<head>NUMBER I. 
    . PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2376078">STEVENSTON</name>. 

(County of Ayr.—Prejbytery of Irvine.— Synod of 
Glafgow and Ayr.) 

By the Reverend Dr James Wodrow.</head> 



<p>Name y Ancient HiJlory &amp;c. 

THE name of this parifh is faid to have been derived 
from a perfon called Stephen, who came from Ire- 
land and fettled here ; or, perhaps, from the church having 
been dedicated to Saint Stephen. It was probably an ap- 
pendage of the abbacy of Kilwinning. The Houfe of Ker- 
rila, the only old caftle in the parifh (which was lately inha- 
bited by the proprietors, the Hamiltons of Grange, but is now 
Vol. VII. A a

Siatiftical Account 



a ruin), belonged, according to tradition, to the abbot. 
After the Reformation, the then Earl of Glencairn, who be- 
came proprietor of the whole parifh, lived in it. The con- 
cave roof of the old hall in that caftle, a very fpacious fquare 
room, was ornamented with the coats of arms of the greateft 
part of the Scottifh nobility. In the year 1678, the parifh 
was very inconfiderable, if we may judge from the proportion of 
afTeflment it paid towards the maintenance of the Highland 
Hoft, and other exaftions, during thofe unhappy times. It 
muft then have confifted of farmers only, who do not make 
a tenth part of the inhabitants at prefent. The two popu- 
lous towns of Saltcoats and Stevenjhn, have rifen almoft within 
the prefent century. There was, indeed, about a quarter of 
a mile eaft from the latter, a group of 14 or idhoufes, 
chiefly inhabited by perfons who manufactured, or played 
on the trump , or Jew's harp, the ruins of which lately re- 
mained ; and one of the coal- pits contiguous to their ancient 
dwellings, is ftill called the Piper-heugh. This parifh lies 
on the northern fhore of the Bay of Ayr ; its form is a kind 
of irregular fquare, two miles and a half in length, and about 
as much in breadth ; but beyond this, the fandy ground 
ftretches two miles farther to the fouth-eaft, and terminates 
on a point of land oppolite to Irvine Harbour. The two 
rivers Garnock and Irvine, meet near this place, and 
their waters immediately enter the Atlantic, The line 
of ftiore between the Harbours of Irvine and Saltcoats 
is about five miles, and thus is nearly double the length of 
the northern boundary. The town of Stevenfton is centri- 
cal, with refpeft to the inhabited part of the parifh. The 
church ftands on an elevated ridge, immediately above the 
town, and commands a very extenfive and delightful profpect 
pf the whole bay of Ayr, narrowed by a long ftretch of the 
mountainous coaft of Carrick towards the S. E. diftant about

five or fix leagues. Correfponding to this, on the weft fide* 
at a feemingly equal diftance, appears the greateft part of the 
romantic Ifland of Arran, with its ftill more lofty and tre- 
mendous mountains, and broken creeks. Between this 
Ifland and Carrick, the fea opens unbounded to the eye j 
and the beautiful regular rock Ailza appears, as if fet down 
exaclly in the middle of the opening, about 40 miles diftant. 

Sea Cw#.— The five miles line of fhore is quite a fandy 
beech, on which the fea deepens in the moft gradual manner 
imaginable. Hence, during a wefterly ftorm, it is formi- 
dable to fuch (hips as have the misfortune to be here em- 
bayed, as they ftrike the ground at a confiderable diftance 
from the fliore, which is covered with a dangerous furf. 
The fandy beech begins at Saltcoats, and fweeps round by 
Irvine, along the whole coaft of Kyle, for more than 26 
miles, to the mouth of the river Boon or Dune beyond Ayr ; 
interrupted only by a fmall peninfula of rocky ground at the 
Trune. The coaft of Carrick, beginning at Doon, is rocky* 
as is likewife the coaft of Cunningham northward from Salt- 
coats towards Greenock. The Harbours of Ayr and Irvine 
within their refpe&amp;ive rivers, the mouth of which is crofted 
by a bar or bank of fand, cannot be entered but at fpring 
tides ; and the harbour of Saltcoats, which is a natural one* 
at an ordinary tide ; and none of the three can at any time 
admit fhips above 220 tons burden. Accordingly, when 
they are checked within this bay by a wefterly ftorm, which 
fometimes continues for feveral days together, it is impoffible 
for them to make the fafe road of Lamlafti in Arran, on the 
weft, and equally fo to clear the rocky fhore of Cunningham* 
and the point of Pencrofs, fix miles N. W. of Saltcoats, in 
order to get fhelter in the Fairlie Road. There is only one 
particular place in this open bay, which will afford theni 

fhelter'

fhelter in fuch a fituation, viz. under the Lady IJIe, a fmall 
uninhabited rocky ifland, about two miles S W. of the 
Irtnie, and near four miles N. W. of Ayr, on which there 
are two beacons or fpires, creeled by the town of Glafgow 
about 17 years ago. If the diftreffed fbip can get to the 
fouth-eaft of this little Ifland, between it and Ayr, and bring 
thefe two fpires to bear in a line with herfelf, {he may drop 
her anchors with fafety, within a cable's length of the fhore, 
in water from 10 to 14 fathoms deep, on very good 
ground *. 

Appearance and Soil of the PariJJj — The parifh naturally di- 
vides itfelf into two diflricts, the upper inclofed farms on 
the north, and the low fandy plain on the fea. The laft 
is narrower, but nearly double the length of the firft. 
The ground of the upper parifh is unequal, many parts 
level, mixed with little hills, and continued ftretches of rifing 
ground, toward the boundaries ; and this track will foon ex- 
hibit a fine appearance, from the rifing belts, and plantations 
of Mr Hamilton's eftate, and his very elegant houfe lately 
built in the middle of it. The prevailing foil here is clay, 
not very ft iff, but eafily fubdued. There are alfo feveral 
fields of kindly gravel and rich loam. 

The lower foijth divifion is a continued plain, the inequa- 
lities made by the fand hills, as they call them, excepted, 
fome of which are above 30 or 40 feet high. The foil here 
is pure fand throughout ; yet the ftratum of clay prevalent 
in the higher ground continues under the fand, and has 
been once bare, and cultivated nearer the fea than at prefent ; 
for a fedlion of the clay, in a regular curved line (the un- 
doubted

were wrecked, Pecember 8th 1789, on the Kyle and Carrick 
coafts. 



doubted veftige of ancient plowed ridges) is frequently laid 
open to the eye, on the fides of the canal and other deep 
drains. 

A fteep ridge of rocky ground, the greateft part of which 
is now covered with foil, runs for two miles nearly in a 
ftraight line from weft to eaft, between thefe two tracks of 
the parifh, and fuddenly raifes the upper plain to a confider- 
able height above the lower. On the weft end of this 
ridge, where it dips into the fea, is the town of Saltcoats, 
built on the rocks. More than a mile eaft, immediately 
under the ridge, is the town of Stevenfton, adorned with 
trees, and two gentlemen's houfes, with their parks at fome 
diftance, one on each fide of it. All the reft of the plain, 
confiderably elevated to the eaft, exhibits a wafte and dreary 
profpedt of fand, which blows in fome places, and is pre- 
vented only by the deep-rooted bent growing through it, 
from being reduced to a dead level. At prefent, the fand- 
hills or mounds are continually finking, and laying open to 
the eye the fpires of Irvine, and other land objects, never 
feen before. In a courfe of time, the inland part of thefe 
lands, raifed by the ftorms from the fea, will cover a little 
more of our cultivated ground ; and the outer part of them, 
undermined by the fpring tides, and blown by the dry N. E. 
winds, will gradually raife the bottom, and narrow the 
bounds of the fea, which has in faft retired in a very fenfible 
manner within the laft 30 years *. 

There 

* There is little ground to doubt, that thefe and the other 
adjoining tracks of land confift of the foil of the upper coun- 
try, carried by land floods down the large rivers of lrvme 
and Garnock into the fea, beaten back agatn inceflantly by 
the tides, and thus reduced to their prefent ftate and torm. 
At every land flood, the fea appears to the eye brown and 



" Stati/lical Account 

There is little fea-weed thrown in upon the fandy fhore, 
but abundance on the neighbouring fhores of Ardroflan and 
Kilbride, where it is chiefly ufed as manure to their barley 
grounds. There are very few white fifli caught in the open 
bay. From the fhores contiguous to Saltcoats, we are fuffi- 

ciently 

muddy for a mile round the mouth of thefe rivers. Everv 
appearance indicates, that, at a very remote period, the fea 
covered the whole tracks, for the upper foil is loofe fea fand! 
wthout a (lone m it_that, at a lefs remote period, perhaps fe- 
vera! centuries ago, the fea covered the lower part of the track 
neareft Saltcoats, wafted the whole rocky ridge above de- 
ferred, and ftretch.ng N. E. through low marfhy grounds, 
went within lefs than a mile of Kilwinning, and thus left the 
ealt part of Stevenfton fand hills more elevated than the reft 
together with part of the parifhes of Kilwinning and Irvine, in the 
form of a circular illand, three miles in diameter, furrounded 
either totally by the fea, or in part by the Garnock, which 
leems to have then held a more wefterly courfe than at prefent. 
Ihe proofs of the infular fituation of that part of the coaft," 
and that it was probably a deer illand, are thefe— The anchors 
of boats dug out ot the lower marfhy grounds— The name of 
the eftate ot Patrick Warner, Efq; the proprietor of a great 
part of the track, Ardeer, (the only Gaelic name in the parifh) 
—The old houfe Hood on a part ot the rocky ridge, which juts 
out beyond the reft like a promontory— Jviq pair of branching 
decrs horns, lately found ; one pair with part of the fcull 
flicking to them, dug out of the ground 30 feet deep ; the 
other at a lefs depth, difcovered by the courfe of Stevenfton 
burn ; both now in the poffeffion of that gentleman— A cave 
under ground, difcovered about two years ago, near the fame 
gentleman's houfe, or a cavity in a folid rock of free ftone, 24 
feet long, 12 wide, and 6 high. The ftone in the bottom of 
this cave, and in the fides, two feet up, is polifhed or worn 
fmooth in fuch a manner, as leaves no doubt that it muft have

eiently fupplied with fhell fifh of all kinds, except oyfters. 
Of thefe there are very few on any part of the weft coaft. 
There is a fmall falmon fifhing at the mouth of the rivers 
Garnock and Irvine, from whence they fometimes come 
along the whole fhore of the parifh, and are caught near 
Saltcoats Harbour. The falmon feldom make their appear- 
ance in thefe rivers till about the beginning of July. They are 
inferior in tafte and quality to thofe caught in the other 
rivers of Ayrfhire. In general, the feafon of the falmon is 
earlier, and their quality better, according as the rivers lie 
farther tp the fouth, that is, according as they become clearer, 
and their channels more rocky, by their approach towards 
the mountainous part of the country. There is a fmall 
frefh water lake covering, perhaps, about 30 acres of ground, 
at the N. E. point of the parifh, where it meets with the 
parifhes of Kilwinning and ArdrofTan. No fifties are caught 
in it, except a few perches and pikes. 

Climate and Difeafes. — In confequence of the dry fituation, 
and the fouth and weft winds which blow into the open bay 
for three fourths of the year, the air is in general falubrious, 
and the climate more mild by feveral degrees, than in the 
higher country ; fnow being feldom feen in the lower part 
of the parifh for 24 hours. The climate is alfo more dry ; 
the loaded clouds often paffing on till they touch the 
hills. Neverthelefs, rheumatifms, coughs, and confu.mp- 
tions are as frequent as in the inland parifhes : Epidemical 
fevers perhaps more frequent. The ravages of the /mall-pox 
are fometimes dreadful, among the children of the families 
who neglect inoculation. The meajles and the chincough are 
feldom, I might fay, almoft never, mortal. The flopping, or 
froop % a difeafe faid to be attached to the fea-coaft, has made

its appearance twice or thrice within thefe 30 years, and cut 
off between 12 and 20 young children at a time. 

Sea-Bathing. — Saltcoats is the principal watering place in 
Ayrfhire. From 300 to 500 people ufually refort there, 
during the Summer months, for fea-bathing, from the inland 
country, efpecially from the towns of Paifley, Glafgow, and 
Hamilton. 

Minerals. — There is a mineral well in the north quarter 
of the pariih, of the fame kind with the chalybeate fpring at 
Moffat, but weaker j and, probably, feveral other fprings 
impregnated with iron, if one may judge from their tafte, 
and the tinge they leave on the clay or fand from whence 
they iffue. A vein of iron ftone, from 10 to 14 inches 
thick, has been lately found between the coal ftrata. The 
upper parifh abounds in different ftrata of ftone, whin, flag, and 
free Jlone, both the fofter and harder kinds, which are worked 
whenever there is occafion for them : And in the fandy 
grounds, near Mr Warner's houfe, there are inexhauftable 
quarries of poft free-ftone, fifty feet thick, of a very white 
and excellent kind, fufceptible of a fine polifh. This is 
carried into the inland country, for tomb-ftones ; and of- 
ten by water, along the coaft, to gentlemen's feats, for 
hearths, flairs, gates, &amp;c. It is alfo exported to London- 
derry and Dublin, and fells there at 1 1. 12 s. per ton of 
ftone, which is 16 feet, i. e. is. per cubical foot.— Beneath 
the rocks on which Saltcoats ftands, and within the fea-mark, 
there is found a kind of black ftone, which has the appear- 
ance of a coarfe marble, but without the calcareous quality 
of marble or limeftone. On the contrary, it ftands any or- 
dinary fire, and on this account is much ufed as cheeks, in 
which they fix their grates. Fitted up in this manner, thefe 

have

have perfe&amp;ly the appearance of Carron grates. In the 
upper part of the parifh, there is plenty of good limeftone. 
Two of the proprietors have draw-kilns, which are kept 
going for a confiderable part of the year, to anfwer the or- 
dinary demand of lime for building, and efpecially for ma- 
nure, which is purchafed by their own tenants, and by the 
farmers of the country weftward along the fhore, where 
there is none of it. Notwithftanding this abundance, a fmall 
quantity of Irifh limeftone is imported at Saltcoats, as ballaft, 
in the coal {hips. The lime made of it is whiter than the 
Scots, and anfwers better for plaifter-work, and for cafting 
of houfes and walls. 

Saltcoats. — 'The principal object worthy of attention iri 
this parifh is the town of Saltcoats, and the coal-mines in its 
neighbourhood, which have furnifhed an article of exporta- 
tion from that town to Ireland for near a century back. 
The town is Angularly fituated, on the limits of the two pa- 
rishes of Stevenfton and Ardroffan, and almoft equally di- 
vided between them. There were leafes of houfes and gar- 
dens granted to a few families as long ago as the year 1565^ 
But it is certain, from unqueftionable traditionary teftimony 
(that of parents to their children now living) that a century 
after that time, or about 130 years ago, there were only 
four houfes in Saltcoats, which now confifts of about 400. 
Yet at a much remoter period, fait mas made there ; which 
appears not only from tradition, but from the remains of 
confiderable heaps of aflies fouth and north of the prefent 
town. It was then made by poor people, in their little pans 
or kettles. They digged up the coal near the furface of the 
ground, at a very fmall expence, and lived in huts on the 
Ihore. Hence, probably, the name of Saltcotes or Cottages*

The improvement of diftri&amp;s, and even of countries and 
kingdoms, feems to depend, not fo much upon a natural and 
regular tendency in the progrefs of ficiety towards improve- 
ment, as upon the happy lpiric of particular men, railed up 
by Providence from time to time, endued with uncommon 
talents themfelves, and capable of roufing the talents, ftiu.u- 
lating the exertions, and directing the induftry of others. 
Of this fort was a Robert Cunningham of Auchinharvie, 
who, by the death of his uncle Sir Robert Cunningham, 
phyfician to Charles II. became proprietor of this whole pa- 
ri fh, during the latter part of the laft. century. Mr Cun- 
ningham, with a very enterpriling genius, and perfevering 
fpirit, made trial, at a great exper.ee, on the different leams 
of coal, bored, and alio put down {hafts or pits at confider- 
able diftances from one another, to afcertain their declivity, 
their thicknefs, their qualities, with the principal troubles or 
obftruclions.to them. Thefe things he afcertained with an 
exa&amp;nefs that furprifed his fucceffors, who are frill in pof- 
ieffion of fome of his papers, and have feldom found him far 
miftaken in his conjectures about this dark lubterraneous 
field. He drove a level mine under ground, through his 
own and part of Lord Eglinton's eftate, for a mile and a 
half,, and thus hid the upper part of feveral of the feams 
dry. After this, he began to turn out a much greater 
quantity of coal than ever had been done before; and to 
open a door for the exportation of it, and thus compleat his 
great and ufeful deiign, he fet about building a Harbour at 
Saltcoats, carrying on this work entirely at his own charges, 
,amidft many difficulties and difcouragements from its ex- 
poled fituation ; the Winter ftorms, for feveral years, demo- 
lifhing part of what he had done during the preceding Sum- 
mer. At laft, he compleated the Harbour, about the year 
1 700 ; and, with fome fmall reparations, it ftands to this 

day,

day, a monument of his public fpirit and enterprife. He 
built falt-pans, with all their appendages, to confume the 
ufelefs part of the coal. By thefe expenfive fchemes, how- 
ever, he hurt his fortune, and was obliged to fell a confider- 
able part of his eftate, referring to himfelf the track of it 
neareft Saltcoats, with a fervitude for working the coal on 
the reft. 

For 60 years after his death, the coal continued to be 
worked in different places of the parifh. A fire or fteam- 
engine was erected near Saltcoats in the 1719, the iecond 
then in Scotland. The fmall cylinder of it was brought 
from London, only 18 inches in diameter, not much larger 
than their preient pumps. It could, therefore, raife little 
water. The work was carried on with a cautious fpirit, and 
moderate fuccels, yielding a maintenance to miners, falters, 
and many others employed in carrying the coals ; the (hip- 
ping of Saltcoats increafing in the mean time gradually, but 
flowly, till about 20 years ago, when a new and very fuccefl- 
ful pufh towards improvement was made. This fhall be ex- 
plained immediately. But in order to render it intelligible, 
it will be neceffary to attempt fome description of the coal- 
field, which the writer of this has been enabled to do, from 
papers put into his hands by the preient Robert Cunning- 
ham, Efq; one of the proprietors, and the fole conductor of 
the work. 

Defcription of the fubterraneous Coal Strata. — Coal has been 
wrought not far from the furface in molt places of the pa- 
rifh j but the proper coal-field now, is the lower fandy divi- 
fion, the furface of which has been delcribed, from Saltcoats 
on the weft point, to the river Garnock on the eaft ; an 
oval piece of ground, above four miles in length, and a mile 

or

or more in breadth. In this field there are eleven ftrata or 
feams of workable coal, which ufually dip (decline downward) 
one fathom in five, towards the fouth, or the fea, but in a 
circular diredion, from the fouth- weft to the fouth-eaft ; 
and they all rife towards the land in the oppofite direction. 
The firft or uppermoft of thefe feams crops out * neareft the 
fea, and the reft follow it towards the land, at regular diftan- 
ces ; all the different feams being perfectly parallel to one 
another. The diftance, or refpettive deepnefs, with the 
thicknefs of the feveral feams, will beft appear from the an- 
nexed Iketch. 

The Iketch exhibits a fmall fe&amp;ion of the eleven feams, as 
they would appear to the eye if they were vifible, with fome- 
what of their proportional diftances. They yield coal of 
different qualities, all good and quick burning, except the 
laft, the raife coal, which is duller than the reft, and chiefly 
ufed in making fait and lime ; but it has alfo been exported. 
The prefent dip-engine pit is cradled on the pavement of 
the firft feam. The figures on the left fide, mark the dif- 
tances of the refpedtive feams from one another in fathoms, 
and confequently, their perpendicular depth, at that place, 
from the furface of the ground. The figures on the right 
hand mark the thicknefs, from the roof to the pavement, 
of the feveral feams, in feet and inches. From thefe things 
it appears, that from the pavement of the firft feam to that 
of the eleventh, is 104 fathoms ; confequently, if the engine- 
pit were removed fo far to the dip as to take hold of firft 
feam, or Bow-bridge coal, at a depth of 20 fathoms, it would 
take hold of the whole 1 1 feams at the depth of 1 24 
fathoms, which is faid to be lefs than the depth from 
^vhich coals are raifed at Newcaftle and Whitehaven ; and

fuch a pit would command * 37 feet of good coal, which is 
faid to be more than they raife from the fame depth at ei- 
ther of thefe places. And along with the coal they could 
raife, with little expence, a vein of iron-ftone, lying 
upon the roof of the feventh fearn of coal. But this is 
an enterprile which muft be left to future generations. At 
prefent, the dip engine-pit, reaches only 54 fathoms, and 
takes in only five of the feams, viz. from the pavement of 
the firft : And though the engine on that pit has a cylinder 
5 feet in diameter, and a 16 inch working barrel, yet they 
were juftly afraid that it would not be able to manage the 
prodigious weight of water ; fo that they have lately erected 
on the rife-pit (40 fathoms deep), a fecond fleam-engine, with 
a 4? feet cylinder, and 3131 inch working barrel, which it 
is to be hoped will do their bufinefs effectually j and they 
have at prefent a field of coal on the level and rife, which 
will probably ferve them fur a generation or two. 

Subterraneous Divifions of the Coal Fields. — 1. This very ex- 
tenfive field of coal, reaching from Saltcoats to Garnock, is 
cut into three parts, by two great galls or dikes that run 
through the whole field, nearly in a line from north to 
fouth. The firft weftern divifion next Saltcoats was 
wrought improperly in the 17 19 5 and the greateft part of 
it remains, very much incommoded with water, open to fu- 
ture adventurers. It is bounded on the eaft by the Capon, 
craig Gaily a great dike of hard whin-ftone, above 20 yards 
thick, at leaft where it appears at the furface, finking per- 
pendicularly into the earth to an unknown depth. This 

dike 

* In the eaftern part of the field, there are two thin feams, 
befides thofe exhibited, lying between the 9th and 10th, one of 
3 feet, and another of 2 feet 4 inches, which would make the 
thicknefs of the whole coal raifed there 43 feet 4 inches. 



Statijlical Account 



dike does not in the leaft difturb the ftrata of coal where it 
cuts them, but has the happy etfeft of keeping off the great 
wafte of water on the weft fide of it, from 

2. The fecond centre divifion of the coal-field, by much 
the largeft which is wrought at prefent. This is bounded 
on the eaft by the Piper-heugh gall, a dyke fmall and thin 
compared with the former, and the metal or fubftance of it 
foft. It is what the miners call a hitch, i. e. it difturbs all 
the ftrata of coal, of ftone, and every thing elfe in its neigh- 
bourhood, fo as to make them ftart fuddenly about ten or 
twelve fathoms out of their former inclined plain : But they 
immediately go on again in a fimilar declivity, at their regu- 
lar or parallel diftances. In this divifion there is faid to' be 
an extent of a field of coal about 2000 yards on the level of 
the dip engine pit, viz. at 54 fathoms, and all clear to the 
rife of this. 

3. The third or eaft divifion reaches from the Piper-heugh- 
ftep to another, called the Milldam-ftep, and gives them an ex- 
tent of level of about 1500 yards. Here the coal, inftead of its 
ufual dip of one fathom in five, dips one in ten. The fecond 
and third feams become alfo fo thin as to be worth nothing. 
And the whole coal, when it approaches towards the ldft 
named Milldam-ftep, becomes very much troubled, and turns 
into what they call humph, a black ufelefs fubftance. In all 
probability it continues in the fame ftate to the eaft, as feve- 
ral unfuccefsful trials have been made in the parifh of Kil- 
winning and on the Muir of Irvine, on the level of the Sie- 
venfton coal, and not a little money funk in thefe experi- 
ments.

?. little further the late improvements in this parifh. — About 
the year 1770, the Auchinharvie eftate, comprehending the 
weftern divifion of the coal-field, the harbour of Saltcoats, 
the Salt-pans, and every thing connected with the colleries, 
came into the pofifeffion of the prefent Robert Reid Cun- 
ningham, a gentleman who inherits a fufficient portion of the 
active and enterprifing fpirit of his great-grandfather, and has 
profecuted his fchemes with judgment, perfeverance, and 
fuccefs. The fervitude already mentioned, page 11. being 
then expired, Mr Cunningham entered into a copartnery for 
a long period with his neighbour Mr Warner, the proprietor 
of the reft of the coal-field. They made trial, by finking 
pits between the 2d and 3d divifions, not difcouraged by the 
prodigious depth of fand, which required three or four hun- 
dred men at the beginning to work night and day without 
intermifiion, in fcooping a circle near a hundred feet in dia- 
meter at the furface, narrowing it gradually, till they reached 
the clay at the depth of 30 or 36 feet, and were thus able to 
fecure themfelves againft the increafing force of. the under 
water. Here they found excellent coal, but loaded with the 
» expence of a considerable land carriage to Saltcoats, through, 
deep fands. Mr Cunningham hefitated for fome time be- 
tween the two fchemes of conftructing a waggon-road, or 
cutting a canal. He fortunately fixed on the laft, which was 
executed at much lefs expence than had been calculated, and 
free of all the formidable dangers that had been predicted, 
the canal was finifhed and navigated September 19. 1772, 
the firft upon which any bufinefs was done in Scotland. It 
is a ditch without any locks, but very wide and deep in fome 
places, from the inequality of the ground ; 2£ miles long, 
befides the long fide branches afterwards cut to the mouth 
of every new pit that was opened ; twelve feet wide at the 
bottom, the fides inclined at an angle of 45 degrees ; the

water four feet deep ; the boats carry for the flapping, or the 
falt-pans, from twelve to fifteen tons ; the land carriage 600 
yards from the weft end of the canal to the harbour of Salt- 
coats. 

In the year 1778, thefe gentlemen made a new and fuccefs- 
ful trial, where nothing had ever been attempted before, in a 
field called the Mi/k, on the banks of the Garnock, at the 
eaftern extremity of Mr Warner's eftate and of the parilh. 
There they erefted a fire-engine on a pit forty fathoms deep, 
and wrought the firft and fourth feams, (fee figure.) They 
continued in the mean time to work on their weftern collierv till 
they were flopped by an unconquerable depth of fand. This 
obftacle they endeavoured to furmount by a very ingenious 
effort. They attempted to drive a very fmall canal under 
ground, from the bottom of the pit along the level and pave- 
ment of the coal, and actually carried this canal more than 
200 yards eaftward ; purpofing, had things anfwered, to 
have driven it on, the whole way to the Mifk 5 to have con- 
nected their two colleries by means of this fubterraneous 
communication, and thus to have faved themfelves the enor- 
mous expence of finking pits from the furface along this 
track. But unfortunately their coal at that place began to 
degenerate, and turn into humph 5 fo that they were forced 
to abandon this jrojecl, and execute another more obvious 
and practicable for the exportation of the Mifk coal. This 
was, to cut two fhort canals above ground, from the Garnock 
to the mouth of their two pits, with flood-gates facing the 
river; and to build lighters of thirty tons burden. Into 
thefe the bafkets full of coals are emptied, or poured, as they 
come up from the mouth of the pit, at a very fmall charge ; 
and, failing down the canals and the river, the lighters dis- 
charge their coals either into empty veffels lying at anchor in 

the 



of StcvenJIon. 



the bay, or, more frequently, into the Irvine fhips, which 
have already taken part of their loading within the bar of 
their own river, and, for want of depth of water, are unable 
to complete it. Thus thefe gentlemen have increafed the 
trade of the port of Irvine, as well as that of Saltcoats. This 
work, however, can only be carried on in moderate weather ; 
but no dangerous accidents have hitherto attended it. 

At thefe two colleries there are upwards of 200 men, ex- 
cluiive of boys, employed, and about 50 horfes : Near 20 of 
the horfes under ground ; the reft in the gins and land car- 
riage. The fecondary employment created by the exporta- 
tion, and by the carriage of an extenftve land laic, cannot be 
ftated.

ing or evaporating the fea-water. Though the pans are five

The yearly duty payable on the above, at 6 s. per boll, is

count being allowed for fea wade, prompt payment, &amp;c. The 
quantity made will increafe from the additional falt-pan. It 
is chiefly difpofed of by an inland fale, reaching to the fkirts 
of Renfrewfhire and Clydefdale, till it meet the Borrowftoun- 
nefs fait from the eaft coaft ; which, for I know not what 
reafon, feems to be made cheaper than on this coaft, and can 
therefore bear the expence of a longer land carriage. A 
cargo of fait is fometimes fhipped from Saltcoats to the coafts 
of Galloway and Nithfdale, but never to Ireland j on the 
contrary, over the whole weft coaft of Scotland, from Mull 
to the Solway Frith, the Irifti fait is fmuggled in fuch quan- 
tities as to be very prejudicial to the fait manufacturers and 
to the revenue. Confidering the high price of coal in Ire-&amp; 
land, it may feem ftrange that we fhould be rivalled and un- 
derfold in an article fo much connected with coal ; but it is 
to be accounted for from thefe circumftances ; that the two 
proceffes of making fait and burning lime are combined in 
Ireland, and carried on with the fame fuel, probably turf 5 
. that their fait is almoft free from any duty ; and, above all, 
they have the liberty of importing rock-falt from the Englifh 
mines without any duty, or with a very trifling one. The 
mineral-falt diflblved in fea-water makes their procefs eafy 
and cheap, an advantage from which the Britifh manufacturer 
is cut off entirely. This grievance deferves the attention of 
thofe who have it in their power td remove it ; and the 
means is very obvious, viz. the laying fuch a confiderable 
but equitable duty on the exportation of the Englifh rock- 
falt as would bring the prices of the Irifh and Britifh fait to 
par : For, though every indulgence ought to be given to the 
fifter kingdom which her fituation requires, it feems rather

Extent of the Coal Country of Scotland — Though the account • 
of the coal has been extended, perhaps, too far, becaufe it is 
the moft diftinguifhing feature in the ancient and prefent 
fate of this parifh, yet I cannot conclude it without taking 
notice, that the Stevenfton mines are the northern limit of 
the coal country on the weft coaft of Scotland ; as the Bar- 
geny mines, near Girvan, are the fouthern limit. North of 
Saltcoats there are no coal flrata * to be found, to the ex- 
tremity of the ifland. South of Girvan, none, till you crofs 
the Solway Frith. There will be two points, correfponding 
to Saltcoats and Girvan, on the eaft coaft : And within thefe 
four points the coal country of Scotland ftretches, nearly 
from the S- W. to the N. £. acrofs the ifland ; in breadth 
between 30 and 40 miles f. 

Ship. 

* I fay flrata. Rome trim of coal, or of a finer fimilar fub- 
fiance, from fix inches to two feet thick, have been found in rhe 
ifland of Mull, at Caftle-Leod, and perhaps other places in the 
Highlands, among vtins of lead, between fiffures of rock^, 
and under what has been (perhaps erroneoufly) taken for 
jointed lava or bafaltea. But thefe coal veins are lb fliort and 
inconiiderable_, and the whole appearance of the metals, as they 
call them (the other fubterraneous ftrata), is fo different from 
the appearance in a coal field, that the veins mud be confidered 
•as lingular phaenome na, which may, indeed, exercife the inge- 
nuityof the naturaiill, but upon which nn folid practical con- 
clufions as to the exilte'iice of coal can be founded.

Ship- Building- — The fpirited and fuccefsful exertions in the 
fea] branch which have been defcribed, the circulation of 
Irifh gold, and the animating example of Mr Cunningham, 
gave I new fpur to the induftry and improvement of the 
parifh. Other circumftances concurred ; fuch as the Ame- 
rican war. The Saltcoats people, finding an increafing de- 
mand for (hips, which they could not build in America, nor 
buy -at that time in Britain but at a high price, were natu- 
rally led to attempt to build them themfelves, their harbour 
being remarkably convenient for launching them. Accor- 
dingly, they began to import fhip timber from South Wales ; 
and in a place where fcarcely a boat had been built before, 
three carpenters yards were let up one after another, which 
have gone on fuccefsfully ever fince. In thefe yards there 
have been' built, from the year 1775 to the 1790,

England 'from Whitehaven to Newcaftle, is probably of a 
greaser breadth than the Scottifh, and feems to run acrofs the 
iiland in a fimilar direction. There is alfo coal in the fouth- 
weft of England, from Somerfetfhire to North Wales ; but it is 
probably inflated, or in patches ; at leaft, this is the cafe with 
two great beds of it, one in Colbrook-vale, at the Iron-bridge, 
in the north of Shropshire, and another in the fouth of StafJ 
fordihire, which have no connection with one another, or with 
the red of the mines. It would be well worth while to trace 
the extent of this valuable mineral throughout the whole liland.

All thefe veffels do not belong to the port of Saltcoats. 
Several of them were built by commiffion for other ports $ 
and fome of the largeft of them were afterwards profitably 
fold by their owners, in England, Ireland, and Spain. The 
three carpenters yards generally employ 60 men. There 
are not fo many at work at prefent, as the demand is lefs 
than formerly. One of the matters is about to remove to 
Belfaft, but will foon be fucceeded by another. 

Other Branches of ManufaBure.— About the fame time a 
rope-yard was eftabliflied, which conftantly employs, at an 
average, 25 men, and works up annually a cargo or more 
of hemp, imported in a large brig from Peterfburgh and 
Riga. The eftablifhing a manufactory for working fail- 
cloth at Saltcoats, has been thought of ; but there is not fuf- 
ficient encouragement as yet for carrying this fcheme into 
execution. Three or four men are employed at the rope- 
yard in making (fewing) fails. Some time after, a confider- 
able brewery was built near Saltcoats, which continues to 
lupply the towns and the country for feveral miles round 
with fmall-beer. A diftillery was fet on foot about five 
years ago, which, while it continued, confumed weekly a 
very great quantity of bear and barley ; but when the duty 
on licenfed ftills was doubled, the proprietors found them- 
selves obliged to give it up. 

Trade and Shipping of Saltcoats. — The exports from Salt- 
coats, befides the coal and fait, are only a few herrings, with

foine bales of the Paifley filk and cotton manufactures, which 
go that way to Ireland. A confiderable quantity of oats 
from the parifh, is carried in boats every Spring to Arran 
and Kintyre for feed. 

There is annually imported a cargo of hemp from Peterf- 
burgh ; 

A cargo of iron from Gottenburgh ; 

Three cargoes of fir timber from Mcmel ; and 

As much fhip timber from Wales as is needed. 

The average of oats, oatmeal, and barley, for three years 
preceding January laft, imported chiefly from Galloway, 
above 2000 bolls annually. From January to May 1791, 
imported about 3000 bolls. The Ayrfhire boll is exactly 
the Englifh quarter. A little linen yarn, and fome trifles 
of provifion from Ireland, are all the other imports recol- 
lected. 

During the Summers 1788, 1789, 1790, three veffels, of 
about 100 tons each, were annually employed in the New- 
' foundland filhery. They were very fuccefsful on the Banks, 
in getting as many fifh as they could carry ; but from fome 
circumftances and accidents, the fales of their cargoes did 
not anfwer expectation, fo that the adventurers have drop- 
ped this bufinefs at prefent. 

For a confiderable time backwards, Saltcoats veffels have 
been employed in the Weft herring fifhery, to the number 
of 12 or 13 annually. This bufinefs is alfo on the decline, 
as there are now only about eight, and thefe have been un- 
fuccefsful for the laft three years. The buffes from Camp- 
belton and Rofa, have done better than the Saltcoats ones. 

The 



Stati/iical Account 



The reafoh of this may be, that the Saltcoats buffes are tod 
large, from 80 to 90 tons, navigated by 18 men. The ex- 
pence of their maintenance for more than three months, and 
that of the nets, fait, &amp;c. exhauft all the profit of their 
fmall cargoes, together with the bounty, now in part with- 
drawn ; whereas the Highland buffes are only from 60 to 
65 tons, navigated by 10 or 11 men. But the principal 
reafon may be, that the Highland failors and rowers are 
more expert at the bufinefs than ours. 

Notwithftanding thefe difcouragements, the number and 
value of the veffels belonging to the port have doubled with- 
in thefe laft twelve years, and doubtlefs the trade increafed in 
fome proportion to this. The number at prefent is 

1 8 veffels below 1 00 tons 

23 from 100 to 200 tons 



Total veffels 41, the regiflered tonnage of which is about 
4300 tons, navigated by above 320 men. About a dozen of 
the largeft of thefe veffels do not frequent their own incom- 
modious port, but find employment, in the carrying trade, in 
the ports of Glafgow, Liverpool, and London *.

* The carrying trade has been greatly hurt by a late Regu- 
lation of the Congrefs, according to which, goods imported in- 
to America in Britiflo bottoms, pay conliderably more duty than 
goods imported in American bottoms. The effect of this might 
be eafily deftroyed by a counter-regulation of the Britilh go- 
vernment, to confine the benefit of their debentures entirely to 
goods exported from this ifland in Britifh bottoms. Without 
fome fuch regulation, this kind of trade, lb important to Bri- 
tain in raifing a nurfery of failors, is in fome danger of being 
transferred to America, as our merchants already employ their 
i^ips, and let our's lie idle.

Of thefe 535 families, there are 506 married and widows,

females). The children under the age of (even are, in Salt- 
coats, very near a fifth part ; in Stevenfton and the country, 
very near a fourth part of the whole inhabitants. All the 
individuals do not actually refide in the parifli ; they have, 
however, no fixed houfe or relidence but there. 

Different Clajfes. — About ten years ago, a Relief Meeting- 
houie was built near Saltcoats. There are about 80 families 
in this parifh of that perfuafion, 14 families of Burghers and 
Antiburghers, and a fingle Cameronian. Three perfons in 
the parifh were born in England, five or fix in Ireland, and 
more than a half of the heads of families born in other dif- 
tri&amp;s of Scotland. There are 20 families of farmers, and 
fix or eight cottagers, or perfons in that ftile, though they 
may hold their fmall pofleffions from a proprietor. The 
number of thofe individuals in the parifh who are and have 
been failors cannot be afceriained, probably between two and 
three hundred.

There are none juft now living in the parifh who have at- 
tained to the age of 90 ; three or four very near it. Two 
died lately beyond that age, and one fome time ago confi- 
derably beyond 100, viz. a Highlander, who had been at the 
battle of Killiekrankie. 

Horfes, &amp;c.-— The number of horfes in the parifh is 135 ; 
a good breed of milk cows, between the Englifh and the 
country kind } no fheep, except the few reared for the gen- 
tlemen's tables. There are at prefent three, generally four 
thaifes, none for hire as yet, except during the fea-bathing, 
and between 70 and 80 carts, taking in the whole parifh. 
The canal has greatly diminifhed their number. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifh is 1206I. Scotch. 
The real land rent (valuing the ground in the proprietors 
hands at a very moderate rent) may be about 1 1 70 1. Sterling. 
The rent of the houfes in the two towns, from the increafing 
demand for them, is higher than in moft places of the king- 
dom. The beft of the houfes, pofTeffed by the owners them- 
felves, pay no rent ; but, according to a calculation, which 
snay be depended on, were the whole 169 houfes in Saltcoats

let at the prefent high rate, they would give 800 1. Thofe 
in Stevenfton (excluding the manfe, and a gentleman's houfc 
contiguous to it) 460 1. j in all 1260I. annually. 

Acres. -r-There are feven heritors or land proprietors. They 
all refide in the parifh except the Earl of Eglinton, whofe 
property in it is but fmall. Of the fix refiding heritors, 
three draw about five-fixths of the rent. The arable or cuIt 
tivated ground in the parifh is now all inclofed ; about 400 
acres of it poflefled by the proprietors ; 20 farms, and about 
100 acres in fmall inclofures contiguous to the towns. Thefe 
may comprehend altogether near 1500 acres. About two 
thirds of this inclofed ground is in pafture or hay. The un- 
inclofed and uncultivated fandy ground has never been pro- 
perly meafured. It is vifibly larger in extent than the for- 
mer, and may be fomewhere between 1600 and 1800 acres. 
This extenfive track, however valuable from the coal in its 
bowels, yields nothing from the furface but a fcanty provifion 
during the fummer to about 50 cows ; befides a rabbit-warren 
in the weft quarter of it, out of which they kill annually neap 
300 dozen. The furs and the flefh are in value about 10 s. 
the dozen. 

Agriculture. — The ground in the inclofures contiguous to 
the town is generally let from 30 s. to 2 1. per acre. The 
average rent of the farms is juft now about 13 s. an acre. 
This will rife confiderably at the expiration of the long and 
cheap leafes of four of the largeft farms. After that event, 
there will fcarcely be an acre under a guinea, the ufual rate 
of the new tacks or leafes at prefent. The farms are not 
large. At the end of the prefent tacks they will be ftill 
fmaller, the proprietors finding it their intereft to fubdivide 
th,em. By the late tacks, the farmers are bound to plow

three years, and reft fix. But, if they choofe to manure art 
wclofure every third year with a fpecified quantity of dung, 
they may continue to plow it as long as they pleafe. Of 
their own accord they lay down all the ground they reft with 
grafs-feeds, chiefly rye-grafs, the feed of which they favc 
themfelves, raifing tolerable good crops of it on every kind 
of ground. The clovers, efpecially the red, does not fuit their 
particular kind of clay ; not that it is too ftrong, but there is 
fomething in the foil adverfe to it, which no manure nor cul- 
tivation can conquer. On the loams, the gravelly, and even 
the pure fandy foil, there are crops of graffes raifed abundantly 
rich and luxurious. The farmers pay their rents chiefly from 
the dairy. The turnip hufbandry is never attempted, for a 
reafon eafily gueffed at. 

Oats is the principal grain which they fow. It covers, 
perhaps, three fourths of their plowed ground. On the reft 
they have bear, or barley, and beans, fown at the ufual times. 
For ten years paft, the farmers and proprietors have begun 
to fow a little wheat, under the difadvantage of being obliged 
to carry it 14 and 18 miles to a market. Tjiis is in part re- 
moved, by wheat mills eredled nearer them. In confequen.ce 
of the very fuperior profit of this grain on our dry grounds, 
the wheat culture is increasing every year. It is feldom or 
never fown. here after a thorough Summer fallow, but after 
a potatoe fallow, the rows of the potatoes four feet diftant, 
the fpaces between them plowed four or five times, from the 
beginning of June to the beginning or middle of Auguft, 
when the rows become luxuriant, and begin to unite. This, 
befides the preparatory plowings and drefiing of the ground 
in the Spring. They ufe, for fallowing and planting, the 
potatoes, a fmall plough of the Scotch form, drawn by a An- 
gle horfe. Another pra&amp;ice they have very lately learned, 

which

which deferves attention and imitation. They break up the 
oldeft, the richeft, and dryeft of their leys with a fingle 
tilth, and immediately fow wheat upon it. They endeavour 
to plough deep, and to lay the ridges turned up by the 
plough as clofe as poffible, to prevent the growth of the un- 
der grafs during the Winter, which, however, feldom di- 
fturbs the crop. The ground is generally dreffed with lime 
or dung, about a month or fo before ; but if the ley be old 
and rich, they referve the manure for the fubfequent crops. 
A crop of oats, in a wet feafon, would lodge on fuch ground : 
The wheat runs little hazard. This ley- wheat is fown in 
the beginning of September ; that on the potatoe fallow in 
the end of October, fometimes in the middle and towards 
the end of November. There is never any feverity of Win- 
ter here to hurt it *. 

Manufactures. 

* The following fteep is generally ufed before fowing, and 
it effectually prevents the fmutt in wheat. Diffolve, in a quan- 
tity of water fufficient to cover the feed, as much common fait 
as will bring the pickle to fuch a ftrength that an egg will 
fwim on it. Pour in the wheat very flowly and gradually, 
ftirring it in the mean time ftrongly and incelfantly, and care- 
fully flamming off all the light grain that rifes to the furface. 
Let the wheat, thus purified, lie under the pickle about thirty- 
fix hours ; then take it out of the hogfhead in fmall quantities, 
fpreading it in very thin layers on the floor (before a fire, if 
convenient), and lifting on every layer as much quicklime as 
will dry or cruft the drenched wheat, in fuch a manner that 
every grain can be eafily feparated and fown with the hand. 
Sow it immediately, if the weather will permit ; if not, it will 
fuffer nothing by lying for a few days in that Hate. 

A refpe&amp;able Englifh agricultural writer has lately denied 
the efficacy of fait, or any other fteep, to prevent fmutt in 
wheat. Without conjecturing on different foils, and feed, and 
modes of preparation, I ihall only fay, that after more than 20 
years trial of this fteep, I never faw any fmutt in the very fmall 
quantity of wheat I raife annually. On the other hand, I ne- 
ver examined a field where it was neglecled without finding 
fome ; a rare ear or too, perhaps, the firft y ^r, but abundance

A vail quantity of potatoes is raifed in this parifii, not only 
by the farmers, but every family in the towns have a patch of 
them, which they plant and drefs themfelves, in the neighbour- 
ing mclomres, if they can procure ground, if not, they go to a 
considerable diftance. This not only makes a principal article 
ot tamiJy provifion, but is ufed here for feeding fwine, horfes, 
and efpecially milk cows. 

The price of many articles of provifion is lower, and that of 
labour higher here, than in many other diftridts of Scotland. 
The firft is the confequence of plenty, joined with our diftance 
from the great markets of Glafgow, Paifley, and Greenock. 
The laft is the confequence of the increafing demand for labour. 
Eggs are from 3d. to 4d. per dozen; beef, and all butcher- 
meat, from 4 d. to 6 d. per lib. ; pork fomewhat dearer ; butter 
from 7d. to iod. the lib. ; the Ayrfhire pound is 24 ounces, 
or 1 § pounds Englifh ; honey at 6 s. the Scotch pint, i. e. 5 
pounds Englifh; falmon, except at an early feafon, 3 d. the 
Englifh pound. The price of moft of thefe articles, and alfo 
of cheefe and coals, has rifen, within thefe laft 20 years, about 
a third part. The price of eggs, butter, and alfo of horfes, 
has doubled ; and that of falmon, in confequence of an eafier 
carriage from Ayr to Edinburgh, tripled. 

The wages of the coal-hewers, or miners, are from 2 s. 6d. 
to 3 s. a day ; but they never work above five days in the 
week. The coal is now fo well afcertained, that it is lately let 
by the piece at one of the collieries, much to the advantage both 
of mafter and workmen. Long before the late act of Parlia- 
ment, the coal-hewers and their children in this diftridt, were 
fet free from their ancient fervitude, by a voluntary deed of 
their mafter; and this much more effectually than that act of 
Parliament did. They are here quite on the fame footing with 
all other workmen. The wages of the carpenters are 2 s. a

where it was chiefly ftamped for handkerchiefs ; but for a 
number of years paft the demand for it has gradually de- 
clined, perhaps from their making it too flight. Still a lit. 
tie coarfe linen is made 1xr the market, befides the demand 
for the parifh wear ; and they are improving the texture of 
it. But above 45 of the weavers are now employed by the 
Paifley manufacturers in the filk, befides a few in the cotton 
branches. A number of young girls are employed alfo by 
them and the Gl/fgow manufacturers, in flowering and tam- 
bour work. Within thefe few weeks, the Jeanies have been 
introduced, and will 'give employment to boys and girls in 
fpinning cotton. There is a bleachfield in Stevenfton town, 
which has fufficient bufinefs from the parifh and neighbour- 
hood, bleaching between 8000 and 9000 yards yearly. The 
nets for the herring bufles are weaved by the Saltcoats 
children. 

Stipend, School, and Poor. — The flipend, being moftly

the queries, becaufe the families of thefe labouring fervauts live 
almolt as well as any other common labourers. The earnings 
of their wives and children, muft ever depend upon their turn 
for induftry. Seldom, very feldom, is it in the power of an in- 
duftrious mother of three or four young children, to earn, by 
fpinning even fine linen yarn, more than is. 8d. a week. The 
poor families of Highlanders in Saltcoats, can live upon much

other children ; and a fmall fum annually for medicines to 
the lick.. The whole annual dilburfements amount to 64 I. 
8 s. at an average for 10 years back. The fund which chiefly 
fupplies this expence, is the collections at the church, amount- 
ing, at the fame average, to 50 1. 10 s. \ which, with the 
other fmaller funds belonging to the poor, give the fum of 
70 1. annually. There is a charitable fociety in the parifh, 
and two boxes belonging to the coal-hewers and the failors, 
which give a little affiftance in this humane work, independent 
of the feffion ; not to mention the private charity of the better 
fort, which, in a parilh circumftanced like this, is very con- 
fiderable and commendable, becaufe the higheft of them are

•well acquainted with the fituation of the poor, and intereft 
themfelves in it. 

From tacks of three of the beft farms in the parifh, writ- 
ten more than 80 years ago, and ftill extant, it appears, that 
the rent of thefe farms at that time, and probably of all the 
reft, was about a fixth part of their prefent rent. 

Morals, Manners, and Turn of the People. — The writer of 
this, during a refidence of more than 30 years, has had the 
fatisfaction of obferving a gradual, yet a very ftriking change 
on the face of the parifh, by canals, and other efforts, 
which have increafed the mining, trade, and fhipping ; by 
good roads, convenient bridges, well built houfes, both in 
the towns and country ; the whole upper parifh, almoft open, 
now properly inclofed ; a better mode of culture eafily in- 
troduced, and willingly followed by the cbildren of the old 
farmers. Thefe things have improved the fituation of the in- 
habitants, with refpec~t to moftof the conveniences and comforts 
of life ; and they have been projected and executed by many 
different forts ot perfons concerned in them, not only with a ju- 
dicious and proper regard to their own intereft, but with a liberal 
and laudable public fpirit. He moft fincerely wifhes that it 
was in his power to give the fame favourable teftimony of 
their improvement in a higher fcale — he means that of their 
minds and morals. But the conftant influx of unknown per- 
fons from dillant parifhes, lefs under the reftraints either of 
religion or character than the native inhabitants, is an unfa- 
vourable circumftance in the way cf example. The manner 
of life both of the Tailors and miners, furnifhes fome temp- 
tation to drunkennefs and intemperance, and leads on to 
habits of thefe vices. The high wages of the miners, earned 
by difagreeable and fevere labour, are too often immediately 

diffipated ; 



3^ Stati/lical Account 



diffipated ; little laid up for the maintenance of their fami- 
lies, whofe education is too much neglected. This, how- 
ever, is with the exception of feveral individuals. The temp- 
tation is much increaled by the cheapnefs of fpirituous li- 
quors, and the number of inns, and houfes for felling fpirits. 
Of thefe there are no lefs than 18 in Stevenfton town, and 
16 in Saltcoats, 34 in the whole parifh ; an evil which ought 
to be fomehow checked by a better police ; for it certainly 
has very melancholy confequences on the health, the induf- 
try, and the morals of the people. It foon renders them 
weak and crazy, turbulent and riotous, idle and worthlefs. 
It opens a door to pilfering, and all other vices connected 
with idlenefs. 

Happily the diforder here is as yet confined to the very 
loweft clafs. The generality of the people are fully as fober, 
and perhaps more intelligent, as well as more induftrious, than 
they were 30 years ago ; and having employment enough, 
they are in a reafonable degree eafy and happy in their pre r 
fent fituation ; while feveral of them are very ingenious in 
difcovering, and attentive in improving the means in their 
power to better it. The luxury and profligacy of the great 
towns have not yet reached them. The fortunes of the bet- 
ter fort are fmall, indeed, but gradually increafing by fruga- 
lity. The fituation of the greateft part of the parifhioners, 
with their habits of education, naturally create a prejudice in 
favour of the fea-faring life, and cherifh, in young minds, 
the fpirit of adventure. Numbers of them never return 
home, but marry, and fettle in various places of the world. 
By far the greateft part of thofe who do return, behave de- 
cently in their families, and appear lefs infecled with the 
yices of foreign countries than the generality of that clafs of 
men. During the America^ war, it was computed that 

about 



of Stevenfion*

about 200 Saltcoats failors (including the whole town) were 
on board the navy ; one in the rank of a captain, three lieu- 
tenants, and above a dozen inferior officers in the fleet. 

Hints for the Improvement of the Pari/h.-^The railing coals 
from a depth of more than 50 fathoms, by double horfe 
gins, is very expenfive. There is a fmall neat fleam engine 
in the parifh of Gorbals, a mile fouth of Glafgow, which, 
under the management of a Angle man, performs the gin- 
work in half the time, and with much greater effect than 
any horfe gin ; railing large bafkets full of coals alternately, 
from a depth of about 60 fathoms. At the linking of a new 
dip-pit, this improvement may be worthy of the attention 
pf our people, and, probably, many other improvements 
which the inventive genius of the prefent age may produce. 
Perhaps an able mechanic might, with little expence, com- 
bine the Gorbals machinery, which is very Ample, with 
the machinery of every engine-pit, i. e. make a part of the 
water raifed by the pumps to raife the coal at the fame time. 
If this be impracticable, the hint will be forgiven from one 
who pretends to no ikill in mechanics. 

It is very practicable to bring a part of the uninclofed 1700 
acres of fandy ground in this parifh into good culture and 
pafture ; it would, indeed, require a great fum to be expend- 
ed in incloAng, levelling, and manuring, but would in the end 
refund the expence many fold. Three or four of the farms, 
and part of the parks of the two proprietors, are already on the 
flcirts of that ground. The foil, though pure land, is very kind- 
ly, more At for the grafs-hufbandry than the clay foil ; more At 
for potatoes than any foil whatfoever. The loofeft of the fand 
makes excellent garden ground. It will bear good wheat, which 
has been raifed on an acre of it in the glebe, and feveral acres 

of

of it in the inclofures near Saltcoats. As to the levelling.-* 
.Thefe Saltcoats inclofures were feued out, 15 years ago, in a 
ftate perfeaiy ufelefs to the eye, full of large hills or mounds 
of fand. Thefe the feuers annihilated in a few weeks, with- 
out almoft either labour or expence. After any heavy rain, 
•they led the fcattered water, which drilled over from the 
higher grounds into a fingle very fmall ffream. This they 
directed againft the middle of one of the fand hills, which 
was gradually and foon undermined, of whatever height or 
bulk it might be. Thus reducing them one after another, 
they brought the whole inclofure to a dead level. The fand 
hills, indeed, at a greater diftance from the higher grounds, 
.cannot be fo eafily fubjec"ted to this operation ; but there are 
acres and hundreds of acres which would need little levelling 
Or fmoothing *. 

Enlargement of the Harbour of Saltcoats. — The laft thing de- 

ferving 

* As there is fcarcely any fea-weed on the fbore, the great 
difficulty would be to find manure fiifficient to raife one fingle 
good grafs crop, to bind the furface by the net-work of its 
roots, after which the ground would be gained. Lime, tho' 
beneficial, does not anfwer fo well as dung, efpecially cow- 
dung. A village of manufacturers, enticed by cheap fuel, and 
a very low rent or feu-duty, each family fet down by itfelf, (as 
all manufacturers ought to be), with fmall inclofures of three 
or four acres behind the houfes, would foon, by means of their 
cows and potatoes, make their fmall inclofures as valuable as 
the Saltcoats ones. The red, and by much the greatefl part of 
the track, could not be brought into culture without much 
expence. But, as it is already inclofed in part, by the canal 
.and its various branches, it might be planted with trees of dif- 
ferent kinds bed fuited to the foil, efpecially the pine or fir 
kinds ; and, though the fea air and florms would undoubtedly 
deftroy a fmall part of the young trees moft expofed to this dan- 
ger, yet the reft would foon rife under the lhelter of one an* 
other, favoured by the great inequality of that part of the 
ground, and, in proper time, turn this dreary, bare, barren 
■•wafte, into a comfortable, extenfive, and valuable plantation, 



of Steven/Ion. 3 9 

ferving attention is the enlargement of Saltcoats Harbour, 
Though the firfl: building of it, 90 years ago, was a great ef- 
fort for a private gentlemen, it does not now fuit the im- 
proved ftate of the trade and (hipping. It confifts of a quay, 
all of ftone, about 24 feet thick, large hewn ftones on each 
fide, and an outer wall to fhelter the fhips, of a confiderable 
height. This building runs along a natural ridge of rocks, 
m a ftraight line from N. E. to S. W. five hundred feet. 
At the S. W. end, it turns at a right angle, and runs through 
the fea, more than a hundred and fixty feet, forming a piei* 
which points nearly north. Within this rectangular fpace is 
the prefent harbour, capable of containing 24 veffels, having 
a proper clay bottom, dry at low water, and from 10 to 12 
feet deep at fpring tides, admitting veffels of 200 tons. But, 
as only two large, and three fmaller veffels can be loaded at 
a time, and the large ones rauft be hauled down to the very 
end or point of the pier, before they can complete their load- 
ing, and muft fail too, at a fpring-tide, in order to make 
room for the loading of the reft. This delay is a very great 
inconvenience in the coal trade. 

To remove which, it is propofed to carry forward the firft 
defcribed line of quay two hundred and fifty feet beyond the 
pier, onwards to the S. W. along the fame line of natural 
rocks, which ftill continues. Then, to turn it through the 
fea, northward and eaftward with a fingle obtufe angle, tUi 
it comes fo near the point of the pier as to leave room for 
fhips to enter. This would form an outer harbour capable of 
containing 14 veffels more, in water from 15 to 16 feet, and 
much more commodious than the prefent one. For the 
prefent pier (ftripped of its outer wall) would ftand as a 
tongue or middle quay between them, from which veffels 
could take in their loading on eath fide ; the largefl always 

lying

lying iri the outer harbour, which would admit fliips of 30O 
tons. Every perfon may conceive in a moment of what ad- 
vantage this would be to the trade of Saltcoats, where the 
veflels now frequently lie for feveral weeks before they can 
receive their loading ; while, in the mean time, perhaps the 
price of coals is high at Dublin, and an Englifh fleet of col- 
liers arrives there before them, and brings down the price 
three or four {hillings a ton. The public benefit alfo would 
be very confiderable to the Glafgow fhips, and to all other 
fliips checked within the bay, as they fometimes are, by wes- 
terly ftorms. They would then have a better place of fliel- 
ter to run into than under the Lady llle, defcribed page 3. 
and at times, too, when perhaps, from the courfe of the 
winds, that Ifle was inacceflible to them* 

Of late, a more than ufual attention and ardour has been 
raifed about this object, partly owing to the ftatiftical inqui- 
ries now going forward. Within this fortnight, (26th May 
1791), an accurate furvey has been taken, and plans and efti. 
mates drawn out, which ftate the expence of this very im* 
portant improvement at only about 2000 1. Small as this 
fam may appear, it will require the affiftance of public fpirit- 
ed perfons. It is efpecially worthy of the attention of the 
Earl of Eglinton, who has fuch a particular conneftion 
with this rifing town. The line which divides the two 
parifhes runs acrofs the prefent harbour from eaft to weft. 
On the north or Ardroflan fide, which is his Lord/hip's pro- 
perty, there is a fheltered place for fliips, nearly double the 
extent of both the inner and outer harbours which front it. 
The bottom of this fpace is rocky ; but, if it were deepened by 
•raifing the rock, which is free-ftone, (and would be very ufe-* 
ful in building the new harbour), and if a" quay were carried 
out from the north fide, till it fhould come not far from the 

point 



of StevenJIon,

point of the prefent pier, and the whole fquare bafon com- 
pleted, (which perhaps would not coft above another ioool.), 
it would make one of the moft convenient and fpacious har- 
bours in the kingdom.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q640073">ARDROSSAN</name>. 

{County of Ayr.—Prefiytery of Irvine.— Synod of 
Glafgow and Ayr, J 

By the Reverend Mr JohnDuncan.</head> 



<p>Name t Situation, and Extent. 

r | ^HIS parifh takes its name from a fmall promontory 
which terminates in a ridge of romantic rocks run- 
ping into the fea, about a mile and a half from the town of 
Saltcoats. It probably obtained the well known prefix Ard 
from its confpicuous fituation, having the fea on one fide, 
and flat fields on the other ; or from the rank of the ancient 
proprietors, who, are faid to have had extenfive pofTefiions in 
this country. It is fituated about 18 ftatute miles from the 
town of Ayr, and fix miles from Irvine. The different ex- 
tenfions and divifions of the parifh are very irregular. The 
medium length, from north to fouth, is fix miles or thereby \ 
its greateft breadth about five, and its leaft does not exceed 
three miles. 

Surface and Soil.— The furface of the parifh is a mixture of 
hilly and flat country, in molt places fit for the plough, in 
pthers only for pafture. Though more than nine-tenths of 
it be arable, and capable of high improvement, yet the far 
greater part even of the beft lands remains in pafture. Be- 
twixt 



of Ardrojfati, 



43 



twixt the Caftlc of Ardroflan and the limits of the parifli, 
on the eaft, is a beautiful inclined plain, moftly of very good 
ground. Towards the weft, the hills are nearer 1 the fea. 
About two miles from the coaft, a ridge of fmall hills bound 
the profpecl:. The tops of fome of them are planted with 
large clumps of foreft trees, which have a very pleafing ef- 
fect. Beyond thefe the furface is irregular j in fome places 
coarfe and marfliy ; in others dry, fruitful, and pleafant. 
The foil is various. Betwixt the point of Ardroflan and 
town of Saltcoats, grafs and clover grow fpontaneoufly with- 
in a very little of flood-mark. The fand is foon fucceeded 
by a thin layer of earth, on a pebbley bottom. A little far- 
ther from the fliore, it is moftly a loamy earth, with a mix- 
ture of fand. On the north-eaft and north fides of the pa- 
rim, the foil is, in general, a ftrong deep clay, capable of 
bearing great crops when well drained and manured, but apt 
to produce only bent and other coarfe grafs where it is ne- 
glected. 

Agriculture. — Though the foil of this parifli be, in generalj 
capable of very high improvement ; yet, in many places, the 
ftate of agriculture, compared with that of other pariflies in 
the fame country, is much behind. Its prefent ftate, how- 
ever, compared with that in the remembrance of fome old 
men, fliows that the farmers have not been altogether idle or 
ignorant. Forty, even thirty years ago, the land was almoft 
in a ftate of nature, very low rented, and the parifli almoft 
deftitute of inclofures. At that time farmers had very few 
inducements to ingenuity and activity. Towns and villages 
in the neighbourhood were very fmall, compared to what 
they are at prefent ; confequently, the confumpt of the pro- 
duce much lefs, and the price of vivres not above the half, in 
many inftances not above the third of what they now bring. 

Low 



44 



Statijlical Account 



Low as thefe were, Ireland was able often to underfell them 
in the common necefiaries of life, meal, butter, cheefe, but- 
cher meat, bifcuit, Sec. 

Roads, feV. — Befides the want of inclofures, the want of 
roads may be juftly reckoned a great bar to improvements of 
every kind. It was not till the year 1779 that a turnpike- 
road was in the whole parifh. At prefent, all thefe put to- 
gether do not much exceed five miles. The other roads to 
church and market, to lime and coal, in the winter, and even 
in a wet fummer, are almoft impaflable. Befides, fo long as 
the prefent fyftem of farming was unknown or difcredited in 
this country, labour in the fields was confidered as mere 
drudgery, fcarcely fit to procure a decent fubfiftence. The 
fons of farmers, rather than follow the profeffion of their 
forefathers, chooie to be bred to the fea and the fuccefs of 
a few fortunate adventurers was fufficient to draw numbers to 
that line. Their parents were not averfe to the choice. Hear- 
ing of rife of the rents in their neighbourhood, dreading the 
fame rife in their own farms, and infenfible to the advantages 
arifing from new improvements, they looked upon bankruptcy 
and beggary as the certain cenfequences of continuing farm- 
ers. Such are the probable caufes why the ftate of agricul- 
ture is fo much behind in this pnriih. But, of late years, 
matters in this refpecl have taken a very favourable turn, 
owing, in a great meafure, to the laudable example of the 
refiding heritors, gentlemen, and clergy in the neighbour- 
hood, and a few fpirited individuals who have made farming 
their ftudy. Not only the inclofures about the town of Salt- 
coats, but fome farms in the parifh, are making rapid pro- 
grefs to a high ftate of improvement. In providing the 
means,. Nature has indeed been very liberal. The fhore 
abounds with fea-weed, a manure of the beft kind for the 

adjacent

adjacent foil, particularly for rairtng barley crops. The ln- 
t ior part of the parifl. has, In many places great abundance 
of toe and coal, which is wrought at a moderate rate WUh. 
fa* advantages, and a fpirit of ingenu.ty and apphcat.on, 
whic h is daily gaining ground, there is every reafon to hope 
for a vaft increafe-to the farmer, the proprietor, and the 
public. 

Patron, Herilors.-Thc Earl of Eglintoune is patron and 
proprietor of far the greateft part of the parifh. The valu- 
ation of the whole amounts to 2970 1. of which his Lord- 
ftup's property makes 2014L °s. The remaining part of 
the parilh belongs to four reading, and three non-refiding 
heritors. 

' EcMical State—The living has never been augmented 
fince 1650, but, on the contrary, has fuffered feveral dila- 
pidations. It is, communibus amis, about 75 1. Sterhng, ex- 
clufive of manfe and glebe. The parifh-church is a neat, 
plain edifice, well finifhed, and large. It is fituated in the 
veft end of the town of Saltcoats. The prefent manfe is in 
a ruinous ftate, but a plan is agreed on for a new one, to be 
built foon. The glebe and garden contain five acres one 
rood of good ground. 

School.— The annual falary paid to the fchoolmafter by the 
parifh is 61. 3 s. 4 d. Sterling. His other emoluments and 
fees are very low. Forty-two years ago, however, the pre- 
fent incumbent accepted this office, after having received a 
college education, capable of teaching the languages, and the 
practical parts of geometry, trigonometry, and navigation, in 
the laft of which he has been very fuccefsful. It is much to 
be resetted, that parifh fchools muft, in all probability, fooa 

be

be occupied by men of no literature, and that an advantage 
winch Scotland has long had over all other nations fhould 
be allowed to dwindle away for want of fupport. The parifh 
fchoolWc of Ardroffan is almoft in ruins, but about to be 
rebuilt. It was the gift of the late Earl of Eglintoune, with 
a garden to the mafter. 

Population.-. The country part of the parifh, efpecially to- 
wards the coaft, is thinly inhabited. Farms of confiderable 
extent are only ufed for pafture, and feme of them rented by 
perfons who refide at a diftance. The farm-houfes which 
are inhabited amount to 31, (befides 2 or 3 that are unin- 
habited). Thefe are occupied by 2 1 9 perfons, old and young, 
viz. 31 fathers, heads of families, 29 wives and widows, 23 
fons above the age of 16 years, 24 below that age, 27 daugh- 
ters above the age of 16 years, 26 below that age, 31 male, 
and 28 female fervants of different ages. There are befides, 
in the country, part of the parifh, a few fubtenants, herds, 
and cottagers, whofe families amount to 105 perfons, viz 
20 fathers, heads of families, 23 wives and widows, 4 fons 
above the age of 16 years, 20 below that age, 13 daughters 
above 16 years, 22 below that age, befides 3 female fervants. 
Total amount of the country part of the parifh, 324 perfons, 
old and young. 

Saltcoats.— On that part of the town of Saltcoats which 
ftands in the parifh of Ardroffan, there are 230 houfes, the 
annual rent of which is computed at 740 1. Thefe are occu- 
pied by 216 f athers, heads of families, 254 wives and widows, 
150 fons above the age of 16 years, 153 below that age, 176 
daughters above the age of 16 years, 187 below that age, 24 
journeymen and apprentices, who only occafionally refide in 
the parifh, and 34 female fervants, making in whole 1194 

perfons.

perfons. This, added to the number in the country, makes 
the whole amount to 1 5 1 8 perfons. The average number 
of births for 10 years is annually 37, deaths 38, marriages 
14. Thofe who are baptifed by diflenting minifters, and 
thofe who die at fea, are not included. The number of dif- 
fenters is uncertain. 

Manners. — The inhabitants of Saltcoats are, in general, 
fober and induftrious. Perhaps no fea-port town in Scotland 
is more fo. In the whole parifh of ArdrofTan there are only 
five public-houfes, moft of which are indifferently frequented, 
and none licenfed to deal in foreign liquors. Drunken riots 
happen very rarely even among the lower orders of the 
people. In fobriety and regularity, the better fort are truly 
exemplary. 

Trade. — The ArdrofTan fide of the town of Saltcoats is 
chiefly inhabited by failors, fhip-carpenters, and weavers *. 
Of the laft, befides thofe employed in working the ftaples of 
the country, near 90 are employed in the filk and cotton 
branches by the Glafgow and Paifley manufacturers. Thefe 
have not increafed fo much as was at firft expected. They 
have all the inconveniencies of diftance from the chief feats 
of manufacture : They are always the firft who feel the dis- 
advantages arifing from a ftagnation of trade, and the laft 
who are benefited by its revival. A few fhoes are made here 
for exportation. 

Antiquities, — Some hill tops in the parifh are evidently ar- 
tificial, 

* For a more particular account of the trade of Saltcoats, 
fee the ftatiftical account of Stevenfton by the Reverend Dr 
James Wodrow. In that parifh the harbpur, and nearly one 
half of the town are fituated.

tificial, and very probably contain the remains of the chiefs 
Who fell in battle at the time the Danes and Norwegians * af- 

flifted 

* Two hills are remarkable for a tradition in the country 
concerning them. The firft is fituaced on the northern extre- 
mity of the parifh, called Knockgeorgan. It is acceffible only 
on one fide ; and, from its central fituation, there is a molt 
extenfive profpecT: of the inland country, the Frith of Clyde, 
and Weftern Ifles. The veftiges of an ancient camp are very 
eafily traced on this hill, particularly the ramparts and gate- 
ways, and in the middle an artificial mound, from whence in 
times of diftrefs, or when a Danilh fleet was feen advancing to- 
wards the fhore, fignals of alarm were made. The other is on 
the eallern extremity of the fame ridge of hills, called Round- 
hill, the top of which is entirely a piece of art, 28 yards in 
length, and 18 yards broad, and feems to have been construc- 
ted for a fimilar purpofe with the former. From thefe two hills, 
by fmoke in the day, and by flame in the night, fignals were 
communicated from hill to hill till the whole inland country 
was alarmed. That hill tops, in convenient fituations, were 
ufed for this purpofe, is evident often from their names. For 
example, Lovjdo t wn, fituated on the extremity of Ayrlhire to the 
call, fignifies the hill of flame. Betwixt Round-hill and Lowdown 
the country is almoit a plain upwards of 20 miles. Not far 
from Round-hill is a fmall farm, called Tower-lodge, where it 
is laid the centinel who had this charge conftantly refided-. It 
was originally a gift of the Crown, and to this day pays no cefs, 
teind, or any other public burden. 

The Cattle of Ardroflan is of unknown antiquity, and feems, 
from what is ftill Handing, to have been originally a huge 
building. Its walls were entire when Cromwell vifited this part 
of the country, and fixed his head quarters at the county town. 
That ufurper had rendered himfelf very unpopular by occupy- 
ing the church of Ayr as an armoury ; and, to conciliate the 
minds of the people to his meafures, he beautified the town, by 
building the fort and parapet, which are yet Handing. For 
this purpofe, he threw down the walls of the Caftle of Ardrof- 
fan, and carried the ftones in boats over fea, fo little were quar- 
ries known in thefe days, in which the county of Ayr al- 
moft every where abounds ! The Earl of Eglintoune at that 
time refided in the fmall ifland of Cumbray, and raull have feen 
with much pain a place of fuch llrength and beauty belonging 
to him laid in ruins.. After the rclloration, the fort of Ayr, 

and 



of Ardroffan,

flitted this coaft with their ravages. From one of thefe 
mounds, on the top of a fmall hill near Boydfton, bones were 
lately dug up. 

Price of Labour and Ptovifions. — The wages given to do- 
meftic fervants vary, according to their age, ftrength, and 
abilities. A good plowman receives 4 1. Sterling ; a boy ca- 
pable of driving a plough or cart, a guinea ; female fervants 
from 15 s. to 35 s. for half a year's fervice. A journeyman; 
mafon receives 22 d. per day in Summer, 20 d. in Winter 5 
a wright 1 s. 6 d. ; a {hip's carpenter 2 s. ; common labourers 
from i6d. to is. a day. There being no market day, or 
market place, the fupply and price of provifions are variable* 
The prices are pretty much regulated by the next market 
town (Irvine), though in general higher. Great quantities 
of meal and oats are fometimes imported from the coaft 
of Galloway. This renders thefe commodities fometimes 
cheaper here than in inland towns ; but in years of fcarcity, 
fuch importation ceafes, they muft be dearer. In the Win- 
ter feafon, rabbits are fold without the Ikin at 7 d. a pair. 
It is Angular, that in a country fo populous and clofe by the 
fea, none think of making fifhing a bufinefs, efpecially as fifh 
are to be found in great quantities on the coaft of Arran, 
and could never fail of finding a ready market. The inha- 
bitants of Ayr long laboured under the fame inconveniency, 
till a colony of fifhermen from the North fettled in that 
place. In the courfe of a few years thefe have enriched 
tbemfelves, and continue to fupply the town and neighbour- 
hood of Ayr at a moderate rate. Saltcoats is a ftill more 
likely place for a colony of the fame profeffion to fucceed ;

for befides that the country adjacent is equally, perhaps more 
populous, It is much nearer large towns and villages ; Irvine, 
Stewartown, Kilbarchan, Lochwinnoch, Johnfton, Paifiey, 
&amp;c. 

Poor.—* The number of poor have greatly increafed of late 
years. They have as yet no other fource of fupply than vo- 
luntary contributions ; and confequently, the ftock formerly 
made up of the overplus of this is rapidly upon the decline. 
In the year 1741, rive ftated pensioners received 5 s. per 
month, divided among them; in 1751, thirteen received 
14s. 2d.; in 1761, twelve received 14s. 1 1 d. •, in 1771, 
eleven received 14 s. 6 6. ; in 1781, eleven received 15 s. 
6d.; in 1 701* the monthly penfions exceed in whole 50 s. 
Befides the ftated penfioners, fome poor receive occafionally 
fmall fums to aid them in paying houfe rents. Poor chil- 
dren are taught to read. 

Improvements To render the trade of Saltcoats regular, 

permanent, and productive •, to maintain good order 'and 
comfbft to the inhabitants •, and to invite ftrangers to fettle 
in a place fo healthful and pleafant, various improvements, 
of no very coftlv nature, are abfolurdy neceffary, and with- 
out which there is much reafon to fear its decline. The 
prefent Harbour is by far too fmall for the number of fhips, 
and might at no great ex pence be made one of the beft of 
its fize in Britain *. There is no magiftracy, or any efta- 
blifhed police in Saltcoats, though the number of inhabitants 
exceeds 2200 perfons ; and of confequence, the virtuous and 
inoffenfive part of the community muft frequently pocket 
injuries, becaufe their poverty puts it out of their power to 
leek redrefs in a diftant and expenfive court. Vagrants and

fturdy beggars may pilfer and opprefs almoft with impunity : 
in no place are they more clamorous and impertinent. 
Laft winter, a murder was committed on the body of a poor 
young woman, who refided in town. The horrid deed was 
perpetrated in the fields, at no great diftance. After the 
difcovery, the fuppofed murderer with the greateft compo- 
iure returned to town, where he lodged all night, and ef- 
fected his efcape next day, before the juftices could poffibly 
begin a precognition ; and every attempt fincc that time to 
apprehend him has proved fruitlefs. 

"Were the town of Saltcoats and environs erected into a 
corporation, as Port-Glafgow lately was, befides the fuppref- 
fion of fmall crimes, it would no longer give fhelter to great 
ones. Men of wealth, virtue, and ability would be happy to , 
exert themfelves for the common good ; the inhabitants in 
general would be taught to refpect, and find themfelves 
happy, under lawful authority j and in proportion as the 
town increafes in riches and population, it would alfo increafe 
in virtue and refpettability.

<p>Name and Appearance. 
INNIGAFF, or MonnigafF, is faid to mean, in Gaelic, 
XV J. aftonymuir, which is abundantly defcriptive of the 
greater part of this parifh. The country exhibits a very 
rugged appearance, being compofed of rocky and heath co- 
vered hills, fome of them of great height. 

Length of the parifh 24 miles. 
Breadth, about 12 ditto. 
Population in 1 748, 828 

in 1755, 1209 

in 1792, 1420 

Increafe in 44 years 592 
This increafe is chiefly owing to the mines. 

Average number of Chriflenings 40 yearly. 
Valued rent - - L. 7586: 10 Scots. 

Real rent among nine heritors L. 5925 Sterling. 



Climate, Difeafes, &amp;c — The climate in all the lower grounds 
}s mild. The parifh is feldom vifited with any epidemical 

difeafe,

difeafc. The fmall-pox, indeed, is often attended with fatal 
effe&amp;s in this neighbourhood, owing to the negleft of inocu- 
lation. Some unhappy fcruples, flowing from a miftaken 
religious principle, prevent the people from doing that duty 
to their children which Providence has pointed out by this im- 
portant difcovery. Inftances of longevity are frequent in this 
parifh. One man, ftill alive, is faid to be 1 18 years of age. 
This, however, refts chiefly on his own teftimony, as no 
authentic record of his birth has ever been produced. His 
name is William Marfhall ; he has the remains of an athletic 
frame. In his youth he was a foldier ; he fays he ferved 
under King William in Ireland. If this was the cafe, he 
certainly does not exaggerate his age ; but of this part of his 
hiftory there is no better evidence than that of his age itfelf. 
That his age, however, is very great, there is this prefump- 
tive proof, that none of the oldeft people in the country have 
ever contradicted his aflertion. 

Rivers. — The only river of any confequence is the Cree, 
which forms the boundary between this parifh and Penning- ■ 
hame, and empties itfelf into Wigton Bay. This river is for 
fome miles fmall, and runs through a bleak and dreary coun- 
try, but is foon confiderably increafed by feveral large ftreams, 
which terminate in it. As foon as it has received this addi- 
tion of waters, its appearance is changed in every refpedT:. 
Inftead of holding its courfe through rocks and muirs, it 
glides flowly and beautifully, for fome miles, through a rich 
valley, abruptly bounded on each fide by banks covered with 
wood. The river in this place is broad, and the whole forms 
a landfcape truly romantic and delightful. 

But beauty is not the moft valuable charatteriftic of the 
Cree j it mingles the ufeful with the agreeable. It is navi-

gable for feveral miles up, which has been the fource of a 'l 
the agricultural improvements which have been made in this 
part of the country. It likewife produces excellent fifc of 
different kinds y but the beft and moft abundant fpecies is 
the falmon. Thefc are found in confiderable quantities. 
Even in the beginning of the feafon, when falmon are efteem- 
cd a rarity, they are fold at two-pence per pound; and, du- 
ring the whole feafon, the price never varies. 

The fmelt or fparling, a very rare fifl,, is alfo found in the 
Cree. It is found only in one other river in Scotland, viz 
the Forth at Stirling. It makes its appearance only during 
a few days in March, at which time they are caught in great 
quantities. They both tafte and fmell ftrongly of ruftes • 
and this flavour, although uncommon, is to moft people 
agreeable. * 

Mountains and Mines.— \t has been already obferved, 
that this parifh contains feveral mountains, feme of which 
are higher than any in the fouth of Scotland. Cairn f- 
muir is 1 737 feet above the level of the fea ; and there 
are one or two more which are 20 or 30 feet higher • 
but, arifing from a more elevated bafe, their altitude is not 
fo ftriking. There are many others of a lefs coniiderable 
height — Thefe mountains, though apparently barren, are 
not unprodu&amp;ive. Large quantities of lead have been dug 
from their bowels. The military road from London to 
Dublin pafTes through this parilh for feveral miles. It was 
in making this road, in the year 1763, that a piece of lead- 
ore was accidentally difcovered by a foldier, who was at 
work. This important difcovery was firft made in the pro- 
perty of Mr Heron of Heron. It produced, at one time, 

about 



of Minnigaff. 55 

about 400 ton of ore per annum to Mr Heron, and thofe who 
were in company with him. At prefent, it yields them only 
about 30. It was found that the veins, leaving Mr Heron's 
lands, "went into thofe of Mr Dunbar of Machermore and 
there it is at prefent fuccefsfully wrought. Some years it 
produces from four to five hundred tons of ore. The ore, 
when fmelted, yields, for every three tons, two of lead. It 
brings at market 18 1, per ton when fmelted, and 81. in ore. 
It has been affayed, but will not bear the expence of extrac- 
ting the filver. It is not carried above a mile by land till 
they put it on board fmall ycfels ; and then they generally 
carry it to Chefter, to which place they can run, with a fair 
wind, in 18 or 20 hours. 

flfoods.—But lead is not the only production of our hills. 
Some cf them, efpecially thofe in the vicinity of the Cree, 
are covered with ufeful wood. There is no land in the pa- 
rifh more productive than that which is employed in this 
manner. The greater part of this belongs to the Earl of 
Galloway, who lately fold the cutting of his woods for 6000 
guineas, although the trees were then only from 25 to 30 
years old. The wood is moftly charred, except a very fmall 
quantity which is ufed in the neighbourhood for domeftic 
purpoies. Befides Lord Galloway's, there is a good deal of 
other wood in the parhh ; but its value has not been fo well 
afcertained. In all thefe woods, the moft predominant fpc- 
cies of trees are the oak and the afli. 

Sheep, Black Cattle, Horfes, Wo.— Sheep are certainly the 
ftaple commodity of this parifh. It is believed that their 
number is not lefs than thirty ihoufand. Although, from the 
fhynefs of the farmers to give an exact account of their (lock, 
the information on this fubject cannot be perfectly accurate, 

yet 



^ Stati/lkal Account 

yet it is certain that this ftatement is not extravagant. But 
although fheep are evidently an object of fo much importance' 
to the farmer, yet little regard has been hitherto paid to the 
improvement of the breed. Indeed, no experiment has ever 
been made for this purpofe. They have been contented with 
the breed which they found upon the grounds, which is cer- 
tainly far from being good. They are of a fmall fpecies, with 
black face and legs, and covered with wool of a very inferior 
quality. They are generally fold at three years old, at which 
age they are, at an average, worth 12I. per fcore. They 
then weigh, if flaughtered, 12 pounds per quarter. The 
wool fells for 9 s. a ftone; and it commonly requires feven or 
e.ght fleeces to the ftone. The fheep are, I believe, univer- 
fally laid, which, although prejudicial to the quality of wool, 
is deemed a necefTary precaution againft the inclemency of 
winter. 

Befidcs fheep, there are a confiderable quantity of black 
cattle bred in the parifh. Thefe have all the advantages 
common to Galloway cattle, which are well known to be 
remarkably handfome. They are fhort legged, deep in the 
rib, broad over the loins, and, in general, without horns. 
They weigh remarkably well to their apparent bulk. The 
bullocks and heifers bred in this parifh are fold at three and 
four years old, when they are fent to the Englifh markets, 
where they bring an excellent price. 

There are few horfes bred for fale. In the upper part of 
the parifh, there are ftill fome remains of the true Galloway 
breed, which, although fmall, are remarkable for figure, fpi- 
rit, and durability. They are the fame with the Cornifh, 
the Welfh, and Hebridian ponies, and are the ancient Britifh 
breed. In the lower parts of the parifh, where horfes are 



more 



vf Minnigaff. 



57 



more wanted for the purpofes of agriculture, they generally 
ufe good middle fized draught horfes. 

There are alfo bred in the parifh fome goats, which are 
fuppofed to anfwer better than fheep on the exceffively rug- 
ged grounds which are frequently to be met with. Their 
number is not very great. They are worth 7 1. or 8 1. per 
fcore. 

Rent, Soil, Crops. — The rent of land varies aftonifhingly 
in different parts of the parifh. In fome places it is let not 
by the acre, but by the mile, one farm containing feveral in 
extent each way. In the fouthern part of the parifh, arable 
land brings from 20 s. to 30 s. per acre. The foil is fuch as 
might be expected from the appearance of the country. Bar- 
rennefs is certainly its mod ftriking characteristic. There is* 
however, a fmall ftripe of land lying along the Cree, which 
is abundantly fertile. The foil of this is light and fhallow* 
but kindly, and, in wet feafons, produces excellent crops. 
The part of this tract which lies neareft Wigton Bay is of a 
different quality, being a deep clay, and in fome places cover- 
ed with mofs. This is not unfertile. The crops raifed are 
oats, barley, rye, wheat, potatoes, and turnip. What number 
of acres are refpectively occupied by each of thefe cannot eaflly 
be determined. By far the greateft number is employed in rai- 
ling oats ; and, next to them, in barley or bear. Wheat and 
turnips are not cultivated to any extent, and have been tried 
rather as experiments, than as forming a part of the general 
plan of hufbandry. Thefe experiments have been fuccefsful. 
The whole grain produced in the parifh does no more than 
fupply the inhabitants. 



Ecclefiajlicul Side of the ParifJj The inhabitants of Gal- 

Vol. VII. H loway"

loway have" hitherto enjoyed, in a very great degree, the 
valuable bleffing of peace and unanimity in their religious 
fcmimcnts. Difltnfion of any kind has been lefs known than 
in almoft any other part of Scotland. There are few Sece- 
ders in this parifh from the eftablifhed Church. There are, 
however, two or three families of Antiburghers and M'Mil- 
lanites. One of the clergymen of the latter fe£r has his refi- 
dence in the parilh, although the number of his adherents rs 
very Fmair. He preaches occafionally in different parts of 
Galloway, and at home only by turns. The amount of the 
ftipend is 72 1. 4s. Sterling. The glebe confifts of 20 acres 
of hnd, 10 of which are arable. The value of the living, 
excluiive of the houfes and garden, may be about 84 1. per 
tkiiUm. The number of poor perfons upon the parifh-roll is 
at prefent 25. Thefe receive about 30 1, per annum, which is 
diftributed to them quarterly. This fum arif'es almoft en- 
tirely from the collections made on the Sabbath, a very fmall 
part of it only being the intereft of fome money left for their 
behoof. From this account of the matter, it appears that 
the poor are but very indifferently provided for. The heri- 
tors have never been afTefled, although this is a meafure 
which it would certainly be prudent and humane to adopt. 

Pr'wcs of Labour and Provfons. — The prices of labour are 
various. In hulbandry, during fpring, fummer, and harveft, 
the labourer receives 1 s. per day at ordinary works. For 
cutting peats, 1 s. 4d. \ for cutting hay, 1 s. 6 d. A woman 
at Weeding, &amp;c. 6d. But, at reaping, both men and women 
receive t s. In winter, a man gets 10 d. The labourer who 
is hired by the year, and has a family, is generally paid by 
what is called a benefit. This benefit confifts of a houfe, 
garden, 50 ftone of oat-meal, 2 or 3 pounds in money, his 
fuel led home, liberty to plant 3 or 4 bufhels of potatoes.

When he eats in his matter's houfe, this is all that he re- 
ceives ; but, if he eats in his own, he is allowed to keep a 
cow, and has fome addition made to his money or meal. 
Thefe benefits are worth from 1*1. to 16 1. yearly* Upon 
this, when they are fober, which is moftly the cafe, and their 
wives induftrious, they are enabled to bring up healthy and 
vigorous families, and to give them all the education which 
their fituation in life requires. I do not know one inftance 
cf indigence in the parifh which has not proceeded from mif- 
conduft, ficknefs, or old age. The happy circumftances of the 
people, however, are certainly much owing to the potatoes 
which they are allowed to plant. A great part of their fufte- 
nance is derived from this fource. The hufband generally takes 
care to have them well dunged, and his wife and children 
employ their leifure hours in keeping them clean 5 fo that 
the cottagers potatoes generally look the belt of any in the 
geld.— A farm fervant living in the houfe gets 8 1. j a maid 
fervant 3 i. per annum. 

Language, Manners, csV.— The language at prefent fpo- 
ken in this parifh is that which is common to all the low 
lands of Scotland. But, although it is a dialeft of the Eng- 
lifh which is now fpoken, there is no. doubt that Gaelic was 
formerly the language of this country, and of all the weft 
coaft of Britain, but a few ages ago. Buchanan fays, that 
this was the language of Galloway even in his time. The 
names of places in this parifh confirm the truth of the re- 
mark. 

The people of this parifh are, in general, fober and in- 
duftrious. They have been even able, in a great meafure, to 
withftand the pernicious influence of Britifh fpirits, which, 
to the misfortune of this country, are too commonly in ufe. 
The lower clafles poffefs a degree of information which is 

unulual 



Stat j^ical Account 



unufual among peafants. While engaged in tending therr 
lheep they have long intervals of leifure. Many of them fill 
up thefe with reading and reflection. Hence they are always 
better informed than the mechanics, or even the labourers 
who are engaged in agriculture. 

Many of the farmers are decent and intelligent men. They 
are moflly wealthy, and live in a very comfortable ftile. 
Some of them pay a great deal of rent. One, in particular, 
pays 500 1. Sterling per annum, and has a ftock of near 6000 
lheep. 

Antiquities.— There were formerly feveral tumuli on the 
banks of the Cree. In the year 1 754, fome of thefe were 
opened, and arms found in them, particularly three pieces of 
armour, all of which feem to have been offenfive. One of 
them was formed very much like a halbert. The fecond 
was fhaped on one fide like a hatchet ; but, fubjoined to the 
back part of this hatchet, there was an inftrument refembling 
a pavJer's hammer. The third was like a fpade, but much 
fmaller in fize. Each of thefe had a proper aperture for re- 
ceiving a handle.' When they were firft difcovered, they 
were fo much covered with ruft, with which they feemed to 
be much corroded, that it was impoffible to diftinguifli of 
what metal they were made ; hut they were at laft found to 
be of brafs. They lay for many years in a farm-houfe in the 
parifh ; but it is not now known what is become of them. 
Near the place where thefe were found, fome veftiges of an 
i retrenchment are ftill to be difcovered ; and formerly, at no 
great diftance from this, fome large ftones were placed, in- 
clofing a circular piece of ground. Thefe circumftances tend 
ftrongly to confirm the truth of an account which Buchanan, 
in his Hiftory of Scotland, gives of a battle which was fought 
near the Cree, by the Scots on one fide, and the Romans 
and Picts on the other.

Mifcellaneous Observations.— It has been already obferved, 
that the great road from London to Dublin pafFes through 
this parifh for feveral miles. The advantages of this are too 
obvious to need any remarks. We have alfo feveral other 
roads of great utility. One dire&amp;ly to Edinburgh interfecls 
this parifh for 1 2 miles. Another, which is now making 
to Ayr, alfo paffes through it for feveral miles. This road is 
the effect of the patriotifm and public fpirit of the gentlemen 
of Galloway and of Ayrfhire, as the whole expence is to be 
defrayed by their fubfcriptions. The utility of the objecr. 
will well reward them for whatever it may coft. There was 
formerly no carriage road to Ayr without going round almoll 
40 miles. The great advantage of having a communication 
opened with fo rich a country as Ayrfhire will foon be ex- 
perienced. 

This parilh produces neither lime nor coals. Lime, how- 
ever, is got from England. It cofts, at the fhore, 13 d. per 
Carlifle bufhel. The farmers generally lay on 50 bufhels to 
the acre, but it is by far too little. Shells, which are found 
on the neighbouring fhores, are alfo fuccefsfully ufed as a 
manure. They are brought in fmall veflels for fome miles 
up the Cree ; and, when landed, the beft kind coft is. 4 d. 
per ton. 25 ton are commonly given to the acre. The fame 
error is committed here as in the lime. 

The coals, as well as the lime, are brought from England. 
They might be procured on very reafonable terms, were it 
not for the duty they pay as on exportation, though they are 
only carried acrofs a frith, from the Englifh to the Scottifh 
border. This duty renders them very high priced, and re- 
prefTes the fpirit of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, 
in every part of Galloway.

TOWN OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q211870">PAISLEY.</name> 

(County of Renfrew.— Prejbytery of Paifley.— Synod cf 
Glafgow and Ayr. J 

By the Reverend Br John Snodgrass.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, £frV. 

THE town of Pauley, one of the moft confiderable ma- 
nufacturing towns in Scotland, lies in the fhire cf 
Renfrew, and about fix miles and a half weft from Glafijow. 
Its fituation upon the banks of the river Cart is equally plea- 
fant and commodious. It was erected into a burgh in 
barony by James IV. in the year 1488 *, at that tlrhe 
probably deriving all its importance from the rich mona. 
ftery which had been eftabhfhed there for feveral ages; 
for George Shaw, who was then abbot of that mona- 
ftery, obtained this privilege from the King. Even in Mr 
Crawford's time, who wrote the hiftory of the (hire or 
Renfrew near the beginning of this century, it feems to have 
been but an inconfiderable place ; for he defcribes it as con- 
lifting only of one principal ftreet, about half a mile in length, 
with feveral lanes belonging to it ; whereas now the town, 
with its fuburbs, occupies fuch an extent of ground, that

ftrangers are apt to confider it as, next to Edinburgh and 
GlafiiOW, the largeft and moil populous town in Scotland. 
Its' buildings of late years have been greatly improved ; its 
fleets are well paved •, and the different parts of the town 
and fuburbs, where the river intervenes, are connefted with 
ane another by three bridges at convenient diftances. 

Trade and ManufaBures.—^z trade and manufaftures of 
Paifley, which have always chiefly been in the weaving 
brand*, are the main articles which render it of importance 
in a hiftory of this nature. Thele may be traced from very 
fmall beginnings ; but their progrefs in fome periods has 
been rapid and aftoniming. Not long after the Union, when 
a free trade was opened with England, the fpirit of manufac- 
ture began to (how itlelf there ; and the fabrics which were 
produced were made upon fuch juft and oeccnomical princi- 
ples, and with fo much tafte and judgment, that they found 
a ready market not only at home, but likewife in the neigh- 
bouring kingdom. But the trade of Paifley, in that period^ 
owed its chief encouragement to a fet of men who were of 
oreat benefit to this country, though they are now difcoun- 
tcnanced, and laid under fevere reftri&amp;ions by government - 3 
1 mean, the pedlars or travelling merchants in England, 
ttmw of whom having frequented Paifley as their ftaple, 
and having gained a little money by their trade, came to 
fettjfc in that town, and bought up large quantities of its 
manufactures, which they vended among their friends and 
correfpondcnts in England. Afterwards the merchants in 
Glafgow found their account in purchafing thefe goods, and 
fending them both to the London market and to foreign 
parts. Such was the Mate of the trade and manufactures of 
Taifley from foon after the Union till about the year 1760. 
The different articles of which they confifted, during that 

period,, 



54 Stati/lkal Account 

period, were, at firft, coarfc checkered linen cloth, and ben. 
gals ; afterwards checkered linen handkerchiefs, fome of them 
fine, and beautifully variegated, by the manner in which the 
different colours were difpofed, according to the tafte and in- 
vention of the manufaaurers. Thefe were fucceeded by fa- 
brics of a lighter and more fanciful kind, confift'ing not only 
of plain lawns, but likewife thofe that were ftriped or check- 
ered with cotton, and others that were ornamented with a 
great variety of figures ; fome of which laft articles ftill con- 
tinue to be manufaaured there. Towards the end of the 
above mentioned period, the making of linen gauze was a 
confiderable branch of trade in Paifiey ; and, before the mid- 
dle of it, a new fpecies of manufaaure of great importance 
was begun by the inhabitants of this place, which they have 
continued to profecute with peculiar advantage ; I mean, the 
making of white fewing thread, known to the merchants by 
the name of ounce thread, as diftinguifhed from the different 
kinds of coloured and white thread which have been manu- 
faaured chiefly af Aberdeen and Dundee. This valuable 
branch of trade may be faid to have been imported into this 
country by a gentlewoman in that neighbourhood * who, 
about the year 1725, found means to procure from Hol- 
land the machinery which is neceffary for carrying it on, and 
fet the firft example of it in her own family. Such a fpirife 
of enterprife, of ingenuity, and of fober induftry, marks a 
charaaer of high diftinaion in the ftatiftical account of any 
country. The manufaauring genius of the people of Paifley 
well knew how to profit by lb worthy an example. That 
bufinefs was loon introduced there, where it has had its prin- 
cipal feat ever fince, and is now carried on to a very consi- 
derable extent. — About the year 1760, the making of filk 

gauze

of Paifley. 



gauze was firfi: attempted at Paifley, in imitation of that of 
Spittalfiekls in London. The fuccefs was beyond the mod 
fanguine expectations of thofe who engaged in it. The in- 
ventive fpirit, and the patient application of the workmen ; 
the cheapnefs of labour at that time, and the ifcill and tafte 
of the matters, gave it every advantage for being naturalifed. 
there. The confequence was, that nice and curious fabrics 
were devifed, and iuch a vaft variety of elegant and richly 
ornamented gauze was iflued from that place, as outdid eve- 
ry thing of the kind that had formerly appeared. Spittal- 
fields was obliged to relinquish the manufacture. Companies 
came down from London to carry it on at Paifley, where it 
profpered and increafed, it is believed, beyond any manufac- 
ture which any town in Scotland could boaft of. Indeed, it 
not only became the great diftinguifhing manufacture of that 
town, but it filled the country round, to the diftance of 20 
miles ; and the gentlemen engaged in it had not only ware- 
houfes in London and Dublin, but they had correfpondents 
upon the continent, and fhops for vending their commodities 
even in Paris itfelf. It is true, that the change of fafhion, 
upon which this trade entirely depends, has of late had an 
unfavourable afpect towards it : But there is reafon to hope, 
that it will fmile upon it again ; and, in the mean time, fome 
of the principal houfes in that place, while they are pufhing 
their former branch as far as they can, have entered into the 
muflin manufacture with their accuftomed ardour; but, I 
muft add, confidering that this is a branch which has as yet 
no fixed principles, with a judgment and prudence by which 
men of bufmefs are ever dillinguiflied from ralh and unwary 
adventurers. 

It appears, from the beft calculation that could be made, 
that, in the year 1784, the manufactures of Paifley, in lilk 
gauze, lawn and linen gauze, and white fewing thread, a- 

VoL - VI1 - I mounted

Statiftical Account 



mounted to the value of 579,1851. 16s. 6d. and that no 
fewer than 26,484 perfons were employed in carrying them 
on. It is difficult to give an exact account of the fiate of its 
manufactures at prefent. The filk branch has evidently de- 
clined, but the muflin has fo far come in its room, and the 
thread manufacture is confiderably increafed. There is, 
however, reafon to conclude, that though it is daily advan- 
cing, it has not yet recovered its former greatnefs. 

Befides thefe principal manufactures, there are fome others 
carried on there of too much importance to be overlooked. 
Tor inftance, confiderable tan-works, four in number, two 
foap and candle works, a manufacture of ribbons, and another 
of inkle or tape. 

Thefe valuable manufactures have had a mod beneficial 
influence over all the neighbouring country. By the increafe 
of population and wealth which they have occafioned, the 
farmer can difpofe of every article of his produce to the 
greateft advantage. This ftimulates his induftry, agriculture 
flourifhes apace, and the value of land is amafingly increafed. 
The fpirit of manufacture is the fecret fpring which puts all 
in motion ; and the weaver upon his loom, while he provides 
a comfortable fubfiftence for himfelf and his family, may be 
confidered as miniftering to the eafe and to the elegance even 
of the gentleman who lives upon his country eftate.

Parijhes, Churches, The town of Paifley continued 

a part of the original or Abbey parilh of Paifley till the yeaf 
1738, when the Magiftrates and Council having purchafed 
the right of patronage from the then Earl of Dundonald, a 
new church was built, and the town was ere&amp;ed into a fepa- 
rate parifh. In 1756 another church was built, upon a very- 
extended plan, to accommodate its multiplied inhabitants, in 
which, though it is one of the largeft in Scotland, yet the 
moft diftant of the congregation can hear a tolerably good 
fpeaker with eafe and diftin&amp;nefs ; and, as it ftands upon the 
higheft part of the town, it was afterwards ornamented with 
a lofty and well-proportioned fpire. In 1781, the number 
of the inhabitants ftill rapidly increafing, another church was 
built not quite fo large as the former, but very handfomely 
and elegantly finiftied ; and, in the following year, the town 
was divided, and eretted into three feparate parilhes, viz. 
the Low Church, the High Church, and the Middle Church 
parifhes. The three parifhes are an area of about a mile and 
a half fquare, cut out of the old original parifli, by which 
they are bounded ; and the ftipend of each minifter, which 
has of late been augmented, is 1301. without manfe or glebe. 

There are two large duTenting congregations in the town, 
thofe of the Antiburgher perfuafion and the Relief. The 
firft of thefe has exifted there for upwards of 30 years ; the 
other is of a late date ; and they are both fupplied with mi- 

nifters 



68 Statiftical Account 

nifters who feem to have no further aim than that of difchar- 

8'ng the duties of their office in a quiet and confcientious 

manner. There is likewiie a fmall congregation of Camero- 
nians. 

Poor. — A manufacturing town muft always have a great 
proportion of poor belonging to it. When trade is briik, 
great numbers of tradesfolk, and working people of all de- 
fections will naturally flock to it by reafon of the encou- 
ragement which they expert to meet with ; and it is con- 
trary to the intereft of its manufacturers to be very fcrupu- 
lous in admitting them. Many of thefe, when trade becomes 
dull, or when ficknefs and debility overtake them, will ne- 
celTarily be reduced to circumftances of penury and want. 
They muft then fall a burden upon the public; and it is a 
matter of vaft importance, that, while they receive an ade- 
quate fubfiftenee, induftry be not difcouraged, and that they 
be maintained in a manner not only the leaft expenfive to 
the community, but likewife the leaft fenfibiy felt. 

The plan of fupporting the poor by the weekly collections 
at the church-doors, under the management of the minifter 
and elders of every pariih, has produced fuch falutary effedts, 
that it certainly dderves the higheft commendation. No fet 
of men are better acquainted with the fttuation and charac- 
ters of the poor than they. They therefore can judge ex- 
actly both what fuppiies they may need, and how they may 
be given them with molt advantage. Jt is much to be re- 
gretted, that, while this mode of maintaining the poor, in 
many parts of Scotland, is difcontinued, recourfe is had to a" 
Icheme of fupporting them by .a difcretionary tax upon the 
inhabitants, under the management of what are called over- 
feers. The progrefs of this fcheme is not a little alarming, 
as there is too much reafon to fear that it will be productive 

of

of very bad effects. It puts charity entirely off its natural 
principle. It is calculated to multiply the poor, and to in- 
creaie their demands, by holding out to their view a fettled 
maintenance which they can call their own. It diverts them 
of fcnfibility, by teaching them to claim it as their right, 
when they would be afhamed to appear in the charader of 
beggars. Thus it is unfavourable to induftry ; and it will 
bring at length an intolerable burden upon the country. It 
is well known what evils are afcribed to the poor-tax in 
England. But Dr Windeborn brings a new charge againft 
it, by afferting, that, though there are in no country fuch 
large contributions raifed for the fupport of the poor as in 
England, yet there is no where fo great a number of them j 
and their condition, in comparifon with the poor of other countries^ 
appears truly the mof miferable. If a fimilar mode of providing 
for the poor mould prevail in this country, there is little fe- 
curity againft the fame evils attending it which have been fo 
long complained of in the neighbouring kingdom. 

Paifley proceeds upon the old plan, of maintaining the 
poor as far as it is practicable in a populous town, and exhi- 
bits a proof of the excellency of that method. Though the 
town is divided, as has been already obferved, into three dif- 
tinct parifhes, yet, in refpect of the maintenance of the poor, 
they are confidered as one. Their funds are thrown into 
one common (lock ; and the minifters and elders of the fe- 
veral parilhes meet together from time to time to confider 
the neceffities of the poor, and to give them fuitable relief. 
The number of poor whom they have either occafionally re- 
lieved, or entirely fupported, for the laft two years, amounts 
to 240 each year, befides 1 3 children each year whom they 
put out to nurfing, and 25 whom they fent to fchool. The 
collections at the church-doors were, at an average, 393 1. 
12 s. 1 1 d. each year, befides about 108 1. arifing from pro- 
clamations 



yo 



Siatiflical Account 



clamations of banns, mortified money, &amp;c. So that the 
whole yearly fum by which 240 perfons were enabled to 
keephoufe, 13 children were nurfed, making, the fecond 
year, a burden of 26, and 25 educated, was only 501 1. 
12 s. d. 

It is believed, that no money is laid out with greater at- 
tention than this, or can go farther in promoting the true 
purpofes of charity. The people who receive it ar« much 
better pleafed than even to be more comfortably provided for 
out of their own houfes. This is a fpur to indufiry in thofe 
who are able to make themfelves any help, and the money is 
raifed in a way that can never be felt, three fourths of the 
whole fum being the yearly contributions of three large con- 
gregations at the church-doors, and given moftly in half- 
pence, except upon extraordinary occafionsi 

In fuch a town an hofpital is certainly necefTary for main- 
taining poor and dcfiitute children, and as an afylum for the 
infirm and the aged, who have none to take care of them. 
For thefe purpofes an hofpital was creeled therein 1752. 
The houfe is capacious : It is built in a free and airy part of 
the town, and has a large garden belonging to it. It is un- 
der the management of 15 diredbrs, who are chofen annual- 
ly; three from the town-council, one from each parifh feffion, 
and the reft chofen by the council from among the inhabi- 
tants at large. It is conducted upon the ftricteft principles 
of oeconomy, and with great attention to health, cleanlinefs, 
and good order, and has hitherto anfwered the ends of its 
inftitution as much, perhaps, as any of the kind. 

The following is a ftate of the expence, and of the per- 
fons maintained in it for the laft three years.

From this account it appears, that the average

And the expence of each perfon to the public

The children are educated and brought up to induftry from 
their earlieft years. The charge of management is exceed- 
ingly fmall, as there is only a miftrefs and a fchoolmafter at 
very moderate falaries, and a fingle houfe-maid ; and the an- 
nual expence is defrayed by mortified money, and a Imall 
affeffment upon the inhabitants. Such is the manner in 
which the poor of the town of Pauley are provided for and 
maintained. 

There are, indeed, large funis of money diftributed yearly 
by the feveral trades from their boxes, as they are called, 
among thofe of their number who are difablcd from work- 
ing. Thefe inftitutions, however, are to be confidered in 
fomewhat of a different light j for, as they are intended to 
be a fecurity againft want, they are conflrutted upon fuch a 
principle, as that the perfon who receives fupply, only draws 
out the money which he had formerly put in, along with 
part, perhaps, of the contributions of his brethren, which 
they all chearfully give, in order to be allured of the fame 
comfortable provifion. A fcheme of this nature may, at fir ft 
fight, be thought liable to fome of the objections which have

been brought againft the poor-tax, particularly, that it tends 
to promote idlenefs, and that the benefit which it affords 
may be drawn away by undeferving objects. But this does 
not feem to be the cafe in faft, and there is no arguing againft 
experience. The pride of enriching the box, and of being a 
fupport to the trade, inftead of a burden upon it a jealoufy 
that pervades all its members, left any of their money fhould 
be improperly given away the difgrace that attends an un- 
neceffary application;— and the evident ruin of the fcheme 
if fuch applications are not effectually difcouraged, all co- 
operate for the prevention of any of thofe evils which other- 
wife, perhaps, might be apprehended from it. 

Schools.— There is an eftablifhed Englifh fchool in each of 
the three parifhes, which are well filled with fcholars ; and, 
as each fchoolmafter is feffion-clerk of the parifh, to which 
he belongs, the emoluments of the two offices bring a decent 
and comfortable living. There is likewife a public grammar 
fchool, with a houfe and falary, and a fchool for teaching 
writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. befides many private fchools, which 
meet with good encouragement, and a Sunday fchool for 
thofe whofe education is in danger of being altogether ne- 
glected ; but fuch is the attention that is paid to the educa- 
tion of poor children in that town, that all the three parifhes 
afford but a fmall number of the above defcription.

PARISH of the <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4663962">ABBEY of PAISLEY</name>* 

{County of Renfrew.— Prefbytery of Pal/ley.— Synod of 
G/afgow and Ayr.") 

By the Reverend Mr Robert Boog.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 
*"TnHE parifh of Paifley is in length, from eaft to weft, 
-a- about nine miles, varying in breadth from half a mile 
to about three. Till 1736, the parifti extended over the 
town of Paifley; but an additional church at that time be- 
coming neceftary, the town was erected into a feparate parifti 5 
and the original parifli has, fince that period, been diftin- 
guifhed by the name of the Abbey parifjj, or, more properly, 
the pari/h of the Abbey of Paifey. 

No fatisfaclory etymology has hitherto occurred of the 
name Paifey. The following has been fuggefted by a good" 
Gaelic fcholar : « A ridge of rocks that runs acrofs the 
river, and forms a beautiful cafcade, would, prior to the 
building of the town, be undoubtedly the moft ftriking ob- 
ject that this place would prefent. The brow or face of a 
rock is, in Gaelic, Pais-licht. A church in front of the rock 
would be the church in Pais-licht. A church did ftand here 
previous to 1 160 ; it is named in the foundation charter Ecclefa 
de Pafelet, Latinized, in the records of the monaflery, Pa/Ie- 
tum, an eafy derivative from Pais-licht, in all probability the 
original of the modern Paifey" 

Surface 



of the Abbey Parijh of Paifley. 75 

Surface and Soil.— It is generally of a gently waving fur- 
face, frequently fwelling, efpecially in the neighbourhood of 
Paifley, into beautiful little eminences. A conflderable part 
of it to the north of the town is a perfect level, having been 
anciently mofs, extending in the year 1719, when a furvey 
of it was made, to about 300 acres ; but now reduced to 
about 130 by the operation of burning, which, in dry feafons, 
is ftill carried on with fuccefs. The fouth part of the parifh 
rifes into a tract of hilly ground, known by the name oi: 
Pai/ley or Stanley Braes. The greateft elevation to which 
thefe grounds rife in this parifli is about 680 feet above flood- 
mark at Paifley. Part of them is mofs and heath, but the 
bulk of them is good fheep pafture, and even a confiderable 
part of them arable. The foil of the parifh, as may be ex- 
pected in fuch an extenfive diftrict, varies. It is in general 
thin, with a bottom of gravel, more frequently of till, very 
retentive of moifture. In the flat giounds, and along the 
banks of the rivers, it is rich and fertile -, lefs fo, thinner, and 
more ftony, as it riles to the fouth. 

Air and Difeafes. — The air is moid, a neceffary confequence 
of the prevailing fouth-weft winds, which, coming loaded 
with vapour from the Atlantic, produce frequent and heavy 
rains. The effects of this moift atmofphere appear in rheu- 
matifms, quinfeys, pneumonic ailments, and all the tribe of 
inflammatory diforders. Upon the whole, however, this pa- 
rifh, and even the neighbouring town, cannot be faid to be 
unhealthy. Contagions, indeed, at times vifit this as other 
places, which run their ufual courfe as epidemics ; but none 
are remembered of any uncommon violence, except a pleuri- 
fy in fummer 1 77 1, and which, contrary to the received opi- 
nion, was truly epidemic. There are no diforders that can 
be faid to be endemic, unlefs fcrophula is to be excepted, 

which 



? 6 • Siatiftical Account 

which is ftill but too common. This has been afcribed to the 
water ufed by the inhabitants in Paifley : It more probably 
proceeded from, it certainly was greatly aggravated by, poor 
living, and by the damp fhops which were neccfTary for the 
linen manufafture ; for, fince filk-weaving became the gene- 
ral employment, and increafe of trade has introduced better 
living, this diforder is lefs frequent. From the fame caufes 
probably it is that fwelled and fore legs, once extremely com- 
mon here, are now but rarely met with. Dyfentery raged 
with great violence in 1765; fince that time it has been 
fcarcely complained of. Nervous fevers at times appear, but 
they are neither very general nor uncommonly fatal. It is to 
be apprehended, that the confinement and fedentary pofture 
of the weaver, and the laborious life of the bleacher, are 
frequent caufes of confumptive complaints. Intermittents, 
which, from the damp air, and adjoining mols, might be ex- 
pected to be common, are not fo much as known. 

Water. — The water in Paifley and the fuburbs is but in- 
different ; and there is fcarce any thing more wanted for the 
convenience and comfort of the inhabitants than a plentiful 
fupply of good fpring water. But now, that every fpring and 
rill is occupied and become valuable property, this is fcarcely 
to be hoped for. 

Rivers. — Befides the Black Cart, which, rifing in Caftle 
Semple Loch, partly bounds the parifli on the north, and 
the rivulet Levern, which marks it on the fouth-eaft, the 
parifli is watered by the river White Cart. . It rifes in the 
high grounds about Kilbride," and, entering this parifh from 
the eaft, flows in a pretty direct wefterly courfe towards the 
town. After forming a beautiful fall at Seedhill-mill, it 
turns northerly^ and, about a mile below the town, enters 

Renfrew 



of the Abbey Parijh of -Pai/ley. ;7 

Renfrew parifh, and joins the river Gryfe at Inchinan.bridge, 
In the Cart are found perch, trout, flounders, and braifes, or. 
gilt-heads, but none of them in any confiderable quantities, 
owing, no doubt, in a great degree to the bleachfields, print- 
fields, and a copperas work upon the banks of the river. As 
for the fine large pearls once found in this river, and which, 
^ccprding to our old hiftorians, had been noticed by the moft 
eminent jewellers in Europe, they have long disappeared, and 
the river has become a more certain fource of wealth by its 
utility to an induftrious and manufacturing neighbourhood. 
Of feveral fmaller rivulets in the parifh, none are fo confi- 
derable from their fize as to merit notice. Covered, how- 
ever, as their banks every where are with thread, lawns, or 
muffins, they have all become highly valuable to their pro- 
prietors, and of great importance to the country. — The river 
White Cart was, by direction of the Magiftrates of Pauley, 
Purveyed by Mr Whiteworth in 1786. He reported, that, 
by removing fome rocks and fhoals in the river, a depth of 
feven feet of water might be obtained in ordinary fpring» 
tides ; and, as the channel is but fhallow under Inchinan- 
bridge, as it could not be eafily or lafely deepened there, and 
as, at any rate, velTels with ftanding mafts could not pafs un- 
der the arches, he propofed to avoid that part of the naviga- 
tion by means of a navigable canal, which fhould leave the 
river a little above, and join it again below the bridge. The 
expence of the whole, including a draw-bridge acrofs the 
canal, was eftimated at 1900I. The plan being approved of, 
Eii net of Parliament was obtained, empowering the Magif- 
trates and other truftees to carry on the work, and defray the 
expence by a tonnage of eight-pence per ton upon all veffels 
navigating the Cart, with an exception in favour of thofe 
loaded with coal. The work is now completed, but at an 
expence of about 4000 1. The navigation is greatly improved, 

but

but not to the degree that was expected 5 and probably, to 
obtain an unobftrucled paffage at all times to and from Paif- 
ley, fome further operations upon the river and canal will ftill 
be neceflary. The tonnage lets at prefent for 1 55 1. But, from 
Whitfunday 1792 to that term 1793, it has been let for 250 1. 
Paifley has derived confiderable advantages from the cora- 
pleating of the great canal between Forth and Clyde. The 
great and increafing demand for Baltic goods have rendered 
that navigation of more confequence to Paifley than it was 
perhaps at firft fuppofed it would be. But, to give this place 
the full benefit of it, a branch would be neceflary from the 
great canal to the Clyde, to terminate as nearly oppofite to 
the mouth of Paifley river as the ground would permit. 
Perhaps it could not be brought nearer than Newfbot Ifle. 
The diftance at this place between the canal and the Clyde is 
but about one third of a mile ; its elevation above the level 
of the river nearly 22 feet. Two locks would therefore be 
neceiTary, and from thefe the chief expence of the work 
would arife. The advantages, however, would be great. 
The navigation would be fhortened no lefs than five miles 
for veffels and rafts of wood coming to Paifley. Two days 
would be faved each trip to the proprietors of goods. The 
bulky articles of corn, wood, iron, coal, aflies, foap wafte, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. which are intended for Paifley, Kilbarchan, John- 
ftoun, Beith, Houfton, Neilfloun, &amp;c. would be brought to 
Paifley by water-carriage, inftead of being landed at Port- 
Dundas, and fent from thence by land-carriage. The ma- 
nufadurers of Paifley might fend a great part of their goods 
from their warehoufes immediately by water-carriage to Lon- 
don and other places. A confiderable increafe of tonnage 
would arife to the proprietors of the great canal, and many 
important advantages to an extenfive and populous tracl: of 
country. 

Woods. 



of the Abbey Parifi of Pdiflef. 79 

Woods.— There are no woods of any great extent in the 
parifh ; perhaps about 140 acres of natural oak, afh, birch, 
plane, &amp;c. may be the amount of the whole, upon three or 
four different eftates. The Foreft of Paifley exitts only in 
ancient records. Walter, Great Steward of Scotland, by the 
charter of foundation of the monaftery of Paifley, grants to 
the monks " Decimas de omnibus terris infra Forejlum fuum 
de Pafleto." Io Prynne's Collections, we meet with " John 
le Hunter de la forefte de Patty." And, in 1460 and 1524, 
the tenant of Dunfkaith-wood, in the immediate neighbour-* 
hood of the town, is bound by the abbot " Cuftodire lylvam 
et fuftentare foffas circa di&amp;a-m fylvam." The names of 
Woodfide, Oaklhawiide, and Oakfhawhead, are the only 
traces that remain of thofe woods. 

Roads. — The only turnpike-road in the parifh is that run- 
ning through it from eaft to weft. Of late years, it has been 
kept in very good repair. The others, which depend upon 
the ftatute labour, are in a very indifferent ftate. This, it is 
hoped, will be remedied by a bill to be brought into Parlia- 
ment next feffion for making fome new turnpike-roads, con- 
verting the ftatute work into money, and regulating the ap- 
plication of it. 

Mines and Minerals. — There are five coal-mines at prefent 
wrought in the parifh. That at Hurlet, belonging to the 
Earl of Glafgow ; Quarreltown, to Mr Houftoun of John£. 
toun ; Achinloadmont, to Mr Fulton of Achinloadmont ; 
Nutfhiel, to Mr Dunlop of H'oufehill ; and one lately open- 
ed in the lands of Newton, the property of Mr Spiers of El- 
derflie. Of thefe, the two firft merit particular notice. —  
The Hurlet or Hawkhead coal lies about three miles fouth- 
eaft from Paifley. It is a ftratum 5 feet 3 inches thick, de- 
clining 



86 Slali/ltcal Accounk 

dining eaftward, with a dip about one foot in feven. This 
valuable ieam has been wrought, it is fuppofed, for contider- 
ably more than 200 years. In 1634, there were five miners 
employed ; of late there have been from 20 to 30 ; and the 
yearly produce, on an average of 20 years, is about 10,000 
tons. Inflammable and fixed air are met with in this mine j 
but the pits are fo well ventilated, there being a complete 
communication between fhafts half a mile diftant, that, tho* 
accidents fometimes have happened, they are not frequent. 
It is well afcertained, that fire has been generated in thefe 
mines, and among the coals upon the hills, by the martial 
pyrites with which they abound— The coal at Quarreltown 
is one of the moft extraordinary mafTes of that mineral in 
Britain. It confifts, in effedT:, of five contiguous ftrata. The 
thicknefs of the whole, meafured at right angles to the fur- 
face of the ftrata, is upwards of ^o feet ; but as, in fome 
places, the feam forms a very confiderable angle with the 
horizon, the thicknefs of the whole in thefe places, meafured 
vertically, is about 15 fathoms. In confequenee of this great 
depth, it is worked in different floors or ftoreys. Till of late, 
the work was carried on horizontally from the fhaft, fo as fuc- 
ceffively to interfere, all the five ftrata. At ptefent, the miner 
purfues the fame ftratum, rifing with it. In the former 
mode of working, there were five feveral floors or ftoreys ; 
in the prefent, there are only three; the firft, third, and 
fifth ftratum being wrought, and afterwards fo much of the 
fecond and fourth as may be done with fafety. — It is difficult 
to convey a clear idea of the manner in which this Angular 
mafs of coal lies. In a field of about 15 acres, it is found to 
dip in feveral different directions. At leaft, conceiving a 
nearly circular area of thofe contents, the coal, from the 
north, the eaft, and fouth quarters of that circle, dips pretty 
uniformly towards the centre. This, however, is, in fome 

meafure, 



of the Abbey Parijh of Paj/tey. « i 

meafiire, Interrupted by feveral hitches, at one of which the 
mafs of coal is fuddenly thrown up about 50 feet, at another 
about 30. Thefe hitches interrupt not only the direction, 
but the degree of the dip. On one fide of the firft mention- 
ed hitch, it is about one foot in three j on the other fide, on- 
ly one in fix. Some years ago this coal took fire ; and the 
pillars giving way, the ground funk, and left the furface in a 
very rugged ftate. The excellent judgment and perfevering 
induftry of the proprietor have furmounted many difficulties 
that have occurred in working this valuable coal. It now 
employs about 30 pick-men; and there are commonly 12 or 
14 horfes below ground. The produce fomc years has been 
not lefs than twenty thoufand tons. 

Free ftone quarries abound in the parifh. The ftone in 
moft of them is of a good quality, lies near the furface, and 
generally dips towards the eaft. A quarry of coarfe granite 
or blue whin, in what was formerly the Abbey garden, af- 
fords excellent materials for paving the ftreets. A ftone, 
here called Ofmond Jlotie, found on the tops of the hills in this 
and the adjoining parifh of Nielfton, is ufed for hearths of 
ovens ; but the Inverary ftone is preferred to it. — We have 
feveral lime-ftone quarries. That at Stanley, the property 
of the Earl of Glafgow, merits the examination of the curi- 
ous. An enormous rock, projecting from the brow of a hill, 
contains the limei'lone lying in a mafs of about ten feet thick, 
and dipping towards a centre, like the Quarreltown coal. 
Several mines have been driven into the rock; and thefe 
meeting in the heart of it, prefent a very lingular piece of 
fubterranean fcenery. The limeftone at Blackhall, the pro- 
perty of Sir Michael Stewart, is alio wrought by mining, but 
not without danger, having only a clay roof. The Hurlet 
lime lies in a ftratum three feet thick, incumbent on the feam 
of coal. After the coal is dug out, the limeftone is blown 

Vol. VII. L down

down with gun-powder, about one half being ..left to fuppori 
the ftrata above. 

Fojils — Foflll fhells, and other marine exuviae, are found 
in great quantities in all our lime quarries ; fuch as entrochi, 
which are numerous ; anomiae, both with the perforated and 
entire beak; gryphites ; milliperes ; fungites ; feveral varie- 
ties of pettens, and many others, which do not exift in their 
natural ftate upon our Ihores. All thefe abound in the lime- 
quarry at Floors, the property of Mr Houftoun of Johnftoun, 
and are generally found contained in a ftratum of white clay 
immediately incumbent on the lime. Corals and fhells have 
been found in finking the fliafts for the Hawkhead coal; the 
former in detached pieces of limeltone, a few feet from the 
furface; the latter involved in the mafs of fchiftus immedi- 
ately over the coal, and at a depth of not lefs than 160 feet. 
Among thefe are the ortho-ceratites, turbinated cochleae, and 
feveral fpecies of bivalves ;, all of them retaining their origi- 
nal form, and mining like the marcalite in common flate. — 
In finking a fhaft for that coal in 1786, the feveral ftrata oc- 
curred as follows :

fined with them. RhomboiJal fpar, both opake and tranf- 
parent, is alfo met with. The fchiftus, No. 5. is extremely 
hard i'but, when lying in a dry place, as in the wafte of the 
coal-pit, it gradually decompofes, and acquires a flacky ap- 
pearance. It is a beautiful vitriolic eflorefcence, perfectly 
refembling plume alu«i, but feems to have more of the vitri- 
olated iron than vitriolated clay. In this ftratum of fchiftus, 
and in the ftratum of coal, pyrites abound fo much, that na- 
tive copperas is fometimes found. They lie not in any regular 
bed, but interfperfed through the ftratum, and are feparated 
from the coal by the workmen. They are employed in a 
copperas or green vitriol manufacture, eftabliftied at Hurler, 
in 1753 by a company from Liverpool. — A bituminous fub- 
ftance is found both in the lime and whin-ftone quarries. It 
drips in a fluid ftate from the limeftone at Blackball. In 
that at Hurler it is found folid ; fometimes fo indurated as to 
be brittle ; fometimes fo foft as to cut with a knife ; in either 
ftate highly inflammable. 

Figured Stones.— At Harelaw, a farm belonging to the Earl 
of Glafgovv, are found ftones in confiderable quantities, with 
well defined vegetable imprefiions. The imprefiions are up- 
on a concave furface, and evidently formed by its application 
to the convexity of a Hem or branch of a tree. In iome fpe- 
cimens, they prefent the appearance of a kind of rhomboidal 
net-work j in others, that of regular indentations, nearly re- 
fembling what we may conceive would be retained by a foft 
body from its application to the cone of the fir-tree. A body 
of a comprefled cylindrical form, which has communicated 
thefe imprefiions, is fometimes found : It is figured upon the 
furface in a manner correfponding to thefe indentations : 
And, though no plant pvecifely reiembling it is now known 
in this country, it is evidently a portion of a petrified branch 

or

or fim trunk of a tree. The ftones thus marked are com- 
monly free-ftone; fometimes, but more rarely, iron-fitone. 
Vegetable impreffions have alfo been obferved upon the py- 
rites of the Hawkhead coal *. 

Hujbatidry.— The hufbandry of this parifh, as of all the 
weft of Scotland, was, about the middle of this century, in a 
moft unprofperous ftate. The indigent circumftances of the 
farmers, their indolent habits, the want of roads, of wheel- 
carriages, and* proper implements of hufbandry, all confpired 
to obftruct the improvement of the foil. Till about 1770, 
lime, coal, grain, &amp;c. were generally conveyed on horfe- 
back. The old fervitudes of carriages, kain labour, thirlage, 
&amp;c. ftili exifted, with many practices difcouraging to the far- 
mer, and ftrongly marking the languid ftate of agriculture. 
The fpirit of improvement, however, which, about that time, 
appeared in Scotland, reached Renfrewfhire •, and a very fa- 
vourable change has now taken place. The introduction of 
artificial grafles, and the culture of potatoes, have produced 
a more diligent and accurate hufbandry, and banilhed the 
pernicious diftinction of croft and outfield f. Before 1766, 
there was fcarce any hay fown \ and the natural grafs hay 
then fold at 3d. per {tone. The general price of hay, of late 
y€ars, has been 5 d. or 6 d. ; at prefent it is no lefs than 9 d. 
Potatoes, about 40 or 50 years ago, were brought in boats 
from Kintyre to Paifley market. About 30 years ago, far- 
mers 

* The particulars relative to the mineralogy of the parifh 
have been chiefly communicated by the ingenious Mr John 
Wilfon, factor to the Earl of Glafgow. 

. f The diftinction between croft and outfield prevailed very 
generally in the old and imperfect hufbandry of Scotland. The 
croft, confifting of a few acres neareft the farm houfe, was per- 
petually in crop, and received the whole manure of the farm, 
The outfield was the open pafture land, which was occafionally 
plowed in patches for oats till they were exhaufted, and then 
left to reft.

mers began pretty generally to cultivate them in the field. 
No crops, it is probable, have proved more profitable to the 
farmer than thefe.— The fcheme of farming moft commonly 
followed i Sj -oats out of lee,-beans and peafe,-barley with 
clovers and grafs feeds. After one crop of hay, the field is 
generally paftured for three or four years, and then broke up 
with the oats. Little wheat is fown, but rather more of late 
than formerly. Rye, flax, and turnip, are but very little cul- 
tivated; hemp not at all. Oats are fown in March, more 
generally in April: Barley from about the 20th of May to 
the 10th of June: Wheat in September or Oftober, either 
after fallow, after potatoes, or out of lee. Lime is common- 
ly applied upon the lee for the oats ; dung and manure to 
barley and wheat. The old Scots plough is generally ufed, 
many farmers having a prejudice againft the chain-plough, as, 
lefs fit to overcome the impediments to tillage with which 
much of the toil in this neighbourhood abounds. It has, 
however, of late been introduced with fuccefs, with the im- 
provement of a cafWron mould-board. The crop, in gene- 
ral, is got in in September and October ; fometimes, as was 
the cafe this feafon, (i 791) not till the beginning of Novem- 
ber. In 1 78 1, it was all in in Auguft, and was one of the 
belt known. In 1782, the harveft was not finifhed till the 
very end of November •, and, during that month, there were 
considerable falls of fnow. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifh is 1 1,944!. 13 s. 4d, 
Scots ; the real rent 9700 1. Sterling, belonging to 30 landed 
proprietors, 15 of whom poflefs each above 100I. Scots of 
valuation. The rent of the beft arable land is about 2 guinea 
per acre ; fomething more in the immediate neighbourhood 
of Paifley. The beft pafture ground brings about 30 s. per 
acre. Lands of inferior quality from 12 to 20 s. ; and the 

high 



86 Statl/lical Account 

high pafture ground about 5 s. Garden grounds around the 
town let at about 5 1. per acre. Till within thefe few years 
P*ft, a great proportion of the garden-fluffs ufed in Paifley 
was brought from Glafgow. The number of farms feems 
rather diminifhing, but not in any great degree. Their ex- 
tent is, in general, from 40 to 100 acres. Few farmers pay 
more than 1 20 1. per annum of rent ; the moft of them about 
50 1. or 60 1. All of them are fufficiently fenfible of the ad- 
vantages of an inclofed farm, and willingly pay 7* percent. 
to the proprietor for money laid out in that Ipecies of im- 
provement. In confequence of this, the parifti is all inclofed 
cither with hedges or ftone dykes. 

Farmers.— Though the rife of rents has been great, moft 
of them having been doubled within the laft 30 years, yet 
the farmers are more independent ; they pay their rents more 
regularly, live better, and are better cloathed than formerly., 
the effect, no doubt, of a more vigorous and fuccefsful huf- 
bandry. Still, however, they are far, very far from enjoying 
the comforts of life in the degree to which fuch an induftri- 
ous and valuable order of men are entitled. The prices of 
grain, their chief commodity, do not rife ; and if, in confe- 
quence of the greater wealth and population which the ma- 
nufactures have introduced, their cheefe, butter, and eggs, 
bring a higher price, this is probably more than counterba- 
lanced by another effect of the fame caufe, the immoderate 
rife upon fervants wages. A little more regard to the inte- 
reft of the farmer will not, perhaps, be found fo very incon- 
fiftent with that of the manufacturer as feems to have been 
imagined of late, when all this part of the country was in a 
flame during the dependance of the corn-bill, the operation 
#f which not one in a thoufand underftood. The number 

of 



of the Abbey Parifh of Paifley. 8 j 

of farmers in the parifh is about 140 ; of ploughs, 148 3 
horfes, 507. 

Servitudes.— The ancient fervitudes, fo oppreflive and har- 
raffing to the farmer, are almoft entirely abolifhed. The on- 
ly one of any confequence that remains is that of thirlage. 
The Abbey Mill exadts from moft of the lands thirled to it a 
multure of the one and twentieth peck, befides dues to the 
fervants of the Mill. This Mill, let by the abbot and con- 
vent about A. D. 1500 for four chalders eleven bolls of rnealj 
and one chalder malt, yearly, pays at prefent a rent of 432 K 
Another mill in the neighbourhood lets at 220 1. 

Manufatlures.' — The manufactures carried on in this parifh 
are, the weaving of filk gauze, muflins, lawns, cotton fluffs, 
and thread gauze, in all their varieties ; thread making, cot- 
ton fpinning, bleaching, callicoe printing; the making of 
candles, white foap, black foap, and ftarch. An account of 
the rife, progrefs, prefent ftate, and produce of the principal 
manufactures, is communicated from the town of Paifley. 
We lubjoin their prefent ftate in this parifh. 

In the various weaving branches there were employed at 
"Whitfunday 1791, in the fuburbs of Paifley, uoSloorm, 
which, added to 2494 employed in the town, gives 3602 m 
all. But it re to be obferved, that the extent to which the 
weaving branches are carried on by the manufacturers in 
Paifley, is not to be judged of from the number of looms 
in the town and fuburbs. Befides about 150 in the country 
part of the parifh, there are great numbers employed by 
them in the villages of Nielftoun, Bar-head, Beith, Dairy, 
Kilwinning, &amp;cc. &amp;c. In 1744, when all the bufinefs was 
confined to the town and fuburbs, there were 867 looms at 
-work. — The thread making employs 9 mills, which, added 

to 



^ 8 Statlftkal Account 

to 128 employed In Paifley, makes 137 in all. The number 
in 1744 was 93. The fpinning of cotton was introduced in- 
to this parifh in .1783. The principal feat of that manufac- 
ture is at Johnftoun, a neat and regularly built village about 
three miles weft from Paifley, upon the eftate of Mr Houfton 
of Johnftoun. The feuing of that village was begun in 1782, 
and it contained at Whitfunday laft 293 families, or 1434 
fouls. There are five companies eftablifhed in it for cotton 
fpinning. Two of thefe carry on their principal operations 
by water-machinery. In the two mills employed in them, 
there are going at prefent 1 1,672 fpindles ; but, when the 
whole machinery in both fhall be compleated, there will be 
22,572. The number of perfons, young and old, at prefent 
employed in both mills is 660. There are befides about 120 
fpinning Jeenies employed throughout the parifh ; but the 
number is daily increafing ; and, when the machinery is com- 
pleated which the buildings already erected are calculated to 
contain, there will be about 150 Jeenies, exclufive of thofe in 
the two great mills. The number of perfons employed in 
this branch at prefent is, in all, about 1020. 

It is painful to think, that a manufacture which gives em- 
ployment to fo many hands, and which may be a fource of 
great wealth to individuals, may be productive of very un- 
happy effects upon both the health and morals of the chil- 
dren employed in it. This there is fome reafon to appre- 
hend. The numbers that are brought together, efpecially in 
the larger mills, the confinement, the breathing of an air 
loaded with the duft and downy particles of the cotton, and 
contaminated with the effluvia of rancid oil riling from the 
machinery, muft prove hurtful, in a high degree, to the de- 
licate and tender lungs of children. Add to this, that mills 
which produce the water-twift are kept going day and night ; 
and children muft be had who are willing to work through 

the 



of the Abbey Parijh of Paijley, Bg 



the night, and fleep during the day. Tempted by the wages, 
parents fend their children to this employment at a very ear- 
ly age, when they have got little or no education ; and the 
clofe confinement deprives them of the opportunity of ac- 
quiring more. Ignorance, difeafe, and mortality, are but too 
likely to prove the effects of this manufacture, if carried on 
by unfeeling and felfifh men. The characters of the gentle- 
men engaged in it in this neighbourhood give reafon to hope, 
that every method will be employed which humanity and 
good fenfe can fuggeft to prevent thefe evils. 

The bleaching bufinefs in this parifli is tarried 6n to a, 
very confiderable extent* There are 10 fields for whitening 
muflins and lawns, and about as many for thread, almoft 
wholly employed by the manufacturers in Paifley. About 
300 perfons are at work in this branch of bufinefs, of whom 
about 240 are women, who are hired for the feafon. 

A foap and candle manufacture pays about 2000 1. of duty 
per annum to Government, and has, in fome years, paid 
upwards of 3000 i. A black and hard foap manufacture, 
4500 1. per annum. The ftarch manufacture is but lately 
eftabliffied. 

The diftillery bufinefs is to be mentioned under this head ; 
it has for fome time paft been carried on to a great extent, 
and the fpirit manufactured in great perfection. A confides 
able quantity of it is exported, but too much of it is confumed 
at home. Dram drinking is common ; alehoufes numerous. 
They are the refort of the vagrant, the idle, and the profli- 
gate ; they gradually become a fnare to the fober and induf- 
trious, and are producing the worft effects upon the health, 
the morals, and domeflic comfort of the people. This grow- 
ing evil might, in fome meafure, be flopped, by limiting the 
number of alehoufes, and impofing fome reftraints as to the 

V0L - VII. M hours

hours during which they fhould be kept open. The juftices 
have power to do fo. The fteady exertion of thefe powers 
is what is wanting. 

There has for Come years paft been a very confiderable 
importation of goods from the Baltic. The many and large 
buildings erecting for the cotton fpinning have produced a 
ereat demand for wood and iron ; the bleaching and foap- 
making, for tallow and alhes.

Since Whitfunday 1791, when th? numbers flood as above, 
there has been an addition of fome hundreds to the town and 
fuburbs. 

Of the above number 10,792, the prefent population of 
the parifh, there are 5259 males, and 5533 females, it the 
proportion of females appear large, it is to be afcribed to the 
number of women employed in the bleaching bufmefs, which 
is the reafon alfowhy, in fome of the diftrias, the number of 
fouls is fo great in proportion to the families, the perfons em- 
ployed in the field being reckoned part of the bleacher's fa- 
mily. 

There are 4197 perfons below 15 years of age, 6455 be- 
tween 15 and 70, and 140 above 70. In the fuburbs, there 
is, above the age of 70, one in 84.769 in the country, one 
In 68.95. 

In 579 families, a portion of the country part of the parifh, 
there are 48 batchelor houfelceepers, and 53 1 married coupler. 
Among thel'e, there have been 221 1 births. The average of

famd.es in the fuburbs, there are r 1 1 batchelor houfekeepers, 
and ,274 married couples. Among thefe there have been 
547° births. The average to each married couple is 4.29. 

The number of fouls to each family in the country is 
5.38 ; to each family in the town and fuburbs, is 4.3 r. In 
the year i 744 , this laft was only 4.01, a change to be afcri- 
bed probably to families keeping a greater number of fervants 
now than formerly. 

Of fervants, houfehold and labouring, male and female, 
there are 970. This number includes the perfons employed 
m the bleachfields. Excluding thefe, there may be about 
415 boufehold, and 255 labouring fervants. '

The inhabitants of the two parifhes amounting to 24,592 i 
therefore the proportion between the deaths of laft year and

is as one to 40.98. 

In the ten years, 1 771 1780, the deaths to the births 

over the whole diftrid are as one to 1 .46. In the ten years, 

, 7 8i 1790, the deaths to the births are as one to 1.54. 

To a place furnifhing fuch variety of employment, there 
will be a confxderable influx of inhabitants from other parts 
of the country. There are a few from England, more from 
Ireland, a great number from Ayrfhire, and probably ftill 
more from the Highlands. Their numbers have not been 
afcertained. If they may be judged of from the degree in 
which the actual population exceeds the annual births multi- 
plied by 26, there will be about 260 in the Abbey parifh, and 
930 in the town. 

In the enumeration that has been made of this parifh, 
1770 perfons are marked as feceding from the eftablifhed 
Church. If thofe only are reckoned Seceders who have 
themfelves made choice of their religious profeffion, the num- 
ber will be considerably fewer. If all the children of fece- 
ding parents are to be counted Seceders, the numbers will be 
fomewhat more. In this laft manner were the returns from 
the feveral diftricls in this parifh generally made. The above 
number includes diflenters of every denomination : They are 
moftly Burghers, Antiburghers, and members of the Relief 
Congregations. There are two fects of Independents, fome 
Cameronians, a very few of the Epifcopal perfuafion, and 
perhaps two or three Papifts. The Burgher-Seceders, and 

the

the two fefts of Independents, have each a place of meeting 
in the parifli. 

Church and &amp;J«/._ Thc ftipend of this parifli was origi- 
nally ,6 chalders of meal ; but, in ,6 4 i, Mr Calvert, then 
mimfter, agreed to give to a fecond, or colleague minifter, 
five chalders, and « that according to the aft of the High 
Comm.ffion," and one chalder provided the entrant mould 
be agreeable to the prefbytery, the parilh, and himlelf. 
Several augmentations have been made to the original ftipend 
of thts charge ; fo that now it confifts 0 f eight chalders of 
meal, 16I. 13 s . 4 d. Sterling of money, and 4 1. 3 s. 4 d. for 
communion elements. There is no houie or glebe belongs 
to it. The ftipend of the rirft charge is ten chalders of meal, 
4 1. 13 s. 4 d. for communion elements, with a manfe and 
glebe. The glebe lets for 10 1 The manfe was built in 
1712, has had feveral repairs, got a pretty complete one in 
1783, and is now a tolerably commodious houle, though in. 
ferior to fome manles lately built in the neighbourhood. The 
Marquis of Abercorn is patron of both livings. 

The fchoolmafter of the town of Paifley was, before the 
disjunction of the town, confidered as the parifh fchoolmaf- 
ter. Since that time, there has been no eftablifhed fchool- 
mafter in the parifh, though there are many private teachers 
and well frequented fchools. 

Abbey. — A particular account of the Abbey of Paifley 
would fill many pages. It was founded as a priory for 
monks of the order of Clugni about the year 1 160 by Walter 
great Steward of Scotland. It was afterwards raifed to the 
rank of an abbacy ; and the lands belonging to it were by 
Robert II. erected into a regality, under the jurifdiclion of 
the abbot. After the Reformation, the abbacy was feculari-

« LZ Duke of Chatelherault, in reward of his fteady ad- 
Wnc Z the caufe of Queen Mary , and, in , 5 8B . was 
TZ King and Parliament eretted into a temporal lordfhip, 
1 Lord Claud was created Lord Paifley. The revenues of 
the abbacy were very confiderable : They confiftcd of the 
teinds of twenty-eight different parifhes, with the property of 
the lordfhips of Paifley, of Kilpatrick in Dunbartonfhire, and 
of Monkton in Ayrfhire, extending each to a hundred merk 
land ; and the forty pound land of Glen in Lochwinnoch ; 
with the lands of Achengown, Grange, &amp;c. and a confider- 
able detached property in different parts of the kingdom. 
All this property, with the patronage of the feveral cnurches, 
fell to Lord Claud Hamilton, laft abbot of Paifley. It con- 
tinued in that family till .653, when his grandfon James Earl 
of Abercorn fold the lordfhip of Paifley to the Earl of Angus, 
who next year fold it to William Lord Cochran, Kilpatrick 
to Sir John Hamiltoun of Orbiftoun, Monktoun to Lord 
Bargenny, and Glen- to Lord Semple and others. Great 
part of the lordfhip of Paifley was, at different times, fold off 
by the family of Dundonald ; and what remained of it was 
in 1764 repurchafed by the late Earl of Abercorn. The fa- 
bric of the Abbey owed much of its magnificence to Abbot 
George Schaw, who, about 1484, enlarged and beautified the 
building, Grounding the church, the precinfts of the con- 
vent, die gardens, and a fmall deer-park, with a noble wall 
of hewn free-ftone. The Abbey 'was, after the Reformation, 
fucceffively the feat of the Earls of Abercorn and Dundonald. 
The late Earl of Dundonald demolifhed the ancient gateway, 
and, by fcuing off the immediately adjoining grounds for 
building, entirely changed the appearance of the place. As 
it was thus rendered totally unfit for a family refidence, it 
has fince that time been let out into feparate dwellings, and

a meafure the more reafonable and neceffary in this parifh, 
as among the many affluent landholders belonging to it, on- 
ly one or two who refided within the parifh, did ever con- 
tribute any thing for the maintainance of the poor. The 
firft affeffment was 152 1. from which fum it foon rofe to 
415 1. ; but this, like other taxes, is not completely effective. 
It has flood at that furn for the laft three years ; and if the 
attention that has hitherto been given to the management be 
continued, and the fame care taken to admit no improper 
objects on charity, it is hoped there will be no neceffity, for 
feme time, to impofe a greater. The collections amount to 
about 80 1. yearly.; the dues of proclamation 18 1.; mort- 
cloths, nl.; and the interefts of money, with a trifling fum 
arifing from fines impofed by the kirk feflion, about 15 1. 
The produce of the whole funds is thrown into one fum, and 
diftributed by the kirk feflion, and 21 overfeers, chofen 
equally from the heritors, farmers, and houfeholders. A 
fmall falary is paid for collecting the affeffment, and paying 
out the money, the only expence that attends the manage- 
ment. The mode of affeffment and diftribution is fo fimilar 
to that in the parifh of Jedburgh, that the minute diffe- 
rences are not worth noticing. 

Befides thefe parochial funds for the relief of the poor, 
there is a confiderable fubfcription yearly to the Paifley Dli- 
penfary, an inftitution that has fubfifted fince 1786", and 
been attended with very happy effects among the lower 
claffes of the induftrious inhabitants of this place. The 
yearly amount of the fubfcription to that chanty, from the 
town and fuburbs, has been about 130 1. 

Various focieties are formed among the journeymen wea- 
vers, for the relief of thofe members who, by age or fick- 
nefs, are incapacitated for work. Sunday fchools, though 
upon a fmall fcale, have been lately eftabliflied, both in the

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7009670">NEW OR EAST KILPATRICK</name>. 

(Counties of Dunbarton and Stirling. — Prefbytery of 
Dunbarton. — Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. J 

By the Reverend Mr George Sym.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THIS parifh is called New, or Eaft Kilpatrick, relatively 
to Old, or Weft Kilpatrick, with which it formed 
one parifh till the year 1 649, when a divifion and new erec- 
tion took place. The name Kilpatrick, Cella Pairicii, com- 
mon to both, is derived from Patrick, the tutelary faint of 
Ireland, whom legends and tradition make a native of Kil- 
patrick. A writer quoted in Britan. Eccles. Primcrdia, fays, 
*« Natale patricii folum inter caftrum Dunbritannicum et ci- 
vitatem Glafcuenfem pofitum ; accepto ab ipfo nomine Kirk- 
patrick vel Kilpatrick ; adding, that his father Was a pref- 
byter, and grandfather a deacon, arid that he was carried 
captive with his two fifters into Ireland, and fold to one of 
the petty princes of that country, who employed him as a 
fwine herd. But a local tradition informs us, that he was 
compelled to leave his native country by the malice and re. 
fentment of the Devil, who, provoked at his fanftity and 
fuccefs in preaching the gofpel, fent a band of witches againft 
him ; that the weird-fifters fell upon him fo furioufly, that 
he was forced to feek fafety by flight ; that finding a little 

boat 



Statijlical Account 

boat near the mouth of the Clyde, he went into it and 
let off for Ireland ; that they feeing it impoffible to pur- 
ine him, for it f eems they were not of that clafs of witches 
who can (kim along the waters in an egg ffiell, or ride 
through the air on a broom ftick, tore a huge piece of a rock 
from a neighbouring hill, and hurled it, with deadly purpofe, 
after him; but that, miffing their aim, the ponderous mafs 
fell harmlefs, and afterwards, with a little addition from art, 
formed the Cattle of Dunbarton. This furely is Efficient 
proof, that Kilpatrick both derives its name from, and gave 
birth to, the celebrated faint of Ireland. 

Number and Rent of Farms.— There are two large grafs 
farms, which pay about 200 1. of rent each. Of corn farms 
there are 6, at iool. or a little above— about 50 between 
30 1. and 100 1 — .and above 40 below 30 1. ; but among the 
laft are included a few cottage lands, each fufficient only to 
maintain a cow. Almoft all thofe above 30 1. and'fomealfo 
of thofe below it, employ a plough and 3 or 4 horfes ; and 
two of the largeft employ two ploughs each. All thefe are 
excluiive of the lands occupied by the greater proprietors 
themfelves, and by the tackfmen of bleachfields and mills. 
Leafes are commonly for 19 years. The average rent of ara- 
ble land is about 15 s. per acre ; there is fome at 30 s. and a 
good deal below 12 s. Every new leafe brings an addition of 
rent to the landlord ; and hitherto few of the tenants have 
reafon to compl iin. In general they live much more com- 
fortably, are better fed, better clothed, and better lodged, 
than when they paid but the half of their prefent rent. The 
raifing of the rent has ftimulated their induftry, and their 
induftry is repaid in the enjoyment of more of the comforts 
of life. And the generous landlord, it is to be hoped, will 
never rapacioufly extort from the hulbandman all that is not 

necefTary 



of New Kilpatrick. 101 

neceffary to a bare fubfiftence. The farmers form the moft 
mduftrious, fober, and ufeful clafs of men, and deierve more 
than any other liberal encouragement. 

Mode of Farming, csV.— Though the farmers in this panto 
have, of late years, made confiderabie improvement in the 
knowledge and praftice of agriculture, they ftill adhere pret- 
ty much to the old method ; the ftubborn nature of the foil, 
they fay, and probably with truth, does not wholly admit of 
the new. 

The crops are wheat, oats, barley, peafe, beans, potatoes, 
turnip, flax, and clover and rye-grafs. Of wheat, very little 
is now fown, a fucceffion of unfavourable feafons having dif- 
couraged the culture of it. Peafe, beans, flax, and turnip, 
are alio fown in but fmall quantities. The principal crops 
are oats, barley, potatoes, and clover and rye-grafs. 

Till lately, very little land, except for fallow, was plowed 
before the month of January. It is a general opinion among 
the farmers here, that, unlefs the foil be dry, and free from 
tough-rooted weeds, winter plowing is prejudicial to the 
crop, wet clay land being apt to cake even after froft, and 
tough or dry-rooted weeds, which are not eafily deftroyed by 
froft, fprouting before the corn is fown, and therefore cho- 
king it the more readily after it is come up. They begin 
now, however, to give lefs weight to thefe objections. 

The greater part of the farmers plow with three horfes, 
fome with four, and but very few with two only. 

The ufual time of fowing wheat is Ottober ; oats, peafe, 
and beans, from the beginning of March to the end of April ; 
and barley, clover, and rye-grafs, from the beginning to the 
middle of May. Potatoes are planted about the middle of 
April ; in large fields with the plough, in fmall plots with, 
the dibble. 

Hay 



corn 
com- 



102 Statiftical Account 

Hay harveft begins about the middle of June ; and 
harveft fometimes about the middle of Auguft, though . 
monly later, and continues often till the beginning of No- 
vember. From 200 to 300 ftone per acre is reckoned a good 
crop of hay, and of oats and barley 7 or 8 bolls. 

A few years ago, a club was formed by the farmers in this 
and other parifhes in the neighbourhood of Glafgow, for the 
purpofe of promoting and diffufing the knowledge of agri- 
culture, which has probably had a very confiderable effect : 
And, with a view of exciting emulation among their plow- 
men, they have begun to have annual plowing matches, at 
which premiums are given to thofe that excel. 

Number of Horfes, cSV.— There are about 360 horfes, 1450 
black cattle, and 150 fheep. Of the black cattle, a confider- 
able number are bought lean, in the Highlands, and fattened 
for the butchers. The price, when bought, from 2 1. 10 s. 
to 5 1. ; when fold, after being fed about a year, from 4 L 
10 s. to 8 1. 

Air Difeafes, c5V.— The air is reckoned very wholefome. 
There are no dileafes peculiar to the parifh. Befides the 
fmall pox and chincough, the moft common are fevers, con- 
fumptions, hyfterics, and diarrhoeas, which, however, are not 
frequent. The fmall-pox is lefs deftrudtive now than for- 
merly, from the more common practice of inoculation. The 
prejudices againft that moft fuccefsful improvement in the 
medical art, though ftill very prevalent, begin to wear off. 

1 here are many inftances of longevity. Within the laft 
year, there died one man in his 95th year, who was able, 
within a few days of his death, to walk in a forenoon above 
a mile to a neighbouring farm, and return ; another man in 
his 89th year ; and a woman in her 91ft : And there is now

tant, and returns the fame day. 

Villages -The only confiderable village is Millguy, which 
contains about 200 inhabitants, who are moftly employed as 
bleachers, printers, and pencillers of cloth. 

Bledchfields.-lCheve are fix bleachfields, of which two are 
for printed cloths only, and one partly. All thefe together 
employ about 220 people. 

Mills.— -There are four oat mills, two barley mills, one 
fnuff mill, and one paper mill. The paper mill employs 
three vats, and about 25 workmen. The kinds of paper 
made are poft, foolfcap, pot, and lappings ; and the quantity 
about 2500 1. worth per annum. 

Coal and Lime Works.— There are two colleries in the pa- 
riOi, one at Knightfwood, and the other at Culloch, which 
have both been wrought beyond the memory of any perfon 
alive.— The coa l at Knightfwood is light and friable, very 
little fulphureous, does not cake, burns quickly, and leaves a 
fmall quantity of white afhes. In digging for this coal, the 
ftrata met with are, blue clay ; blaize ; hard white free-ftone ; 
blaize, mixed with what the workmen call grey-plies, proba- 
bly a fpecies of fchtftus cinereus ; fpungy white free-ftone; 
iron-ftone three inches thick ; blaize, and grey-plies ; then 
the coal three feet four inches thick, with fix inches of ftone 
in the middle. Befides the main coal, there are two thinner 
feams in the ftrata of blaize above, not worth working. The 
main coal lies at various depths, from 18 to 50 fathoms, ac. 
cording to the height of the ground, the dip of the coal, and 

the 



104 



Stati/lical Account 



the interruption of troubles.— The dip is from north-weft to 
fouth-eaft. The price of a cart of coals of i2cwt. at this 
work is 2S. 6 d. •, and about 26,000 carts are fold annually. 
The coal is nearly exhaufted in Knightfwood lands, but it 
extends through thofe in the neighbourhood. This colliery 
employs abouv 60 men and boys, and 20 horfes. 

At Culloch the coal is more heavy, lefs inflammable, and 
confiderably fulphureous. The fmall coal cakes ftrongly ; 
the great leaves a flag, with a great deal of brown afhes. It 
is, however, a good ftrong coal, and, mixed with that of 

■ ightfwood, makes an excellent fire. The ftrata here are 
clay ; blaize, with feveral feams of ironftone through it, 
fome 4 inches thick ; limeftone, from 3 to 41 feet thick j 
then the coal, from 4| to 5 feet thick. The price of the cart 
of 12 cwt. is 2 s. ; and about 13,000 carts are put out in a 
year, a great part of which is ufed in burning the limeftone. 
The depth of the coal is from 13 to 36 fathoms, and the dip 
from north-weft to fouth-eaft. 

At Culloch is alfo the only limework in the parifli. The 
limeftone is wrought after the coal has been taken out from 
below it. It is burnt in draw-kilns, of which two, capable of 
burning each 20 chaklers a-day have been lately erec'ted. 
The lime is of an excellent quality, and is fold at 10 s. per 
chalder of 32 wheat bufliels. About 3000 chaklers are maJe 
annually. At this place the lime and coal works together 
employ about 70 men and 20 horfes, and they are both on 
the increafe. 

Heritors, Valuation, and Rental — The parifli is divided a- 
mong nine greater, and eight fmaller proprietors. Of the 
former, five refide conflantly or occafionally ; all the latter 
conftantly. The valued rent of the whole is 53 1 1 I. 16 s. 2 d. 
Scots, and the real rent may be about 5000 1. Sterling.

fcholars is, at an average, about 40. Befides this there is 
another, attended by an equal number of fcholars, but with- 
out a falary, at the village of Millguy ; and a houfe is now 
building for a third in the north part of the pariih. There 
is alfo one in the borders of Old Kilpatrick for the accom- 
modation of the eaft part of that, and the weft part of this 
parifh, to the fupport of which the feffions of both parifhes 
contribute a finall fum annually. 

Price of Labour, &amp;c— The wages of fervants living in their 
matter's family are, a good plowman, 1 2 1. 3 a common farm- 
fervant, 9I. or iol. ; and a maid-fervant, 3 1. or 4I. a-year. 
Thofe of day-labourers employed conftantly, iod. but more 
generally is.; of day-labourers employed occafionally, 14a. 
in winter, and i8d. infummer; of mafons, from 20 d. to 
2Sl ; and of wrigbts, i8d. to 20 d. The price of labour 
has rifen greatly within thefe four or five years, from the 
great demand for the public works and manufactures carry- 
ing on in this part of the country. 

The price of all kinds of provifions is nearly the fame as in 
Glafgow. 

Poor. — The number of poor on the parifh-roll at the la ft 
general diftribution in December 1791 was 19. Of thefe,

5 receive fupply regularly, from 3 s. to j s. each a month ; 
and, befides this, 5 s. 10 s. or 15 s. at each of two half year- 
ly djftributions ; the reft at thefe general diftributions only, 
or as occafion requires. 

The funds are, the collections at the church on Sundays, 
and other days of public worlhip, the intereft of 115I. in 
bank, and the intereft of 40 I. part of a late donation, on 
bond to the feffion. Thefe funds have been hitherto fuffi- 
cient to fupport all the poor of the parifh in a very compe- 
tent manner, and none of them are allowed to beg. 

There is no way of fnpporting the poor fo eafy, and 
fo little expenfive, as from the collections at church. Af- 
feffinents are attended with more trouble, and are conGder- 
ably more expenfive; for many claim to be admitted on the 
poor's roll when the poor are fupported in this way, who, in 
the fame circumftances* would make greater exertions to 
fupport themfelves before they applied for fupply out of the 
funds provided in the other way. AfielTments, however, 
are certainly the moll equitable method of fupporting the 
poor. When heritors, either from non-refidence or unfre- 
quent- attendance upon public worlhip, contribute nothing,.' 
or do not contribute their juft proportion ; and when, from 
n fpirit of fe&amp;arianifm, many others withdraw from the efta- 
blilhed Church, and alfo contribute nothing, it is often im- 
poffible, and always unfair and unreasonable, that thofe only 
who do attend the church fliould bear the whole burden of 
the poor. 

Population. — The population by DrWebfters table in 1 755 
was 1390. The number of inhabitants, young and old, in 
the year 1788, when an exact lift was taken, was 1664 ; to 
which, from the erection of two of the bleachfields fince

bleachfields and paper mill. That it has not increafed more 
is owing to the conjunction of fmal'l farms, and the deflruc- 
tion of cottages. The number of males is to that of fe- 
males nearly as 10 to 9. The average number of marriages 
for the laft 10 years is 16, of baptifms for the fame time 57, 
and of burials for the laft 9 years 28. The rule given for 
finding the population of a diftrift, by multiplying the births 
h.j 26, or the deaths by 36, feems not to be well founded. 

Canal, 5"c. — The great canal between Forth and Clyde 
paffes through the fouth part of the pariih. It is carried 
over the river Kelvin by a ftately aqueduct bridge, planned by 
Mr Whitworth, and executed by Mr Gibb. The foundation 
of the bridge was laid June 15. 1787, and it was fmiihed in 
June 1790. The length is 350 feet, the breadth 57, of 
which the canal occupies 27 §, and the height, from the fur- 
face of the river to the top of the parapet wall, 57. It itands 
Bpon 4 arches, each 50 feet wide, and 37 high. 

Advantages and Difadvar.tages. — From the preceding ac- 
count, it appears that this pariih enjoys confiderable advan- 
tages : Abundance of coal and lime within idelf, and to be 
had eafiiy from other places too, by means of the canal j its 
vicinity to GlafgOW, diftant only about fix miles from the 
middle of the parifh, where there is a ready market for all 
kinds of product j plenty of ftone for building j and rivers

proper for mills and bleachfields. The principal difadvan- 
tages are, the ftubborn nature of a great part of the foil, and 
the want of good roads. The latter difadvantage, however, 
will foon be in a great meafure removed, two lines of turn- 
pike road being now carrying through the parifh, leading 
from Glafgow, the one to Drymen, and the other to Bal- 
fron. If to thefe were added a good crofs road from eaft to 
weft, there would remain little caufe of complaint on this 
account. The difficulty of procuring dung in fufficient quan- 
tity for the land, is alfo no fmall difadvantage. The farmers 
in the fouth part of the pariftj, indeed, carry it, but at a very 
great expence, from Glafgow, Port- Glafgow, and Greenock ; 
but it will not bear the expence of carriage, added to its 
price, from thefe places to the north part ; fo that the far- 
mers there are confined to the quantity made on their farms, 
which is commonly far from fufficient.

<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE village from which this parifh takes its name was 
formerly called Wolfftruther. This name, according 
to tradition, originated from the number of wolves wuh, 
which the neighbouring grounds abounded. 

Weftruther was formerly a part of the parifh of Gordon ► 
It was firft erected into a feparate parifh about the middle of 
the laft century. Upon the application or the heritors, who 
complained of the diftance of the church of Gordon, a mi- 
nifter was appointed in the year 1647 to a chapel at Baflan- 
dean, in the ibuth fide of the prefept parifh. About two 
years after, for the better accommodation of the north parts 
of the parifh, a church was built at the village of Weftruther, 
where it ftill continues. This chapel belonged Co the nun- 
nery of Coldftream. The walls of it ftill remain, to the 
height of 12 or 14 feet, and inclofe the burying-ground of 
the Homes of Baffandean. 

Extent and Situation.—-Th\s parifh is about five miles long, 
and four miles broad. It lies on the fouth fide of that range 

of 



Statijlical Account 



of hills called Lammermuir, by which it is feparated from Eafi 
Lothian. The London road by Coldftream enters the parifli 
from the north, about the 28th mile ftone from Edinburgh, 
paffes through the fouth-weft fide of it for the fpace of about 
tour miles, and then enters the parifli of Greenlaw.

Villages. — The only villages are thofe of Weftruther, Wed- 
derly, and Hounflow. Weftruther has of late been contider- 
ably increafed by a number of houfes built on feus. Each 
few, along with a houfe and fmall garden, has generally 
two or more acres of land to fupply the family with corn, 
potatoes, &amp;c — The village of Wetherly is much diminifhed 
within thefe thirty years. — Hounflow is entirely a new erec- 
tion. It is fituated on the London road betwixt the 30th 
and 31ft mile ftones from Edinburgh. The firft houic in 
this village was built in the year 1775. It confifts of feus 
granted by Mr Home of BafTandean, and contains upwards 
of 70 fouls. — As the land in this neighbourhood was within 
thefe twenty years covered with barren heath, it is perhaps 
unnecefTary to obferve, that this village has very much iiu- 
proved the appearance of the country around, as well as railed 
the value of the adjacent grounds. — The feuers in thefe two 
villages of Weftruther and Hounflow have each a privilege 
of peats for fuel in the mofles that are next them — The 
climate of this parifh is confiderably colder than the lower 
parts of the country. It is, however, remarkably healthy. 
Perhaps this is, in part, owing to its open and elevated fitua- 
tion. There does not appear to be any difeafe to which the 
people are particularly fubject. Inftances of longevity are

pretty frequent. There is juft now living a woman aged 93 ; 
and, within thefe few years, two men died at the age of 95 
or 96. Several attain to 80 and upwards. It is worthy of 
remark, that three minifters in fucceffion, though each above 
thirty years of age at his admiffion, ferved the cure of this 
parifh from 1647 to 1782, a period of 135 years. 

Soil. — The foil is of various qualities. Perhaps there may 
be one half of the lands in the parifh not capable of being 
cultivated to any advantage by the plough. One part of 
thefe is bog-land, on which grows a kind of coarfe grafs, that 
is fometimes paftured by young cattle j fometimes it is cut for 
hay, and is reckoned excellent winter food for cattle that 
are not of fufficient age to be fed on turnip. Though a 
great part of this land has already been drained at confider- 
able expence; yet, as this is the only fpecies of improvement 
of which it is capable, certainly more ought ftill to be done 
to carry off the water, which, in particular places, continues 
to ftagnate. 

The other part of thefe lands that are not capable of be- 
ing cultivated with advantage by the plough, confifts of 
ground covered with deep mofs, or which, from the height 
of its fituation, even where the foil is tolerably good, is not 
adapted to the railing of corn, and confequently would not 
pay the expence of improvement by lime, which is the only 
manure that has been ufed with effect to any extent for bring- 
ing in heath lands in this corner of the country.. 

The other half of the lands in the parifh may be divided 
into fuch as are already cultivated by the plough, and fuch 
as are capable of being cultivated in this manner. 

The foil of thefe lands is, in fome places, a whitifh cold 
clay, which is by no means favourable to the views of the 
hufbandman. In other places, particularly towards the fouth 

fide 



H2 Statijlkal Account 

fide of the parifh, the foil confifts of a rcddifli earth, on a 
free-ftone bottom. This earth, where it has been long in 
cultivation, and often dunged, has become a rich loam, and 
is excellent for every fpecies of crop that is adapted to the 
climate. Where this reddifh foil is not fo deep and ftrong, 
it is inclined to be fharp and gravelly. This alfo is very fit 
for cropping, and particularly is well fuited to the turnip 
hufbandry, and to the raifing of white and broad clover. 

This and the neighbouring parifhes have been in a pro- 
greffive ftate of improvement ever fince the making of the 
turnpike-roads, by which there is eafier accefs to manure ; 
and the product of the land is carried to market at lefs ex- 
pence. 

The benefit derived from good roads, however, muff, al- 
ways be partial, aad much limited, while the crofs roads con- 
tinue in the miferable condition in which they are to be 
found at prefent not only in this neighbourhood, but alfo in 
many other places of the country. But, as this fubject has 
often of late been under the confideration of the gentlemen, 
it is to be hoped that lome effectual method will foon be 
adopted for correcting an evil that has long been felt and 
complained of. When by this means the intercourfe be- 
tween the different parifhes and the different parts of the 
fame parifh {hall be rendered more eafy and expeditious, 
new vigour will be imparted to that laudable fpirit of im- 
provement which of late years has fo much increafed the in- 
trinfic value of the lands in this county, and roufed the in- 
duftry of the people to exertions highly beneficial to them- 
felves and to the community at large. 

Among the improvements in hufbandry that have been in- 
troduced into this part of the country, none have been at- 
tended with more happy and more cxtenfive effects than the 
raifing of turnips and broad clover. As the turnips, from the

froft, or from their flying up into feed, if the winter be frefh, 
are often rendered in a great meafure ufelefs, long before the 
return of the grafs, fome crop that would anfwer for food to 
the fatting cattle in the fpring, is more wanted here than in 
the lower parts of the country, where the frofts are feldom 
i'o fevere, and where the fpring lets in at a more early period. 

Early oats feem very much adapted to the climate of this 
parifh. ; that fpecies called red oats, in particular, are found to 
fucceed well. — Befide the dung raifed in the different farms, 
the only manure here ufed is lime, which is brought from 
Lothian, at the diftance of 17 or 18 miles. 

Horfes, Black Cattle, and Sheep. — There are in this parifh 
160 horfes, 700 black cattle, and 5000 fheep. Confiderable 
attention is now paid to the improvement of the breed of 
flock of every kind. — The extent of the different farms is 
very various. The higheft may be rented at 260 1. and the 
lowed about 20 L Within thefe 20 years, fome of the farms 
have doubled their rents. — The price of labour through all 
this country is higher, in general, thaft in the Lothians, and 
not fo high as' in Northumberland. A man that is hired 
for the year gets 61. 10 s. 7 1. or 7 guineas, along with his 
victuals. A day-labourer gains is. per day, or 8d. with 
victuals. In hay time and harveft he will gain lod. or is. 
with his victuals.*- The price of female labour is confider- 
ably raifed of late years. This is, in a great meafure, owing 
to an additional number of hands being wanted to carry on 
the operations of hufbandry in its modern improved Hate. 
Many of thefe operations are performed by the women fully 
as well as by the men, fuch as turnip hoeing, &amp;e. A female 
fervant who was hired a few years ago at 30 or 35 s. for the 
fummer half year, will now, when employed in works of 
hufbandry, gain 2 1. 5 s. 2I. 10 s. or 2 1. 15?. for the fa ne

period. The winter wages are much the fame as formerly. 
A woman, when employed by the day in turnip hoeing, gains 
6 d. or 8 d. without victuals.

Church and Poor. — The ftipend was lately augmented, and 
is, by the new decreet, 83 1.6 s. 8 d. Sterling, and 2 1. 10 s. 
for communion elements, befides the glebe. The minifter is 
alfo entitled to fix days cafting of turf on the lands of Mr 
Home of Bafiandean. 

The poor are fupported by the weekly collections, amount- 
ing to 8 1. or to 10I. and an afleflment according to the va- 
lued rent, which is paid in equal proportions by the proprie- 
tors of land and their tenants. The one half of the collec- 
tions is difpofed of by the kirk-feffion for the relief of indi- 
viduals, or families that have accidentally fallen into diftrefs, 
and have not had an opportunity of being received on the 
roll of enlifted poor, or who perhaps wifti for nothing more 
than a little occafional fupply, till the recovery of health, or 
the removal of fome prefent calamity put it again in their 
power to fupport themfelves without being burdenfome to 
the public. 

The money expended yearly in fupport of the enlifted 
poor never exceeded 24 1. Sterling till this prefent year, 
when, from an additional number of poor, it has increafed to 
36 1. This fum is made up by the remaining half of the col- 
leftions, the intereft of 24 1. funk for the benefit of the poor, 
and the afleflment above mentioned. Befides the 24 1. the 
intereft of which goes to the afleflment, there is another fum 
of the fame amount, the intereft of which is difpofed of by 
the fefiion to the relief of occafional poor. 

The higheft allowance this year to a pauper is 3 1. 7 s - 6d r 
the loweft about 1 1. It is always underftood, that, if their 
ncceffities increafe, the kirk-feffion will be ready to give them 

fome 



of Weftrutber, tig 

fome additional fupply. It is eafy, however, from the ftnall- 
nefs of the allowance* to fee that it is only meant as an affif- 
tance. The truth is, the poor ufually live in their own hou- 
fes, or in the houfes of fome of their conneftions, and are 
able, in moft cafes, to do fomethihg for themfelves. 

The affeffment is laid once in the year by the heritors, 
who meet for that purpofe along With the minifter and kirk* 
feffion. This meeting is called by an intimation from the 
pulpit at leaft ten free days before. 

The heritors fome years ago, inftead of giving the whole 
allowance to the poor in money, adopted a plan of giving a 
confiderable proportion of it in oat-meal, which cannot be fo 
readily perverted from the charitable purpofe for which it it 
beftowed.

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

'1 N the old feflion records, the name of this parifh is fome- 
X times written Welfloun, and the tradition of the country 
people is, that it has its name from a copious fpring of ex- 
cellent water in the neighbourhood, called Waljlon-iuell. In 
former times this well was in great repute for its medicinal 
qualities, and much frequented. The water has no uncom- 
mon colour or tafte, but is (till faid to be an excellent reme- 
dy in cutaneous difeafes. 

Soil, Surface, Climate, CSV.- — In the high grounds the foil is 
fhallow and barren, and moftly covered with heath. In the- 
lower grounds, the foil is moftly a black, loam, lying on a 
deep clay, and tolerably fertile ; on the eaft fide, it is a black 
loam lying on gravel. The furface, though uneven, is not 
rocky. The air is exceedingly moift, notwithstanding which 
the people in general are very healthy. Rheumatifm is the 
prevailing difeafe. This is perhaps owing in a- great meafure 
to the following caufes. The houfes in this part of the coun- 
tiyare all exceedingly damp. The windows are, for the

frioft part, glazed, but few of them are made fo as to open: 
And the common people univerfally fleep in clofe timber 
beds. Few of them are fuffciently convinced of the vaft ad. 
vantage of having their bed clothes expofed to the frefh air ; 
or of the danger of fleepihg in a place too much confined. 
Between this parilh and Diirifyre runs a fmall river called the 
Medwin, in which there are a few excellent trout. About 
two miles to the north-eaft of this place, part of the Med- 
win runs off to the Tweed. The reft of it falls into the 
Clyde, about 5 miles fouth-weft from this. Here the Med- 
win is faid to be about 750 feet above the level of the fea; 
and by obfervations made with the barometer, an high hill 
in this neighbourhood, called Walfton Black Mount, appears 
to be nearly 800 feet above the level of the Medwin. 

Population. — This parifh was formerly more populous than 
it is at prefent. From various caufes, many of the parochial 
regifters of marriages, births, and burials, have not been ac- 
curately filled up, and confequently are not much to be truft- 
ed.. In making out the following abftradl: from the feffion 
records of Walfton, thofe periods have been chofen in which

There are three or four perfons about 81 or 82 years of

parifli at prefent 427 perfons, old and young, of which num- 
ber 206 are males, and 221 females. They refide chiefly in 
two fcattered villages. In the parifh there are 140 commu- 
nicants belonging to the eftablifhed Church ; 54 to the Re- 
lief; 32 to the Antiburghers, and 28 to the Burgher meet- 
ing houfe, but no Epifcopalians nor Roman Catholics ; 26 
bachelors, and 69 married men and widowers; 15 handy- 
craftfmen ; about 130 houfehold fervants ; 11 labouring fer- 
vants, or days wage men ; and one ftudent at the univerfity ; 
12 farmers, each having a plough of land; and 16 fmaller 
tenants, each having a piece of ground, one horfe, and iome 
cows. There are 106 inhabited houfes, which gives 4 per- 
fons at an average to each. Large farms, and laying down a 
great deal of corn lands in grafs ; the manufactories in the 
neighbourhood, fuch as cotton mills, iron works, &amp;c. and 
the extenfive buildings carrying on at Edinburgh and 
Glafgow, are great drains for fervants here, and peculiar 
caufes of depopulation. The confequence of this is, that 
fervants are become exceedingly fcarce, and their wages very 
high. To remedy this, it will be neceflary for gentlemen 
and tenants to encourage their fervants to marry, by giving 
them a comfortable houfe, a cow's grafs, &amp;c. 

ProduB\ons i 



cfWalJlon. 119 

Productions, bV—There are few trees in the parilh, 
though alh, plain tree, and various kinds of fir, would thrive 
very well. The parifh lies high, and is expofed to fevere 
blafts of wind; one of the firft improvements, therefore, 
which the proprietors ought to fet about, is to inclofe their 
grounds with ftripes and clumps of planting. A little in this 
way has been done in the neighbourhood, and with great 
fuccefs. What has been done in this parilh has been done 
with no judgment ; and no pains have been bellowed upon 
the plants in their infancy. The great fecrets of planting 
are, to fence well, to plant thick at firft, and to weed or thin 
them judicioufly, as the plants grow up. To plant a hill, 
one mould plant the bafe of it firft, and advance upon the 
hill, as the timber on the lower parts becomes a proper fhel- 
ter for the higher. 

In the parifh there are about 320 black cattle ; 960 Iheep, 
of the black faced kind ; and 90 horfes. It contains about 
3000 Scotch acres of land ; about 2000 are arable, and of 
thefe 450 are employed annually in railing oats, 50 in barley, 
15 in potatoes, and 10 in flax. The other 1475 acr€s °f 
arable, together with about 1000 of heath and marfhy 
ground, are employed in pafture. The average rent of the 
beft arable land is about 25 s. ; and of the inferior, about 
half a crown per acre.- The valued rent of the parilh is 
1233 1. Scots } and the real rent at prefent about 700 1. Sterl. 
The Scotch plough is almoft the only one in ufe. The far- 
mers are only beginning to fow turnip and artificial grafies. 
The parilh annually exports articles of provifion, fuch as but- 
ter, cheefe, fowls, meal, bear, black cattle, and fheep. 

Church, Stipend, &amp; c. — Mr Lockhart of Lee and Carnwath 
is patron of the parifh. The ftipend is 2 chalders of oat- 
meal, 1 chalder of barley, and 33 1. 6 T g 2 d. Sterling money, 

includ- 



1 20 Stati/Iical Account 

including communion elements. The glebe is one of the 
worlt in the country ; and it ought to be obferved, that mi- 
nifters glebes, in general, are of lefs advantage to them than 
many people are apt to imagine, as they oblige them to keep 
more fervants than the produce of them can maintain. To 
remedy this, as much land contiguous to the glebe, as, toge- 
ther with the glebe, would be fufficient work for a man and 
two horfes, fhould always be allotted to the minifter at a mo- 
derate rent. 

Number of Poor, Parochial Funds, cjrY.— The money paid 
to the poor for 40 years paft, amounts, on an average, to 1 8 I. 
Sterling per annutn, as appears by written records. The an. 
nual amount of the funds defined for the relief of the poor, 
arifing from the interefi: of 2000 merks mortified far their 
ufe many years ago, from money received for the ufe of 
mortcloths at burials, from the weekly collections that are 
made in the church, &amp;c. is about 10 1. Sterling. The defi- 
ciency has always been made up by an aflcflment on the heri- 
tors and tenants. At prefent, there is but one poor perfon 
upon the roll. 13ut, upon looking over the poor's roll for 
40 years back, one often meets with 13 or 14 perfons upon 
it. The relief afforded to the poor is always in their own 
cottages. Convinced that begging from door to door is ari 
inlet to numberlefs evils, many people are endeavouring to 
fupprefs it as much as poffible. It may be remarked, that in 
thofe parifhes where an afleflment is laid upon the heritors 
and their tenants to fupply the deficiency of the pariih funds, 
the poor are much lefs fcrupulous in applying for parifh fup- 
port, than in thofe parifhes where they are fupplied by the 
feffion folely from the parifh funds. Where this hit is the 
cafe, the poor are lefs importunate, and more backward io 
3pply for parifh fupport, and more thankful when they re- 
ceive.

ceive it. The cheapen- way, therefore, and the bed way for 
the morals of the people, to fupply the poor, where it can be 
done, is to do it by the kirk-feflion. The elders know the 
circumftances of every individual in the parifh, prevent impo- 
fition, and often difcover modeft merit in want. This conli- 
deration fhould engage every perfon to be as liberal as his 
circumftances will admit in contributing towards the parifh 
funds. Sectaries of every denomination receive fupply when 
they need it from the parifh funds ; but, though they give 
fome occafional fupply to indigent perions, it is but a fmall 
proportion of the weekly collections that are made in their 
churches which is employed for the maintenance of the poor. 
This has a great tendency to diminifh parifh funds, and to 
bring on puor's rates upon parilLes. To prevent lo great an 
evil as the poor's rates, or an affejlkieat for poor's money, 
the non-rciiding heritors alfo fhould look upon themfelves as 
in juftice bound to make an annual donation to the poor's 
funds of thofe parifhes where they have any property. 

Wages s Price of Proviftons, CSV. — The wages of a man-fer- 
vant, when maintained in the family, 40 years ago, were 
about 3 1. Sterling, 'now from 5 1. to 7 1. ; of a woman-fcr- 
vant, 2 1. now 3 1. per annum ; of a day-labourer who recei- 
ved no victuals, 8 d. per day, now 1 s. The wag.s which 
the common labourer receives, together with his wife's in- 
duitry, enable him not Only to bring up a family, but alfo to 
give them education. They are all taught tore-id and wriu*, 
and many of them to keep accounts. Few of the::;, how. 
ever, are able to provide for ficknefs or old age. Before 
marriage, they generally expend the molt part of their wages 
in purchaling tine clothes. This leaves them but little to 
furmfh their houle, and begin the world.

Ant'iqmt'tes^ fsV.— There are on a high rifing ground fa 
the fouth part of the parifli, traces of what the common 
people call a Roman camp. It confifts of the remains of two 
concentric circular earthen dykes, or mounds. The inner- 
moft is about 67 yards in diameter. Between the innermoft 
and the outermcft is a fpace of about 15 feet. There were 
through the whole of this and the neighbouring parifhes a 
great number of vaults with ftrong doors. Some of them, if 
not the whole, had an appartment immediately above them 
with a turnpike-ftair leading to it. A few of them ftill re- 
main. Vulgar report fays, that the u(e of them was to keep 
their cattle from the Annandale thieves or freebooters. May 
not this fuggeft the origin of many of thofe circular dykes, 
the remains of which are called by the common people Ro- 
man camps ? Freebooting in former times, under certain 
circumftances, was by no means a difgraceful employment. 
This rendered every precaution to preferve their property, 
efpecially their cattle, highly necefTary. 

Char abler of the People.— The people, in general, are active 
and induftrious, efpecially in feed-time and harveft. They 
know, that, if thefe works were not carried on with uncom- 
mon activity, they would lofe the feafon of them, fo variable 
and uncertain is the weather hereabout ; and in thofe times 
of urgent necefiity, but efpecially in harveft, they are peculi- 
arly attentive to that apoftolic direction, " Look not every 
man on his own things, but every man alfo on the things of 
others," in its beft fenfe. For, no fooner is any one's har. 
veft finiflied, than his fhearers are immediately difperfed 
among all thofe in his neighbourhood who have any corn to. 
cut down. They are fober and oeconomical. 



Advantages and Dij advantages. — The greateft part of the

tommon people enjoy the comforts of fociety in a moderate 
degree; but they have no peculiar advantages. One great dif- 
advantage to which this parifh, in common with the whole of 
this high country, isexpofed* is, that the corns on their lower 
grounds, efpecially in the neighbourhood of rivers, mofies, 
and marfhes, are very liable to be deftroyed by fro/Is in the 
night-time about the end of Auguft, and beginning of Sep- 
tember. One of thofe beautiful, calm, ferene evenings, 
which draws numbers of the people in towns into the ftreets 
and the fields* fills the farmer here with anxiety j and deprives 
him of his fleep. He knows it is highly probable, that, when 
he rifes in the morning, he may fee the hope of his harveft 
gone. The froft in September laft deftroyed many hundred 
bolls of corn in this country. Seldom does one year pafs 
without lofs in this way, lefs or more. But the years 1782 
and 1784 were peculiarly diftreffing to this part of the coun- 
try. Their corns were fo effectually deftroyed by the froft, 
that, out of 40 bolls fowing, fome of the farmers had not 20 
bolls of meal ; nor durft they venture to fow a peck of them 
the following feafon. They were therefore obliged to pur- 
chafe, at a great diftance, the whole of their feed-corn. The 
little meal which the frofted corn of thofe years produced was 
as black as earth ; and the porridge made of fome of it, after 
ftanding a fhort time, ran partly to water. Their potatoes 
alfo, which are now become a confiderable part of the people's 
food, were entirely deftroyed. No remarkable ficknefs, how- 
ever, followed. So great were the ftraits and hardfhips to 
which the people were reduced by thofe calamitous years^ 
that they contracted a dull and melancholy look, which con- 
tinued for feveral years after. Till the winter 1788, even 
the curling-ftone lay neglected. In thofe years, many more 
than ufual received fupply from the parifh funds ; and the 
late Count Lockhart of Lee and Carnwath, in the year 1782^ 
remitted to the moft of his tenants one third of their rent.

NUMBER IX. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">GLENSHEIL</name> 

(County of Rofs.—Prefbytery of Lochcarron.— Synod of 

Glenelg.) 

By the Reverend Mr John Macrae.</head>



<p>Origin of the Name, Situation, and Extent. 

GLENSHEIL, which is only a diftrid of the parifli of 
that name, is iituated between the forefts of Seaforth, 
the proprietor, and Glengarry, and Ihould, it is laid, be called 
Glan-fhelig, or valley of hunting. 

The higher part of the parilh confifts of two narrow glens 
or valleys, extending between two or three computed miles 
from the head of the well known arm of the fea called Loch- 
Duich, and at the medium diftance of one computed mile 
and a half from each other ; but the grazings occupied by 
the inhabitants of thefe glens extend to the diftance of eight 
computed miles more in the fame direction of louth-eaft, by 
between three and four computed miles broad. 

The lower part of the parifh, called Letlerfern, runs in the 
direction of north-weft along Loch-Duich, on the fouth, the 
diftance of fix computed miles, and riles from the fea, by a 
pretty rapid afcent, to the medium dillance of one computed 
mUe and a half ; fo that the parilh is lixteen miles long, by 
between one and a half and four broad. 

Face 



of Clenjheil. 12$ 

Face of the Counhy—The two valleys in the height of the 
narifh are furrounded on each fide by mountains which rife 
alraoft by a perpendicular afcent to a prodigious height. The 
farther they retire from the lea, their elevation feems to de- 
creafe, or rather appears lefs linking. In many places, thefe 
mountains are rocky, and covered with heath and bent to the 
very fummits; but the interjacent valleys are not unpleafant, 
being covered with fine and coarfe grafs, and fome wood ; 
but the proportion of arable ground is very inconfiderable. 
The lower part of the parifh is all covered with green, and 
intermixed with heath and bent. Here the proportion of 
arable ground is fomewhat greater. 

Number of Farms, Management, and mode of Cultivaticti.— 
In the parifh are 17 farms, each of which, with the excep- 
tion of two, is occupied by a number of tenants ; fo that each 
farm forms a village. The tenants graze their cattle promil- 
cuoufiy, each reftriaing himfelf to a number of heads, pro- 
portioned to his rent ; and the arable ground they occupy in 
like manner. 

It does not always happen that the farm is equally divided 
among the occupiers ; and, when one man's divifion is not 
large enough to enable him to keep as many horfes (which is 
always four, and they never ufe oxen) as are fufhcient to draw 
the plough, two or more of them join. 

In fome places, particularly along the coafr, the arable 
ground is fo fteep, and frequently fo fmall in extent, that ei- 
ther the horfes cannot Hand firm, or have not room enough 
to turn upon it with the draught; in which cafe, the ground 
is turned by a machine, called the crooked fpade, in a man's 
hand. 

The old Scotch plough, and no other, is ufed. The horfes 
go all a-breaft ; that is, the four horfes are tied by the hal- 
ters 



126 



Statiftical Account 



ters to one flick at equal diftances, which flick the driver 
holds forcibly in both hands, while he himfelf walks general- 
ly backwards, direclly before the horfes. 

Where the ground is fteep, the mode of plowing is ex- 
tremely tedious, being performed by what is called the ftde- 
furroiv : that is, where the horfes cannot carry the draught 
direclly againft the afcent, they go along-fide the brae in an 
oblique direction, plowing down the ground all towards one 
fide ; and, in returning back, the plough cuts no ground, 
but is carried empty* 

Soil, Climate, and Dlfeafes. — The foil is various. That in 
the height of the parifh is thin, ftony, and barren. Along 
the coaft, though the foil is thin and light, it is not quite fo 
unfertile ; it is in general gravellifh, or confifts of a black 
light earth. 

All the weft coaft, but particularly Kintail, is fubjeft almoft 
to inceffant rains and ftorms throughout the year. The only 
dry weather to be looked for is from the middle or latter end 
of May to the middle of September, when the rains general- 
ly fet in. The fnow is feldom of long duration on the fea- 
coaft, and here the froft is not felt fo keen as in inland coun- 
tries. 

The difeafes raoft prevalent among the inhabitants of this 
place are rheumatifms, fciatics, and ruptures. They are daily 
expofed to damps and rains, which are believed to be the 
caufe of the two former ; and the latter is attributed to the 
heavy weights which the men are in ufe of raifing on their 
breafts when they back-load their horfes ; for, owing to the 
roughuefs of the country, and there being no roads, no 
waggon or cart can be ufed for any diftance. 

There are many inftances of longevity. There are now 
living in the parifh three men and a woman who exceed 80, 

and 



of Glenjheil. 127 

and, within the laft ten years, three men died, two of whom 
were above 90, and one above 80. All the inhabitants, rich 
and poor, inoculate for the fmall-pox •, fo that the ravages 
formerly' made by that dreadful plague are not now much 
felt. 

. Loch-Duich and Shores.— Herrings pay annual vifits to Loch- 
Duich. They generally make their appearance about the 
middle of Auguft, and fometimes fooner. Their ftay is often 
fhort, particularly of late years ; but, during fome feafons, 
they appear in fuch immenfe ilioals, and continue fo long, 
that, in the courfe of a few weeks, many veflels fifh full 
cargoes. It is obferved, that, for the laft fix years, the her- 
rings of this and the neighbouring lochs are much diminifh- 
ed in fize, in fo much that the nets with which they were 
taken before that period, are now found to be by far too wide 
for the purpofe. 

In Loch-Duich are alfo found haddocks, cod, ling, fkate, 
cuddie, flounder, &amp;c. with almoft all the variety of filh (but 
not in fuch quantities) that appear any where on the weft 
coaft. 

The fhell-fifh on the fhores of Loch-Duich are mufcles, 
wilks, cockle, limpets, fpout fifh, clam (hells, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Of the fea-weed growing on its Ihores, the proprietor al- 
lows the feveral contiguous farms what is amply fufficient for 
the purpofe of manuring the land. The overplus, which is 
manufactured into kelp for his own ufe, does not, on an ave- 
rage, exceed ten tons yearly. 

Seed-time, Harvejl, and Produce. — The only grain raifed in 
the parifli are fmall oats and bear, and potatoes the only 
roots. The oats are begun to be fown about the middle of 
March, barley and potatoes about the 20th of April ; and 

the 



128 



Statijlical Account 



the fowing is feldom over before the end of May , and ; n 
fome feafons, the harveft is not in before the end of October 
This country is but little adapted for the purpofes of agri- 
culture ; there are fome farms which will not raife as much 
corn as will be fuflicient for the confumption of the occupi* 
ers for one fourth of the year. The height of the parifc is 
believed to be much calculated for rearing fheep ; and, in 
the year i 7 86, triple rent was offered for that diftridt by 
iheep-farmers, (it being then out of leale), which the pro- 
prietor abfolutely refilled, declaring, that he would never 
prefer fieep to men, at the fame time that he fet the lands to 
the old inhabitants (who are not over fond of Iheep) on their 
paying a pretty moderate augmentation. 

The ftaple production of the parim is black cattle. Thefe 
are not large, but hardy, and uncommonly elegant in fhapc. 
The price of a full grown cow is from 3 1. to 5 1. They are 
generally bought at Whitfunday and Michaelmas, by perfons 
from Ayr and Perth fhires, who fell them to the Englifh 
drovers. The horfes are, like the black cattle, of fmall fi ze , 
but ftrong and well formed, and generally fell at between 4 I 
and 6 L. 

All the fheep are of the fmall kind. Their flefh is fweet 
and delicate, and their wool middling fine. A fhcep and 
lamb, with year old fleece, will fetch in May from between 
5 s to 6 s. 

Goats are reared in the height of the parifh. Their Heft 
and milk are believed to be of a medicinal quality, and to 
contribute not a little to prevent and remove many com- 
plaints, particularly thole of a confumptive kind. The price 
of a goat is from 5 s. to 7 s. 



Characler. — The inhabitants of this and of the neighbour, 
ing parilh of Kintail confi.il: principally of two tribes or I co- 
ordinate 



cf ClcnjlmL 129 

ordinate clans, the Macraes (or Mackraws) and Maclennans, 
of which the Macraes are by far the moft numerous. Thefe, 
except the name only, are united by every tie of conneaion^ 
yet it is not unufual to fee them under the influence of thofe 
paflions which mutual jealoufy and clanifh animofity infpire. 
It is feldom, however, they fail to unite againft any third 
party, whom they believe or imagine to have a defign of in- 
vading the rights of either. 

The Macraes and Maclennans have been long diftinguifhed 
for a deep-rooted attachment to the family of Seaforth, who 
have been for many centuries proprietors of this country. 
One inftance of this attachment may ferve as a fpecimen. 

Owing to the fide which William Earl of Seaforth efpoufed 
during the troubles of 17 15 and 17 19, memorable in this 
place for the battles of Sherrihrmuir and Glenfheil, his lands 
of Kintail (a name then common to this and the parifh of 
that name) had forfeited to the Crown ; yet* during all the 
years of the forfeiture, it baffled all the endeavours and policy 
of Government to penetrate into the country, or to collect 
any rents in Kintail ; and all the attempts made to effect that 
purpofe by his Majefty's troops were defeated with difgrace, 
and not without proving fatal to fome of thofe who were rafh 
enough to undertake the enterprife. Seaforth's tenants were* 
on that occafion, affified by the advice, and animated by the 
example of Donald Murchifon, whofe name, had his talents 
been employed on a more confpicuous theatre, the page of 
hiftory would not blufh to tranfmk with honour to pofte" 
rity. He regularly collected the rents, and found means 
either of remitting them to Seaforth, who then lived in 
France, or of matching an opportunity of conveying them 
fafe to his Lord in perfon. 

The inhabitants of this parifh are a frugal people, plain, 
open, and fincerc 3 and, if furpalfed in the virtue of induftry

The fwarm of fturdy beggars with which this country is 
infefted is confidered as no fmail dlfa'dvantage. They confift 
chiefly of ftout able women, who, rather than engage in fer- 
vice, are content to go about from houfe to houfe ; but there 
5s every reafon to believe, the introduction of manufaaures 
would effectually relieve the public of this burden. 

The number of real poor on the parifh roll is 2 1 . There 
is no other fund for their fupport but the weekly colledtions, 
which, one year with another, may amount to between 5 1. 
and 61. Such of them as are not able to travel about for 
alms, employ fome near conneaion in that way. 

Church, CsV.— The living, including the glebe, is about 
60 1. The King is patron. The grois refit of the panfh 
'does not exceed 600 1. There is a parochial fchool, with 
200 merks Scots falary. The matter, befides quarter pay- 
ments from his fcholars, receives 1 s. for each marriage, and 
a confideration from the feflion funds for precenting. 

There are only two houfes in the parifh where whilky is 
retailed. One of thefe is a ftage-houfe on the road from Fort 
Auguftus to Bernera, called Sheil Inn. intemperance is not 
a prevalent vice in this place. The only feafon of the year 
in which excefs in drinking, as if by general confent, is 
reckoned allowable, is Martinmas, when the faaor difcharges 
them for their rents. Then the proprietor's health is re- 
peatedly drunk in copious bumpers. 

Population — The number of people in 1755 was 509.— 
There is good reafon to believe that the population of the 
parifh has increafed during the la ft 18 years. In 1769 and 
1772, a number of fubftantial farmers emigrated to North 

Carolina 



* 3 2 Statijlical Account 

Carolina wirh their families and many of their connexions, 
which not only at the time, but for fome years after, very 
ienfibly djroinifhed the number of inhabitants ; and, by \ 
particular enumeration made in the year 1781, the number 
or fouls were 15a lefs than they are at prefent, being now 
721. The number of births is yearly from 17 to 22 ; of 
marriages, from 3 to 6; and of burials, from 8 to 12. 

Battles.— In a narrow pafs in the height of the parift was 
fought in 1719 the battle of Glenfheil, between fome Englilh 
troops and 300 (fome fay 400) Spaniards. Thefe were joined 
by fome Highlanders who favoured the caufc of the Pretender, 
and who were headed by the Earl of Seaforth. The Earl wal 
carried off by his tenants from the field, dangeroufly wound- 
ed ; and, foon after, his followers gave way, leaving the 
Englifh mafters of the field of battle. Their viclory, how- 
ever, coft them pretty dear, having loft their commander. 
The Spaniards, who were fufpefted by the Highlanders of 
not being hearty in the caufe, furrendered prifoners at dis- 
cretion*

<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifh of Stow, in the fouth diftrift of Mid-Lothi- 
an, takes in part of the N. N. W. of Selkirkshire. 
Its extent from Nettleflat, the mod northerly farm-houfe, 
(where Galawater takes its rife), to Corflie, the county boun- 
dary, and from thence to Caddonlie, on the banks of Tweed, 
is 15 miles. Its medium breadth 5 miles, making 75 fquarc

and every way rendered decent and commodious.

improvement of agriculture, no manufactures being yet efta- 
bWhed. The people, in general, are healthy and robuft, 
fubject to few difeafes. The greateft part of thefe arife from 
Want of cleanlinefs and foul feeding, fuch as difeafed iheep 
and fifh that come up at fpawning time. Epidemical dheafes 
have feldom proved fatal , but, of late years, there have been 
more confumptions and nervous complaints than formerly 
This is perhaps to be attributed to the immoderate ule of 
fpintuous liquors, and the introduction of tea of the worft 
quality, drunk too hot, which may produce the moft fatal 
effects on the nervous fyftem. 

Gala-water was formerly famed for great plenty of excel- 
lent trouts. Thefe in number are greatly decreafed face the 
introduction of lime as a manure. 

Face of the Country, feV.-The country is hilly. Towards 
the water fides it is moftly covered with a fhort green fward • 
towards the higher grounds, heath, bent, and ling, generally 
prevail, which laft proves a good feed for fheep in fpring. 
On the fides of the many burns that fall into Gala and 

Tweed, 



of Stotf. 13! 

Tweed, there grows the richeft and moft delicate grafs, in- 
terlperi'ed with'a variety of plants and flowers. 
' This country is well adapted for pafture of fheep and 
goats. Theft laft are now entirely given up, in confequence 
of the increafed growth of corn. Upon a general furvey, 
it wrould appear that the tops of the hills near the water 
fides were the only fpots cultivated by the plough, while the 
lower ground was covered with trees, chiefly alder and birch. 
When they began to clear the ground, no medium was ob- 
ferved ; not a tree left for building, or country ufe, all of 
which rauft be brought from a diftance. Of late, fome of the 
proprietors have begun to plant and it is to be hoped, in a 
few years the country will aflume a different appearance. 

Improvements.— Anno 1754, the turnpike roads from Edin- 
burgh to Selkirk were made. This produced a total change 
in the fyftem of farming. No lime had been brought to this 
country but for building, and on horfe-back. The expence 
of this mode of carriage prevented the ufe of lime as a ma- 
nure. A carriage-road being now opened to Middleton lime- 
kilns, the farmers, who before had only ufed fledges and 
tumbler carts to lead in their corn and earth-elding, (the 
winning and leading of which was the whole fummer work of 
their fervants and horfes), to improve this advantage, now were 
induced to increafe the number of their horfes, and change 
the conftruclion of their carts, to lead coals inftead of peats, 
and lime for their land. The old lees, and hitherto unculti- 
vated heath-land, were now broken up, and produced great 
crops, as is always the cafe with new land. But, as lime 
was a new and more expenfive manure, the farmers in gene- 
ral refolved to make the moft of it by repeated crops^ not 
confidering the fatal confequences of fcourging the limed foil, 
or the advantage of laying down their land in good condition

for grafs. Would the farmers confult their own interefti 
and, after lime, fow their lands with grafs the fecond or third 
crop, the hay and pafture would more than compenfate 
them, befides leaving the land in good heart for after crops ; 
but men feldom forego a prefent profit for future gain. 

Sheep — Nature feems chiefly to have defigned this part of 
the country for fheep pafture. The fheep in the higher 
parts of the parifh feem originally to have been of the black- 
faced kind, fhort legged ; and, from the nature of the foil, 
which is dry and light, they are hardy, and known by the gra- 
ziers to be healthy and good feeders. The wool is coarfe, and 
was formerly fold to the Galafhiels clothiers for the purpofe of 
making gray cloth of that name, at from 2 s. 6 d. to 4 s. per 
ftone. The fheep in the lower grounds are a crofs breed 
between the black and the white faced, by which means, to- 
gether with a finer pafture in the low lands, the quality of 
wool is finer, and the price from 7s. to 10 s. per ftone; and, 
from the late advance in that article, 11 s. and 12 s. This, 
perhaps, may alfo be owing, in a great meafure, to the quan- 
tity of artificial grafs fown. It is a certain faft, that where 
moft of this is, the fheep are not only improved in quantity 
and quality of wool, but in the value of carcafe — One thing 
further is greatly in favour of any improvement by fown 
grafs. The farmer will not be obliged, as often formerly, to 
drive his fheep to lower ground, at a diftance from home, 
for food, in a hard winter, having plenty of fowri-grafs hay, 
to fupply the fheep when they can get no food from the 
ground. The increafe of turnips will alfo be of great advan- 
tage in this refpecl. 

Number of Sheep. — Though ftoremafters do not, in gene- 
ral, wifh to fay how many they hold, according to the beft 

information, 



of St ou). 137, 

Information, which I believe is not above the truth, there 
are in the parifh 1062 fcores, or 21,240 Iheep. 

Inclofures. — Of late years many inclofures have been made, 
and all who either pofiefs land in property, or hold it in 
tack, are fcnfiblc of the advantage arifirtg from them ; but the 
farmers think 7§ per cent, too high a premium for dry ^one- 
dykes, which they muft keep in repair. — The culture of 
turnips has of late years rapidly increafed, in fo much that 
there is hardly one who pofTefTes 3 or 4 acres who does not 
apply fome of it in that way. Young cattle are reared with 
the (haws ; and the increafed quantity of dung is by fome 
thought adequate to the price of labour, and the land put hi 
high order for barley and grafs.

being exceedingly warm and dry, there was a great ftorm of 
thunder, with hail and rain. At Wedderlaw, a hill in Over-

in conference of the thunder ; he immediately fent his dog 
to drive them oft'. By this means the greateft part were 
feved, though fome went with the break, which was carried 
down to Gala, and a great quantity of the mofs as far as 
Galaihiels, which is reported to have ferved the poor people 
in that village for peats the following winter. 

Poor.— The firft afleffment was in October 1764, of 14 1. 
per annum, allotted according to the valued rent, paid in equal 
proportions by the heritors and tenants. Thefe laft have 
been invited to attend the meetings forth at buGnefs. The 
kirk-feffion fupplies 5 1. from the mort-cloth money, &amp; c . 
From anno 1782-83, by reafon of the great dearth at that 
time, it was raifed to 30 1. for the half year. After this, 
it was again reduced to 24 1. per half year, at which it ftill 
continues. The number of poor on the roll is between 25 
and 30, befides occalional allowances. 

ManufaElures. — Anno 1778, Robert Boyd clothier came 
to Stow. Before that time, nothing had been done in the 
clothing way. The manufacture has inci eafed ; and this laft 
year he has made and carried to market, on his own behoof, 
cloth to the value of 180I. Sterling, befides country work. 
As Stow is fituated in an wool country, having plenty of 
water, near to coals, and the Edinburgh market, it is to be 
hoped the trade will fucceed. Before this period, the only 
manufacture was what is called Stow ftruntain, made of the 
coarfeft wool, and wrought by the women on a loom like a 
bed-heck. Price of working one grols, or 144 yards, per

<p>Soil and Climate. 

THE parifh of Port, in the northern part, is rocky and 
mountainous, and moftly covered with heath, there 
being only fome narrow fkirts and hollows capable of culti- 
vation. The fouthern parts are more level, and confitr. of 
mofs, meadow, dry-field, and carfe. The moi's is very ex- 
tenfive, and affords plenty of fuel, which is, however, ob- 
tained with confiderable trouble and expence. The foil, 
which is various, produces moderate crops of beans, peafe, 
oats, barley, clover, and turnip. The two lalt are much 
more cultivated than formerly. Potatoes are railed in great 
abundance, and are the chief fubfiftence of the poorer tort 
of inhabitants for fix or eight months in the year. 

The climate is reckoned wholeibme. The people, in ge- 
neral, are fober and induftrious. Many have been long- 
lived ; and, within thefe few years, one man died at the age 
of 92, and a man and a woman aged 96. 

Trades. — Moft of the adults are employed in agriculture, 
excepting a few weavers, t3ylors., ilioemakers, blackimiths,

and Wrights, fiationed in different places for the accommo- 
dation of the neighbourhood. 

W iters.— There are, on the north-eaft corner of the parifh, 
three mineral fprings clofe by each other, all of different 
qualities; one emetic, another cathartic; and the third is 
ufed for warning cutaneous eruptions on the body. But the 
refpe&amp;ive nature of thefe waters has not as yet been properly 
analyfed.— The Loch of Monteith is the moft remarkable 
fheet of water, being nearly in the center of the parifh, ad- 
joining the kirk and manfe. It is adorned with two fmall 
iflands and a peninfula. It is about five miles round. Loch 
Vennochar, on the north, is the boundary betwixt this parifh 
and Callander. There are fome other fmaller lochs, one of 
which forms a beautiful round bafon, about half a mile in 
circumference, on the top of our higheft ridge of moun- 
tains. — The Loch of Monteith abounds with perch, pike, 
and eel, and affords fome large trout. The Forth, till of 
late, afforded fome fport for falmon on the border of this 
parifh. But now they feem to be in a good meafure banifhed 
from this neighbourhood, by conveying down the river fuch 
quantities of mofs, for the purpofe of acquiring the fine clay 
foil which is below it. 

Population. — The inhabitants of the parifh, in 1755, a. 
mounted to 1865. It is believed, that, for fome time, they 
have been on the decreafe, owing partly to the junction of 
farms, and chiefly to the emigration of cottagers and their 
families to great towns, and to the cotton manufactures. 

Farms and Valuation. — A considerable proportion of the 
parifh is now inclofed. The farms, in general, are not large. 
The rents ar e v arious, from lool. to iol. Sterling. — There

upwards of 20 heritors, befides a number of fmall feuers. 
The only principal heritors at prefent refiding are Mr Er- 
fkine of Cardrofs, the patron of the parilh, and Mr Graham 
ofGartmore. mi 
The valued rent of the whole is 5471 L Scots. The real 
rent it would be difficult, with any degree of accuracy, to 
inveftigate. 

Poor.— The number of poor on the feffion lifts is com- 
monly from %% to 40. They are fupported partly by the 
weekly collections at church ; by the dues paid on the pro- 
clamation of banns, and for the ufe of the mort- cloth ; by 
the annual produce of fome money laid out at intereft j and 
partly by the private charities of their neighbours of different 
ranks, who are in general well inclined, according to their 
ability, to affift and relieve the indigent and diftrefled. 

ProduBions.—lt is undoubted, that this parifh raifes more 
grain than is confumed by the inhabitants, a great many bolls 
of oat-meal being yearly exported to Glafgow, Dumbarton, 
and to the Highlands. The greater part of the barley is 
converted into whifky by the licenfed difUllers. Confider- 
able quantities alfo of butter and cheefe are fent to market in 
the great towns.

{County of Lanark.— Prejbytery of Hamilton.— Synod of 
Glafgow and Jyr.) 

By the Reverend Mr Hugh Mitchell.</head>



<p>Extent and Soil. 

HPHE parifli of Glasford is near eight miles in length. 

its breadth is exceedingly unequal ; though, at an ave- 
rage, it may be two miles — Its foil, like its figure, is unequal. 
In fome parrs it is a light loam, in others a ftrong clay ; but, 
in many parts, it is mofly and barren. The light loamy foil 
is remarkably ftony. Experience, however, and obfervation, 
have mown, that to this kind of foil, ftones anfwer many 
- aluable purpofes. They fhelter the young ftalk from mil, 
dew and ftorms ; they prevent the crop from being burnt up 
by fcorching heats; they intercept the evaporation of the 
enriching juices ; and, by thefe means, greatly affift the pro- 
grefs of vegetation. 

An heritor, who occupies his own land, hoping to improve 
the foil by carrying away the ftones, made the experiment 
upon one of his inclofures. The land obftinately refufed to 
yield him its ufual crop. Difcovering his error, he reftored 
what he had unjuftly taken away. 

Not many parifhes are better fupplied with fuel. The eaft 
and north-eaft extremities lie contiguous to excellent collie.

The Ipirit of improving land has not yet reached this pa- 
ri(h There is in it only one man who deferves the name of 
a farmer. To improve land requires both induftry and Ikill. 
Few of the farmers here have a moderate portion of either, 
d many are defeftive in both. Though the land on the 
aft of the parifh lies in the vicinity of lime and coal, and is 
capable of vaft improvement, it is neverthelefs in much the 
fame ftate in which it was 20 years ago. Potatoes, turnips, 
and cabbages, for the ufe of cattle, may be raifed in great ' 
perfection. Few, however, are planted but for culinary pur- 
pofes. The faft is, that the greater part of the farmers are 
proprietors, who occupy their own land. The value of their 
property, taken feverally, may be from 30 1. to 120L a year. 
They read no books on agriculture*; nor do they feek the 
company of thofe who might infpire them with a tafte for 
improvement. They feem to be contented with what they 
have, rather than ambitious of more. Though they are not 
kind to the foil, their attachment to it is ftrong ; and the 
fpot where they firft drew breath is held facred. 

The eaftern part of the parifh is inclofed with hedge and 
ditch. Thorn-hedges, however, on the marfhy and light 
loam foil, have been found not to fucceed here ; nor can 
they be kept up but at great expence. For the firft three 
years they do well enough ; but, if afterwards they are not 
once a year cleared of mofs, within the courfe of ten years 
they become completely incrufted with that noxious vege- 
table. To take off the mofs without hurting the tree, re- 
quires both Ikill and patience ; and therefore this expedient 
is feldom tried. Another, Id's laborious, has been attempted.

Some farmers, expecting a new crop of moots, have cut down 
the difeafed hedge till within a foot of the ground. The 
remedy has been worfe than the difeafe ; the external air 
being in great meafure, and the nourifliing dews altogether 
excluded by the thick coat of mofs ; and the perforation 
being greatly obftructed, the tree decays, and fickens, and 
dies. Trees of every defcription in the parifh foon gather 
mofs. Hence apple, pear, and other fruit-trees of the larger 
kind do not thrive ; and the fruit of fuch as arrive at matu- 
rity is greatly inferior, both in richnefs and in flavour, to the 
fruit on the Clyde. 

The women in this parifli pofiefs a Angular dexterity in 
rearing calves ; and the richeft veal in the Edinburgh mar- 
ket, it is believed, comes from Glasford or Avendale. 

Population.— In 1755, tne numbers were 559. At the 
beginning of this year, (1792) there were in the parifh 788 
fouls. Its population has greatly increafed within thefe 20 
years. The increafe, however, is owing not to the farming, but 
to the manufacturing part of the community. There are in 
it three fmall, but thriving villages. One of them, which, in 
the year 1771, confifted only of 14 houfes, and 63 inhabi- 
tants, now contains 44 houfes, and 196 inhabitants. In this 
village there are 36 looms; 12 employed in the cotton, and 
the others in the linen manufacture. The flourifhing ftate 
of thefe manufactures has contributed to enhance the price 
of labour of every kind. The day-labourer has raifed his 
wages one penny a day. Taylors, within the courfe of laft 
twelvemonth, have raifed their wages from 8 d. to 1 s. a day. 
Mechanics have enhanced the price of their workmanfhip in 
proportion. 



Church, School and Poor, — The prefent value of the bene- 
fice 



of Glasford, 145 

fice is 36 1. Ss. 10 d. in money, 74 bolls 14 pecks in oat- 
meal a manfe, and a glebe of near fix acres. The Earl of 
Eglintoune is patron, the prefent rent of his Lordlhip's 
property in the parilh is 292 1- out of which the clergyman 
is paid 1 1. 5 s. 3 d. in money, and 36 pecks in visual. 
Another heritor, whofe rent is fcarcely 61. pays 5 s. in mo- 
ney, and 20 pecks in victual. To them who underftand the 
doctrine of teinds, this difproportion, vaft as it is, may not 
feem extraordinary. It ferves, however, (a wag might fay), 
to fhow how much Lords are obliged to the church, and 
how little the church is obliged to them. There are 41 heri- 
tors, 8 of whom do not refide in the parifh. The whole 
valued rent is 2654 L 4*. 2d. Scots. The real rent can- 
not be lefs than 1900I. Sterling. 

The church was built in 1633. It never was elegant nor 
convenient. Its prefent uncouth appearance fixes the atten- 
tion of every beholder ; and fcarce a ftranger paffes by with- 
out making it a compliment. It is riot in good repair. The 
heritors, unlike the ancient Jews, love not to decorate the 
temple ; though it Would be doing them injuftice not to ob- 
ferve, that they love to attend it. 

Matters have been fo managed here, that the manfe is 
like the church. Though repaired five years ago, the manfe 
needs again to be repaired. It is damp in the extreme. 
After a thaw or a fmart mower of rain, the infide walls and 
timber exhibit a fcene wonderfully ftriking. The pearly 
drops meet the eye from every point of view ; fo that, amid 
the rigours of winter, its inhabitants enjoy fome of the plea- 
sures of a May morning. The fituation of the manfe ac- 
counts for this. It lies in a fwamp, the inconvenience of 
v.'hich the prefent clergyman has, in fome degree, remedied 
by fivers , as they are here called, and by other methods of

draining the water. The fite feems to have been chofen In 
turbulent times; for, except a narrow neck of land that leads 
to the church, and a little garden, now pretty well drained, 
the manfe and offices are completely furrounded with a 
morafs. It is therefore not difficult to conceive, that, if ne- 
ceffiiry, the manfe might, at fmall expence, be made a place 
of confiderable ftrength. 

The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 merks. He has a teach- 
ing-room and a dwelling-houfe, confifting of two fmall apart- 
ments. The quarterly fees are ; for Englifh, i s. 6 d. ; for 
writing and arithmetic, as.; and 2 s. 6d for Latin. The 
fchool, as well as the church, is injudicioufly fituated, being 
at the diftance of leven miles from the oppofite extremity of 
the parifh ; and, were it not for a populous and thriving vil- 
lage in the neighbourhood, a fchoolmafter could not live. 
The average number of i'cholars may be 40. With all the 
application he can beftow, his living, including perquifites, 
cannot be worth more than 20 1. a year. Within the courfe 
of fix years, there have been five changes of fchoolmafters. 
This rapid fucceffion is juftly attributed to the fmallnefs of 
the living. The low value of money, and the high price of 
every thing, render 20 1, but a fcanty fubfiftence. A fchool- 
mafter, even in a fmall landward pariffi, hopes, at his admif- 
fion, to live at leaft as comfortably as a plowman. He mi£ 
takes it ; and will be able much fooner to difcover than to 
correct his miftake. The plowman's wages have been doubled 
within thefe 40 years part: The fchoolmafler's condition, du- 
ring that long period, has undergone no material change for 
the better. The plowman ferves one mafter only: The 
fchoolmafter has commonly as many dictators as employers. 
The former receives his wages from one hand, and thefe 
wages are chearfully and punctually paid : The latter, with

the reluctant hands of forty *. 

Provifion is made for the poor by half yearly affeffmehts. 
Their average number for 10 years preceding 1792, is 7; 
and the annual fum for their fupport, at an average, during 
that period, is 24 1. 

. CharaBer The inhabitants of this parifh cannot be diftin- 

guilhed from their neighbours either by their virtues or their 
vices. They are, in general, fober, contented, and hoipitable. 
The manufatturing clafs, poffeffing thefe qualities, are alfo 
induftrious. In the memory of no man living, has there 
been any belonging to it who has fuffered capital punifh- 
ment ; nor is it known here that there is one inftance on 
record. The parifh is not furnifhed with the accommoda- 
tions of an inn. There are, indeed, four houfes where ale 
and Britifh fpirits are fold ; but it is not probable that any of 
the landlords fhall become rich in the trade. 

In this parifh there are a few Burghers and Antiburghers, 
and fome of the Relief denomination. In former times, 
both here and elfewhere, the Antiburghers, the ftricteft feet, 
would not allow a church clergyman to pray in their fami- 
lies. If at any time this indulgence was granted him, it was 
upon condition that he fhould go about the duty not as a

ving the mod likely means of bettering his condition elfewhere. 
It were to be wifhed that a nation, liberal and enlightened in 
other refpecls, would concur in adopting fome effectual plan to

<p>Soil and Climate. 

THE parifli of Kilbirny is, in foil and appearance, very- 
various. More than one third of it on the north-weft 
is muir, mofs, and hill, fit only for fheep and black cattle, 
with plenty of hares and muir-fowl. Another third of it 
lies gently declining to the fouthward, with foils of fand, clay, 
and earth, and not unfruitful either in grafs or corn, and 
capable of great improvement. The remaining part of it lies 
low along the river Garnock, and is compofed of fome of the 
fineft deep moulds of earth and clay in Scotland, the molt 
part of it yielding generally 8 or 10 bolls of oats per acre ; 
but is thought rather wet and level for wheat. — The climate is 
very healthful ; the air neither too moift nor too dry. We have 
no peculiar difeafes, nor any epidemical, excepting the fmall- 
pox, which once every five or fix years carries off a number 
of our young ones. Inoculation, though a great mean of 
preferving both life and beauty, is not by far fo much at- 
tended to and pradtifed here as it ought to be; but I hope 
that the people will foon be more and more convinced of its 
falutary effects. The moft common difeafes are colds, rheu- 

matifms. 



* Statifiical Account 

matifms, inflammatory and nervous fevers ; with a few con- 
fum prions, and very feldom the putrid fever and fore throat. 

W iters. — There is a fine loch, about two miles in length, 
and near half a mile in breadth, well ftored with pike, perch, 
trout, and eel. The late Earl of Crawfurd kept a pleaiure. 
boat on it ; and now there is a collier-boat erected on it, 
much more ufeful, for conveying coals from this to the JBeith 
fide of the loch. 

Garnock is the only river of any confequence, but not na- 
vigable. It riles from the foot of a very high hill in the 
muir called the Mifty Law, and runs lhallow, clear, and 
dimpling beautifully down the hills fouthward, and almoft 
divides the parifh into two halves, circulating the lower 
grounds on the fouth-eaft fide; and then holding on its 
courfe through Dairy and Kilwinning, enlarging as it flows, 
until near Irvine it pours a torrent into the fea. 

There are no bleachfields, nor printfields, nor cotton mills 
as yet on this river, though it is finely fituated for them all ; 
and, as there is plenty of fire and provifions in this place, and 
the manufacturing bufinefs going on bnfkly in this weft 
country, it is not to be doubted but that there will foon be 
fome of thefe public works in this parifh. 

Man/ton. — The manfion-houfe of Kilbirny, an old caftle, 
was built by the Crawfurd family near 300 years ago, and a 
new houfe, with large oflice-houfes adjoined, about 100 
years ago, and long inhabited by the Crawfurd family, and 
Vifcounts of Garnock ; and again, about 36 years ago, re- 
paired and beautified by the late Earl of Crawfurd j but foon 
thereafter was unfortunately burnt ; fo that now it ftands 
quite unroofed and ruinous. It was plealantly fituated, com-

and policies, all of which are going to ruin. The place, the 
parks, and more than 1000 acres of good land, are fet to one 
farmer. This arrangement feems here, as in other parts, to 
be a lofs to the proprietor, as well as to the community at 
large. It turns out many induftrious families, thins the 
country, prevents marriages and population, and makes the 
land no better than it was an hundred years ago. Hence, at 
the end of every leafe, the proprietor only gets an advanced 
rent in proportion to the rife and value of other commodities 
and necefiaries of life •, whereas, if fmall farms of 60 or 80 
acres were only given to one perfon, every inch of ground 
would be improven, many fubdivifions would be made, in- 
duftry would be more encouraged, and marriage, population, 
and improvement, would go rapidly on j and then the pro- 
prietor would, at the end of every leafe, get an advanced 
rent, both in proportion to the growing value of his lands, 
well improven, and alfo in proportion to the rife and value 
of other commodities, much heightened by the increafe of 
demand and population. 

Population — The town or village of Kilbirny contains about 
80 families, or 300 people. About 50 years ago, there were 
only three houfes there ; but the late flourifhing filk manu- 
factories have wonderfully increafed the population of all the 
little towns in this weft country ; and, if the cotton works 
go on as they are now promifing to do, the number of 
houfes and inhabitants in every village will ftill increafe. In 
1755, the numbers were 651; and now there are nearly 
700. Though the town has greatly increafed, yet the coun- ' 
try part of the parifh has rather decreafed, owing to the fore- 
faid ruinous policy of fetting large farms to one perfon. 
There are, below 10 years of age, nearly 180; and between 
10 and 20 years of age, 140 j between 20 and 50, 215 ; be- 
tween 



*52

tween 50 and 70, 140 ; and between 70 and 100, 25. Tha 
proportion between males and females is nearly, as ufual, 13 
to 12. The births, one year with another, are 22; mar- 
riages, 11 ; and burials, 14. 

People. — The people are fober, quiet, a&amp;ive, and induftri- 
ous, and generally wealthy. There are few poor, and none 
that go a-begging. The poor's funds are good, and more 
than fufficient for the parifh poor. The prefent minifter, 
Mr Malcolm Brown, was fettled here in the 1734, and is 
now a man above 90 years of age, with judgment and me- 
mory found and good, but fight and hearing greatly on the 
decline. He can walk ftraight and fteady, ride a mile once or 
twice a week, marry and baptize all that offer, and preaches 
once or twice a year. The ftipend is 8 chalders. He has 
been married thefe 50 years ; and his wife, near 80, is ftill a 
ftrong, active, lively, and fenfible woman. They are both 
much efteemed and refpefted by all that know them.

<p>Name, Soil, and Climate. 

THE antient and modern name of this parilh is the 
fame, and is faid to fignify, in the Gaelic, " Here is 
a plain," which accords very well with the fituation of the: 
village that is built on a rivulet called Pow Sail, at the head 
of a haugh of about 300 acres of iriclofed land, divided into 
fixteen parks, in grafs, rented about 20 s. per acre ; 30 years 
ago, uninclofed, they fet at 7 s. per acre. The parilh is 1 2 
miles long, and, at an average, about 3 broad. The face of 
the country is beautifully varied with hill and rock, rivulets 
and fmall plains, lying on the Tweed. The foil is light, but 
fertile. The air is healthy. The molt frequent difeafes are, 
flow fevers, confumptions, and rheumatifms. There are no 
flfh but trout and falmon.

This, and moft of the neighbouring parifhes, are greatly de- 
creafed in number. A third of the inhabitants live in the 
village, the reft in farm and cot-houfes. We have only 6 
fanners, 7 weavers, 4 taylors and apprentices, 2 mafons, 2 
fmiths, and 6 day-labourers ; the reft are fhepherds, cow- 
herds, and ploughmen. There are only one Seceder, and 
one Epifcopalian. The people are induftrious. Only four 
old perfons, and a dumb man, receive charity. 

Productions. — There is little natural wood here, only at 
Polmood, a fmall one which formerly has been pretty large; 
but has been deltruyed by bad management, and particularly 
by fheep. The loil is very fit for trees of every kind, and 
the late Sir James Nalmvth planted a great deal of fruit 
trees, as well as fir, wheh have thriven very well. There is 
no wheat. The grain is barley, peafe, and oats- The far- 
mers alio fow turnip, and plant a confider.ble quantity of 
potatoes, of which the peo le are fond, and think that a fta-

are fown on account of the fheep, which are great enemies 
to them. — Servants wages are high. A man, 6 1. per annum ; 
a maid fervant, 2 1. for the fummer half year, and about

<p>EJlate of Broughton. 
ryiHE efhte of Broughton has been, for a great number of 
A years, in the pofTeffion of the Murrays of Stenhope, 
who refided in the parifli, and was fold by the late Sir John 
Murray .commonly called Secretary Murray (having afted in 
that capacity to the Pretender), to James Dickfon of Edrum, 
member of Parliament for this diftridt of burrows in the year 
1762, and above eight years afterwards, it was fold by his 
heirs to the prefent Lord Juftice Clerk, now proprietor of 
the whole parifh. The manfion-houfe on this eftate was 
burnt about 18 years ago, and is not yet rebuilt. The village 
of Broughton was rebuilt by the late James Dickfon, Efq; 
after the Englifh fafhion, and remarked by paflengers for its 
neatnefs. 

The form of this parifli is two ridges of hills, with a val- 
ley between them, and the village of Broughton at the lower 
end of the valley, 4 miles in length and 3 in breadth. 

Soil and Air. —The foil is generally of a deep wet clay, and 
produces good crops in dry feafons. — The air is dry and 

healthy, 



of Broitghtori. 157 

healthy, and no diftempers are prevalent here, but fuch as are 
every where common. 

Population.— -The antient ftate of population in this parifli 
was 400 fouls. In 1755, it was 367. The prefent ftate of 
population is 264. There are 142 males, and 122 females. 

In the village of Broughton there are 20 dwelling houfes, 
which contain 36 people, and 6 1 children. 

In the country part of the parifli 167 refide, which, with 
the 97 that live in the village, make up 264 fouls, the a- 



niount of the prefent population.

There are twelve farmers in the parifli, and they employ 
in hufbandry 28 male fervants, and 23 females. — There are 
4 weavers in the parifli, 4 wrights, 1 taylor, 1 fmith, 1 mil- 
ler, 2 flioemakers, and 3 fliopkeepers. 

The people in this parifli are well affecled to the prefent 
eftablifliment ; at the ordination of the incumbent, there was 
not one feceder in the whole parifli ; there are now 8 who 
were Seceders from the Church before they came into this 
parifli. 

Productions. — There is no natural wood, nor fruit trees in 
the parifli ; but feveral plantations of fir and hard timber, in 
a thriving condition. There are 200 black cattle, and up- 
wards of 2000 flieep, and 80 horfes, young and old. — There 

are

are 400 acres In tillage, 300 in corn, 60 in bear, 30 in peas, 
and 10 in potatoes.— The parifh fupplies itfelf with provi- 
Cons, and exports corn, cattle, and wool, to a confiderable 
extent.— '1 here is no hemp, and very little flax raifed in the 
parifh, being found, from -experience, not to agree with the 
foil and climate.— The foil anfwers fown grafs extremely 
well, and there are about 30 acres, at an average, hid down 
with grafb feeds every year, which produce very plentiful 
crops. All the other lands arc in pafture. 

They in general fow their corn and peafe in the month of 
March, and reap in September ; their bear in April, and 
reap in Auguft. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiotis — This parifh labours under a 
great difadvantage in regard to feuel, having none but coal, 
and that at the diftance of 16 miles ; lime is at the diftance 
of 12 miles. — Another difadvantage this parifh labours un- 
der, is the want of refiding heritors, which is a great lofs to 
the poor, efpecially in thefe parifhes where there are no poor 
rates, as in this cafe, the poor are fupported by the poor. 

The language fpoken here is Englifh, with the Scotch ac- 
cent ; but from what language the names of places in the 
parifh are derived, is impoffible to fay. 

The land rent of the parifh is about 700 1. a year. — The 
cot-houfes, in the parifh, at an average. 1 1. yearly. 

Church and Poor. — The value of the living varies fome- 
what, in proportion to the price of meal, the ftipend being 
35 1. in money, and 3 chalders of oat meal, at an average 
80 1. including the glebe. Patron, Duke of Queenfberry. 

The number of the poor receiving alms, at an average, are 
8 ; and there being no poor rates in the parifh, they are 
fupported by the Sunday's collections, and the benefits arifing

from the mort-cloth and proclamation of banns. It would 
be a good fund towards the maintenance of the poor, and a 
good mean for the preventing of the crimes of unchaftity and 
hild- murder, if the (tool of repentance, which is, no doubt, 
relic of Popery, was legally abolifhed, and a fine in money 
Jtablifhed in its place, in proportion to circumftances and 
fixations, wherever the fcandal was not removed by mar- 
riage.

61. of female, 3I per year, with victuals.— There are 14 
ploughs in the pariah, of the Scotch, kind, and upwards of 
50 carts. 

Ancient Buildings.— There are the remains of ten caftles, 
commonly called towers, which appear to have been houfcs 
of great ftrength. In the under ftorey they had a wooden 
door of uncommon thicknefs, full of iron-fpikes with broad 
heads, and a throng iron-gate that opened in the infide. One 
of thefe doors and gates was preferved in the parifh for a 
long time as a piece of antiquity, and has been feen by feve- 
ral now living. In one of thefe caftles the great Macbeth, 
is faid to have lived ; and it is called Macbeth's Caftle to this 
'day. Mr James Dickfon, late proprietor of this parifh, em- 
ployed workmen to dig up the foundation of part of Mac- 
beth's Caftle, in fearch of treafure and antiquities y but no- 
thing was found but fome pieces of old armour, and coins of 
no great confluence. 

Reads. — The public road which runs through the parifh, 
and leads to Moffat, is kept in good repair ; but the bye- 
roads are very bad, and many of them impaffable, no ftatute 

labour 



l6 ° Smijlical Accdunl 

labour having been performed, nor commutation money up.' 
bfted, for the laft ten years—There is only one bridge in the 
parith over Biggar water, about a quarter of a mile from the 
village ; and, being upon the public road, and of great advan- 
tage to travellers, the water in the winter feafon being often 
Jmpaffable, is kept in tolerably good repair. 

School.— There is only one fchool in the parifli, falary 5 I. 
16 s. 8d. which, with fchool wages and other perquifites' 
may amount to the fmall living of 1 1 1. or 1 2 1. yearly ; and \ 
for that fum, from 2 o to 30 fcholars are regularly inftrufted 
in the different branches of education. 

There is one inn and two alehoufes in the village. 

Cottages.— There are no new houfes built in the parifh of 
late, nor cottages, but a great many cottages pulled down, 
the farmers finding more lofs than profit arifing from the 
keeping up of cot houfes : The throwing down of cottages 
muft be one principal reafon of the decreafe of popula- 
tion in country parifhes, and of the increafe of population 
in towns and villages, and a principal reafon of the fcarcity 
of fervants, and the increafe of their wages } the poor people 
being banifhed from the country, take up their refidence in 
towns, and breed their children to manufactures, who would 
otherwife have all been bred to the plough ; and, if manu, 
failures continue to flourifh, and this growing evil, of throw- 
ing down cottages, and banifhing the poor from the country 
parts of pari flies, is not fpeedily corrected, it is more than 
probable that fervants for carrying on the purpofes of agri- 
culture will not be obtained. 

There is one fair in the year in the village, held upon the 
4th of October, originally for black cattle, but now chiefly 
for the hiring of fervants, and the ftoremafters felling their 
cheefe,

<p>Name, appearance, and Soil. 

CON-TCJIN, the meeting of waves, or Co-an-da-avihin, 
fignifying the meeting of two rivers, whence the ifland 
of Contin derives its name. 

The appearance of the country is generally hilly and moun- 
tainous, the hills in the lower part of the parifh, near the 
place of Contin, being moftly covered with natural wood. 
There is alfo a great flat of corn lands, belonging to Colonel 
Mackenzie of Coul, through which the river Rafay runs, all 
in fight of the manfion-houfe of Coul, which lies about 200 
yards to the north-eaft of Contin. There is alfo a great deal 
of corn lands in the feveral glens and valleys in the pariih.— 
The corn lands, upon the whole, yield pretty good crops, 
though the foil be but light and fhallow. 

Air and Difeafes — The air is rather moid, but not un- 
healthy. The difeafes are, fmall-pox, meafles, and rheu- 
matifms ; the latter, no doubt, owing to the moifture of the 
air, and to the natives giving up the ufe of plaiding or coarie 
flannel next their Ikin, in place of which they now wear

linen. They are fometimes diftrefled with fluxes, occafioned 
by their feeding moftly on potatoes. They are moft Cubjeft 
to them in the latter end of fpring, and beginning of fum- 
mer, when the potatoes have a tendency to grow, and when 
the people have neither milk, meal, nor onions to eat w'nh 
them. This year, and the laft, there was a putrid fever, 
which made prodigious havoc in a place called Strathbran, 
where it carried off" more than two thirds of the inhabitants, 
and ftill continues to rage with violence there. It is found 
to be very infectious ; and its having done fo much damage 
in that place is attributed to the unwholefo'menefs of the air, 
which has been worfe this year than ever, owing to the e;c- 
tenfive flat in that ftrath being repeatedly overflowed in the 
fummer and harveft months, and the ftagnated putrid waters 
fending forth noxious vapours that poifon the air. 

Lakes. — There are many lakes and rivers, all of which 
abound with fifli of one kind or other, though none draws a 
price but falmon, being at a great diftance from any market 
town, and of no fuch confideration as to encourage an ad- 
venturer to try what could be made of them. — The moft re- 
markable lakes are Loch- Achilty, where the char and filver 
trout are fometimes found. One thing remarkable to be ob- 
ferved of this lake is, that there is no vifible running water 
ifTuing from it except at the time of high fpeats, although a 
great quantity falls into it daily. It certainly difcharges it-' 
felf by fubterraneous paflages into the river Rafay, to the 
weft of which it lies about three quarters of a mile. It is a 
mile long; in fome places very deep. The water is beauti- 
fully clear : It has an artificial ifland, a place made for fafety, 
where the ruins of a houfe and garden are ftill to be feen.

Tarvle. The next is Loch-Lichart, in a line to the weft, four 
miles long, where there is plenty of trout, fome weighing 
four and five pounds. The loch is lined on both fides with 
a ridge of high hills, covered with oak and birch wood, with 
fome firs, interlperfed here and there with green fpots for 
dealing, and at both ends, on each fide, pretty extenfive 
flats of corn land. The oak wood on this loch-fide fold 
three years ago for 360 I. Betwixt Loch-Lichart and Loch- 
Bran, on the fame water, are feveral inconfiderable lakes, all 
abounding with black and white trout ; and Loch-Bran a- 
bounds with large pike. Several miles to the weft of that is 
Loch-Chroflc, abounding with trout. To the north-weft of 
Loch-Lichart, four miles diftance, lies Loch-Fannich, abound- 
ing with fifh, is fix Scotch miles in length ; from it hTues a 
fmall river, called Grudie, which difcharges itfelf into the 
Cannon, about one mile above Loch-Lichart. — Ail the ftraths 
are liable to inundations. The moft remarkable ones hap- 
pened in March 1789 ; and this very year, (1 791) the great- 
eft part of the corn lands were twice overflowed this harveffc 
in the courfe of 20 days, by which the crop was much da- 
maged. — There is a very remarkable echo on the farm of 
Kinellan; it will echo a whole fentence perfectly diftinft. 
It is believed to be unequalled, unlefs by an echo in Wales, 
and another in StafFa, the latter of which is of a very diffi 
rent nature. 

Animals, CSV The parilh principally abounds in black 

cattle, horfes, ftieep, goats, deer, roe, foxes, wild cats, pole- 
cats, badgers, and otters. — Common fowls of various kinds ; 
turkeys, geefe, wild and tame, ducks of different fpecies, 
fwans, maws, gulls, curlieus, cranes, herons, fcarfs, king's- 
filher, muir-fowl, heath-fowl, plovers, fnipes, hawks of vari- 
ous kinds, the black and grey eagles, ravens, rooks, crows,

owls. And on the higheft hills, tarmagans, migrating birds, 
lapwings appear in fpring, wood-cocks in the latter end of 
harveft, cuckoos in April ; May, fwallows of various kinds, 
and three kinds of bats, fuppofed fleeping birds. 

Population.— In Dr Webfter's lift in 1755, tbe numbers 
are ftated at 1949; at prefent, there are 2000 above the 
age of feven years.— There is in the parifh one woman aged 
101 now living, and has the ufe of all her faculties. There 
5s alfo an out-penfioner of Chelfea Hofpital upwards of 90 

years old, who has drawn the penfion for 45 years There 

are a fufficiency of fquare-wrights, fmiths, weavers, taylors, 

and fhoemakers, for carrying on the work of the parifh 

Two ferry-men, one over the Rafay at Contin, and another 
over the Connon, three miles to the weft of Contin, at a 
place called Little Scatwell. — All the people are of the efta- 
blifhed Church except 50 or 60 Epifcopalians. — The popu- 
lation is on the increafe, but it is feared will foon decreafe, 
as the gentlemen are encouraging fhepherds to come and 
fettle on their properties, which muft neceffarily remove the 
prefent inhabitants, and force them to go in queft of bread 
to other countries, as there are no manufactures eftablifhed 
here to employ them. 

Productions — Cabbages, turnips, potatoes, and various kinds 
of garden fluffs. — Fir trees, planted and natural, oak, birch, 
elm, alder, fauchs of different kinds, mapple, mountain afh, 
plains, beech, feveral remarkable large ones at the place of 
Coul, and fruit trees ol various kinds. — There is a fufficiency 
of corn grown for iiipporting the inhabitants ; but, owing to 
the number of diftillers of whifky, of which there are no lefs 
than three diftilleries in this parifh, there are imported an- 
nually about 300 bolls of barley from the neighbouring pa- 
ri flies, 



of Contirt. 165 

tlfhes, principally from Eafter Rofs.— About 50 acres are in 
fown grafc on the Mains of Coul, and a few acres on another 
farm. The farmers have feldom fowed any, (except a few 
pounds in their gardens) ; nor can they be prevailed upon to 
do it, though they have got long leafes from Colonel Mac- 
kenzie of Coul, (19 years) to encourage them to rail'e grafs ; 
and the foil is found to be admirably calculated for it, yield- 
ing from 200 to 300 ftones the acre. Colonel Mackenzie 
has not impofed one {hilling of additional rent upon his 
whole property in this parifh. — They begin to fow oats and 
rye in February •, but, in moft places, in the latter end of 
March, and whole of April. Barley is fown by the begin- 
ning of May, and finilhed by the 1 2th of June; notwith- 
ftanding of which, the harveft is much earlier than in any of 
the neighbouring parifhes, and was fafely ingathered even 
this very year by the end of October. — There is great plenty 
of fhelly marl now difcovered in the Loch of Kinellan, upon 
the eftate of Coul 3 and the proprietor, at his own expence, 
has fo far drained the Loch, as to have eafy accefs to the 
working of the marl; and the tenants have full liberty to take 
from it whatever quantity they pleafe for the ufe of their 
lands. The Lake is alfo furrounded with ftone-marl, which 
has been found by the farmers there to meliorate the ground 
very much. This Lake lies five miles to the weft of Ding- 
wall. There is lime-ftone alfo found on the Coul property, 
but difficult to work. There was this year difcovered, on 
the property of Mr Mackenzie of Strathgarvie, (a minor), a 
rich lime-ftone quarry, which could be eafily wrought, and 
to great advantage, there being plenty of peats and wood 
clofs by the quarry. The proprietor of the quarry has clofe 
by it betwixt 300 and 400 acres of arable ground admirably 
calculated for lime, on which property there are no lefs, -M 
prefent, than 50 or 60 families, without any induftry, or any 

thin^

thing to fupport them, but what corn they are able to raife 
from thefe fields, which fets now at about 7 s. 6 d. the acre. 
The quarry lies clofs by Lochmalin, about 1 2 miles to the 
weft of Dingwall. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.— -The Gaelic and Englifh Ian- 
guages are both fpoken in the parifli, bat Gaelic chiefly. All 
names of villages and places are derived from the Gaelic. 
The rental of the parifli is between 1300 1. and 1400 1.— The 
falmon filhing fets at about 20 1. 

Church and Poor. — The minifter's ftipend is ioco merks, 
and one chalder of victual, and the glebe would fet at 7 1. 
Sterling. The King is patron.— The number of heritors is 
9, none of whom refide in it. — There are only 10 poor peo- 
ple who receive charity. The moll indigent of them get a 
weekly fupply from the feffion. The annual amount of the 
contributions for the relief of the poor, in the panfli church, 
feldom exceeds 40 s. ; there is a fmall legacy left to the poor 
of the parifli by a Mrs St Clair, who died at Jamaica, a native 
of this parifli, daughter to Mr ^neas Morrifon minifter of

The fetid confifts of peat, wood, heath, whins, and broom.

CharaBer of the People.— The people, in general, are fober, 
and very oeconomical ; but averfe to induftry, never work- 
ing but from neceffity; The rifing generation are rather fond 
of gay clothing, the manufacture of other countries, which 
exhaufts all their fubftance, and keeps them conftantly poor. 
There is ho manufacture in the parifh. The people are ge- 
nerally very contented with their fituation, and have the ne- 
ceffaries of life in abundance. They are perfectly honeft, 
and religioufly inclined. Their condition might be eafily 
made better, were there any manufactures eftabliftied amongft 
them ; a linen or woollen one would anfvver extremely well. 
The women would be made induftrious by this means. 
There is plenty of fine foft water in this place, for warning, 
bleaching, and whitening linen cloth ; and there are plains 
of any extent required for forming a bleachfield, into which 
water might be brought at a trifling expence j befides, fuch 
is the quality of the water, that one fourth of the expence of 
foap, &amp;c. would be faved. 

The beft arable land in this parifh fets at 14 s. 6d. the a- 
cre, and the loweft at 2 s. 6 d. — The farms in this parifh are 
from 1 00 1, to 2I. ; for the moft part they are from 15 1. to 

3 1 There is not an inclofure in the parifh, but thofe on 

the Mains of Coul. The people are averfe to inclofures, as 
they wilh to have all kinds of pafture in common. The fi- 
tuation of the parifh, in 1782 and 1783, was truly deplor- 
able, and no doubt many of the poorer fort muft have died 
from want, were it not for the timely fupply of corn fent by 
government to this country. One remarkable circumftance 

to 



Statijlical Account 



to be obfervcd was, that although thefe years produced little 
or no corn, they were particularly favourable for the growth 
of grafs, which yielded immenfe quantities of milk, the prin- 
cipal fupport of the inhabitants ; and the kind providence of 
God was very remarkably feen towards the poorer fort, in 
caufing the flieep and goats, the only cattle they had, to yield 
greater quantities, and more fruitful milk, than they were 
ever known to do before, or ever fince. Another favourable 
circumftance for the inhabitants was, that there was a great 
demand for cattle, (the ftaple commodity of the parifti), and, 
^hat they fold at high prices.

' PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1774629">IRVINE</name>. 

(County of Ayr.— Prejbytery of Irvine.— Synod of Glafi 

gow and Ayr.) 

By tht Reverend Mr James Richmond.</head> 



<p>Name and Situation. 

IRVINE, or, according to its ancient orthography, IrwJne, 
and Earwine, is a feaport town fituated near the mouth' 
of the river of Irvine, in the Bailleary of Cuningham, and 
(hire of Ayr. It was originally in the province of Galloway, 
which antiently comprehended not only the county now 
known by that name, and the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright, 
but alfo the greateft part, if no: the whole, of Ayrfhire. 
Even at fo late a period as the reign of Robert Bruce, the 
Caftle of Irvine was accounted to be in Galloway. There is 
reafon to fuppofe, that a people of Saxon original encroach- 
ed by degrees on the ancient Galloway. The names of 
places in Cuningham are generally Saxon ; the name of the 
diftria itielf is Saxon, though, according to Buchanan, it is 
faid to be Danilh, and figmfies the King's Houfe, or the Re- 
fidence of the King *. The town of Irvine (lands on a ril- 
ing ground, of a fandy foil, to the north of the river, and 
about half a mile diftant from the harbour, which lies nearly 
Vol. VII. Y to 



* See Sir David Dalrymplc's Annals, vol. I. p. to6. 



J 7° Siatijlical Account 

to the fouth.weft of it. It is dry and well aired, has one 
broad ftreet running through it, from the fouth-eaft, bend- 
ing a little to the fouth about the middle, and terminating 
in the north-weft. On the iouth fide of the river, but con- 
netted with the town by a flone bridge, there is a row of 
houfes on each fide of the road leading to the harbour, thefe 
are mortly of one ftorey, with finifhed garrets, and occupied 
chiefly by feafaring people. . On part of the great road lead- 
ing to Ayr, which interietts this ftreet, nigh to the bridge, 
are the fame kind of buildings. The moft of thcfe build- 
ings have been erected within thefe 40 or 50 years, and are 
increnfing every year. 

They are not within the royalty, and form no part of the 
ancient burgh, being fituated in the parifh of Dundonald, 
and annexed to Irvine, quoad facra, only. Part of thefe 
lands, however, belong to the town, as alfo the quay, on 
which there are feveral ftore-houfes, coal-yards, and an inn 
or public houfe, which, by a Angular feu, has the exclufive 
privilege of felling ale and fpirits there. It appears, from 
the records of the burgh, that Alexander II. granted a char- 
ter to the burgefles of Irvine, confirming fome other royal 
grants, but from whom thefe were obtained, is now uncer- 
tain. No mention is here made of their other charters, 
which are many. From one granted by Robert II. it ap- 
pears, that the burgefles of Irvine were in pofleflion of the 
whole barony of Cuningham and Largs. The ma*iftrates 
of Irvine do not now enjoy fo extenfive a jurifdittion. 

Extent, Soil, and Rent of the Pariflj.- -The parifh of Irvine, 
at its greateft length, is about 5 miles, extending from the 
fea on the fouth-weft, to the parifh of Stewarton on the 
north-eaft. At its greateft breadth it is about 2 miles, and 
is bounded by the river Annock, which feparates it from the 

parifh. 



of Irvine* 



harifli of Dreghorn on the fouth-eaft and eaft ; by the parifh 
of Kilwinning on the north and north-eaft ; by the river 
Garnock on the north-weft, and by the river of Irvine, 
which feparates it from the parifh of Bundonald, on the 
fouth. To the north-weft of the town, there is a common- 
ty belonging to it, of above 300 acres, of a fandy foil, and 
partly covered with whin and fhort broom. If laid off in 
proper inclofures, and rented to the inhabitants, it might be 
worth 20 s. or 30 s. per acre in a few years. Adjoining to 
this, and immediately at the back of the town, there was 
formerly a large loch, which, about the beginning of this 
century, was drained by the Rev. Mr Warner, and is now 
arable. To the north-eaft, the town have a confiderable 
tratt of land, yielding a revenue of about 500 1. per annum. 
The lower part of the parifh is flat and fandy. To the north- 
eaft of the town, it confifts of a light loam ; in fome parts 
the foil is mixed with gravel ; all of it produces heavy crops 
of all different kinds of corn and grafs. Towards the ex- 
tremity of the parifti, the fituation is more elevated and the 
foil of a ftiffifh clay. 

There is only one gentleman's feat in the parifh, Bour- 
treehill. It is well laid out, and highly improved, by the 
Hon. Mr Hamilton, who refides upon it. Nigh to this feat, 
there is an old caftle of a fquare form, belonging to the Earl 
of Eglintoune, whofe feat is alio about a mile from Irvine to 
the north, and the town lands on that quarter are all along 
bounded by his Lordftiip's policy. This caftle is faid to be 
the remains of an ancient nunnery, where there was a chapel, 
church-yard, and a fmall village. The face of the country 
is greatly beautified by circular 1 plantations on moft of the 
eminences. The farms are large, the farm houfes are moftly 
new, very neat and convenient* 



Rivers. 



l 7 2 Stati/tkal Aicount 

Rivers. — There are no rivers which run through the pa- 
nfti. The river of Irvine, which takes its rife to the eaft of 
Loudonhill, in the parifh of Loudon, in times of floods, 
carries great quantities of fand along with it, chiefly after it 
paffes Irvine, which being thrown out at the Bar, is gradual- 
ly removing it to a greater difiance from the harbour. The 
depth of water, from the Quay to the Bar, is generally from 
9 to 1 1 feet at fpring tides. In high ftorms, with the wind 
from the fouth or fouth- well, it is fometimes 16 feet. 

Roads .— The roads leading to and from the town are, \Jl y 
The Kilmarnock road to the fouth- eaft. 2d, The Ayr road 
to the fouth. 3d, The Greenock road by Kilwinning to 
the north-weft ; and, /\th, The Glafgow road by Stewarton 
to the north-eaft. They are all kept in tolerable repair by 
the itatute iabour, which is converted into money, and paid 
to the truftees. Three fhillings Sterling are paid by every 
houfeholder in the town for that purpofe, which, in many 
inhances, is a very hard and oppreflive tax, efpecially in fea- 
port towns, where there are lo many failors widows, left with 
numerous families, and often in poor circumftances. This is 
an evil which calls for redrels. Befides the ftatute money, 
there are tolls nigh to the town, on the Stewartoun, Kilmar- 
nock, and Ayr roads. 

A fly goes regularly from this to Glafgow, by Kilwinning, 
Dairy, Beath, and Paifley, three times every week. A ftage 
coach runs from this to Greenock twice in the week, and 
continues to be wcil employed. 

Manufactures. — Manufactu: es, as yet, arc not carried on 
here to any extent. The young men, in general, are failors, 
or go abroad to the Well Indies and America as ftorekeep- 
ers and planters. Many from this place and the neighbour- 
hood 



of Irvine. i r /3 

hood have gone to the Eaft Indies, and are ftill going out, 
Some in the mercantile line, others in the phyfical, feafaring, 
and military, and lome in each of thefe profeffions, have late- 
ly returned from thence with large fortunes. Many of our 
young men are alfo employed as fhipmafters and failors from 
ClyJe. 

The number of the incorporated trades are nearly as fol- 
lows, viz. weavers, 116; fhoemakers, 56; fmiths, 24 ; tay- 
lors, 27 ; coopers, 7 ; mafons and wrights, 80.— There are

Befides thefe, there are a great many carts belonging to the 
country employed in carrying blind coals from Kilmarnock, 
Riccartoun, and Fairley. There are three mafter fhip-build- 
ers, a tan work, a ropeu r ork, and a bleachfield. One whifky 
ftill, which confumes about 950 bolls of malt yearly. One 
{mall brewery, moft of the ale being brewed by retailers 
themfelves. Many private families brew their own beer; 
and, of late, the practice of brewing ftrong ale has been much 
revived. 

There are a great many grocers and fmall huckfter fhops, 
and four or five hardware fhops. Weavers of filk gauze, 
muflins, &amp;x. and fome other tradefmen employed in the 
town and fuburbs, are not entered with the corporations, nor 
included in the above lift. Their numbers are daily in- 

creafing.

creafing. About three years ago, a company of manufac- 
turers in Glafgow fet on foot a tambour-work here, and 
have now about 70 girls employed, who earn from 15 d. to 
2 s. per week. 

Laft year a fpinning Jenny was erected, which employs 
about 80 hands, whofe wages are from 1 s. to 9 s. per week. 
And two others are ereded fince in the fuburbs, which give 
employment to about 50 each.

Commerce.— TYm exports and imports of this place h_. 
rapidly increafed of late. Coals have always been the chief 
article of our export. Formerly they were carried in fmall 
brigs and floops to the different ports of Ireland : Their fize 
is now greatly enlarged, and their numbers are increafed. By 
an accurate lift made up in the Cuftomhoufe on the 30th 
September 1790, it appears, that the number belonging to 
Irvine was 51 vefiels, the tonnage of which amounted to 
3682 tons. They are of various fizes. The largeft is 160 
tons, the fmallcft 33 tons, excepting one of 17, and one of 
10 tons, which are packets employed between this and 
Greenock. It appears from the fame lift, that thefe veflels 
are navigated by 305 failors, all belonging to this place.— 
There are 49 veffels belonging to Saltcoats and Largs, which 
are branches of this port, the tonnage of which amounts to 
4166. Many of thefe vefiels, as well as veflels from the dif- 
ferent ports of Ireland, and other places, come here for coals. 
Above 24,000 tons of coals are exported from this yearly. 
The exportation of coals from this took place, in a fmall de- 
gree, towards the end of the laft century : They were car- 
ried coaftways in birlings or fmall boats. When thefe arri- 
ved, they blew a large horn, which was fixed to a poll at the 
quay by an iron chain ; and, upon this fignal, the country 
people loaded their coal poneys or fmall horfes, and carried 

down 



of Irvine* ij^ 

down what quantities were wanted. The coals here are of 
an excellent quality, make a very quick and chearful fire ; 
and, anfwering the purpofes of baking and brewing better 
than any other coals from this coaft, bring the higheft prices 
in Ireland. Their price, delivered at the quay, is 9 s. per 
chalder, Winchefter meafure. Their ordinary price in Ire- 
land is feldom under 16 s. 

Confiderable quantities of woollen carpets and carpetins, 
muflins, and fluffs of filk, lawns, gauzes, and linen called 
Kentings, are exported from this to Ireland. The lawns, 
gauzes, muflins, and filks, are brought from Paifley. The 
bounty for filks exported in the year 1790 amounted to 236I. 
It has often exceeded that fum, and fometimes rifen to 800 1. 
The chief articles of our import are hemp, iron, Memel and 
' Norway wood, fhip-rimber, chiefly from Wales, raw hides, 
Ikins, and grain, from Ireland. 10,000 Quarters of grain 
have fometimes been imported from Ireland in one year. 
Great quantities are alfo brought coaftways from Galloway. 
The county of Ayr is fuppofed to produce grain fufiicient for 
the confumpt of its inhabitants. Paifley, Glafgow, and the 
more inland parts of the country, confume what is imported. 

Population. — In 1755, by Dr Webfter's lift the numbers 
were 4025. The town and fuburbs have increafed fince that 
period. The country part of the parifh has been diminifhed. 
From an enumeration made in 1781, it appears, that there 
were in the town, country, and fuburbs, 4391 fouls; and, 
from an enumeration made in December 1 790, their num- 
bers are 4500. This increafe has chiefly taken place in the 
fuburbs or annexed part of the parifh, the numbers in the 
town having rather decreafed, owing to the taking down of 
fome old houfes, each of which contained many families ; 
whereas the new ones built in their place are occupied by- 
one

one or two families at mod. This laft enumeration was 
made after an unufual mortality by the fmall-pox, and a ner- 
vous fever, which made its appearance about the beginning of 
Auguft that year. The births, deaths, and marriages, as 
contained in the parifh regifter for thefe laft ten years, are

In the years 1781, 1784, and 1790, the fmall-pox were in 
the town. In the year 1784, 54 died of thai difeafe; and, 
in the year 1790, 57 died of the fame difeafe, and about 24 
of the fever. Inoculation here, till of late, was not in gene- 
ral practice. 

Character of the People.— Perhaps in no fea-port town of 
the fame extent are the inhabitants more fober and induftri- 
ous than in this. They are fotial and chearful, but feldom 
riotous, it being very unufual for any perfons to be feen upon, 
the ftreet after 12 o'clock at night. The people, in general, 
are in eafy circumftances ; many of them are wealthy, and all 
of them remarkably hofpitable, They are happy in each 
other's fociety, and entertain frequently and well. Their 
entertainments are more fubftantial thanfhowy; though in 
this, upon occafions, they are by no means defeflive. As a 



of Irvine* 177 

proof of their moderation and good conduct, there has not 
for many years been an inftance of bankruptcy among them, 
one or two incomers only excepted. They are humane and 
generous, though thefe qualities may not, in every inftance, 
be exerted with necelTary prudence j and this perhaps is one 
reafon of the ftreefs being fo much infefted with vagrant 
poor. In other inftances their liberality has been well di- 
refted. 

Church. — The church of Irvine is beautifully lituated on 
the fummit of a rifing ground, to the fouth of the town, and 
nigh to the river *. It is an oblong fquare of 80 feet in 
length, by 60 in breadth. The lofts form an octagon in the 
infide, and, gradually afcending, place every hearer in full 
view of the preacher. At each angle there is a mafly pillar 
of wood from the ground-floor to the roof of the church. 
The area below is neatly fitted up with pews, all of them 
facing the pulpit. Three-fourths of the church were built 
by the magiftrates, and one-fourth by the other heritors. 
The communion tables confift of two rows of table feats, ex* 
tending from the pulpit, on the north-weft, to the fouth- 
eaft door, the partitions of which form the ends of faid 
feats, and are moveable at pleafure. Thefe feats are the pro- 
perty of the feffion, and yield from 81. to pi. annually 

The magiftrates, referving one loft for themfelves, difpofed 
of the reft of their property to the inhabitants, who fitted up 
their own feats, according to a plan previoufly agreed upon. 
The money which they raifed in this manner defrayed their 
fhare of the expence of building the church, and left them 
an overplus of near 300 1. This fum they laid out, with an 
addition of near 5 col. more, in building a very elegant 

Vo1 " ™- Z fieepk

J 7 S Statiftical Account 

fleeple adjoining to the church on the north-weft fide. The 
fteeple, at its bafe, is 14 feet fquarc. 

Poor. — The poor of this place have greatly increafed with- 
in thefe 50 years. This is afcribed to a variety of different 
caufes. At that time, it was confidered as difgraceful to re- 
ceive fupply from the fefiion ; and none but fuch as were in 
the mod diftrefied circumftances ever thought of making 
application to it. By this they were led to make every ex- 
ertion for their own fupport and their children, from the 
fame principle, acquired early habits of induftry. 

The country was then parcelled out in fmall farms, and 
employed a greater number of hands in the cultivation of it. 
Their incomes, though fmall, afforded them, in general, the 
certain means of fubfiftence. Few ever thought of reforting 
to towns, but fuch as could live upon their money, or upon 
the profits of their particular callings. When the farms were 
enlarged, as they now are, thefe cottagers or fmall tenants 
crowded into towns or neighbouring villages •, and, being 
bred to no bufinefs, they foon exhaufted their little ftock, 
and became burdens upon the public. The confequence of 
the fuppreffion of cottagers is felt, and will be more and 
more felt in many different ways throughout Scotland. 

The funds chiefly arife from the intereft of a fmall ftock of 
money, and a mortification of fome lands, public collections, 
proclamation of banns, baptifms, legacies, mort-cloths, feat 
rents, &amp;c. The moft necefiitous of the poor are fupplied 
by weekly penlions, which are from 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. per week ; 
•and fuch as need occafional fupply to afiift their own induf- 
try, by precepts and watering rolls. Precepts are diftribu- 
tions made by the fefiion, as occafion requires. Watering 
rx»lls are the diftributions which are made at each Sacrament, 
which is twice every year. — A Bailie Gray of this place fome 

time 



of Irvine. 1 79 

lime ago burdened his fubjects with 1 1. ios. annually for. 
the education of poor children. Mr Stewart, a druggift. 
here, has lately difponed his fubject, in value about 300 1. to 
the poor, referving to himfelf . and wife (they have no chil- 
dren) the liferent of it. The magiftrates and heritors, who. 
are required every year to attend at fettling the treafurer's 
accounts, are well acquainted with the ftate of the funds ;. 
and, when neceffary, they voluntarily affefs themfelves in fuch 
fums as the fupport of the poor requires, thereby wifely pre- 
venting a general Jlent. There are of late feveral lbcieties 
eftablifhed here for the fupport of the poor belonging to 
each, which, in time, yvill operate greatly to the relief of the 
poor's funds. 

Schools.— There are in Irvine two public fchools, and feve- 
ral private ones. Before our connection with America was 
dirTolved, many young men from that country and the Weft 
Indies were fent here for their education. Mr Cunningham, 
who was then rector, and had always a doctor under him, 
had frequently from 20 to 26 boarders in his houfe. The 
charafter of the fchool is now, perhaps, a« high as ever it 
was; though, unfortunately for that branch of education, it 
is confidered by the people at large as of lefs importance 
than it ufed to be. The rector's falary is 1 8 1. ; his perqui- 
fites arife from births and marriages. The Engliih teacher's 
lalary is 10 1. His perquifites arife .from teftimonials and his 
falary as feflion-clerk. There are about 30 boys at the gram- 
mar fchool ; at the Englifh, about 70 fcholars. At private 
hours they teach arithmetic, writing, book-keeping, mathe- 
matics, French, geography, &amp;c. There is a fchool- mi ftrefs 
eftablifhed here, who teaches all kinds of needle-work. 



Ecclefiajlical State of the Pariflj. — There is one minifter on- 
ly. He has an affiftant, whofe falary is 40 1. ; 15 1. of which 

is 



l8 ° Statijlical Account 

is paid out of the town's funds, 10I. by feffion feats, and the 
reft by an annual contribution among the inhabitants. The 
minifter's ftipend, till 1785, was 7 chalders of victual, chief- 
ly meal, and near 100I. Scots. At that time he obtained an 
augmentation of 400 1. Scots. The glebe, originally about 
one acre and an half, has received an addition of fix acres 
and an half. Irvine is the feat of the preubytery, which con r 
fiftsof 18 minifters, and belongs to the fynod of Glafgow 
and Ayr. This fynod meets at Irvine once every third year. 
There were many learned, grave, and pious minifters, (fays 
Mr Warner, in his preface to Nifbet's Expofition on Ecclefi. 
aftes), who, in fuffering times, being put from their own 
charges, came and refided in this place, efpecially during the 
times of Mefirs Hutchifon's and Stirling's miniftry here. In 
the year 1662, Mr George Hutchifon was filenced by the 
Parliament for not giving obedience to his bifhop. By a 
fubfequent aft of the fame year, he was baniftied from Edin- 
burgh ; and, upon paffing the a&amp; of indulgence, he was ap- 
pointed by the privy council to preach and exercife the other 
functions of the miniftry at Irvine in 1669, where he died. 
He is the author of an Expofition on the book of Job, and 
on fome of the minor prophets. They are works of confi- 
derable merit. Mr Dickfon's works are well known : He 
was alfo a minifter in Irvine. They were both of them men 
of eminent learning and abilities at that time, as was alfo 
their cotemporary Mr Nifbet, as appears from the honour- 
able teftimony which they and others have borne of him,

There U in this place a Relief Mceting-houfe ; and, be- 
longing to it, there are, as nearly as could be collected, about 
240. The minifter's ftipend is 70 1. raifed partly by fub- 
fcription and partly by their ordinary collections. 

Buchvi'Ues— Upon the death of Mr Jack, fir A: Relief mi- 
nirter in this place, that congregation made choice of Me 
Whyte to be his fuccefibr. Mr Whyte being called to affile 
at the Sacrament in the neighbourhood of Glafgow, a Mrs 
Buchan had an opportunity of hearing him; and, captivated 
by his oratory,, fhe communicated unto him by letter the 
flattering account of his being the firft minifter who as yet 
had fpoken effectually to her heart ; exprefling, at the fame 
time, a deiire of viliting him at Irvine, that the might be 
further confirmed in the faith. 

This letter he fhowed to fome of his people who gave her 
a very welcome reception ; and, from her heavenly conven- 
tion, and extraordinary gifts, they began to confider her as a 
very valuable acquifition to their party. Religion was the 
conftant topic of her converfation : In all companies, and up- 
on all occafions, fhe introduced it. Her time was wholly 
employed in viliting from houfe to houfe, ia making- family 
worfhip, folving doubts, anfwering queftions, and expound- 
ing the Scriptures. Some of the congregation began to en- 
tertain fufpicions of the orthodoxy of her principles, all of 
which had been implicitly imbibed by their minifter. They 
exprefled their diflatisfaction with his minifiry, and defired 
him to difmifs her as a dangerous perfon. He refufed to 
comply with their requefl: They threatened- to libel him. 
He remained firm to her intereft ; and in this he was fup- 
ported by fome of the moft wealthy of his hearers. They 
drew up a paper, containing what they Juppofed to be he:-

principles and his, and detired him 'to declare whether thefe 
were his principles. He acknowledged that they were, and 
readily fubicribed them as fuch. 

They carried the matter before their preSbytery, who 
thought proper to depofe him from the office of the ministry. 
He returned to Irvine, accompanied by his adherents, deli- 
vered up the keys of the church, and preached for fome time 
in a tent, and afterwards in his own houfe. 

The curiofity of the public was excited, and many fre- 
quented his meetings. — Strange accounts were given of their 
doctrine and manner of worfhip. They ufually met in the 
night time, and were instructed by this pretended prophetefs. 
She gave herfelf out to be the woman fpoken of in the 12th 
chapter of the Revelation, and that Mr Whyte was the man- 
child fhe had brought forth. This, and fome other ravings 
She uttered, drew upon her and her party the indignation of 
the populace. Idle people affembled at different times in a 
tumultuous manner, furrounded the houfe, broke the win- 
dows and furniture, and would have proceeded to greater 
extremities, had it not been for the interposition of the ma- 
gistrates. After repeated applications from different mem. 
bers of the Relief congregation to have her apprehended, 
and proceeded againft as a blafphemer, the magistrates thought 
it prudent to difmifs her from the place, which was according- 
ly done May 1784. 

To protect the woman from infult, they accompanied her 
about a mile out of town ; but, notwithstanding all their ef- 
forts, She was grofsly infulted by the mob, thrown into ditch- 
es, and otherwife ill ufed by the way. She took up her resi- 
dence that night, with f ome of her followers, in the neighbour- 
hood of KUmaurs ; and, being joined by Mr Whyte and others 
in. the morning, the whole company, about 40 in number, pro- 
ceeded

cceded on their way to Mauchline, and from thence to Cum- 
nock and to Clofeburn, in Dumfries-fhire r Tinging as they 
went, and faying that they were going to the New Jerufalem. 

Climate and Difeafes.— -The climate here is much the fame 
as in other places on the weft cbaft, more mild and tempe- 
rate than in higher and more inland parts of the country ; 
the fnow often lying on thefe when there is none here, and 
the froft feverer and of longer continuance. The town, from 
its fituation, being at the diftance of one mile from the fea, 
and elevated above it, is reckoned very healthy. 

No epidemical diftempers, but fuch as are common in 
other places, prevail here. 

For thefe laft 1 7 years, the fever has appeared twice only. 
The firft of thefe times it was neither of fo bad a kind, nor 
fo mortal, as in other places in the neighbourhood. In 17901 
and 1791* it was general, and of long continuance, though 
not above 24 died of it. The influenza, as it was called, 
which raged in this country fome years ago, was general here 
alfo, but of fhort continuance, and none of the inhabitants 
died of it. In the year 1760, many of the inhabitants of 
this place died of the bloody Jlux. The infection, it is faid, 
was brought from Ireland. The raoft remarkable inftances 
of longevity in this parifh are, a man of the name of Grant, 
who died in the 105th year of his age ; four of the fame fa- 
mily, whofe ages were as under ; the father 92, his fon 86, 
his grandfon 83, his great-grandfon 80. A woman died laft 
year aged 103. Some are living, and in good health, 84 and 
upwards, one of 94. 

No perfon belonging to this place has been tried for any 
capital crime thpfe 40 years. Some have been banifhed the 
town for petty thefts, and other immoralities. 

Prif oners.

Prifoners.^22 Perfons were committed to prifon during 
the laft year; 12 of thefe for debt, moft of them from the 
country; 5 f or a riot in Saltcoats againft the prefbytery, who 
had gone there, at the requeft of the inhabitants, to infpecT: 
the ftate of the fchool-houfe. AH of them ftood trial before 
the Circuit Court at Ayr ; four of them were found guilty ; 
but, by an error in the verdift, were difmiffed ; two by law- 
burrows, two for riotous conduft, and twb for petty crimes. 

Ancient Religious Orders.— \n this town there was a con- 
Vent belonging to the Carmelite or White Friars. This or- 
der, as is well known, took its name from being originally 
placed in a monaftery by the Patriarch of Antioch tin Mount 
Carmel, about the year 1 160. Being expelled thence in the 
1238, they came into Europe ; and, in the reign of Alex- 
ander III. into Scotland, where they had fix convents befides 
the one at this town. 

Though not the fmalleft vdftige of the buildings now re- 
main, feveral perfons remember to have feen fome fragments 
of its walls a little from the fouth corner of the prefent 
church-yard ; and that piece of ground being now in my 
pofleffion, I lately dug up part of their foundation. It ftood 
near the brink 'of the river, which was a fituation proper for 
the monks of that order, whofe principal food confifted of 
fiih ; and, contiguous to the fame fpot there is a well, ftili 
called the Chapel Well. 

That this friary was founded by the family of Fullarton is 
certain, but in what year cannot now be known, as there is 
reafon to believe that the foundation charter is loft. It is, 
however, very probable that it was before the death of Alex- 
ander III. in the 1285, as the diftrafted ftate of the nation 
for many years after was very unfavourable for ereftions of 
this fort. The firft authentic account that we find relative 

to 



of Irvine* 

{* '±h convent, which, from its purport, may be fuppofed- 
n be long after its foundation, is from a contract and inden- 
ture, dated at Irvine, 24th Auguft 1399, between Reynald 
Fullarton of that Ilk, and the provincial brethren and con- 
vent of the Carmelite Friars hear Irvine, for the purpofc of 
paying 40 merks *, for meliorating and upholding the hoiifes 
of the laid convent, and for repairing the principal kirk and 
c'.oifter J and they were thereby obliged, in all time coming, 
•to pray weekly, on the Lord's day, or any other feaft day,

voice, for the fouls of Sir Adam, and Marjoryjais wife, and 
for Reynald, and Elizabeth his wife, and their heirs and fuc- 
ceffors, and for the fouls of all the faithful deceafed. 

We are informed of fbme emoluments which belonged to 
this friary, from an act palled in the reign of James VI. which 
does much honour to the memory of that Prince. It ought 
therefore to be more particularly known, and fhould render 
the name of James dear to the inhabitants of this town. At 
a time when the church livings belonging to the Popifli 
clergy were generally beftowed upon court paralltes, we find 
this Monarch appropriating what was within the liberties of 
this burgh to a much more laudable purpofe. 

This act bears, that his Majelty had made a perpetual grant 
to the provoft, bailies, counlellors, and communiry of the 
burgh of Irvine, and their fucceHbrs, " of all and fingular

in the middle of the ftreet ; but the ftreet at that place is o£ 
fo great a breadth, that the building may be confidered as 
no incumbrance. It is executed in a plain, fubftantial man- 
ner. In the ground-floor is the town-clerk's office, with a 
room for the meetings of council. The reft is appropriated 
to fhops. O^r the entry to the council chamber the town's

In the town there are two branches of banking-houfes ;

continues the whole week. 

The principal commodities are linen, cloth, horfes, wool,

(Stewartry of Kirkcudbright.— Prejbytery of Dumfries. 
— Synod of Dumfries,) 

By the Reverend Mr James Heron.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifh of Kirkgunzeon is about five miles long, 
and three miles broad. Of old it belonged to thfe 
abbacy of Holm-Coltern, in Cumberland \ but the people of 
that abbacy having taken part with the Englilh again ft the 
Scots in the reign of David Bruce, the King forfeittd their 
property in Scotland, and beftowed it by charter, dated at 
Dunfermline, the 7th ot June 1369, on Sir John Hemes 
of Terregles, who was brother to the Earl of Vendome ift 
France, and who had come into Scotland with King David 
Bruce after his captivity in the year 1341, and affumed the; 
name of Herries, from HerifTons, or porcupines, which he 

0 

bore in his arms, now quartered with the Maxwells of Nithf- 
dale. 

Soil, Appearance, and Agriculture The appearance of the 

country is rather hilly j but there is a good deal of fine flat 
land in the parifh. Some of the hills are healthy, and fit 
for fheep only j others are green, and are both ferviceable 
for tillage and feeding of black cattle. The low land is moft- 



J ^ Statiftical Account 

ly -of a- very fertile nature; but, in general, much interrupted, 
with fmall fwamps, little ftony hills, and large fingk ftones, 
which renders the tillage difficult and irregular. Several of 
the farmers, however, are clearing away the ftones, and turn- 
ing them to the advantageous purpofe of dividing their fields, 
K which laudable undertaking they are greatly encouraged 
by Mr Maxwell Conftable of Nithfdale, who is proprietor of 
more than ieven.eights of the parifh. i This gentleman, if 
the tenant raifes and leads the ftones, allows him the price of 
the building, which may generally be computed to be more 
than one third of the whole expence. The tenant raifing 
and leading the ftones at his leifure times, does not feel the 
burthen ; nor is his rent augmented by perpetual intereft. 
It has likewife for fome time been tfte practice of the proprie- 
tor of this eftate to renew the leafes about three years before 
they are out, which both prevents the tenants -from ufing 
their farms in the fame manner they might be inclined were 
they uncertain of remaining, and gives the landlord an op- 
portunity of looking after the management of fuch as are to 
remove. There are other five properties in the parifh; one 
of thefe is almoft in a ftate of nature; the other four are 
well inclofed, fubdivided, and interfperfed with clumps and 
belts of planting. The farm of Lochend, in particular, on 
which a fmall diftillery has lately been erected, is in the 
higheft pitch of improvement, and fhows, in a ftrong point 
of view, the effects of cultivation. This farm, a few years 
fince, was not worth above one fixth of its prefent value. 
There have been good crops of wheat thefe two Iaft years 
upon fields which were lately covered with heath and rufhes. 
The number of acres in the parifh are about 8000 ; thofe in 
rotation of crop about 3000 ; but it is not eafy to fay how 
much more may be arable, as confiderable tracks of what 
can at prefent only be called pafture grounds, are breaking 

up

tip every year. About 1200 acres are yearly in crop, which 
confifts moftly of oats, barley, and potatoes ; wheat, peafe, 
and turnips, though there are a fhare of them alfo, not being 
general crops. It is probable, however, from fome experi- 
ments lately made, that wheat will often be adopted in place 
of barley, efpecially where the foil is ftrong and heavy. A 
confiderable quantity of (hell marl has been found in the 
parifh, but is moftly exhaufted. The center of the parifh 
beinw only five miles from a convenient fea-port, lime may be 
had from England at a reafonable rate. The tenants have 
not hitherto been much in ufe of fowing grafs-feeds, but are 
now coming faft into practice. More clover has been fown 
in the parifh this laft year than for many former years all 
put together. 

Cattle and Sheep. — There are about 200 horfes in the pa- 
rilh, young ones not fit for fervice being included. There 
are about 2000 black cattle, and upwards of 2000 fheep, of 
the black faced Scots breed, which are kept upon the hills, 
and whofe fleeces, at an average, do not weigh more than 
three pounds Englifh. A few fheep of the Yorkfhire and 
Northumberland breed, kept on the low lands, produce fleeces 
which weigh from fix to ten pounds Englifh each, of excel- 
lent wool. Some lingular fheep produce a great deal more. 
Thefe fheep do not thrive upon the hills ; nor are the hill- 
fheep any thing improven by being croffed with the Englifh 
rams. The late John Dalziel of Barncrofb, a gentleman 
who beftowed great pains in improving the breed of black 
cattle and fheep in this country, tried the experiment in a 
farm he poffefled in this parifli ; but it had a very different 
effect from what he expected. The wool of the brood of 
! thefe Englifh rams was coarfe and fhaggy, and the fheep 
themfelves ill-fhaped and unhardy. 

Rent 



fo* Statyikal Account 

Rent and Productions. — The whole rent of the parifh dq« 
not yet amount to 2000 1. Sterling; but any farms that have 
been lately out of leak, have been raifed one third. The 
number of farms are about 50. None are under 5 1. or more 
than iool. of yearly rent The average rent of the arable 
or pafture ground cannot be eafily afcertained. As fome of 
the beft grounds are cither in the pofleffion of the proprie- 
tors, or are fet by the lump ; but according to the rate of the 
country, the arable might fet from more than 1 1. to lefs than 
5 J the pafture from js. to,,; the meadows, of which 
there are a confiderable proportion, are moflly valued at , I. 
per acre. The ftaple commodities of the parifh are black 
cattle and oat meal, the former bought up for the Englifh 
markets, the latter for the manufacturing towns in the weft 
of Scotland. Liverpool and Whitehaven afford a ready mar- 
ket for barley, and whatever other articles the parifh pro- 
duces, fuch as mutton, wool, pork, butter, cheefe, poultry 
for. are generally fold at Dumfries, which is 9 miles diftant' 
The principal feuel is peats, of which there are abundance' 
Enghlh coal may be had at much the fame price as in Dum- 
fries. 

Awrfr.— The principal road, which divides the parifh in 
almoft equal parts, was made by the commutation monev 
and is m good repair -, as alfo two bridges upon it, that were 
built at the expence of the county. The more private roads 
are improving yearly. The ftatute labour, while it conti 
nued, was of little effect. There has lately been fome pro- 
pofals of bringing the great road from London to Portpatrick 
through this parifh ; fhould this ever take place, it would 
prevent many difagreeable pulls, that cannot otherwife be 
avojded ; but in this cafe there would be 7 or 8 miles of en- 



tire 



of Kirkgunzeoni 191 

y w new roa d to make, and a new bridge to be built over the 
Urr, which might coft 500 1. or 600 1. 

-Population.— The number of fouls in this parilh was, in 
1755, 489; at prefent the number is 520; the number of 
inhabited houfes is 103; there are 7 more males than fe- 
males. There are two men of 90 years old, and feveral of 
80 and upwards. The average of births, for the laft 5 years 3 
has been 18; of marriages, 3 ; of deaths, 10. 

Dlfeafes. Of difeafes, flow rheumatic fevers are the moft 

prevalent, but very few die of them. The fmall-pox, when 
they attack in the natural way, are the moft deftruftivej 
were inoculation more generally in practice, many live* 
Imi^ht in all probability, be faved. Befides thefe that were 
inoculated in this parilh by medical gentlemen in the year 
1788, the minifter inoculated about 50 of the children of 
his pariihioners, all of whom did well and recovered, with- 
out ever having the leaft appearance of danger ; befides 40 
more laft winter, with equal luccefs. 

Church and School.— The patronage of the parifh belongs 
to the family of Nithfdale ; but that family being of the 
Romifh perfuafion, John Maxwell of Terraughty, who is 
Prctelhint, and male reprefentative of the family, is by them 
Vefted with the right of prefentation. The ftipend is 70 1. 
in money. The glebe contains near 1 1 acres of very good 
land, lately inclofed and fubdivided. The manfe was built 
about 40 years ago, is in decent repair, and pleafantly fituat- 
ed in a fmall valley, which is interfered by a fine trouting 
river. The offices have been built about 5 years, and are 
4try complete. The church, which has originally been a 
Romilh chapel, is almoft in a ftate of ruin* but is propofect 

fhortly 



*fi Sfatijlical Accom 

fcortly to be rebuilt. The roof, which is of a peculiar CO J 
ftrudion, is faid to have been formed at Holmcultern in] 
Cumberland, and brought hither when the parifh of Kirk- 
gunzeort belonged to the Abbecy. There is, properly fpeak- 
ing, but one fchool in the parifh. The fchool and fchool.- 
matter's houfe were built at the expence of the heritors. 
The (alary is ill. Sterling. 

Ancient Buildings. —There are three ancient buildings in 
the parifh, Barclolh, Corrah, and Drumcultran. Bardofh is 
faid to have been one of the feats of the family of Herrifes, 
but there are no records when it was built • it feems to have 
been a pl.ee of refuge, defended more by nature than by art, 
being remote and inacceffible. The Corrah, which has been 
both a large building and a place of confiderable ftrength, 
was built by Sir John Maxwell, brother to the Earl of Nithf- 
dale, who married Agnes, eldeft daughter of William Lord 
Herries, and by her got the eftate and titles of Terregles. 
This was the Lord Herrics who was fo eminent in the reign 
of Queen Mary, and who, though he was a loyal fubjea to 
her Majefty, was yet a reformer, and caufed unroof both the 
abbecies of Sweetheart and Dundrennan. Befides the Cor- 
rah, he alio built Mofcrops Tower at Terregles, which has 
lately been taken down, and a princely manfion erecled in its 
room. Lord Herries was fucceeded, in his eftate and titles, 
by his fori William, who, it is probable, had refided fome 
time at the Corrah, as a pigeon-cote, built in the year 1583, 
was inferibed with his name, and the name of his lady Ka- 
tharine Kerr. The Corrah was afterwards inhabited by Mr 
Maxwell of Breconfide, a connedion of the family, who 
was one of 29 children by the fame mother, who was firft 
married to Gordon of Lochenvar, whofe two eldeft fons 



were

were the firft Lords of Kenmure, and who, alongft with Mr 
Maxwell of Breconfide, juft now mentioned, were fuppofed 
to be the handfomeft and ftrongeft men in the county. A 
part of the Corrah is now poffefTed as a farm houfe j the 
greateft part has been taken down, and houfes built with the 
materials. In one of the apartments which remain, there is 
an old oaken bed, faid to be the nurfery bed of the family, 
which is yet almcft entire, curioufly carved and figured, and 
is a piece of great antiquity. The Tower of Drumcultran is 
not lo very ancient as to deferve any particular defcription ; 
nor are there any remarkable antiquities, unlefs the veftiges 
of three Roman camps, and a Druidical temple, mould be 
mentioned. Thefe things are very common in this part of the 
country, and do not feem to claim any farther attention.

THAT chain of mountains, which nearly divides Scot- 
land, called the Grampians, may be confidered as ter- 
ininating at the German Ocean, in this parilh. It forms al- 
fo the north-eaft point of the county of Kincardine. It is 
attached to the commiflarifc of St. Andrew's, but belongs to 
the prefbytery and fynod of Aberdeen. In fhape it is a pe- 
ninfula. 'The word Nigg is faid to mean, in Celtic, a penin-

with two cairns, which are feen feveral leagues off, and direct 
thofe who fail near the coaft. The north fide of the pariOi 
confifts of two haughs, on the river and the fide of a hill, 
ending in the Girdlenefs, and of a valley and hill beneath 
the heathy ridge. Though a part of the foil be clayifh, the 
far greater part is loamy, of various depth, and on different 
bottoms, in fome places incumbered with ftones. The haughs, 
the valley, and fides of the two hills, to the north, are ara- 
ble. The bank to the fouth is in good part ploughed. A 
broad belt, of above a mile, more and lef's, throughout the 
middle, and the whole length of the parilh, with the excep- 
tion of fome acres lately cultivated, is unarable and uninha-

■fand beach, and that port being formed by a river, has often 
a furge riling quickly at its mouth, by the wind blowing in 
fhore, dangerous to boats ; here, therefore, they have often

found fafety. From this place, though there be feveral In- 
dented hollows along the coaft, and though an attempt was 
lately made, by a fmall pier, to fit one of them to receive 
boats, there is no harbour for them 4 miles round, till they 
come to Aberdeen. 

The latitude is 57 deg. 9 min. north; the longitude is 2 
deg. 9 min. weft. In time of war a flag is hoifted on a ftaff 
half a mile from the point, on the moft raifed eminence, as 
a fignal, when an enemy's fhip is in the offing. There is 
free open fea along this coaft. The water riles, at fpring 
tides, 13 feet ; and the height of the ftream is at 45 minutes 
paft noon, at full and change. The tide of flood runs fouth- 
weft and by fouth ; that of ebb, north-eaft half north, and 
at the rate of 3 and 4 knots in the hour. The variation of 
the compafs is 25 degrees weft, and has increafed a degree 
within thefe 7 years. From 6 and 8 fathoms at the rock 
foot, the bottom deepens, fhelving off fhore, with fandy, 
rocky, and various ground, and fometimes rifing, till it finks 
to 90 fathoms, at the diftance of 10 or 11 leagues from land; 
then it afcends on the lifhing bank, the Long Forties, to 33, 
34» or 35 fathoms, a few leagues over, until it falls into the 
depth of the north fea. 

Rivers, Lakes, &amp;c. — The Dee, which forms the harbour 
of Aberdeen, after a courfe pretty much north-eaft, of 80 
miles, fills here into the fen. On this fide of the harbour 
is Torry Pier, where veffcls come to unload lime, and take 
in cargoes of ftones ; above which lie the boats of the fifher- 
men, ferving alfo as pilots, who inhabit the village of Torry. 
The tide flows more than two miles farther up the river, to 
a bridge over it, and even to the boundary of the parifh ; 
but there is no navigation up the ftream, except for boats and 
lighters about a mile, on account of the fhallows in it. The

Dee is a clear rapid river, flowing moftly through gravelly 
foil, favourable to natural wood, and fometimes rifes to over- 
flow the haughs, carry off part of the mould, and fweep a- 
way corns. The upper haugh in this parifh is a little ex- 
pofed, and in autumn 1768 fuffered. One lake, the Loch 
of Lorftown, is on the fouth-weft boundary, oblong in form, 
covering 27 acres, and fuppiying water to the only mill here. 
There is alfo one chalybeat fpring, though not frequented 
for any diieafes ; but fprings of fine water abound. 

Face of the Country, &amp;c: — Being destitute of wood, the 
face of the country is naked. In the laft age, a grove feems 
to have been by the harbour mouth to the edge of the water. 
And befides many remains of oak dug out of the mofs, 
flumps of trees, which mult have been one and a half, and 
two feet diameter, ftill (land on the eaft fide of it, above 
ground. Fine grafs, mingled with many herbs, grows early 
on the lea banks, and rock top, almolt ever green from the 
fpray and dews. Through the large uncultivated, and, for 
the molt part, uncultivable fpace of this parifli, a low heath 
is fpread. The fearlide and hill pafture is reckoned good 
and wbolefome for fheep, and almofl never is covered to any 
depth with fnow. The corn fields are liable to the common 
. weeds, efpecially to ikelloch, (moftly wild muftard), for 
which, to fow late after ploughing, when the plant is rifen 
up, and may be deftroyed by harrowing, has been tried with 
fuccels. 

Many ftones of the granite kind lie on the furface, which, 
with thofe taken from the rock by the fea, and under ground, 
are fome of a beautiful bluilh, and others of a purple and va- 
rious heu. They fupply abundant materials for building and 
inclofing. Several ipecies here, from the attraction of the 
magnet, feem to be volcanic ; fo are others in the hills far

up the Dee. If this experiment is a certain indication, ii$ 
what condition muft this country have once been ? 

Climate and Difeafes — The air is healthy : Along the coaft 
ft is frefh, and, from the influence of the fea, to the fenfe 
colder ; yet the froft is lefs intenfe, fnow continues fhorter 
time, and the crop ripens fooner than in places a little inland. 
The eaft wind brings a moifture, and fometimes, particularly 
in the month of May, mifts come off the fea ; but the cli- 
mate cannot be called damp; rather, from the moderate 
quantity of rain which falls upon this eaft coaft, perhaps a- 
bout 27 inches annually, from the light, loamy, fandy foil, 
abforbing it foon, and from the frequent breezes, it may be 
reckoned dry. This allows grain to be fown pretty early 5 
oats, from the middle of march, and bear, from the middle 
of April ; potatoes are planted in April j turnip is fown from 
the beginning of June. The crop ripens in general foon. 
In this fea air, iron is foon corroded. It brings alfo on the 
lurface of many bodies, efpecially in a northern and eaftern 
expofure, a fog, or green fpecies of mofs. To the growth 
of timber and fruit it feems unfavourable, at leaft till fhel- 
ter be acquired. No difeafes of an epidemic nature prevail 
here, except brought by contagion. Agues are unknown. 
The fmall-pox, for which inoculation is not uled, once 
in a few years fpreads, efpecially among the fifher families, 
whofe communication with one another is open, and carries 
off fometimes many children. From the more fadentary 
life of women now, at knitting ftockings, hyfteric complaints 
are thought frequent. The inhabitants live to a moderate 
age. The fifhermen are very little fubjedt to difeafes through 
mid-life ; but expofed, from their occupation, to difafters. 
Of 30 men in boats at the Cove, within 3 years 9 have pe- 
riflied. 

Ancient 



Ancient Population, and State.-Vrom the end of the laft 
rpmnrv t0 the middle of the prefent, the population of tfatf 
pal las about one fourth greater than now. The country 
L alfo filled with the cattle of 17 ploughs, 10 and 12 to 
the plough , and covered with above 2000 fheep. From 
about the war .740, the population has declined to the year 
I7 86 The cattle were reduced, rapidly near the laft period, 
to fcarce one plough-, and there remained not one fheep. 
The caufes of this depopulation feem to have been thclc : 
The drain of men, principally to the fleet, in the different 
wars , an increasing turn to the fea-faring life, to ****** 
and manufactures S from a prohibition, «d the moffes being 
xngh exhaufted, the occupation of preparing and carrying 
fuel to Aberdeen flopped. The new mode of agriculture 
contributed here to the fame general effect. The tenants 
found, with the ideas' of inclofing and green crops, their 
fheep difturbed j and they put flocks of them away. The 
profpeft of a divifion of the parifh, which almoft wholly lay 
m run ridge, and the fhort, uncertain leafes in view to it, 
led them to put away the remainder, to give up their oxen, 
and to plough on their fields with horfes, deprived of the 
dung of cattle and fheep, the wet grounds being turned low, 
or neglected. 

Divifion ofthePariJh, and Improvements.— From the abbacy 
of Arbroath, to which this parifh belonged, one half of it, 
alternate ridge, came to a predcccflbr of Mr John Menzies 
of Pitfoddels, who now poffelfes it. The town of Aberdeen- 
holds the other half, purchafed with monies mortified prin- 
cipally for promoting education and religious inftruction. 
That community has alfo fome property, which had remain- 
ed feparate. By the arbitration of two gentlemen, the parifh. 
was divided in 1786, the town of Aberdeen obtaining the

fide along the lower part of the harbour, and round the 
coaft, and Mr Menzies that up the river, and inland. He 
has now let his grounds in the following manner : Divided 
into fmall lots, from 10 1. to 30 1. fome of which are taken 
in leafe together, and fome even fubdivided. The tenants 
are obliged to do fomething in inclofing them, and to keep 
part in grafs and green* crop. As an incitement to meliorate 
the land, the rent rifes a little at the end of 9, and again at 
the end of 19 years ; while the temptation to exhauft it is 
removed by the uncertain term of a lifetime to which the 
leafe extends beyond the laft period. The town-council of 
Aberdeen have feued out their {hare in nine moderate lots, 
from about 30 1. to 90 1. each. By becoming private pro! 
perty, a new fpur is given to render it more valuable. Ac- 
cordingly, every feuer has made fome progrefs in improving 
his ground ; and fome of them, by building ftone-fences, 
draining and dreffing the furface, as well as by laying on 
lime, and erecting farm-houfes and fteddings, have done 
much to change the face of their property. Indeed, a fpirit 
of induftry and improvement has gone out, and reached the 
loweft cottager. Multures and embarraffing fervices are abo- 
lifhed. Part of the formerly plowed land is regaining. Oxen 
are brought in, and reared of a larger fize. Cows are kept 
to a greater number than ever ; and fome fheep are intro- 
duced. The population has increafed from new families 
coming in, and from the fettlement which has taken place. 
The people who, in 1787, were 1024, are now 1090. They 
are alfo becoming better accommodated. Within the fpace 
of a few years, 70 houfes have been built in a fubftantial 
manner, and fuitable for' the different poffefibrs, at the ex- 
pence of above 1200 1.

are univerfally ufed ; and, in thefe rifing grounds, drawn by 
two horfes. The bell: form of other implements of hufband- 
ry, and beft modes of agriculture, and rotation of crops, are 
only beginning to be underftood and tried. 

Manures.— To animal dung and afhes, that manure pro- 
duced in the filhing villages, from the mixture of all oily 
and fifhy fubRances, is ufed. It favours bear and green 
crops } but, when ufed much, renders the foil unfit for pro- 
ducing oats. Hence that foil is called poifoned land. Another 
manure is ware and fea-weed. It is brought to land in the 
Bay of Nigg, and at the mouth of the harbour principally, 
after an agitation of the fea, when the wind blows in points 
from the north, round by the weft, to the fouth ; that is, 
blows from the land ; fo that the breeze which would carry 
a body out to fea on its furface, brings this fubftance, at the 
bottom, or fwimming in it, in a contrary direction, on fhore; 
an object fuggefting the manner of the internal motion of 
water agitated by wind *. This ware is of three kinds, ob- 
tained at different feafons. The firft is the green flake, 
which grows in the river, is wafhed down by the fummer 
floods, and is brought afhore at the harbour- mouth. The 
jfecond kind is compofed of various marine plants torn from 
the rocks by the ftorms, and driven to land, from the end of 
harveft throughout winter. The laft is the top of the earn 
tangle, {fucus digitatus fuppofed), which that plant throws, 
commonly in the end of May, or fometimes later, efpecially 
with rains or motion of the fea, and is carried to fhore. 
The fea-weed produces a crop of bear, a little inferior in.

Lime is purchafed about 2s. the boll, Scotch, and 2 s. yd. 
Englifb, unflaked, nearly 7*. cubic feet meafure ; yielding, 
the firft, 2 bolls fully, the other near three bolls flaked lime, 
and is ufed in different quantities with luccefs. 

Crop 1790. — The proportions of the different kinds of 
grain ("own, and roots and grafs, with their probable produce, 
and the manner in which they are difpofed, are thefe : 

362 Acres in oats, may be computed to have produced 5 
bolls the acre, the produce, or an equivalent, and much more 
being confumed by the people. 

169 Acres in bear, may have produced 7 bolls the acre, 
of which a part is made into meal for ufe, and one half may 
be fold to the breweries and diftilleries. 

1 8 Acres in peafe, may have produced 4 bolls the acre, 
partly confumed, and partly fold. 

54 Acres in potatoes, yielded about 30 bolls the acre, 512 
pounds Amfterdam in the boll, a large fliare of which is con- 
fumed within the parifh, and 600 or 700 bolls are carried to 
Aberdeen market, or exported. 

70 Acres in turnip and in rye grafs, and red and white 
clover. 

114 Acres, part of which is cut for hay, produced food, 
with the pafture, and various fodder, for 46 working oxen, 
230 cows, and the young cattle ; the milk of the cows being 
ufed in families, employed for rearing calves for breed or 
fale, and fold in the fifliing villages, or without the parifh. 
Tew cattle are fed for market. The hill-pafture, along with 
the cattle, had only 209 fheep, and 12 goats. From the 
crop alfo was the Vupport of 87 horfes, nlmoft all for the' 
draught. The ploughs wrought by them and cattle are 33, 
the wains 5, and carts and carriages for ftones 69. 

Caufcivaf 



Caufiwy Stow—Oblong roundilh pebbles, from 6 to 12 
inches in length, are brought by fea and land carriage from 
the fea-fhore, and are exported to different places in England 
for ordinary caufeways. The collecting and carnage of a 
ton may be 1 s. 8 d. i and the quantity exported annually 
400 tons. 

In 1766, the granite quarries by the fea and in the nius 
were opened for making caufeway ftones to pave fome ftreets 
in London. This granite is of a remarkably clofe texture, 
and of great hardnefs. To this new work 600 men were 
collected from different places. It led many families to fet- 
tle for a time in the parilh, and employed fome horles m 
drawing the ltones, where water conveyance could not be 
obtained. Decreafing rapidly from 1772, it now engages 
only 17 inhabitants, with a few ftrangers. The fbape of the 
formed ftone is fomething wedge-like, 12 inches long in the 
head, 6 broad, and 9 deep, being 2 inches leffened in length 
and in breadth on the bafe : The fmaller in umiiar propor- 
tions. The ton may be made by a man in two days, colls 
2s. 6d. befides the expence of powder and tools; and will 
pave, according to the lize of the ftones, from 2] to 5 fquare 
vards. 3000 Tons are now annually exported to London, 
Maidftone, Ramfgate, and other places. The cubic foot 
.weighs 151 pounds. This new and heavy employment re- 
quired and introduced a better breed of horfes. The wages 
. were at firft too high ; lb that a man gained 1 8 s. and 20 s. 
in a week, which did him no good. Except by a few indi- 
viduals, all was fpent. 

Fiperles and Salmon Fficrs.— -The falmon fifhers, 23 in 
, number, almoft all of whom have pieces of ground, are en- 
gaged in fluYing the river and the fea adjacent, and :ir^ em- 
ployed at vacant hours diligently in cultivating the land.

The manner of their general payment is favourable to oeco- 
nomy and exertion. A man has commonly fo many bolls of 
meal, money to purchafe boots, a fee, and a premium on the 
quantity of fifh caught. According to the length of time he 
is engaged, and the fuccefs of the fifhing, he may gain from 
5 1. to 15 1. in the feafon. 

White Fifhers. — A greater number is employed in the white 
-fifhing, or that for different kinds of fifh in the fea. In the 
villages of Cove, 24 men in 4 boats, befides 14 young and 
aged in yauls, are occupied in this manner. In the only 
other village, of Torry, 36 men are in 6 boats, fifhers, and 
atting as pilots ; and 9 in youth or age, go to fea occafion- 
ally in yauls ; in whole 83. The ordinary fare of pilotage is 
6 s. The round of fifhing through the year, and different 
manner of it, fome particulars of which are applicable to the 
eaft coaft of Scotland, are thefe : 

In January the haddock has roe, is in good condition, and 
ordinarily comes on the coaft in fqualls. Towards March, 
the fmall flat fifh, fait fluke, and plaife, are in their prime 
on the fand bottom. After May, the haddock recruited, and 
the whiting good, are taken in moderate quantities, and a 
few turbot. From November, the cod, in beft ftate, is 
catched on the rocky ground. This is the fifhing with the 
fmall line, and takes place at different diftances, but common- 
ly not far from land. The quantity of line found fufficient 
for a man to manage at fea and fhore, contains 36 fcores, 
720 hooks, (in fummer a few more), one yard diftant from 

each other other, on fnoods of horfe hair, value 1 5 s. The 

next fifhing is with the dog line. In Augufl: frequently the 
fea-dog, that voracious fifh, confuming all before it, comes to 
4 and 3 leagues from fhore, fometimes nearer, and is taken in 
conlidcrable quantities j 20 yielding, when good, one Scotch 

. pint 



ofNtgg. *°5 

pint of oil (io d. or i s.) from the liver; and the fifli being 
fold to country people, or dried for ufe. A ftronger line, 
with larger hooks, for this fifhing, contains 24 Gores, 480^ 
yarddiftant, and cofts los.-The laft fifhing is with the 
great line. From March or April, as the weather permits, 
it commences. After catching fmall fifh for bait, the fiflier- 
men go off farther into the fea, to two and feveral more 
leagues from fhore, to find the larger fpecies. The ling is 
firft in good ftate, then the hollobut, (here called turbot), 
and afterwards the Ikate in May and June. Large cod, cal- 
led keilling, are alfo got in fpring and fummer. The line 
for all thele is of confiderable ftrength, and contains, at 41 
fathoms diftance from each other, on fnoods of one fathom, 
3 fcores, 60 large hooks, in value 25 s.— For the fmall fifh 
they ufe a yaul 17 feet long, 7 1. value, dividing fometimes 
for defpatch into two parties, and taking in a young or old 
man when they go fhort way from fhore. But to the dog- 
fifhing they ufe a boat 23 feet long, by 9 fully wide, with 2 
fmall mafts and fails, 15I. in value, and have 6 men. In 
this flender vefTel, in which they feek the larger fifh towards 
fummer, they venture off, with compafs, to the bank, 14 or 
1 5 leagues from land, and draw their lines twice or thrice 
before they return. 

From the ftatement it appears, a fifherman needs only 
al. 10 s. for lines; and this fmall outfet, fometimes lefs, 
enables him, at the age of 19 or 20, to gain bread as well as 
his father, and therefore to marry and raife a family, which 
foon he generally does. 

The bait for the fmall fifh is the limpet, gathered ufually 
by the children from the rocks ; the fand eel, dug out of the 
fand, or caught behind the mefhes of a net by bafkets ; a 
worm got in the fand, lug ; fome offals from the butcher- 
market falted, and the mufcle. They go to Montrofe, fome 

of 



Statj/lkal Account 



of them twice or thrice in the fummer, and bring a loading 
of the boat, at the expence of above 2 1, to each crew, at 
every time. The mufcles, caft upon the rock where tlie 
*ide overflows, hold if the weather be fettled, and remain till 
ufed. If a ftorm prevents them catching hold, and after 
they are expended, it cofts a fifherman from 3 d. to 8 d. for 
others each time he goes to fea ; and this often in the winter, 
when the fifhing of January failing, as it has done thefe feve- 
ral years, he will not gain more than their value. The divi- 
fion of the catch is one equal fhare to a man, after a feventh 
for the boat. The fifh are carried to Aberdeen market, 
where they bring a price double what it was 30 years fince, 
but variable with the quality, the rarenefs, and quantity. 

Shell Fijb.— About four years ago, 3 new method was 
brought in at the Cove for catching the lobfter, which is 
good in fpring, and the crab, which becomes fo in fummer. 
A bafket, 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, nearly a cylinder, cutting 
a good fection off for a bafe, is formed of plain wood, in flits, . 
for the bottom, and of hoops for the curve, netted over. ) 
From the ends the net-work is wrought inward into a nar. 
row entrance for the fifh, bait being hung within to entice 
it. It is funk with a weight, having a rope and buoy. The  
crab enters, falls down, and cannot get out. To the effect j 
of this Ample machine, which cofts 10 s. 6d. they attribute 
the cloathing of their families after the hardfliips of 1783, 
and fome following years. That for lobfiers is of lefs fize, 
and funk near the rock foot. From 12 at night, in fummer, 
to feveral hours into morning, the fifherman goes out to fea, 
lays his line at dawn, which is the beft time for the fifhing, j 
at flack of ebb or flow, when the current of tide does not 
impede, and returns with his catch. Then he draws his ' 
creels for fhell-fifh. The woman, who has been from 3 or 4 

o'clock 



of Nigg* ■ 207 
a'clocl- carrying home fuel, or engaged at the rocks, bears 

to hou r.hold affairs. A boy or girl, from I*, », to z^ears 
° * has been employed in gathering bait. After the ne- 
ceffarVexpences of bait and lines, a man in this hazardous 
m anner of life, with his wife and child, has gained in thefe 
feven paft unfavourable years, fcarce 10I. annually. During 
fome later months of winter, the fubfiftence of the family has 
depended much on the work of the females. Since the com- 
rnencement of the American and French war 1778, 24 men 
have been hnpreffed or entered to ferve their country in the 
fleet from the fifher families. In thefe late armaments, their 
•ufhing has been interrupted from fear of their young men 
being feized ; and to procure 10 men, inftead of one from 
each boat, who have been demanded from them, the crews 
have paid 106 1. 14 s. which exhaufted the fubftance of fome 
families, and hung long a debt on others. 

Marine Plants.— To help their maintenance, the fifher. 
women at times, and alfo fome women of the country, from 
the beginning of fummer, go to the rocks at low tide, and 
gather the fucus palmatur, dulfe ; fucus efculentus, badderlock ; 
and fucus pinnatifdus, pepper dulfe, which are relifhed in this 
part of the country, and fell them. 

Kelp.— The fea-ware, or bladder-fucus, grows up in three 
years on the rocks round the Nefs and Bay chiefly, to a con- 
dition for being cut, dried, and burned into kelp. In 1791, 
1 1 tons, of a fine quality, were made by 33 women, moftly 
young women, at 8 d. per day, with the direction of an over- 
Teer. 

ManufaBure.—The whole female part of the parifh, when 

not

not occupied by thefe engagements, or harveft, the mofs, 
and domeftic affairs, work at knitting woollen ftockings, the 
materials of which they generally receive from manufacturers 
in Aberdeen. The work of the few tradefmen and others, 
is chiefly for the accommodation of the people. 

The male children of the land people, from 9 and 10 years 
old, often herd cattle in fummer, and thofe of all attend 
fchool in winter. The female children learn ftill earlier to 
knit and to read.

Among the land people, rhere has been a great migration, 
moftiy down the country towards the coafts ; very little a- 
mqng the filhers. No land man becomes a fifher. From 
this place, fome go to learn handicrafts, to manufactures, and 
abroad. Since 1778, 70 have been, for a longer or fhorter 
time, failors ; 44 have ferved in the fleet. Several natives 
have applied to (hip- building and commerce, with fpirit and 
fuccefs. None attach themfelves to ftudious engagements. 

Rent. — The valued rent is 1562 1. 6s. Scots; the real 
rent, about 900 1. Sterling. Rent of houfes, and fued land 
in Torry, is about 90!. Land, on the fide near Aberdeen, 
is let from 2 1. 1 2 s. 6 d. per acre downward ; for potatoes, 
ploughed, with ?. little afiiftance of carriage, for a crop at 61. 
at a medium through the pafifh', at 20 s. \ poor ground 
lower. 

Roads. — Since the divifion of the parifh, many lines of 
road have been formed, at the expence of the feuers, and with 
the ftatute labour ; but none fubftantially completed. 

Fuel, — By peat from fome remainder of mofs, and from 
moffes in the parifh of Banchory Devenick, with fome turf, 
and a few coals, the people are expenfively ferved.

Ecclefiajlical State. — The crown is patron. The church, 
anciently called St. Fiacer Church, and the north-eaftmoft 
houfe of the parifh, was built before this century, and is de- 
cent. The manfe was built 1 759. The ftipend, confifting 
of 52 bolls bear and meal, together with the money and al- 
lowance for communion elements, may be reckoned 89 1. 
The glebe of 10 acres inclofed, 18 1. The fchoolmafter has 
a falary of 81. 6 s. 8 d. as feffion clerk and precentor, 2 I. ; 
and with perquifites and dues of teaching, 1 s. 6d. for Eng- 
lifh, and 2 s. for writing and arithmetic, may complete 20 1. 
He is accommodated with a fchool-houfe and garden. A 
fchoolmafter at the Cove, 3 miles diftant from the parochial 
fchool, has the fame accommodation, with a fmall gratuity. 
Above 70 are taught, belides fome by women. 

Poor. — The number of thofe requiring ftated help, or oc- 1 
calional fupply, is 25, none of whom beg, except one who is 
above 80, goes a little about, from habit. The funds for their 
fupply are, intereft of 50 1. of which 27 1. J 5 s. 6 d. was lefc

Imall burdens, this fum is diftributed amorlg the poor, who 
are fatisficd. They underftand their effects, at death, to be. 
long to the funds ; but this is rather a preventive of impro- 
per application, than any fource of emolument, there being 
leldom occafion to demand hoarded fubftance from relations. 
In 1783, by the exertions of charity within the parifh, with 
•a fmall allowance of meal from government, the poor were 
fupplied, and fome families extraordinarily helpecf, without 
encroachment on the funds. That feafon increafed the fpi- 
rit of induftry, repreffed intemperance, and introduced, by 
importation, fome new and earlier kinds of oats into this 
country.— In 1787, three filliermcn, loft off the Cove, left 
widows, children, and depending relatives, for whom, befides 
the collections in this and the neighbouring parifh, a fub- 
fcription ws»s opened in Aberdeen, and, from the generous 
humanity of perfons there, and fome others, near 60 1. were 
contributed. In 1790, 6 men perifhed, leaving 5 widows 
and 25 children, one half helplefs, for whom, by the heri- 
tors, by collections in the neareft parifhes, and principally in 
Aberdeen, above 131 1. were contributed. Both thefe fums, 
under the management of fome gentlemen, do afford an aid 
half yearly to the poor families ; and the children are taught 
and inured to induftry, promifing to fill the place of their 
fathers in an ufeful, and not eafily fupplied employment. In 
view to the helplefs condition of a fiflierman in old age, any 
favings through life being almoft unknown to him, in 1772 a 
plan was propofed to the fiflhers in Torry, to give in 2 s. 6 d. 
each, and 1 s. annually ; fome captains of fhips, and others, 
adding a little gratuitoufly. There was an odd 2 d. in the 
divilion of their pilotage fare, which they added. By the 
attention of fome gentlemen, natives of this place, the mo- 
ney, allowed to accumulate on intereft, without diftribution, 
for 10 years, has rifen to 170 1. and 1 1 I. are annually divid- 
ed j

ed ; 10 s. to each old man, and 7 s. i d. to each widow, every 
half year. The odd 2 d. formerly kept for a drink to the 
crew, has been the principal fource of increafe ; the means 
of a 'little enjoyment, perhaps, of intemperance, becoming 
the fupply of indigence. A fimilar inftitution has been com- 
menced lately at the Cove. 

Cujloms. — In the month of May, many of the lower ranks 
from around the adjacent city, come to drink of a well in 
the Bay of Nigg, called Downy-well •, and proceeding a little 
farther, go over a narrow pais, The Brigg of ae Hair *, to 
Downy-hill, a green ifland in the lea, where young people 
cut their favourites names in the fward. It feems to be the 
remains of fome fuperftitious refpect to the fountain, and re- 
treat of a reputed faint, gone into an innocent amufement. 
The Bay, from the corruption probably of his name, was for- 
merly called San Fittick's Bay f . On the fudden death of 
their relations, or fear of it, by the fea turning dangerous, 
the filher people, efpecially the females, exprefs their forrow 
by exclamation of voice, and gefture of body, like the eaftern 
nations, and thofe in early ftate of civilization. 

Antiquities. — Whatever purpofe cairns may have ferved, 
the two principal ones here could have anfwered well for 
watch towers, and kindling fires on them to advertife the 
country, on the approach of hoftile fliips. 

A few years ago, in removing the green fod of the eaftmofl: of 
4 fmali conical hills, above the inner entrance of the harbour, 
there was found a broad covering ftone, two fide ftones above 
two feet long, and two end ftones fhorter, without mark of 

inftrument, 

* Bridge of one hair. 

f Sanclus Fitticus, or Monfutucus, perhaps. 



2I 4 Statiflical Account 

inftrument, and within them an urn 6 inches high, formed 
of dark baked earth, with a yellowifli cruft, figured fimply. 
lately the remaining ruins of an edifice, belonging to the Ab- 
bey of Arbroath, were dug up, on the upper part of the 
harbour. A burial ground was nigh. Silver pieces, ftruck 
on Queen Mary's marriage, 1559, and others, were found. 
It retains the name of Abbot's Walls. 

Difadvantages..— On the northern part of the bank, above 
the fea, and facing it, in the beginning of harveft, fome years, 
the wind, in a fouth-eaft ftorm, carries the fea-fpray up gul- 
lies, and over the face of the rock, and fome fait dew, a con- 
siderable way on the land, which hurts the crop of ripening 
oats. Timely rain may recover it ; if not, it comes to no 
farther maturity, and the flxaw is little fit for ufe, being too 
laxative. This harm is called blading. By the temporary 
and exceffive gain in bringing to more prohibited goods, to 
which the feafaring people here are little tempted now, no 
folid acquifition was made; it commonly has been fpent to their 
moral prejudice : And when one has been hurt in the employ- 
ment, he has been left to languifh neglected. The poor have 
fuftained, for many years paft, the lofs of 5 per ant. on the 
weekly collections, by bad copper. Such coin being at lift 
refufed, by thofe who, for juft debt, have a right to good 
money, muft, in the end, generally be thrown in to the poor ; 
who, in this part of the country, with the fupport of the fick 
in the Infirmary of Aberdeen, in the collections made for it, 
have fuffered much. To injuftice in importing fuch money, 
there is inhumanity. 

When the fifliing of January fails, the fi fliers are put to 
fevere hardfhips in the laft winter months ; efpecfally the 
laying out as much, or more, for mufcle-bait, than they can 
gain, difcourages them from going to fea fo frequent!;.-, or (b 



well 



well prepared as they might do. Indeed the condition of 
the fifliers on this coaft needs to be relieved. A hardy race 
of men, more prolific than any other, fo cheaply out-fitted 
to gain bread and raile a family, employed in bringing in an 
additional quantity of food, affording fuch a number to the 
fleet for our common defence, and giving fuch a fum for 
fubftitutes of one from each boat; they certainly deferve 
of their country, and do eflential fervice. At the fame time, 
fheir gain for a livelihood, were they fenfible of it, is infe- 
rior now to that of many other ways of life ; and by conti- 
nuance, they may be tempted, as fome of them elfewhere 
have been, to change it for the chance of another. In ad- 
dition to fuch generous and humane exertions for their fa- 
milies on difafter, as have already been made, fome mean3 
promifing benefit feem to be thefe : To preferve the coaft 
open to them for bait ; to make the mufcle, for the purpofe 
of bait, cheap ; to order the number required from them for 
the fleet, fo as to put them no more in fear of imprefling, 
which interrupts their buflnefs ; nor to fuch expence for fub- 
ftitutes, which has oppreffed their families ; to render the 
wages of thofe who have died on board his Majefty's fhips 
recoverable at a low expence, which, it is hoped, the bill in- 
troduced by Mr Dundas will do ; and to make prize-money 
recoverable. An experiment might be made to improve the 
diftant fifliery. If a few decked veffels, which could wea- 
ther a little rough fea, were employed on the bank, the boats 
could uepofit their cargoes with them, and could have re- 
c'ourfe to them in danger, while the crews might fifli with 
the hand line. The fifliers prefently fee 2, 5, 7, and more 
Dutch fhips at a time on this bank fo engaged ; and they 
obferve them catching many more cod and ling than them* 
felves, which they attribute to the bait being hung at fome 
diftance from the bottom by the hand-line, where thefe fifli 

fwim j 



216 Statiftical Account 

fwim ; while their own ground lines are fitter for taking 
fkate and hollobut, which keep by the bottom. 

Melioration — The city of Aberdeen is hemmed in by the 
fea on the eaft, by Old Aberdeen on the north, and by the 
river Dee on the fouth : It is only open, for any extent, to 
the weft. Hence the high rent of land around it, perhaps 
among the higheft in the kingdom. It has been often men- 
tioned, that eafy accefs to this parifh, by a bridge over the 
Dee, at the neareft proper fituation, might enlarge the fpace 
of gardening ground. It would certainly tend, in a high 
degree, to meliorate the northern fide of this parifh. Per- 
haps a road to the fouth, Iefs fteep than the prefent one up 
Tollo-hill, might be the confequence. 

The quarries have hurt fome parts of the hill, but there 
remains a considerable range of pafture for fheep, and the 
introduction of as many as it will carry feems neceffary for 
filling fuch a wafte, and for the improvement of the country. 
Without a melioration of the roads, horfes will be able to do 
little on them in winter ; even people can hardly come 
through the weftern part of them to church ; fome do not. 

Character. — The people, on the whole, are not defective 
in underftanding, and are very induftrious. They are decent, 
content with their lot, fober, and charitable : It were to be 
wifhed that their impreflions of religion were deeper. No 
crime, of a heinous nature, has been committed in the me- 
mory of any living. Among the filhers, a ftrife of words 
may be at a time, which is foon laid ; they are ready to feize 
any thing in the fea, whofe owner is not afcertained, not to 
plunder the wreck ; but of taking a mufcle from the fea-bed 
of another, or keeping back a penny of the common fifli, a 
fufpicion was never heard. They are not deftitute of the

fpirit of adventure and fympathy. On one of the boats off 
the Cove harbour being overturned in a ftorm., the men cling- 
ing to the bottom of it ; their companions were juft come in 
with hazard from the fame danger, opprefled by toil, and 
forrow at the fpedlacle, when one of them faid, " We live 
« together, let us die together •" and roufing his fellows by 
his example, run down, launched a boat, and refcued three 
out of the four periihing people.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4882715">BELHELVIE</name>. 

(County of Aberdeen.— Prejbytery and Synod of Aber 

deen.) 

By the Reverend Mr Alexander John Forsyth,</head>



<p>Situation, 

THIS parifli is fituated in that divifion of the county of 
Aberdeen called Formartin, which divifion includes all 
the lands on the fea coaft between the ritf ers Don and Ythan„ 

Appearance and Soil. — To a ftranger who travels on either 
of the two principal roads in this parifli, the appearance of 
the ground is very unfavourable, as he will fee little but 
heath and ftones ; notwithstanding which, this parifti, parti- 
cularly on the fea coaft, contains many acres of naturally very 
fertile land, and capable of producing heavy crops of wheat, 
' being a rich loam and clay. However, there is but little 
wheat fown, owing to improvements here being in their in- 
fancy, and to the difficulty of difpofing of it, from the bakers 
in Aberdeen obftinately preferring Englifti flour (though of- 
ten not fo good) to the flour of wheat produced in their own 
country. Befides a fmall quantity of wheat and flax, this 
parifli produces great crops of oats, bear, turnip, potatoes, 
&amp;c. The grain does much more than fupply the inhabitants, 
and the overplus is fent to the Aberdeen market. 

Along 



of Belhehie. 



219 



Along the fea coaft the foil is fandy, and free of rocks ; a 
iittle farther up it is a deep black mould or loam, and red 
rich clay. The weft part of the parifli is mofly, and wet in 
fome parts ; and in other parts dry and rocky, and not fo 
much calculated for improvement as the eaft part. There 
are hardly any old trees in this diftridt, except a few ftrag- 
gling maples ( acer pfeudo platanus J and afhes, which have 
been planted near the houfes, of which the fir ft feems to 
bear the fea air beft. But there have been great forefts of 
1 wood in the molTes ; and, even below the downs, the foil is 
of a mofTy nature, and has been full of wood. The trees in 
the mofles feem to have been all oak and allar, except fome 
fir found in the moft wefterly parts of the parifli. About 
two miles from the fea the oaks have been moft numerous, 
and have grown to the largeft fize. Near the fea there has 
been little elfe but allar ; and, though fome of thefe trees 
are found below the benty hillocks, yet they have been fmall 
in comparifon of thofe a little farther up. The allars, in 
general, are much decayed, but the oaks are found almoft 
quite found, buried under the mofles. Some of the heritors 
are making a few plantations, which are thriving, but require 
much trouble, as will always be the cafe in an open country 
expofed to the winds, efpecially when fituated near the fea. 

Improvements.— Notwithstanding the advantageous fixa- 
tion of this parifh on the fea coaft, it has long lain in a ftate 
pf nature, owing to particular circumftances. A great part 
of the parifh, under the name of the eftate of Belhelvie, be- 
longed to the Earl of Panmuir, being forfeited in 1715, was 
purchafed by the York-Building Company. Short Ieafes 
were univerfally granted, and no improvements of confe- 
quence took place. If the tenant improved with lime, which 
very feldom happened, he took care, when his leafe w 

near 



Statijtical Account 

near expired, to take fo many crops of oats as to leave his 
ground in as bad, if not in a worfe ftate than when he got it. 
And it was likewife a general method to pare and burn the 
moffy ground, which gave a temporary manure, at the ex- 
pence of the foil. This eftate was in 1782 fold before the 
Court of Seffion, in terms of an aft of Parliament. The 
managers of the fale divided it into 16 different lots. It was 
expofed at 24 years purchafe, amounting to 22,963 1. 1 s. 8 d. 
Sterling, and fold for no lefs a fum than 30,745 Sterling. 
Since that time, a rapid improvement has taken place both 
in that eftate and other parts of the pariih. Long leafes, of- 
ten 57 years, are given; and the ground, of courfe, is af- 
fuming a different appearance. The tenants who have got 
the long leafes are ufing quantities of lime, an u throwing 
great parts of their ground into grafs and turnip. Even the 
petty crofters, with liferent or 19 years leafes, ha e their 
patches of fown grafs, turnip, and potatoes: and winter 
herding is univerfally eftablilhed, which was knnwn of late 
years only in this country. A great bar to improvement, 
high multures, are moftly taken away ; and the perfonal ier- 
vices paid in the parilh are very trifling, and in fome places 
quite abolifhed. The greateft drawback to improvement ftill 
remaining is the catting, drying, and leading of peats or fuel, 
which confumes a great part of the furnmer time that might 
be much better employed, and will continue to do fo while 
the price of coals is fo greatly enhanced by a duty which 
produces in the north of Scotland very little revenue to Go- 
vernment, and yet falls heavy on thofe who pay it, becaufe 
it is both a partial and an oppreffive tax. 

The wages of a day-labourer is 8 d. fometimes gd. a day; 
and as, in general, they are but indolent workmen, their pay- 
ment is not fo fmall, as it will appear to thofe who refide in 
England. The women employ themfelves in knitting ftock- 

ings,

logs, to which work they are much attached. And this 
fedentary life fubjetts them to nervous complaints, which a, 
more aclive life would prevent. 

Rent, — As there is more firing in this parifli than in the. 
adjoining ones, a great part of the land is divided into fmall 
crofts, for which more rent is paid in proportion than for the 
large farms ; and the crofters fubfift moftly by day-labour. 
There are 16 heritors in the parifh, 4 of whom refide in it. 
The 6 principal heritors have from 500 1. to near 700 L Scots 
of valued rent each. The valued rent is 4469 I. 13 s. 4d. 
Scots. The real rent is greatly increaled lince the fale of the 
Y rk-Building Company's eftate ; notwithstanding which, 
the tenants are much more thriving, as they do not depend 
upon precarious tenures. 

Church and School. — The ftipend amounts to 72 1. Sterling, 
32 bolls of meal, and 15 bolls of bear, with a glebe of about 
7 acres. The falary of the fchoolmafter, mcluding his office 
of (effionrclerk, is about 9 1. Sterling j and he may draw in 
whole, including perquifites, about 16 1, per annum ; a fmall 
allowance for fo uleful a member of fociety. 

Population.— In 1755, the numbers were rated at 1471. 
In 1791, they amounted to no more than 1318, being 586 
males, and 732 females ; of which number, 512 are under 
20, 324 between 20 and 40, 270 between 40 and 60, 180 
between 60 and 80, and 32 above 80 years of age. There 
are of married people, widows, and widowers, 337 ; and 
thef'e have had, in all, 11 89 children, of whom 556 are fons, 
and 633 daughters. In order to make a more complete 
comparifon of the prefent and paft population, there is fub- 
joined from the feffion-book a note of the number of bap-

tifms for ten years, commencing in 1627, and of baptifms^' 
marriages, and deaths, for ten years, commencing in 1700, 
and 1780. The account of the baptifms fince 1780 may not 
be perfectly exact ; becaufe, fince the duty was laid upon the 
regiftration of their names, fome have neglected to get them 
regiftered, but they are not many.

<p>Name, tsV, 

BALMACLELLAN is one of the four parifhes in the' 
northern diftricT: of the fteWartry of Kirkcudbright, 
commonly known by the name of Glenhns *. This parifh, 
like fome others in different parts of our ifland, feems to 
have derived its name from its ancient proprietors. A con- 
fiderable branch of the family of Maclellans having, till lately, 
for feveral centuries poffeffed the lands contiguous to the 
church and village, are fuppofed to have transferred their 
name to their property : So that Bal in the Gaelic language, 
as is believed, implying a townfhip or manor, the compound- 
ed name Balmaclellan will therefore fignify the manor or 
townfhip of the Maclellans. 

This clan was at one time fo refpeftable and numerous, 
that 13 knights of the narne of Maclellan are faid to have 
lived at the fame time, poffeffed of property in the different 

diftricts

diftricls of Galloway and Nithfdale *. A branch of this 
clan was afterwards ennobled by the title of Kirkcudbright, 
The honours remain, but the family poffeflions are long fince 
alienated. 

Bounds. — The parifh of Balmaclellan is of an oblong figure. 
The river Kenn forms its weftern boundary ; and Urr, flowing 
from a lake or loch of that name on the eaftern extremity of 
the parifh, becomes its march for about two thirds of the 
whole breadth. The north and fouthern boundaries are 
marked by rivulets, which, proceeding generally from the 
intervening lakes, fall differently towards the Kenn or Urr. 

Appearance. — The furface of the parilh is generally moor- 
ifh ; and, of the whole, fcarcely one fourth fuppofed arable. 
It exhibits more of a level appearance than moft of the pa- 
rities in its neighbourhood. It is not, however, without its 
eminences, a confiderable range of pretty high hills ftretch*. 
ing themfelves along its northern march. From the top of 
thefe, although by no means the higheft in this tract of 
country, in ferene weather, may be difcovered the fea at 20 
miles diftance, with the larger fhipping of the Solway Frith, 
objects which, in this inland fituation, deferve not to pafs 
without attention. Towards the land, the country generally 
opens to a range nearly of the fame extent, prefenting the 
obferver with a very enlarged, but rugged landlkip. Hills 
rifing behind each other by degrees confound the view, which 
is at laft terminated by the lofty tops of Goatfield in Arran, 
the hill of Enterkin, and the Cumbrian mountains, fome of 
which are not lefs than 60 miles diftant. 

Of the furface of the parilh, about 60 acres are fuppofed 
to be covered with wood, and nearly 20 or 25 with water. 

The

of Balmackllan, 225 

The woods, chiefly natural, lie along the banks of the Kenn. 
Thefe are well preferved, and in good condition. Thofe 
more inland are generally low and fcraggy, calculated more 
for flicker than for ufe. The lochs Or lakes are five, vari- 
oufly fcattered around the hills, plentifully ftocked either 
With eels, trout, or pike j and fome with all thefe fpecies ia 
common. One, in particular^ named Loch Brad, although 
of very fmall extent* is remarkable for an excellent fort of 
trout, diftinguifiied alike for fize and colour, meafuring from 

9 to 1 8 inches in length and many of them weighing 8 or 

10 Englifli pounds. 

Soil and Agriculture.— -The foil of this parifh is chiefly of 
two kinds. The firft, lying along the Eenn, on the weftern 
fide of the parifh, is generally dry, light, and gravellilh ; 
remarkable for its kindlinefs, and needs only the affittance of 
fome exciting manure, as lime or marl, to render it produc- 
tive of the mod abundant crops. This foil, which compre- 
hends the principal arable part of the parifli, generally reaches- 
inland to about two miles diftance from the banks of the 
Kenn. The other, which occupies the middle and eaftern 
parts, confifts generally of a lights but ibmetimes of a deeper 
mofs, both commonly covered with heath. Of thefe, the 
former is often found mixed with earth, but is commonly fo 
ragged and perplexed with (tones and rock, as to defy every 
attempt of the plough to better its condition. Even here, 
however, there are interfperfed parcels of a much luperior 
kind, and but little differing from the foil defcribed on the 
weltern fide. On fuch fpots the farm-houfes are generally 
i'tt down. There they enjoy the benefit of planting abun- 
dance of potatoes, of fowing a little rye, barley, or oats ; buc 
thefe laft moft frequently in quantities by no means fufficient 
for the confumption of the farm. 

Vol. VII. Ff Ori 



220 Statijlical Account 

On the north-eaft extremity of the parifh, where the foil 
s good, an d the roads open, there is one large farm already 
in pVt covered with lime from Clofeburn, which has yielded 
crops by no means inferior to thofe in the moft efteemed 
diftritts of the country. 

The crops produced in this parifh are chiefly oats, rye, 
barley, and potatoes, the culture of wheat or turnip having 
been but feldom attempted in this diftrift. The plough is 
here drawn generally with three, although now frequently 
with two horfes ; and potatoes are beginning to be planted 
regularly in drills, fo as to admit of the horfe-hoeing culture. 
On the whole, in this interior part of the country, a metho- 
dical ftile in farming can yet be reckoned only in its infancy j 
and the parifh, according to the prefent mode of cultivation, 
is not fuppofed to grow within itfelf above three fourths of 
its own confumption. 

From the defcription already given of the furface of the 
parifh, it will be eafily perceived that the greater part is only 
fit for pafturage. The fheep and black cattle are both efteem- 
ed good, being of the true Galloway breed ; and there is a 
greater breed of horfes in the parifh than might be expefted 
from the numbers kept. The little labour required in moft 
of thefe farms, added to the cheapnefs of pafture, generally 
difpof'es the firmer to turn fome of his mares to breed, which 
in two or three years repays him better than any other way 
in which he could have employed his capital. From a pretty 
accurate computation, there are fuppofed to be in the parifh 
8200 fhecp, 1340 black cattle, 130 horfes, a few goats, and 
not more than a dozen of iwine. 

The valuation of this parifh in the county books is 3481 1. 
■Scots; the prefent rental nearly 1900 1. Sterling. Th's is 
divided among 14 proprietors, of whom only three are refi- 
dent. The principal heritors are the Honourable John Gor- 
don 



of Balmaclellan. 227 

don of Kenmore, and Alexander Spalding Gordon, Efquire, 
of Shirmers, fheriff-depute of Wigton.

Of the above inhabitants, the greater number live in the 
country, there being but one village in the parifh, viz. that 
by the church, and that confifting only of 77 perfons. The 
decreafe of population may be accounted for in different ways. 
The engroffment of farms, and increafe of pafturage, dimi- 
nifhed the hands neceffary for agriculture. To this may be 
joined, as an additional reafon, the change of property Of 
five families of diftinftion formerly refident within the parifh', 
the number is now reduced to one. Thefe were generally 
ferved by a numerous train of dependants, who, under the 
name of cottars, moftly married, and living therefore in fepa- 
rate families, added confiderably to the population of the 

neighbourhood ;

neighbourhood; all of which have now given place to the 
unmarried and domeftic fervant of the farmer. The Cup. 
predion of the cottagers is a matter deferving very ferious 
confideration : The confequences will foon be feverely felt. 
^ The divifion of labour is fuch as may be expected in a fo- 
ciety who generally live and drefs on their own prodigious. 
In the parifh were formerly accounted about 46 or 50 farms. 
Thefe are n,ow held by 30 perfons, who pay of rent as fol- 
lows :

Average of perfons to a family, 4*.. 
The average rent fcarcely exceeds 2 s. 6 d. per acre. The 
beft land in the parifh lets at about four times that rate! 
There are in the parifh 120 families, 3 mills, 2 blackfmiths, 
6 Weavers, 4 taylors, 4 fhoemakers, 2 carpenters, and 1 ma- 
fon. The wages of houfe-fervants are, men, from 6 1. to 7 !. 
and women from 3 1. to 3 1. 10 s. a year. Day-labourers are 
from 8d. to iod. with, and from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 4d. with- 
out victuals. 

The manners and defcription of the inhabitants of this pa- 
rifh are fuch as may be expected from a mixed fociety. 
Generally expofed in the open air, and in all varieties of 
weather, their bodies acquire a hardinefs unknown to thofe 
in a more fedentary fituation. Converfant with a greater 
number of objects, their minds difcover an expanfion of ideas 
much beyond the mere manufacturer, or vulgar citizen. 
Their prominent virtues are peaceableneis and fobriety, altho' 

bv

by no means deprived of that portion of fpirit which is ne^ 
ceffary on occafions to affert their rights. Since the com- 
mencement of the prefent century, there is no recollection o* 
any one having fuffered capital punifhment, or having fallen 
under the imputation of any atrocious crime. There are but 
three perfons in the pariQi who have ever ferved in the army 
or navy. The young men generally adventure in the civil 
line, either in the character of mechanics or merchants ; of 
which laft, the moft are itinerant in the north of England. 
There is no foreigner, or any other than natives of Scotland 
at prefent refident within the parifh. 

Authors.— No writers of very eminent genius can be claim- 
ed by this parifii, if it is denied right to Thomas Gordon, the 
celebrated author of the Independent Whig. This very keen 
and acute writer, the fevereft fcourge of the Englifh hierar- 
chy, whom the compilers of the Scotch Encyclopaedia erro- 
neoufly ftate as belonging to Kirkcudbright, was certainly a 
native either of this or the neighbouring parifii of Kells. 
Near branches of his family were fettled in both •, and it is 
not at this day certain, or indeed material, in which of them 
he was born. 

Church.— The church and manfe of Balmaclellan were 
built more than 40 years ago, but have both undergone feve- 
ral repairs fince that period. The offices are totally ruin- 
ous they are ordered to be rebuilt the enfuing fummer. 
The prefent value of the living is, in money, exactly 75 1. 
and a glebe valued at 20 1. or 25 1. a year. The King is 
patron. 

Reglflers. — So far as can be collected, except for ten year?, 
ihere has been no regular public regifter kept in this parifh# 

This.

This was the neglett of former times. But a different caufc 
jn future, is li kcly t0 operatc t0 the fame ^ ^ ^ ^ 

Parliament, paffed in the feffions of ,783, iaipofin a tax of 
3 d. on every birth, bunal, Chriftening, and marriage. This 
tax tnfling in itfelf, has been viewed by the lower people 
wnh a degree of jealosy very difproportioned to its object. 
Perhaps the lownefs of the tax in queftion is the chief reafon 
*hy it cannot be enforced. However this be, the above 
ment.oned aft of Parliament has put an end to the regies 
» moft of the parifl.es of this neighbourhood. The people 
refufe to pay The clerk who would a* under the ? J q{ 
Parliament, befides taking out a licence at 5 s . is bound, un- 
der the penalty of 20 1. to make faithful return for eW rv 
name entered on the regifter; a penalty of S cl. being al&amp; 
impofed on any perfon who ftall preface to keep a parochial 
regtfter without complying with the above conditions. So 
that in a parifh like this, where the whole duties to Govern- 
ment would not amount to more than 4 s. 6d. or 5 s. yeaxk 
through the refraclorinefs of individuals, and apprehenfion 
of penalty, the parifh at large is deprived of a record which 
might one day be neceffary for proving their propinquity, or 
fecuring their claims. 

P^r._The funds of this parifh, at an average, amount 
yearly to about 9 1. Sterling. This is wholly collec~ted from 
the people at the church-doors, there being no affeffment in 
the parifh, and the non-refiding heritors contributing feldom 
any thing to the relief of the poor. There is alio a fma!l 
fund of former favings, amounting to between 6c 1. and 70 1. 
lyiug at intereft in different hands. 

The ftated poor are few, at prefent amounting to but about 
four or five perfons. They are moftly able frill to earn the 
greater part of their own fubfiftence. But there are feve: al 

fupernumemies 



of Bahnackllan. 23 1 

fupernumeraries dependant on the felfion from time to time 
receiving affiitance, whofc various demands throughout the 
year amount to as much or more than thofe of the ordmary 
poor. 

In addition to the legal fchool falary of this parifh, 
amounting to about nl. Sterling or thereby, there was a 
few years ago a donation made of 500 1. by a native of this 
place, a Mr Murdoch late merchant in Glalgow. This fund 
is iecured on land, which, at prefent, is faid to yield more 
than 5 per cent, t fo that the fchool falary of this parifo now 
amounts to nearly 36 1. This, however, is the whele income 
of the mafter, the terms of the donation not permitting him 
to receive wages. 

Difad.vantages.-Tht peculiar difadvantages of this parifh 
are chiefly of two kinds, neither of which, unfortunately for 
it, can well be remedied, viz, its foil, and its local fituation. 
Nearly one fourth of the parifh, as before defcribed, being, 
from its foil, incapable of culture, is a mamfeft difadvantage 
attached to property in this fituation, and which no efforts 
of genius or of induftry can furmount. Even here, however, 
there is not wanting fcope for confiderable meliorations. A 
fuperior mode of fencing and fubdividing farms, are improve- 
ments of which the coarfeft foils are capable. A little wood 
planted in convenient fituations in every farm would gratify 
the eye, and, what is of much greater utility, in 12 or i£ 
years would protect the cattle and flocks, which, for want of 
inch fhelter, in tais expofed and bleak fituation often fuffer 
materially in time of ftorms. A more liberal mode of build- 
ing and repairing farm-houfes, fomewhat removed from the 
aukward flovenlinefs of former times, are alfo improvements 
highly necefiary in this part of the country. To which may 

be 



2 3 2 Stati/licai Account 

be added, th C evident neceffity of a little more attention ft 
rendering the ieveral farms acceffible by roads. It i s almoft 
impoffible to conceive how, for centuries, thefe roads have 
been permitted to lie in a Ihte of nature, unpayable to any 
ftranger without a guide, and often to the inhabitant himfelf 
without much danger, which in a few days the idle Ihepherd 
or farm fervant could have repaired. 

The other difadvantage of the parilh already hinted, viz. 
that of us local fituation, mu ft for a long time, and indeed 
for ever in a confiderable degree, aft as a bar to the improve- 
ment of that part of it whofe foil is abundantly adapted to 
agriculture. Almoft 2Q miles diftant from lime in every 
direction, it is not to be wondered that this fort of improve- 
ment has been but partially attempted. The Carlinwark 
marl, which is fix mil es nea rer, and which may be brought 
up Loch Kenn to the verge of the parifh, together with the 
original coft, and the additional expence of water carriage, 
is thought to be a manure of too bulky a kind to be carried 
to any diftance from the landing place. On the whole, the 
attempts both in lime and marl which have been already 
made, have, in themfelves, anfwered the moft fanguine ex- 
pectations. Their diftance, hitherto, is the only objection to 
their general introduction in this neighbourhood. It is to be 
hoped, however, that the conveniency of better roads, which 
is faft taking place, together with a higher fpirit for farming 
in general, will combine to refcue this part of the country 
from that fupinenefs under which it has hitherto laboured. 

A great advantage to this neighbourhood are its public 
roads. The two great roads from Wigton to Edinburgh, and 
from Carlinwark and the lower parts of this county to Ayr- 
lhire, interfecl each other at this point. But what offers 
principal advantage is the road propofed to be opened be- 
tween Dumfries and Newtonftewart by this place. This, 

which

which will fhorten the diftance between thefe two places, by 
the odds of nearly 10 or 12 miles, will alfo enfure a large 
proportion of the Irilh travellers to pais this way. The 
country will be opened up, the value of its productions in- 
creafed, and a freer communication with Grangers will cor- 
rect the operation of local prejudices;

(County of Dumfries, Diflria of Annandale.— Prefhy. 
tery of Lochmaben.— -Synod of Dumfries. J 

By the Reverend Mr Andrew Jaffray.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 
N the parifh of Lochmaben, there are 7 or 8 lochs, whence 
it is mod likely that it derived its name. According to 
tradition, there was a nunnery in the largeft of them, where 
a cattle afterwards flood ; and fome, who are acquainted with 
the Gaelic, fay, that Lochmaben fignifies the Loch of the 
Maidens, or the Loch of the Fair. Lochmaben is fituated in 
Annandale, a diftrict of the mire of Dumfries, lying along 
the banks of the Annan, to the length of about 10 miles, 
and in breadth about 3. It is about 8 miles from Dumfr.es, 
and 12 from the town of Annan, where the river runs into 
the Solway Frith. 

Town of Lochmaben.— Lochmaben is a royal borough, fup- 
pofed to be very antienr, and governed by a provoft, three 
bailhes, a dean of guild, treafurer, and nine common council 
men. There is a charter of novodamus by James VI. dated 
the 16th July 161 2, giving, as a reafon for the renewal, the 
inroads of the Englith, who had plundered and burnt the 
town, and deftrov.ed their records. Tradition fays, that it 

was 



of Lochmaben. 235 

was erected into a royal borough by Robert Bruce I. King of 
Scotland, whole paternal eftate was the great lordfhip of An- 
nandale.' He gave the borough lands out of his own eftate. 
fthas been a town of greater note formerly than now, and 
has extenfive borough roods and town commonly. Much 
of it is feued off, from which they have but a fmall feu-duty. 
There may be about 700 inhabitants in the town and borough 

roods. 

Linen Manufaaure.— These is a confiderable manufafture 
carried on, in the town and country round it, of coarfe linen 
cloth, to the extent of 60,000 yards yearly, which is all fold 
into England, moftly unbleached, at from 6 d. to 1 s. or 13 d. 
per yard. 

Church. — The church is an old Gothic fabric, dedicated 
to Sr. Magdalen. In a bloody family feud, between the 
Maxwells of Nithfdale, and the Johnftons of Annandale, it 
fuffered much. In an engagement between thefe on a plain 
called Dryfe Sands, the Maxwells, who were defeated with 
great flaughter, fled, and took fandhiary in the church of 
Lochmaben, and were purfued by the Johnftons, who burn- 
ed the church to the ground. This happened about the 
year 159 1. There appears to have been alfo feveral fmall 
chapels in the parifh, the veftiges of which now fcarcely re- 
main. The ftipend is 105 1. The Vifcount of Stormont is 
patron. 

Co/lie at the Town. — There is the fite of a very antient 
caftle dole to the town, on a noble fituation, between the 
caftle and kirk lochs, furrounded by a deep moat and foffe. 
Tradition fays, the ftones of it were carried away to build 
another caftle. It commands a pleafant profpecl over an ex- 
tenfive plain, and was originally the feat of Robert Bruce, 

Lord 



G 3 6 Staiijlical Account 

Lord of Annandale; before that family came to the crown of 
Scotland They had other two feats, one at Annan, the o. 
■Mr at Hoddam ; and a very great eftate, which continued in 

he,r poffcffion long after they came to the crown. It is faid, 
that Robert Bruce I. king of Scotland, was born in this caf- 
tie. The ground on which it 'ftood belongs now to Robert 
Maxwell, Efq; whofe predeceffors have been in poffeffion of 
it for 2oo years, when David Maxwell their anceftor, was 
appointed fub-governor of the Caftle of Lochmaben, by 
Lord Maxwell, warden of the Weftern Borders, and keeper 
of the fa.d caftle. There are Efficient documents for this 
in the hands of the faid Robert Maxwell, and in the town 
books of Lochmaben. The faid Mr Maxwell, and his pre- 
decelTors, have been often and long provofts of Lochinahen. 

Caftle Loch, and Caftle.—The Caftle Loch is a large and 
beautiful fheet of water, lying fouth of the town, in length 
a mile and a half, and in mean breadth a mile, abounding in 
a variety of fifh. It is affirmed by the fifhermen, that there 
are 15 or 1 6 different kinds fit for the table, among which 
there is one that, from every information that can be obtain- 
ed, is peculiar to that loch, as it is to be found no where elfe 
in Britain. It is called the Vendife or FenOacc, fome fay from 
Vendois in France, as being brought from thence by one of 
the Jamefes, which is not very probable, as it is found by ex- 
perience to die the moment it is touched, and has been at- 
tempted to be tranfported to other lochs in the neighbour- 
hood, where it has always died. It is generally about the 
fize of a fmall herring, which it refembles much in external 
appearance and in its anatomy ; it has the tafte and flavour 
of a frefh herring, not quite fo ftrong, but more delicate, and 
is reckoned the moft delicious fifh that fwims. They lie in 
the deepeft parts of the loch, and are caught with a net.

The caftle ftands upon a peninfula of the loch, and ,s by 
far the largeft and ftrongeft of any, either on the Englith or 
Scotch borders, next to Carlifle, againft which it was a frontier 
garrifon. It was built by Robert Bruce, the firft of that 
name king of Scotland. The original caftle occupies about 
an acre of ground, and contains three courts, ftrongly built 
of ftone and lime. The walls are twelve feet thick. It was 
furrounded by three deep fofles, each of which was filled 
with water from the loch, that met on either fide. The 
whole fortification may contain 13 acres. The inner foffee 
went through the caftle, within which there was a bafon for 
holding the boats, to place them out of the reach of the ene- 
my, and to (belter them from the weather. The principal 
entry to the caftle feems to have been by water. It has been 
a very ftrong place, and, before the invention of cannon, 
might be faid to be impregnable. Even in the prefent ftate 
of fortification, it might be made a place of ftrength, as it is 
furrounded by water and marfhy ground for a mile, and only 
a narrow neck of land for the entry. Before the union of, 
the Crowns, a garrifon of 200 men was conftantly kept in 
it. Among the titles of the Marquis of Annandale, he 
affumes that of Conftable, or Hereditary Keeper of the 
Caftle of Lochmaben. The governor had a falary of 300 1. 
Scotch, (a confiderable fum, it is fuppofed, in thofe days), along 
with the fifhing of the lochs. Though King James VI. in 
the forefaid charter, granted in the year 16 12, gives the fifh- 
ing of all the lochs to the borough of Lochmaben, yet the 
proprietors of the Caftle have always enjoyed the property,

There are three kinds of tenure of bnds in Scotland

indeed over Europe, in different modifications, according 
to the different laws and conftitutions of the countries 
where it prevails. Secondly, the Allodial, which, in the Ger-

having a fnperior 5 and, Thirdly, the Udal, being a right com- 
pleat without writing; this obtains in Orkney and Zet- 
land, and in the holdings of the Four Towns in the Panfh 
of Lochmaben. As to the two firft, antiquarians and law- 
vers may inveftigate them j with refpett to the laft, the lands 
of Four Towns were granted by one of our kings to his 
houfehold fervants, or garrifon of the Caftle, and the pro- 
perty of each being fmall, they were allowed, as a kind of 
algence, to hold it without the neceffity of charter and 
fafmej bare pofiefiion being a fufficient title. The tenants pay a 
fmall rent to the Vifcount of Stormont, but have no charter 
or fafifte from him. The property of thefe lands is trans- 
ferred from one perfon to another, by delivery and pofiefiion 
only ; but they muft be entered in the rental in Lord Stor- 
mcnt's rental-book, which is done without fee or reward. 
The tenants right was renewed by James VI. and Charles IL 
confirmed by the Court of Seffion, and by a decree of the

January 1727. The diftria is called Four Towns, as com- 
prehending four populous villages. Their pofTeffions are ge 
nerally fmall. The land on the river fide is rich and fertile 
peculiarly favourable for the growth of flax, of which they 
raife a good quantity. Many of the men are weavers. The 
women fpin their own flax, and a good deal of foreign flax 
alfo. Their pofTeffions and valuations are diftinguiihcd by 
acres. There is a peculiarity in their land meafure, and the 
ell by which their acres have been meafured (called the Ba- 
rony dl), contains 42 inches, whereas the common ell made 
ufe of m the country, is only 38 inches. 

Four Towns Commonty.-There was a large and extenfive 
commonty contiguous to the Four Towns, which they had 
an intereft in. It was divided fome years ago; they had a 
large fhare of it. Their feveral fhares are moftly now im- 
proven, and are of higher value than their original property 
acres. On many of their fhares are built fmall farm houfes 
which has confiderably increafed the number of inhabitants 
of the parifh. 

Sirnames in the Four Towns. —The prevailing firnames of 
this diftricl: are, Richardfon, Rae, Kennedy, Nicholfon, 
Wright, &amp;c. of which the Richardfons are by far the moft 
numerous. They add bye-names or nicknames to diftinguifh 
one family from another of the fame name. If pofTeffing 
the fame lands, from father to fon, for many generations de- 
nominates an old family, and gives the appellation of gentle, 
man, here are numbers who have a juft claim to that title, 
having pofTefied the fame ridges and acres for 500 years. 
Some of thefe names are to be found among the companions 
of Wallace and Bruce, in his wars for the recovery of his 
antient inheritance of the kingdom of Scotland. They are 



now 



of Locbmaben. 2 4*

^ Tun* -h £ were formerly aU run-rUge. This, 
Z« wiU add much «o .heir advance, and t. the 
beauty of the country. 

Rockhall Tlto.-There is a moat in the parifh, called 
Rockhall Moat, of which there are many in this part or 
the country, and of the moft remote antiquity. Th.s is a 
m oft beautiful mount of earth, perfe&amp;ly round, and termi- 
nating in a Iharp top } it is larger than many of ^them, and 
is verv entire. It ftands on the fide of a ridge of hills, which 
feparates Annandale from Nithfdale, and overlooks an ex- 
tenfive plain on the foot of the river Nith, part of Galloway, 
and all the Solway Frith. As to the ufe of thefe moats, it 
is generally agreed, that the people met on them to make 
Jaws, and admiriifterjuft.ee. To this day, the Twelve Keys 
of the Me of Man, who are their parliament, meet on one 
of thole mounts, in the open air ; and fome of the court- 
houles in England are called the mote, or mute, or moot-hail. 
The public courts among the Saxons were called Wittm- mote, 
or WitUn-a-gemote y which was the original of parliaments in 
England, according to Rapin. 

Soil.— The foil is very rich and fertile on the banks of the 
jrivers. There are three, viz. Kinnel, Ae, and Dryfe, that 
join the Annan, all within a mile of one another in this 
parifh. Thefe lands are exceedingly rich, but they are 
fometimes overflowed in the winter, which adds to their fer- 
tility. The lands on the riling ground are good, and very 
capable of improvement, and raife good crops, when proper- 
ly managed. It is all arable, though not yet wholly in til- 
lage.

Lime — The manure made ufe of is lime, brought 1 2 and 
14 miles diftance; the price is 1 1 d. the Carlifle bufhel, two 
of which make one Linlithgow boll. 

Coal.— .The coal, with which it is burnt, is brought from 
England, which is the reafon of the high price. This coal, 
when carried by water, is liable to a high duty. There is no 
coal on the whole coaft of Galloway, Nithfdale, or Annan- 
dale; they are moftly fupplied with that article from Cum- 
berland, on the other fide of the Solway Frith. Jt is to be 
regretted, that the people who live at a great diftance fhould, 
after fhipping and unloading, paying freight, and carrying it 
many miles by land, after all be obliged to pay a heavy duty ; 
while the people who live at the coal-pit fhould pay nothing, 
and at the fame time all living under the fame king, govern- 
ment, and laws. It is afferted, by thofe who know, that a 
farthing on the cart load, at the coal-pit, which would be lit- 
tle felt, and eafier collected, would bring more money to go- 
vernment than all this duty. There have been frequent at- 
tempts made to obtain fome redrefs in this matter, but hi- 
therto without fuccefs. The fuel moftly made ufe of in this 
part is pear. The moffes are wearing out. Coal that is ufed 
for fuel and burning lime, is brought at 30 and 40 miles 
diftance by land ; and notwithstanding of the long land car- 
riage, there have been great improvements made, by break- 
ing up moorifh and wild lands, with the affiftance of lime, 
without which one cannot pretend to improve thofe kinds of 
ground, to any profit or advantage. The rich lands on the 
banks of the rivers, may let for 20s. to 25 s. per acre; the 
uplands not fo high.

State of the Poor.— There is a great number of poor in this 
parifh. There are 30 on the roll, that are ferved quarterly 
out of the public charity, which is but a fmall pittance to 
each, there being no fund or provifion made for their fupport, 
but what is collected in the church. Thofe that are able are 
allowed to beg from door to door ; and many ftrollers and 
idle vagrants are fuffered to travel in the country, with which 
it is greatly opprefled, and by this means the poor of the pa- 
rilh are robbed of that charity which properly belongs to 
them. 

School. — There is a legal fchool in the parifh, of 200 merks 
of falary. James Richardfon of Reading, in England, mor- 
tified, on the 26th of March 1726, the fum of 400 1. Ster- 
ling, in the following manner, viz. 200 1. to the grammar 
fchool of Lochmaben ; the intereii of it to be paid to the

rithmetic, gratis: Another tool, for fupporting a library, 
and keeping in repair a good houfe, built by the faid Mr Ri- 
chardfon, for the ufe of the fchoolmafter, and for preferving,

Name, Situation, and Extent. 
RRAY is compofed of the united parifhes of Vrtzf 
and Kilchrift. The former feems to derive its name 
from its local fituation. The church and burying-ground 
lie on a large plain, on the banks of the rapid river Ornn, near 
its conflux with the Connon. The Orrin has, in the courie 
of ages, evidently {hifted its bed, and its paflable fords, through 
every part of that plain, and would repeat its ravages almoit 
every feafon, were it not retrained by the annual exertions 
of the Grounding proprietors. Hence it is probable, the 
name is derived from Ur-a, the new ford. Kilchrift * evi- 
dently Cella Chrifli, a burying-ground confecrated to Chnft.— 
It is fituated chiefly in the county of Rofs : A fmall part of 
it lies in Invernefs-fhire. It extends from the Frith of Beauly 
on the fouth, to the north fide of the river Connon, about 
7 Englifli miles in a ftraight line, nearly from fouth to north. 
Its breadth on the banks of the Connon, from eaft to weft, is 
about 6 Englifli miles, but does not exceed 3 towards the 
fouthern boundary, along the Frith of Beauly. The inter- 
mediate fpace lines the foot of the great chain of mountains 

which 



24^ Statical Account 

*hich extend from thence to the weft coaft of Scotland. 
There is a davoch of land belonging to this parifh in the 
valley of Strathconnon, in the bofom of the weftern moun- 
tains, at the diftance of 10 computed, or 18 Englim miles. 
It is furrounded by the parifh of Contin, and forms a part of 
the miffion in that parifh. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate. —The general face of the parifh 
prefents a pifturefque view of corn-fields, intermixed with 
barren muir, clumps of natural wood *, rapid ftreams, large 
plantations around gentlemen's feats, with different views of 
the two beautiful Friths of Dingwall and Beauly, which, 
as canals formed by the hand of nature, and penetrating 
for upwards of 20 miles into a populous country, invite 

the merchant and manufacturer to fettle on their banks 

The foil is as various as the general face of the ground ; 
but, on the whole, is warm, dry, and productive. The 
fields on the Hopes of the riling grounds are compara- 
tively of a richer foil than the low ground, except a part of 
the eftate of Lovat, which once belonged to the priory of 
Beauly, and is a deep, rich, carfe ground. The plains abound 
with pebbles, from 4 to 6 or 8 pound weight, evidently 
rounded by friction, and intermixed with beds of dry fand 
and gravel. Hence a confiderable part of the low ground is 
barren dry muir, producing only a fhort heath ; and the arable 
land (with a few exceptions) of inferior quality to that on the 
high lands. On one eftate there are fevcral fmall hollows 

furrounded 

* Every little burn and meadow prefents a bufh of natural 
wood, confifting moftly of aller, interfperfed with afh. There 
are a few bufhes of birch, fome oaks and willows. Around 
gentlemen's feats there are to be feen large plantations of firs, 
and other foreft trees. They continue to plant every year, par- 
ticularly Mr Mackenzie of Seaforth, who rears an extenfive nur- 
fery for that purpofe.

of ao miles in extent, towards Tain and Cromarty, on the 
north by the hill of Weavas, and on the weft by the great 
cham of mountains ftre.ching to the weft coaft. It ts worth 
remarking, that the weftern mountains make the weather al- 
.ernately foul and lair on the eaft and weft borders of them, 
in fome meafure fimilar to the monfoons on the Malabar and 
Coromandel coafts. The weft and fouth-weft winds blow 
moft frequently, during which it generally rains on the weft 
coaft, and is fair weather on this fide of the hills i or, at 
moft, there are only flight occafional fhowers. On the other 
hand, the eaft wind uniformly brings rain or fleet on the eaft 
coaft ; but the ftorm dies away in the intermediate hills, and 
there is dry weather and funlhine on the weft coaft.

with two horfes, without a driver, with moft of the other 
inftruments of hufbandry ufed in the Lothians. The tenants, 
however, have not yet furmounted their prejudices in favour of 
old cuftoms, and are fatisfied with following the mode ufed 
by their grand-fires, except in the culture of potatoes, which 
lias taken place only within the laft 30 years. The lands are 
ftill open ; nor do they fhew any dcfire to have them inclo- 
fed. They ufe a plough peculiar to the country, drawn for 
the moft part by fix fmall oxen, or by two horfes and four 
oxen. Almoft every kind of carriage is performed with 
carts*. The wheels are timber tumblers, bought at about 2 s. 
the pair, on which are placed frames for the different pur- 
pofes, made by the tenants themfelves Horfes are the on- 

k 

other place in the north of Scotland. The reafon is, that it 
abounds with licenced ftills, which confume the barley. It is 
the neareft corn country to a large extent of the weft coaft and 
Mid Highlands. The Highlanders are fupplied from thence 
with oat meal and whifky : Hence confiderable quantise of 
barley and oat-meal are imported by the Friths of Dinijwall 
and Beauly to a fure and ready market Home-made barley 
of crops 1789 and 179,0 fold at 18 s. per ho\\. At the fame 
time, barley fold in Murray at 16s. and 16s. 6d. Oat meal 
of thefe crops fold at from 16s. to 18s. 9 ftones barley of 
crop 1 79 r, fells at from 18 s. 6 d. to 20 s. per boll. Potatoes 
generally fell at from 6 d. to 8d. a peck; beer, from 2d. to 4d. a 
pound ; mutton and pork at i\ d. ; a hen at 6 d. ; chickens at 
2d. each; eggs at i|-d. per dozen; a wedder of the country 
breed at 6 s. 



* The great number of cottagers affords labourers, who are 
employed by the proprietors in improving their farms. The 
common hire is 6 d. a day. In harved, men and women earn 
6 d. and, in fome places, their maintenance. Common men- 
fervants are hired at 3 1. a year, women at il. 10s. Several 
young people of both fexes, and fome married men, go to the 
fouth country to earn harveft wages, and return the beginning 
of winter.

from 3 1. to 4 1. Within the laft two years, the fouth coun- 
try drovers have raifed the price from 15 s. to 20 s. a head. 
The averse value may be computed at 3 1. It will not be 
far wide of\he truth to eftimate the number of black cattle 
at 10 head each tenant, including his oxen ; and each mailer 
at I, which will amount to 1448, worth 40 s. each at an 
average. Both horfes and black cattle are fent to graze m 
the weftern hills, from May to Michaelmas, at about 1 s. 6d. 
per head. Of late, fince (beep-farming is become prevalent 
in the Highlands, the price of grazing low country cattle is 
raifed to 2 s. Horfes are returned in July to bring home 
fuel. If the weather admit of that fervice being foon per- 
formed, they are fent back. The rending heritors keep 
about 40 draught horfes, worth 15 1. each, and 250 black 
cattle, worth 5 1. at an average, befides riding horfes and 
wheel carriages. 

Rivers and Ffi.— The Beauty empties itfelf into the Frith 
of that name at the S. W. point of the parifh, and cannot be 
faid to belong to it. The Connon interfe&amp;s the parifh near

July and Auguft. A Company from Berwick farms the fal- 
mon filhing, along with feveral other filhings in the neigh- 
bourhood. During the fpring months, and beginning of 
fummer, they fend confiderable quantities of kitted falmon to 
the London market ; but are kind enough, (though againft 
their own intereft), to indulge the neighbouring families 
with a competency for their tables at 2 d. a pound. But the 
body of the people are more indebted for their fupport, to the 
fhoals of herrings, which, for the naoft part, appear annually 
in the Frith of Beauty, at the ferry of Kefiock. They vifit

£ m. Moft of the inhabitants rear ffieep, for their wooi 
iftey manufacture both the wool and the lint for their own 
e, 0r for home ™e i but neither in fufficient quantity for their 
own confumpt. A great deal of Enghfh cloth is every Sun- 
Jay feen at church. The only article in this and the neigh- 
bounng pari/hes, that can be called a manufaaure, is diftilling 
of aquavitae. There are 9 licenced ftills in the pariffi, at 30 
gallons each. Highlanders from Lochaber, the extenfive 
weft coaft of Rofs-ffiire, and the Hie of Sky, buy the fpirits 
at between 10 s. and 14 s. per Scotch gallon. One man only 
in the pariflx occupies a ftill without partners. From 5 to 
10 or 12 tenants join about one of thefe ftills, by which 
means each has an opportunity of manufacturing his own 
growth of barley; and where that falls fliort of making up 
his proportion, he buys from his neighbours. The whole 
barley in the parifh is diftilled. Though no feed is left for 
the enfuing feafon, yet the whole growth is not equal to the 
quantity manufaaured into fpirits by 9 ftills. They fay, 
that no barley anfwers fo well as the growth of the partfh, 
which they attribute to the warmth and drynefs of the foil. 
The barley crop is generally allotted for paying the rents. 
The principal or only profit refulting from the diftillery is 
keeping up the price of grain, and converting it fpeedily in- 
to money. The profits otha wife are next to nothing, ex- 
cept the draff or grains. The only other refource they have 
is from black cattle ; but grafs being fcanty, the increafe of 
cattle feems hardly fufficient to fupply the wafte of horfes, 
few of which are reared in the parifh. 

Church, School, and Poor.— The church was built about 1 2

others have now outftripped it in elegance and convenience; 
Captain Kenneth M'Kenzie of Cromarty, reprefentative ot 
th e Earls of that name, is patron. This, with feveral other 
patronages, was forfeited in 1747, but reftored, along with 
the eftate, to the late Lord Macleod, fon to the laft Earl.— 
The amount of the ftipend depends on the price of viftual. 
It confifts of 10 chalders of barley. This, together with the 
glebe, may be eftimated at 140 1. The decreet of modifica- 
tion and locality is dated in 17 19— A clergyman of the Epif- 
copal Church of Scotland refides in this parifh. About a 
fourth part of the people attend his meeting. He has two 
other places of worfhip in the neighbouring parifhes. When 
he is abfent, his ordinary hearers attend the parifh church as 
punctually as the other parifhioners. There are no diffenters 
of any other denomination.- A parochial fchool is eftabl.fhed, 
and well attended. The Society for propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge fupport a charity fchool and fpinmng miftrcfs, 
both of which are ufeful.-The poor's roll contains 62. 
There are no funds in the parifh for their fupport, except 
the weekly collection, and another more general colledhoa 
made on the firft Sunday of every quarter, when every indi- 
vidual is fuppofed to contribute his mite. The whole amounts 
to about 10 1. Sterling, and is diftributed by the feffion. 

Population.^ torn a roll made up in 1 791, there are in the 
parifh i86operfons, of whom 420 are under 10 years of 
age . The average of births for the laft 3 years, while the 
prefect incumbent has officiated, is 40. Of thefe the Epif- 
copal clergyman baptifed 10. The average of marriages is 
t 1 . There is no regiftcr of burials kept in the parifh. The

great body of the people is divided into two clafl^ tenant, 
and cottagers ; or, as the latter are called here, mdlers. The 
former amount to 12o , who rent from s 1. t0 2p l. ^ 
Not above two or three pay 30 L The mailers are thofb 
poor people who build huts on barren ground, and improve 
foots around them, f or which they pay nothing fur a L»- 
Jated number of years. The proprietor frequently indulges 
them with tools and feed for the firft feafon. After the firft 
period is expired, thefe crofts are rented at from 3 S . to 40 s 
a year. Every year produces one or more of thele new fet- 
tlers At prefent they confift of 248 families of whom r 4 8 
have fettled within the laft 40 years. From this increafe of 
the cottagers, and the great quantity of improved ground, an 
increafe of the population has undoubtedly taken place with- 
in thefe 20 or 30 years ; although there appears to be a de- 
creafe upon the whole fince ,755, the return made to D r 
Webfter at that period having been 2456. This decrease 
can only be accounted for, by the annual emigrations to the 
fouth country in harveft, and by the great numbers enlifted 
into the Highland regiments, at the commencement of the two 
laft wars.— The new lettlers are not all natives of the parifh. 
Severals come down from the Hebrides, from the weft coaft,' 
and mid Highlands, when a fevere feafon has deflroyed their 
cattle. This is the reafon, why the number below 10 years 
of age is fo high in proportion to the births. All the trades- 
men in the parifh are included among the mailers. They 
confift of 20 weavers, 1 houfe-carpenter, 3 millers, 15 tay- 
lors, 2 mafons, 21 brogue or fhoemakers. All of them work 
for the parifhioners and immediate neighbourhood. No ar- 
ticle is manufactured for exportation. There are alfo in- 
cluded in the above number 82 widows, 40 of whom are on 
the poor's roll. But, though thefe laft have feparate huts, 
they are not included in the above number of families. One

i^Hery feW turned of 8o, but none who have reached 90. 

Heritors and *,«/.-There are i I proprietors in the parifh, 
of "whoa, 3 have their feat, in other parifhes, and 3 m this. 
Of thefe U 4 only relUe conftantly, and 4 °ccafionally 
Brahan Caftle is in this pari*, the principal refidence of Mr 
Mackenzie of Seaforth.-The valued rent is 2574L « 
S rotch. 'I he real rent approaches to 2000 1. Sterling. J?evr 
of the eftates have been meafured. From a grofs computa- 
tier fro* the quantity of feed fown, the average rent will be 
,bout :o s. an acre. The greater part of the rent is reckon- 
ed in barley and oat-meal. Few, however, choofe to pay m 
&amp;nd Hence the rent varies as the price of virtual rifes or 
fill". Some proprietors, of late, have pafled from payment 
in kind for a fixed rent in money. The proprietors who 
Ire in the parifh occupy land of the annual value of 500 1. 
Sterling. Their families, including fervants and labourers, 
do not exceed 80 perfons. Hence there are about 1800 
perf-ons to be maintained on the produce of ipolA worth 
of land, belldes paying that fum as rent. 

D if advantages 

* There being no villages, and few mechanics who follow 
fedentary employments, the people work in the open air and 
are, in general, lively and healthy ; except when mfefhous d.f- 
teinpers'occur, as happened in the year , 789 when a putrid 
fever was introduced into a poor family 5 whence, as from a 
centre, it fpread through this and the neighbouring pan hes, 
the-nte to the well coaft, and at laft to the Hebrides, marking 
its nrogrefs with dreadful havoc. The gentry inoculate their 
children for the frrr.dl.pox with fuccefs, but the great body ot 
the people have not furmounted their religious prejud.ces aga' nlt 
that innovation. The gout and gravel are not knovrn. kheu- 
matilms arc frequent, for which they apply ftrong fpints to tne 
part affected.

hoped, however, that this grievance will be foon alienated 
by the extenfive plantations of firs laid out withm thefe laft

and, even if they were inclofed, they fay, they cannot lie out 
of their ordinary crops fo long as would be neceffary to put 
their farms in the modern rotation.— Again, foreign manure 
cannot be had for improvement, at fuch a price as the tenant 
can afford. Gentlemen who ufe lime for building, and ma- 
nure, find it cheaper to bring it from Sunderland, than from

In fome parts, particularly towards the eaft, * is of a ftronger 
ual? an d tends to clay, a foil in which wheat and beans 
arTproduced to great advantage. The hufbandry of this pa- 
rifh has been, for feveral years paft, in a progreffive flare of 
improvement. Confiderable quantities of manure, brought 
regularly from Edinburgh, and abundance of lime in the 
near neighbourhood, have contributed much to produce this 
happy effect. Several gentlemen in the parifh farm on a 
large fcale, and with great fpirit and fuccefs. Their ge- 
neral practice is, to fummer fallow a large field, to manure 
it richly, and fow it with wheat, by which they have of pro- 
duft generally from 9 to 12 bolls on the acre. Their fubfe- 
quent crop is commonly beans and peafe •, after which they 
take a crop of barley or oats, wit'h which they fow grafs 
feeds ; they then take one or two crops of hay, and after- 
wards keep it fome years in pafture. By this rotation, they 
preferve their ground in excellent order. The following is 
given, as one inftance out of many, of the fertility of thefe 
lands. Mr Kirkland, two years ago, fummer fallowed and 
manured a field of 16 acres ; it produced, of good grain, 14 
bolls per acre. The price of wheat was fo high that year, as 
to fell from 26 s. to 28 s. per boll; fo that, from his wheat 
and the ftraw, he realized 20 1. Sterling^ acre, i. e. 320 1. 
on the 16 acres. This % fa£r may be depended upon, as the 
writer hereof had it from himfelf. Other inftances of great 
improvement in hufbandry, and correfponding produce, 
might be mentioned ; but this is by no means the general 
condition of the parifh. Many of the fmaller tenants conti- 
nue in the old tract, and thereby retard the progrefs of im- 
provement.

more modern, being formed within thefe 50 years, by James 
Earl of Morton, P. R. S. and grandfather to the prefer*

great park, containing between 400 and 500 acres, inclofed

to commodious inclofures, by funk fences and belts of planta- 
tion, forming, altogether, a very beautiful and extenfive fcene.

knd lets as high as two guineas per acre ; but thefe are prin- 
cipally the grounds round the village. The rent of the pa- 
rifh, at a medium, may be reckoned from 22 s. to 25 s. per

its extenfive environs and furrounding hills, are in full view. 
From the fmall eminences in the weft end of the parifh, thefe 
views appear to the greateft advantage. One of thefe de- 
mands particular attention. From the top of the fouth Piatt 
Hill, immediately above the manfe *, can be pointed out 14 
different counties full in view. Some affert, that parts of 16 
counties, making one half of Scotland, may be feen from that 
fpot. this proipea gives a full view of the Forth, from the 
ifland of May towards Stirling 5 the coafls of Fife, Kinrofs, 
and Clackmannan ; the hills in the fhires of Perth, Stirling, 
and Dunbarton, as far as Ben- Lomond ; the three Lothians, 
Berwickfhire, &amp;c.— The great road from Edinburgh to Glaf- 
gow runs nearly through the middle of the parifh, and a. 
longft it from Addifton Bridge to Bonington, for more than 
two miles, there is one uninterrupted fcene of the moft beau- 
tiful and valuable plantation any where to be feen. It com- 
prehends the extenfive pleafure grounds of Addifton, Ratho, 
Dalmahoy, Hatton, and Bonington. 

Church and School.— The church is fituated exa&amp;ly 7 miles 
weft from Edinburgh. It is very old ; but when it was found- 
ed is uncertain. The ftipend confifts of 5 chalders of viftual, 
58 1. 8 s. 6d- Sterling in money, which, at the county con- 
verfion of 10 s. 5 d. per boll, makes the ftipend equal to 100 1. 
Sterling. But, from the ufual difference between the county 
converfion and the felling prices, it is equal to 1 20 1. corntnu-

meadow ground, of no great value 5 but the whole, with the 
manfe and garden, may be reckoned equal to 20 1. a year.-. 
The fchoolmafter's falary, about 25 years ago, was only 8 1. 

s Sterling. Upon an application to the heritors, they aug- 
mented it to 13 1. 3 s. About 10 years ago, the fchool- 
mafter being rendered unfit, by age, for the duties of his of- 
fice, raoft of the heritors voluntarily agreed to double the 
falary, and raifed it to about 24 1. of which 10 1. with a free 
houfe, was alloted to the old fchoolmafter for life, and 14 1. 
eftablimed as a falary for an efficient teacher, the choice of 
whom was left to the minifter. Ever fince there has been at 
Ratho a numerous and thriving fchool ; and within thefe two 
years, the heritors have expended above 150 1. Sterling id 
enlarging the fchoolmafter's houfe and rebuilding the fchool \ 
which is finiflied and furnilhed in fo complete a manner, that 
it may be confidered as a model for other parts of the coun- 
try, there being few fuch in Scotland. 

Poor.— iln the year 1 760, the parifh had no money at in- 
tereft, and not above fro 1. of ftock in the treafurer's hand,

about 40 indigent perfons, at an average, regularly fupplied*

been produced altogether from weekly collections at the 
church doors. This may appear incredible in fo fmall a pa- 
rifti ; but one circumftance, which deferves to be recorded, to 
the honour of the late noble patron, will explain it. The late 
Earl of Lauderdale, who was remarkable, in his rank, for reli-

SciU ^om letting the lands in large farms and « 
Lh of them into pafture grounds, wherry ^« 
have been entirely depopulated, and others confiderabLy re- 
duced in numbers. If it be a good maxim, that the nches 
of a country confift chiefly in the number of its mhabi- . 
tants, the policy of the proprietors has not been d.reftcd, 
in this refpea, to the belt interefts of the parifh. One cir- 
cumftance, indeed, that obftru&amp;s the increafe of population 
in this diArift, is, the great diftance from coals, the parifh 
being, in this refpeft, the moft unhappily fituated of any in 
the three Lothians. It is equally diftant from the eaft and 
weft hills, being between 10 and 12 miles diftant from both; 
and many bring them from Bonharr, which is 17 miles dif- 
tant, on account of the goodnels of the roads. This cir- 
cumftance muft prove an infurmountable obftacle to the efta. 
blifhment of manufaftures, and coalequently to the popula- 
tion of this parifh ; which, however, upon the whole, has 
only decreafed 105 within thefe 37 years ; the number re- 
turned to Dr Webfter, in the year 1755, being 930. 

Eminent Men.— The immediate predeceflbr of the prefent 
incumbent, was Dr William Wilkie, who, in 1760, was tranf- 
latcd to the profefibrfhip of natural philofophy in the uni- 
verfity of St. Andrew's. This gentleman, along with many 
peculiarities of character, poflefled much valuable knowledge, 
and, in point of extent and originality of genius, had per- 
haps no fuperior in his time. He was author of the Epigo- 
piad, an epic poem of great merit, and which; as a monu- 
ment

mory. He wrote alfo a volume of fables, which he dedi. 
cated to his noble patron, the Earl of Lauderdale. It is per. 
haps to be regretted, that many valuable manufcripts of his, 
both (cu r. mifcellancous, have never been publifhed. 

He died about 18 years ago. </p>

partly owing to want of care, and partly to the moffy foil of

Airdrie, although there are very few diffenters in the panQi. 
Their congregation is therefore collected from neighbouring 
parifhes. 

Schools and P 00 r.-There is a public fchool at the parifh 
church. The falary is 5 1. 1 1 s. ifd. with a fchool and 
dwelling-houfe, but no garden. This falary, being paid by 
more than 100 heritors, is fcarcely worth collecting. The 
fchoolmafter is alfo precentor and feffion clerk. The emo- 
luments of thefe offices, though trifling, are better than the 
falary, but the whole is a fhameful pittance in fo wealthy a 
pariflv, and it is a difgrace to the country, that fo ufeful a 
body of men are, in Scotland, fo poorly provided for in ge- 
neral, and calls loudly for redrefs. There are generally two 
fchools in the town of Airdrie-, but as they have neither 
fchool-houfe nor falary, the, teachers continue no longer than 
till a better place offers. If one penny upon the pound 
Scotch of valued rent, all over Scotland, were levied, along 
with the land-tax, and paid to the parochial fchoolmafters, in 
addition to their prefent trifling falaries, it might make their

I he funds for fupplying them do not exceed 100 1. the into*

cloths or pall-dues, proclamations of the banns of manage, 
and an extraordinary coUeftbn on the firft Sabbath of Tune 
yearly, has hitherto raifed a fum equal to the yearly diftribu, 
tion. fhere are 4 different charitable focieties in the town 
of Airdne, who have about 500 1. of ftock, and are very ufe- 
ful in fupportmg poor members. Their funds are well ma- 
naged, and increafing yearly. If f uch focieties %m

be very beneficial, particularly in times of dearth, by layinr 
out their ftock for the purchafe of grain, and felling it to the 
poor at prime coft, as was done here in the year 1783, upon 
the general failure of the preceding crop *.

need a cure, knew the value of this water, they might find 
m l advantage from it, at a fmall expence, in companion of 
the Englifh watering places, as every accommodate can be 
got in the neighbourhood at eafy rates. 

Roads, Bridges, fcrY—The roads were in a molt wretched 
ftate, till the year 1772, when the county obtained an act of 
Parliament for commuting the ltatute work for money. Since 
that period, the roads are greatly improved, and a bridge 
built over almoin every rivulet. The prcfcnt converfion is 
' l S s. Sterling for each ploughgate of land, and i8d. for 
each houfeholder, which amounts to 100 1. or thereby, an- 
nually. This fund is managed in the beft manner, and as 
there are plenty of excellent materials, few parilhes in Scot- 
land have fuch good roads. An aft was obtained laft feffion 
of Parliament, for making a turnpike road from Edinburgh 
to Glafgow, by Bathgate and Airdrie, the trade of which will 
run through this partfh for many miles, and, when finifhed,

ManufaBures^te diftillery of malt fplrits, brewing of 
ale, making, candle making, and iron founding, are the only 
manufafturcs of confluence carried on at Airdrie as the 
weavers and tambourers are chiefly employed by Glafrow 
manufacturers. The diftillery is carried on to a confidence 
amount, there being about 4 o,ooo gallons of proof fife* 
made annually. It is allowed| by judgeSj ^ thfi ^ _ 
rus made at Airdrie are of a peculiar fine quality and flavour i 
and although a fmall quantity only is ufed here, there is a 
conftant demand for it from every part of the country, and 
feme of ,t is exported to America and the Weft Indies on 
account of its quality. There are 7 corn mills, 6 lint mills, 
and 3 fets of rollers for crafting malt. The thirlage is no 
great hardfhip here, as the multures are generally fknall. Oa 
that account, fome proprietors of miljs have allowed them 
to fall to ruin. 

CWfcr._Confidering the number of the inhabitants 
and the want of magiftrates, the morals of the people are 
much better than could be expected. None born in the pa- 
rifh have ever fuffered either corporal or capital punifh- 
ment. The people, in general, are hofpitable and fober. 
Diffipation is only to be found among a few of the lower 
rank. They attend church regularly, and are generally very 
clean and well drefled. As every perfon, who choofes to 
work, finds employment, the trades people, in general, are in 
eafy circumftances, and appear to be contented. Almoft 
every tradefman is proprietor of a houfe and garden, which 
gives them a natural attachment to the place. The people 
of Airdrie feem to have a peculiar foible of keeping a great 
number of ufelefs dogs, which are a nuifance to every paf- 
fenger, and plainly points out the propriety of a tax being 
laid on thefe animals. 

Mifcellaneous 



of Eaft Monkland. -79 

MT,llaneous Obfervatlons .-The parifh is, on the whole, 
J tl- fertile. Its chief advantages arc the 

To Sand peats, water and free ftone, 

from lime, which is the manure that anfwers the fo.l beft. 
Mother difadvantage is, that the College of Glalgow are t, 
tu larsof the teinds, which are faid to be mortified by an 
aft of Parliament, and are therefore not faleable. This and 
feveral neighbouring parifl.es, are therefore obliged, either to 
take leafes of their teinds every i 9 years, and to pay an ar- 
bitrary graffum to the college, or elfe to get them valued by 
a nrocefs before the Court of Seflion, which is attended with 
' reat expence. This calls loudly for redrefs, as it hurts the 
Lit of improving the lands, the College having a nght to 
the fifth part of the rents, in cafe of a valuauon. It would, 
therefore, be for the intereft of thefe parifhes, as well as of 
the College, to apply for an aft of Parliament to make the 
teinds faleable, and to lay out the price upon lands for behoof 
of the College, by Commiffioners appointed for that purpofe; 
which would not only remedy this grievance, but fecure the 
College revenue, encourage agriculture, and prevent many 
expenfive proceffes between the College and the landholders. 
The parifh, in general, is deemed healthy. No epidemical 
diftempers are known here. Many perfons now living are 
above 80 years of age, and 3 near 100. The fmall-pox is 
the moft fatal difeafe, as inoculation, by fome fatal prejudice, 
is not yet become general. Confidering the prodigious num- 
ber that Great Britain loffes annually by this difeafe, a pre. 
mium fhould be given by government, for fome limited time, 
to encourage the general pradtice of inoculation, amongft 
the middling and lower ranks of people. It appears, that 
the ancient Celts or Gauls once inhabited this part of the

<p>Ereclion and Conjlitution. 

THESE parifhes, originally diftinft, were united in 161 8, 
by decreet of the High Commiffion, and have ever 
fince been under the charge of one minifter, who difpenfes 
ordinances alternately at each church; but, as they lie in 
different (hires, (Lundie in Forfar, and Foulis in Perth), each 
parifh continues to have its own kirk-feffion, poor's box, and 
feffion regifter. It will therefore be proper to defcribe each 
©f them feparately. And, firft, of 

LUNDIE. 

Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;c.— Lundie, the name of 
the largeft lake in the parifh, as well as of the parifh itfelf, 
is of Gaelic origin, being derived from Linn-De, which fig- 
nifies the water or pool of God, probably on account of its 
great extent •, as high hills, of old, were called the hills of God, 
and deep waters, the waters of God. It is of a circular form, 
and contains 3258 acres, of which 2000 are arable, about

1 10 in lakes, i r 9 in meadow ground, and the remainder hill 
and pafture. It Is furroundcd by Siddley-hills on the north 
and weft. The fouth flope is green, and affords good paf- 
ture. The north or back part is heathy. The middle of 
the parifh is pretty flat, and the foil is fufficiently produc- 
tive, except in rainy or late feafons, when the crop is feldom 
got in without damage., The air is not unhealthy *, though 
it muft neceffarily be rnoift, from the number of lakes and 
fens in the parifh. 

Lakes and Echo.—Therc are 4 lakes, all of which are fup- 
pofcd to be full of marl, from the fpecimens that have been dug 
from their fides ; but none of them have as yet been drained. 
Lundie loch, which is about a gun-fhot from the church, 
covers 72I acres, and is 60 feet deep in fome places. All 
of them abound in pikes, perches, and eels ; but there are no 
trouts,- or any other kind of fifh in them. Thefe lakes are 
the fountains of Dighty Water, which is fo beneficial to the 
country in general, particularly to Dundee; and which 
empties itfelf into the fea at Monyfeith, about 10 or 12 
miles from this.— At a fmall hill, about 60 feet above the 
lake of Pitlail, there is a remarkable echo. When a perfon 
ftands upon this hill, the furrounding mountains of Siddley 
forming a kind of amphitheatre, he will find a loud cry dis- 
tinctly repeated three times at leaft, if not four f. 

Heritors 

* There are no local diftempers prevalent in either of thefe 
parifhes. The molt frequent difeafe is the rheumatifm. In- 
flances of extraordinary longevity fometimes occur. One man 
died here, ahout 20 years ago, aged 106 j and many have ex- 
ceeded 80. 

f The following anecdote ftrongly marks the fimplicity of coun- 
try people : — One fummer evening, a young fellow fat down on 
this hill to divert himfelf and fome friends, by playing on the

and that of Foulis cannot be ftated with prec Gon; the for-

the advance of rent may be formed from one farm, wh.ch m

AMtW, Produce, and CaUk.-Thc chief produffions 

° a fU v There is more of this 

are barley, oats, potatoes, and flax, lnere is mo 

!aft article raifed here than at Foulis, but not fo much ra - 
cial grafs. Several farmers have tried the culture of wheat, 
but have all given it up, except one. The feed time for oats 
is from the ift of March; for barley, about the aoth or 
May; and for wheat, from the middle of September to the 
end of Oclober. ConGderable quantities of oats, barley, and 
oat-meal, are exported, befides fupplying the inhabitants. 
The crop is femewhat later than at Foulis.-^-There are 140 
horfes, and 364 cattle; ,8 ploughs, chiefly of the conduc- 
tion recommended by Mr James Small, in his Treaufe on 

Ploughs,

he was determined he never would again ; ^ereupon he broke 
his^pe in pieces, and could never afterwards be prevailed upon 
to play any more.

thefe ploughs are managed by two horfes only , and one man 
both holds and drives, which occafions a confiderable faring 
oi time and labour * 

Population. -For thefe 30 years paft, the population has 
varied httlc ; though, from the regifter of baptifms and burn 
f IS ' th£rC 3p P ears t0 be » great increafe ; the number of the 
former, within that period, being 343, and that of the latter 
onIy i 45 The number of inhabitants, at prefent, is 334, 
all of whom attend the eftablilhed Church, except two or 
three Seceders. Of thefe, there are 16 farmers, who keep 
two ploughs each; 2 fmaller ones, who have a horfe and 
iome cows ; ,4 weavers and 2 wrights, who have a cow and 
an acre of ground apiece; 2 taylors, 2 ale-fellers, and 1 
imith. There is alfo a fmall bleachfield, with a warning- 
mill, beetles, &amp;c. and a thread mill, which give work to 14 
or 15 people.

Z ulrivated, and moftly inc.ofed. The ground has 

' ; f " Hope towards the fouth, which renders the Gtuat.oa 

1 IgLable. There is only one hill, called the BU* 
L L, which, though noted for good pafturage formerly, « 
„bw become of little value, by the total removal of tap 
from it. There are neither rivers nor rivulets m either of 
Z pariflres, but feveral fes. One, which was ca. ed the 
Piper Dam, and which covered 55 acres, was dratned about 
, ; years a R o. A confiderable quantity of marl, as well as of 

'I, has been dug from it. It not only fupphes the pardh, 
but part of the neighbourhood, with that fpeces of manure, 

and yields a confiderable fum, yearly to the proprietor. 

Heritor, Tenants, and i^r.-The whole parifli is the pro. 
perty of Sir William Murray of Anchtertyre, Baronet, who 
does not refide in it._More than one half is occupied by one 
farmer and his fon •, another farms 180 acres, a third 150, 
and the reft is divided Into about 20 ftnall farms. The rent 
is above 1000I. Sterling. The farms let at from 10s. to 
20 s. an acre. 

AgY'uulture, Produce, and Cattle -About one third of the 
arable land in this parilh, amounting to nearly 400 acres, is 
laid out in green crops, grafs, turnips, potatoes, and flax. 
The reft produces wheat, oats, and barley. Foulis was the 
firft parifh in this country where a regular rotation of crops 
was attempted. It is about 20 years fince the proprietors 
introduced it, and the fuccefs encourages the continuance. 
The feed time is the fame as at Lundie 5 and the crop is 
generally all cut down and gathered in by the ift of October.

confidence quantities of grain. There are about 90 horf es 
and 300 head of cattle. The number of ploughs and carts 
is much the fame as at Lundie. 

Population.— Owing to the enlarging of farms, and throw- 
ing feveral pofleffions into one, the population has decreafed 
to the number of about 100. The number of baptifms, 
during the firft ten years of the prefent century, was 1634 
and, during the laft ten years preceding 1 790, only 9 r . Yet, 
during the laft 30 years, the number of baptifms exceeds that 
of the burials by nearly one third, there having been 300 
baptifed, and only 208 buried in the parifh within that 
period. The number of inhabitants, at prefent, is 314, all 
members of the eftablifhed Church, except 8 or 9 Seceders ; 
among whom there are 10 weavers, 2 wrights, 2 taylors, 1 
finith, 1 fhoemaker, 1 diftiller, and 20 fmall farmers, each 
of whom has a plough, fome with 4 horfes, and others 1 or

and 30 1. in money, including communion elements. It may 
be eftimated at 70 1. per annum. Colonel Alexander Dun- 
can of Lundie is fuppofed to be patron of both parifhes, 
though Sir William Murray claims the patronage of Foulis. 
The church of Lundie lies exaftly 3 miles and 120 feet dif- 
tant from Foulis, in a north-weft direftion. When it was 
built cannot be afcertained j nor is there any thing very re- 
markable about it, except an elegant monument lately erected 
at the eaft end of it, by Lady M. Duncan of London, in me- 
mory of her hufband, the late Sir William Duncan, phyfieian 
to his Majefty, who lies interred there. But the church of 
Foulis merits particular notice, as a remarkable piece of an- 
cient architefture. It is 88 feet 10 inches in length, and 27 
feet 9 in breadth, and is built all of hewn flone. It is per- 
fectly entire, without the leaft fymptom of decay, although 
it was built in the year 1142, during the time of the Cru- 
fades, as appears by an infcription on a large oak beam that 
Supported the organ loft, having been erected in confluence

rifh, but both are poorly provided, the legal falary 0 f each 
being only 40 1. Scotch. The average number of fcholars 
attending each is 30; and, though aided by voluntary fub- 
fcriptions, the encouragement is fo trifling, that the parifhes 
are often expofed to changes, and as often but indifferently 
fupplied. The average number of poor in each parifh is c .

feen here, particularly a number of paintings upon a wainfcot 
partition, (which feparates Lord Gray's burial-place from the 
church, and is fuppofed to be equally ancient), reprefentin? our 
Saviour in various attitudes, the Apoftles, with the inli ?n ia of 
their martyrdom, the Roman Centurion, &amp;c. At the weft end 
of the church, there are the remains of a large font befides an- 
other without, and a third within the door. About zo years 
ago, there Mood in the eaft end of the church a large Mack oak 
table, which went by the name of the altar. It was placed be-

to them -The fuel generally ufed here is coals, at the rate of 
,1 ^chalder. Some peats are alfo ufed.-The principal 
advantages of Lundie and Foulis are their vicinity to the Tay, 
by which lime and coals are eafily procured, and the extra 
produce of the parifhes exported—The names of feveral of 
the villages are derived from the Gaelic ; e.g. Bafiavdo, the 
old black town on the back of the hill ; Lwcrief, a town on 
the fide of a hill, with trees, and the like : Others from their 
fituationi as Smiftonvn, becaufe mifts lie long upon it, &amp;c.—

Name, Situation, and Extent. 
1HE name Moufivald is fuppofed to be of Saxon origi- 
nal, Unifying a wood, or as fome think, a plain rifing 
country, not covered with wood. The term wold feems to 
have been defective of long ranges of high land lying in a 
particular direction. Thofe places Co named in England, viz. 
I ork Wolds, Lincoln Wolds, &amp;c. and the range of which 
this diftricl makes a part, lie from S. E. to N. W . ; and 
having the S. W. fide much expofed to the ftrong and fre- 
quent S. S. W. and W. winds, blowing from the mouth of 
the Solway Frith, probably accounts for their appearance 
without trees on the higher parts, while there was formerly 
plenty of wood on the lower ground ; and perhaps wold was 
the term for the whole range of hills from the S. E. end in 
Moufwald to the N. W. end in Tinwald. But in later 
times, when the country became better peopled, and was 
divided into diftricls,. or parilhes, it was neceflary to diftin- 
guifli each, by annexing fome other word or name, which, 
jn this f fiance, feems to have been from the Englifli. And, 
'Ariel: was neareft to the great mofs, called,

I ^tJprtof the name is not according to ,*e or,^ 
felling, we may as well fuppofe mous, as now ufed, to have 

P u r. The oarifh is a part of that diftrift for- 

formerly been mofs.-T.te panin is a p 

ffi erly called the ftewartry of Annandale, now united to the 
flnre of Dumfries. It is, in length, between 4 and 5 Engliflx 
m Ues, from north to Couth-, and, excluding the mofs, neany 
about 2 Englifh miles in breadth, on an average from eaK 
weft , but! including the mofs, its figure nearly refem*es 
that of a heart, narrowing both on the north and fouth 
garter, as it defcends to the mofs, and ftiU grow mg nar- 
rower, till it terminates on the fmall river Lochar, winch 
divides it from Carlaverock. It would meafure from the eaf C 
to this fouth-wefterly point between 4 and 5 miles. 

Surface and Soil.-Thc furface of the parlfh is plain and 
level rather than hilly ; and, though there are feveral rifing 
grounds in it, they have fo gentle an afcent as to be cultiva- 
ted with the plough to the very fummit.-The foil is vari- 
ous i two or three farms adjoining the mofs have a confider- 
able' quantity of pafture ground, which is wet and marfhy, 
and fome of the arable land is alfo wet ; while other parts 
of thefe farms, rifing confidently above the level of Lochar- 
inofs, are light and fandy. A confiderable part of the parifli 
next to thefe, though rifing a little above them, appears, for 

a

wald, in the 1 ft and 2d Volumes.

a mile in breadth, to be pretty level, and is either light and J 
'andy, or a thin foil, and gravelly bottom; and, in f 0me 
Places, very rtony, much inclined to produce broom in the 
courfe of 3 or 4 years, even when laid down rich with grafs 
feeds. Next to thefe farms, the rifing grounds towards the 
eaftern part of the parifh are of a moderately deep and rich 
foil *. 

Air, Climate, and Z)/».-Notwithftanding 882 acres and j 
2 roods of Lochar Mofs lie in the weftern extremity of this ! 
parifh, and notwithstanding its contiguity to that large track 
of mofs, of which it is a part, the air is pure, and tolerably 
healthy, owing to the vicinity of the fea, which flows within 
4 Englifti miles of the center of the diftrict, and the dry and 
fandy bottom of the far greater part of it. No epidemical 
difeafes are peculiar to the inhabitants. Rheumatifms and 
nervous or hyfterical complaints prevail of late years much 
more than formerly. On the whole, although the inhabi- 
tants, in general, do not arrive at extreme old age, yet num- 
bers attain to 70, and feverals to 80 years. There are a few 



at 



* The face of the parifh is greatly altered to the worfe with- 
in thefe 12 years. In the grounds belonging to the Duke of 
Queenfberry, confiding of about 2870 acres of arable, palture, 
mofs, and meadow ; 92 acres, or fomewhat more, were lately 
wood landh, confifting chiefly of beautiful thriving oak, afh, and 
other foreft trees, finely interfperfed with corn fields, checquer- 
ed, both in the low and rifing grounds, with clumps and beauti- 
ful drips of natural wood. But thefe woods, which were fo or- 
namental to the country, and ufeful both to the proprietor and 
to the public, have not only been fold and cut down, but left 
uninciofed, and e.\pofed to the cattle ; fo that not one in a hun- 
dred of them will ever again arrive at perfection. The farm- 
houfe which the traveller had formerly only here and there a 
peep of, are now left naked, and expofed to view in every direc- 
tion ; and, what is worfe, without any thing to ihelter them 
from the furious gtifts of wind which fometimes blow from the 
opening of the Solway Frith, and from the S. W. and W. 



of Moufuoald. 295 
at prefent above 80, and one woman in the 88th year of her 



age. 



Sericulture and Produce.-T\xz crops confift of oats, barley, 
and potatoes. Some few farmers raife a little wheat and 
rye Some, too, fow turnips, which feem to agree very we 
with our foil. A very few plant field- cabbages, and fow fmaU 
cuantities of grey peafe. Moft of the farmers in this diftndt 
fow red clover ' and rye grafs, with barley, for cutting, the 
greateft part of which is confumed by their own horfes. 
They alfo begin to lay out their grounds much richer than 
formerly, and fow them with white clover and ftable feeds 
for pafture, and find themfelves well repaid. The foil of 
this parifh, however, feems to be too light and thin, in gene- 
ral, for producing wheat in fufficient quantities to indemnify 
the farmer for his labour and expence. They fow wheat 
after a potatoe fallow, a fummer fallow, or after turnips, 
which had been fown in the drill way •, and, after all the 
pains and expence beftowed on a fummer fallow, it hardly 
brings them 10I. per acre, which is fcarcely two thirds of 
what an acre of wheat in a wheat country would fetch. Moft 
farmers fow a little lintfeed for their own ufe. A consider- 
able quantity of potatoes is carried to Dumfries market, 6 
miles diftant from the center of this parifh, or to floops at 
different parts of the Solway Frith, about 5 or 6 miles from 
hence. Oats and barley are the chief grains the farmers, in 
general, depend upon for paying their rent •, and they raife a 
confidence quantity of both, of an excellent quality. A 
good deal of hemp was railed and fpun in this parifh 40 
years ago. At prefent, there is very little to be fcen.' There 
is no land in common in the diftrict, every proprietor and 
every tenant knowing his own property. There is very lit— 
■ tie wafte grour.d, the above mofs excepted, which affords 

but

but little pafture, and a finall fpot of moor on the N E 
quarter of the parifh, which is the higheft ground in it, and 
which ftiU remains in a ftate of nature, and on the fummit 
of which there is fome little heath ; a few fteep, to the num. 
ber of 140, are fupported on it, and on the farm of which it 
is a part. 

W jod and Wild Animals.- There are fome thriving natural 
woods, the property of Sir Robert Grierfon of Lagg, on the 
north quarter of the parifh ; and feveral acres have lately 
been planted by that gentleman, with different forts of fir 
and other foreft trees. There is alfo a fmall piece of natural 
wood, confifting of oak and a(h, on a farm on the fouth 
fide of the parim, lately purchafed by the Vifcount of Stor- 
mont.— The wood-lark, bullfinch, and moft of the other 
kinds of birds common to the fouth of Scotland, are to be 
found in the woods. It is faid there are numbers of the 
golden-crefted wrens feen here. In the mofs there are the 
bittern, fnipe, moorfowl, and curliew. Some black game 
have alfo been feen. Plenty of wild ducks hatch here, and 
abundance of wild geefe in hard winters. Woodcocks are 
alfo found here in winter ; and the fwallow, cuckoo, field- 
fare, green and grey plovers, in their feafons. Polecats, 
commonly called fumarts, abound here ; and there are num- 
bers of foxes ; both of which, particularly the latter, make 
great havoc among the poultry. 

Rivulets — There are no rivers in the parifh, Lochar, 3s 
has been noticed* only touching it for a few yards in one 
point. But it is well watered with feveral rivulets, which 
take their rife in the higher grounds, and run into Lochar. 
It has alfo plenty of fine fpring wells. St Peters, about 100 
yards weft from the church, is one continued fpring for 30

the population of this parilh cannot be afcertained ; but, from 
a pretty accurate furvey taken in fpring 1791, the number,

* Prom the dry land quite through Lochar Mofs, there is a 
fine fpot of meadow ground, made in the courfe of ages by the 
rivulet, which was the ancient boundary, in this diftritf, be- 
tween Nithfdale and Annandale, and by thofe rivulets which 
run by the Cleughbrae-mill, and by the village of Moufewald, 
and which meet at the fide of the glebe, a little below the 
manfe, and thence got the name of the Minifter's Burn. Of 
this meadow ground, 102 acres, lying in this parifli, and be- 
longing to the Duke of Queenlberry, were divided among his 
tenants about 40 years ago, and inclofed by ditches. A confi- 
derable pait ot it is ftill laid under water by the Michaelmas 
floods, whereby it is enriched, but feldom fuffers any damage 
by the floods which happen about Lammas, as the meadows on 
the fide of Lochar often do.

burials exatf, no account being kept of children dying under 2

Many have 8, feveral 10, and fome 12 children.

berry has feveral cottagers, who poffefs a houfe, kept in re- 
pair at their own expence, and a fmall kail-yard, for which 
they pay 3 s. and the higheft 5 s. yearly. The farmer's cot-

Village and Antiquities.— The village of Moufwald is the 
only one in the parifti, that comes properly under this de- 
Vol. VII. P P fcription. 

* The prices of provifions are always regulated here by the 
market of Dumfries, which is only 6 miles from the center of 
this parifh ; and moll articles may be bought full as low in the 
market as on the fpot. Labour is much the fame price in all 
the neighbourhood of Dumfries. Servant's wages are more 
than doubled within thefe 50 years; male-fervants 3 1. 10s. aud

and Banks 29 ; the reft of the parifh having only 2 or 3' 
houfes ftanding together, or a finglc farnvhoufe, and the 
offices belonging to it. There are the remains of five old 
ftonc fquare buildings in this parifh, all of which proba- 
bly, in former times, were ufed both as places of refidence 
and defence againft the depredations of the Engliffi. Three 
of them, though now ruinous, had part of three ftories ftand- 
ing within thefe 50 years. One, at a place called Buckler- 
hole, (or, as fome would have it, Bucklerhcld), had lately two 
ftories, and what they called a ivatch-houfe. Great part of 
the walls are now taken down. Another at Raffles was pretty 
entire 12 years ago. And the old part of the manfe, in the 
memory of thofe with whom the prefent incumbent has con- 
yerfed, was a high tower, having a pigeon-houfe at top. Its 
walls are very thick *.

Moufwald Mams, or, as it is fometimes called, the Place It 
has been the iargeft, and is very itrongly built. It was the feat 
pf a Sir Simon Carruthers, the Laird of Moufwald, who was 
what the old people called a belted knight His only daughter, 
ft is faid, married into the Qweenlberry family, by which means 
they came into poffeiHon of the eftate. In the aile of the 
church there were formerly two ftatues as big as the life ; the 
one is faid to be an effigy of Sir Simon, and the other of his 
Lady. The latter was of beautiful white free ftone, and has 
been quite carried off. That reprefenting Sir Simon now lies 
on the outfide of the aile; his head lying on a pillow; his feet 
on a hon ; his hands elevated in a fupplicating pofture. There 
is no infcription. There are alfo feveral camps in the panih 
probably Britifh ; one at Burronhill, with a ltrong double fofle 
or ditch. In digging the foundation for a new fcnoolhoufe 
there three years ago, feveral human bones were found. It is 
a fine fituation. Another n.gh the top of a little hill, called 
Panteth-hill, which has an estenfiye and commanding profpeift.

The fchoolmafter's Salary is. 100 merles Scotch. The fchool 
*ees are only 1 s. per quarter for Engliffi and writing, 1 s . 6 d. 
for arithmetic, and 2 s. per quarter for Latin. Both falary 
and fees are by far too fmall to encourage a perfon of claffical 
education to continue the toilfome office for any length of 
time : Hence we are often changing mailers. It is a great 
pity but that fome fuitable provifion were made for fo ufeful 
an order of men. In winter, there is a private fchool kept 
in another quarter of the parifh, to which there is between 
30 s. and 40 s. per annum left by the late fchoolmafter, a na- 
tive of the parifh, and between 4 1, and 5 1. to the poor, 
which fall to them at the death of two men, to whom thefe 
fmall fums are left in liferent. Several children find it more 
convenient to attend the above fchool, and one in the parifh 
of Ruthwell ; fo that the public khoolmafter's income will 
not exceed 13 1. per annum. There is a very good fchool- 
houfe lately built, but no houfe for the fchoolmafter. 

Poor.— The number of poor on the roll, who receive quar- 
terly fupplies, has not exceeded 6 in any one year fince 
1 772 ; befides whom, fome few others receive occafional aid. 
There are no poor's funds in this parifh befides what arife 
from the weekly colleaio'ns. An addition of 5 1. Sterling, 
however, was left at Whitfunday 1791, by a man who died 
in the parifh of Dumfries, and left feveral children of his 
own, whofe progenitors were natives of Moufwald. There' 
are none belonging to this parifh who beg, yet it is daily 
infefted with beggars from Ireland and the neighbourhood 
of Dumfries. Numbers from Ireland go up to England dri- 
ving cattle, and return home begging.

ers are fo convinced of this, that they have of late brought 
coals above 30 miles diftance, and caft fewer peats than for- 
merly.

ftafices None have emigrated, though a good many young 

men po from hence to England and the Weft India Iflands, in 

different lines of life; and feveral men, and fome few women,

any capital crime. None have been banifhed. Within thefe

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5194100">CUMMERTREES</name>. 

(County of Dumfries.— Prefbytery of Annan.— Synod of 

Dumfries.) 

By a Friend to Statijlical Inquiries.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 
T7«ROM the name of the parifh there is little doubt of its 
havm 2 been formerly covered with timber. Confider 
able tratfs of natural wood flill remain, befides the fubter- 
ranean forefts of oak, fir, and birch, with which the molTes 
are every where replenished. It now confifts of the antient 
panfli of Cummertrees, and of the parifh or chaplainry of 
Trailtrow annexed to it after the Reformation ; and the 
whole is bounded by the Solway Frith on the fouth, by the 
parifhes of Annan and St. Mungo on the eatt, and Daltcn 
and Ruthwell on the north and weft. The parifh is about 4 
miles long and 3 miles broad ; but, as its figure is very irre- 
gular, its extent cannot be accurately determined. 

Climate and Sw/.—The climate is like that of moft of the 
other parifhes on the Solwny Frith, humid, but by no means 
unhealthy ; and the divifion that has lately taken place of 
large trails of common, and the confequent improvement of 
thofe lands, by inclofing and draining, do no doubt contri- 
bute to the falubrity of the air, and the prevention of difeafes

occafioned by flagnated water. The foil is various, but in 
general good; in the northern part, it is a loam above a 
free-ftone; in fomc of the centrical parts, it is remarkably 
rich and fertile, and lies above lime-ttonc ; near the fea, 
the foil is fandy, and what is now converted into arable, was 
formerly an extenfive rabbit warren-, there are alfo many 
large trafts of flow mofs in this parifh, not capable of im- 
provement, unlefs at an enormous expence. 

Population.— In 1755, the population was rated at 63 1. It 
is probable that this eftimate was inaccurately made. The 
examinable perfons, above 8 years of age, amount, by a late 
account taken of them, to 845, amongft whom are included 
fomc tranfient people, who are employed in the lime works 
at Kilhead. Notwithftanding the quantity of waftc or com- 
mon land brought into culture in this parilh, it is doubtful 
whether population has increafed fince the beginning of this 
century, as the farms are much more extenfive than they 
formerly were, and the number of tenants have decreafed in 
a proportional ratio. Twenty-five years ago, about 40 peo- 
ple, fome of them farmers, but moftly labourers and tradef- 
roen, emigrated from this parifh to America, enticed by ad- 
vertifements, fent from thence by perfons who had acquired 
large tracts of country, and wifhed to have it peopled. The 
emigrants, upon their arrival, were miferably deceived and 
difappointed, and thofe of them who had money enough to 
pay for their pafTage home, returned, bewailing their credu- 
lity. There is no town or village in the parifh. It is poffef- 
fed by 4 heritors, 3 of whom are refident. 

Rivers and Fifiings. — The Annan, which bounds this pa- 
rifh on the eaft, is the only river $ it produces falir.on, lal-l 
mon trcuts, and a fmall fifh called hirlings, that are fome-

times taken in great quantities, and are, it is faid, peculiar tou 
the rivers that difcharge themfelves into the Solway Frith, 
They are of the fize of a good burn trout, or herring, and 
are of two kinds, the red and the white ; but the red are of 
a much fuperior quality to the other, and arc remarkably de- 
licate : They afford much fport to the angler. In the Solwav 
Frith, great quantities of flounders and cod are taken, and fome 
times turbot and foles are alfo caught; the prices, therefore, 
of both red and white fifh, are, in general, moderate. 

j^m^.-Fr.ee-ftone, of a very hard and durable kind, 
and extremely proper for building, abounds in the northern 
and central parts of this parifh ; but the excellent lirae-ftone 
quarry near Kiihead, has been the fole means of bringing the 
wade lands into culture, and promoting the improvement of 
every part of the parifh. The limeftone got here is of an 
exceeding fine quality, and is purchafed, either calcined, or 
in a raw ftate, by the whole country around. The price, 
when burnt, is high, occafioned by the duty laid upon coals 
imported from the oppofite fide of the Frith, as it is fold at 
1 1 d.per Carlifle bufhel, each of which contains 3 Winchef- 
ter bufhels ; but if the duty was taken off, might be afford- 
ed at 8 d. or 8| d. which would be a confiderable faving to 
the poor farmers, and the lofs to the revenue fo inconfider- 
able, efpecially when balanced by other advantages, as not to 
merit any attention. The duty upon water-born coal ap- 
pears the more grievous and partial to the people on the 
Scotch fide ol the Frith, becaufe their neighbours on the 
Englifli fide are exempted from it, although it is difficult to 
determine upon what principle fuch exemption was founded. 1 
Many applications have been made to government upon this ■ 
fubject, but the duty ftill remains unrepealed, to the great ! 
©bftru&amp;ion of the improvement and cultivation of the coun- 
try. 



of Cwnmertrccs. 3°7 

To this unaccountable duty may alio be bribed the 
T ,1 o manufaaures, not only in this parifh, but in moft 
l0W " s of the county of Dumfries, and in all Galloway , . 

that 

0 ^ repeated reprefentations made upon this matter and 
X fubftitute fome other tax, upon the luxuries of h e, p 
Ueu of a duty which fo manifeftly tends to hurt agnculture, 
and to prevent the introduaion of manicures into the 
fouth of Scotland. 

Church, School, and Poor.-The patronage of this parifli is 
in the Crown. The ftipend has been lately augmented, and 
now is S ol. Sterling in money, ,00 merks for communion 
elements, and 6 chalders of visual, viz. 4 of meal and 2 
of barley, which, at the ordinary prices or thefe art.cles in 
the country, brings the ftipend to a total of at leaft 120 1. 
Sterlings annum. The minifter has alfo a glebe of 7 or 8 
acres of rich land, and 16 acres laid off to him at the divi- 
sion of a common in his neighbourhood, which is now moft- 
ly brought into culture.— The fchoolmafter has the legal fa- 
lary of 100 merks Scotch, 5 1. lis. 3d. Sterling— The 
number of poor is not great, and there is no other fund for 
their fupport, except the weekly collections at the church, 
and the fines exacted for irregular marriages, and from other 
delinquents, who have been brought before the kirk-feffion. 

Agriculture, Produce, &amp;rV.— The improvement of the land, 
In confequence of the diicovery of lime-ftone, has, within 
thefe 30 years paft, been remarkably advanced. The chief 
crops are oats and barley, with fome wheat ; potatoes are al- 
fo cultivated to exceeding good purpofe, and conftitute a 
large proportion of the food of the people. Every farmer* 

alfo,

fo, fows feme turnips, which, with the potatoes, are planted 
» rows, according to the drill hufbandry, and as they are 
*ept clean, howed, and often plowed between the rows, are 
a good preparation for a barley crop the enfuing feafon. Oats 
are never fewn earlier than the middle of March, or the be- 
ginning of April, and barley from the end of April to the 
xniddleofMay, wheat commonly in October, rye-grafs and 
clover are now almoft univerfally fown in with the barley 
crop a large part of the parifh is fubdivided and inclo J 
frith hedges and ditches, and, upon the whole, improvements , 
in agriculture are daily advancing. 

Valuation and Real Rent.-Thc valued rent is 3 1 8 1 merks 
the real rent about 2 8ool. Sterling, and what may appear 
extraordinary is, that the real rent in the year 1733, wh en 
the late incumbent got an augmentation, was little more 
than 500 1. Sterling. This great advance is only to be a- 
icribed to the difcovery and ufe of lime, and the divifion of 
the commons. The whole extent of the parifh, by adtuat 
meafurement, is nearly 7 8co acres, in which is comprehend, 
fd large trafls of mofs and muir incapable of culture. 

Horfes, Black Cattle, Sheep, ferV._The number of horfes 
cannot be exactly afcertained, but the breed is much improv- 
ed by Englim ftallions coming into the parifh, in the fum- 
mer feafon, and the tenants, in general, breed and bring up 
as many young horfes as fupply themfelves. Every farmer 
rears a confiderable number of young cattle, which, after re- 
ferving a fufficient number to keep up their flock, are fold 
to jobbers and dealers, when they are one or two years old, 
who carry them to the Carlifle and other markets. The 
price of a good year old ftirk is 3 1. or 3 1. 3 s. The num. 
ber of fheep kept in the parifh. is very inconfiderable, moft

of the tenants being debarred from keeping them, on ac 
count of the hedges and planting. Many iwme are alfo ndft 
ed in this parifh, which are fed with potatoes and corn, and, 
when fat, fold to dealers, who cure and export their carcafes. 

Price of Provifms, labour, &amp;JV.— The average price of oat, 
meal, for thefe 7 years paft, has been 20 d. per ftone ; the 
pnce of barley, during that period, has not been lower than 
6 s. nor higher than 10 s. 6 d. per Carlifle bufhel j the me- 
dium, therefore, may be eftimated at 8 s. Confiderable 
quantities of oat-meal are annually exported to Greenock 
and the weft coaft ; and all the barley, except the fmall por- 
tion retained for home confumpt, is bought up for the Liver- 
pool market, where oats are frequently fent. Confiderable 
quantities of potatoes are alfo exported. Grain is (hipped at 
the mouth of the river Annan, and at a fmall harbour called 
Powfoot, in this parifh. The wages of men fervants are, in 
general, about 8 1. per annum; of women, 3 1. 10s. or 4 1. 
per annum, befides maintenance. They are all hired from 
half year to half year ; and the late increafe of wages may be 
imputed to the vicinity of England, where they are fhll 
higher, and where many of the fervants in the lower part of 
Annandale frequently engage themfelves. The wages of 
day-labourers, employed in hedging or ditching, are 1 s. and 
fometimes is. 2d. per day without viftuals j mafons and 
joiners have 1 s. 6 d. per day. 

iW-r.—The military road, from Portpatrick to Gretna, 
made at the expence of government, interfefts the fouthern 
part of the parifh. As it was lately falling into difrepair, the 
funds arifing from the compofition of the ftatute not being 
fufficient for prcferving it, the truftees for the high-roads 
made an application to Parliament for an aa to ereft turn- 
pikes,

pikes, and levy tolls for keeping this road in repair ; but they 
havmg difcovered, at the fame time, that the diftance between 
Dumfries and Annan might be fhortened by following ano- 
ther traft, they obtained a power alfo to carry a road by that 
line, and to levy tolls for its fupport. This has accordingly 
been done ; and the new road is carried to the northward o{ 
the military road, through a country rather in an uncultivat- 
ed ftate, which has already received much benefit from it. 
The other roads in the parilh are fupported by the com- 
pofition for the ftatute labour, which, however, is very ina- 
dequate to the purpofe. 

Antiquities and Curioftties. — The Caftle of Hoddam, fituat- 
ed near th river Annan, is as perfect, and kept in as good re- 
pair as any buikling of the kind in Scotland, it was conftrucl- 
ed originally by the Lord Hemes, who frequently refided 
here, but was greatly increafed, and improved with additional 
buildings, by John Murray Earl of Annandale, into whofe 
pofTeffion it came, in the courfe of the laft century. Mr 
Sharpe of Hoddam refides with his family in the Caftle, 
which he has repaired, and much improved, by adding feve- 
ral rooms to it. On the hill immediately above the Caftle, 
ftands the lower of Repentance, a fquare building, with re- 
markably thick walls, about 25 feet in height. There are 
various traditions concerning its name, and the motives for 
erecting it ; but as it is fituated on very high ground, and 
feen at a confiderable diftance, there is no doubt that it was 
ufed as a watch tower, from whence the motions of the Eng- 
lifh, before the union of the crowns, were difcerned, and 
upon which beacons were lighted, to alarm the country when 
the enemy appeared. This tower ftands in the church-yard 
of Trailtrow, where the people of that fide of the p;irifti are 
fn ufe to bury, and where Mr Murray of Murraythwaite has 



vf Cummerirees. 



a burying place walled in, adjoining to the tower. In the 
lime-ftone quarries of Kilhead, feveral veins of a beautiful 
fpotted dark coloured marble have appeared, and large blocks 
of it being cut out, have been worked up for chimneys and 
hearths, fome of which have been fent to London. This 
marble is of a dark colour, and is mixed with {hells, petrified 
vegetables, and other bodies, which greatly add to its variety 
and beauty, as the whole receives a very fine polifli. 

Feuel — Peats are the only feuel ufed in this parifli ; the 
calling and preparing of which, during the fummer, con- 
fumes much of the time which the people ought to dedicate 
to the improvement of their farms* From this labour, they 
would be in a great meafure relieved, if coal was either found 
in this country, or allowed to be imported free of duty, from 
the oppofite Ihore of the Solway Frith.

<p>Origin of the Name. 

BALLINGRY fignifies the Village of the Crofs. It is a 
compound of the Gaelic word Bal t which is a village, 
and inri, being the initials found on thofe crones erected of- 
ten in the fields, in honour of Chriftianity, on which were 
infcribed J. N. R. J. Jefus Nazarenus Rex Judicorum, Jefus 
of Nazareth King of the Jews. 

Appearance and Soil. — The figure of this parifh is irregular, 
its utmoft length being 3 miles, its utmofi breadth not above 
one. The foil, in this parifh, is in general reckoned good, 
though not ftrong ; there is not more than a fourth of it in 
tillage, the *eft is employed in pafturage. In general, this 
part of the country is very imperfectly improved, and ex- 
tremely naked of planting, excepting the eltates of Lochore, 
Ballingry, and Navity, which have attained a confiderable de- 
gree, both of cultivation and of beauty. 

Crops generally raifed^ and limes of /owing. — Oats is the

advantageous crop ; they fow alfo a mixture of rough bear 
and barley, peafe and beans and fome wheat ; but of this laft, 
very little. The time of fowing oats is towards the end of 
March, or the beginning of April j they fow their bear from 
the beginning to about the middle of May. The rotation 
of crops here in general is, after breaking up ground, to 
take two crops of oats, and one of bear ; with this laft crop 
they fow grafs feeds, and the ground then commonly remains 
in grafs 3 or 4 years before it is again broke up. There is, 
in this parifh, one mill, that of Inchgaw, to which the diffe- 
rent eftates are bound thirle, that is, muft have ground at 
that particular mill what quantity of victual is confumed by 
the families living on the eftate. 

Population. — In 1755, the numbers were rated at 464

Of the above there are 80 Seceders. About 30 years ago, it ■ 
appears this parifh contained above double the number of in- 
habitants, which it does at prefent. The obvious caufe of 
this decreafe of population, has been the throwing the prin_ 
cipal eftates into grafs farms, which are now in the hands, of 
a few confiderable dealers in cattle. 

Produaiom.— Although there is a confiderable quantity of 
grain raifed in this parifh, yet the foil being better calculated 
for grafs, the rearing of cattle forms the moft confiderable 
employment of the tenants, and is one of the principal pro- 
duAions of the parifh. There are alfo } n this parifh both

Park purchafed Lochore, upon which eftate they both lie. 
They are of an excellent quality ; and will be of confiderable 
benefit to this part of the country, as affording the means 
of improvement at a convenient diftance, and at a moderate 
price. 

Church and Poor. — The living confifts of 48 bolls of victual, 
one third being bear, and two thirds meal, and 48 1. in mo- 
ney. The manfe and offices are in very good repair. — In lo 
fmall a parifh, the number of poor cannot be confiderable ; 
at prefent there are 7 upon the poor's lift. The funds for 
their maintenance are extremely good. The collections at 
the church door may amount to 5 1. per annum ; but there is 
an income befides the collections, of about 30 1. Sterling an- 
nually, arifing partly from money, and partly from land, the 
property of the poor. The poor receive according to their 
ntceflities, from 6 d. to 2 s, per week. 

Waters. — There are no rivers of any confequencc in this 
parifh. There is one fmall rivulet named Orr, which iffues 
from a confiderable lake, called Lochore, from which the 
eftate takes its name. The prelent proprietor hath formed 
a plan for draining this lake, which is already far advanced, 
the fuccefs of which will gain about 150 acres of excellent 
land, befides draining the furrounding grounds, which at pre- 
lent are annually overflowed. Towards the eaftern extre- 
mity of the hike, there is a fmall ifland, upon which is fitu- 
ated an old caftle, furrounded by a high wall. The building 
confifts of an old tower, and feveral lower houfes. It was 
built by Duncan de Lochore, former proprietor of the eftate, 
in the reign of Malcolm III. ; but the eftate paffing into the 
hands of the Wardlaws of Torry, it from them received 
confiderable repairs j and the name of Robertus Ward/aw, is 

upon

upon the chief entry to the tower. At prefent it is ruinous, 
but forms a very beautiful object in the lake. 

In this parifh there is a Roman camp, a little to the we 
ward of the houfe of Lochore, which is flill remarkably en- 
tire although, in fome places, it is levelled and defaced. Il 
form is nearly fquare. There appear, on the north and we!?, 
fides, three rows of ditches, and as many ramparts of eartii 
and ftone. There is a- round turret on that fide which is 
next the loch, the total circumference meafuring about 2020 
feet. 

It has been conjectured, with much probability, that this 
was the fpot where the ninth legion was attacked, and nearly 
cut off, by the Caledonians, as we have it narrated by Taci- 
tus, in his life of Agricola. The prefent proprietor of Loch- 
ore, in profecuting the plan mentioned above, for draining 
the lake, having occafion to cut fome ditches immediately 
under the camp, the workmen have dug up feveral antiqui- 
ties, which are evidently Roman, particularly the head of a 
Roman fpear. Juft by the camp is a village called Blair, 
which, in the original, is faid to fignify locus pugnae, or a 
place where a battle has been fought.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5566309">GLADSMUIR</name>

{County ofEaJl Lothian.— Pre/by tery of Haddington.- 
Synod of Lothian and Tweedak.) 

By the Reverend Mr George Hamilton.</head> 



<p>Origin and Name. 
»Tp«HE church of Gladfmuir was built by Baillie of Lam- 
-1 mingron, in the year 1695, and the parifh was then 
formed by annexations from the contiguous parifhes, Tra- 
"nent, Hadington, and Aberlady. The etymology of the 
name offers nothing worth enquiry ; it probably arofe from 
the number of glades (kites), which frequented this parifh 
in its barren ftate, and are yet not unfrequent in the neigh- 
bourhood. 

Soil and Climate.— Between the Frith on the north, and 
the banks of the Tyne on the fouth, the country rifes gently 
to a ridge, on the fummit of which the church is placed. 
The top of this ridge, which was long an open muir, was 
for ages robbed of its foil, being incefTantly pared of its turf 
by the neighbouring inhabitants ; it is now, therefore, clayey, 
fhallow, and barren ; but the foil becomes more fertile as you 
defcend on either fide. The air is pure, dry, and healthy, 
and epcdemical diflempers accordingly are rare. 



Landed 



of Gladfmuir. 



3*7 



Landed Property, Agriculture, CSV. — The parifh is divided 
amongft 1 5 landed proprietors, only three of whom refide 
within its bounds. It contains between 5 and 6000 acres of 
land, of which 3000 are in tillage ; above 500 acres are an- 
nually fown with grafs feeds ; about 1600 are in pafture, and 
above 200 in wood. The real rent is about 4500 1. paid by 
22 farmers, 4 of whom pay above 300 1. a year each, and 7 
under 1 00 1. The rents are wholly paid in money, the kane 
and carriages, which were formerly exa&amp;ed, being now con- 
verted. 

One hundred and fix two horfe ploughs, and 240 horfes, 
are employed ; 134 black cattle, and about 100 fheep are 
kept. Wheat, barley, oats, and peafe, are the common pro- 
duce of this diftrict ; cabbage and turnip crops are little 
raifed, nor are potatoes fo much cultivated as perhaps they 
ought to be, confidering what a wholefome and cheap food 
they yield to the lower clafs of people. 

Population, Employment, Seels, and Manners. — The villages 
in this parifli are 3 in number, and, by a fingular coincidence, 
they contain exactly 59 families each. The number of fa- 
milies in the whole parifh is 340 ; of fouls, 1380 ; of thefe 
647 are males, 733 are females, 1010 are above 10 years of 
age, and 370 are under 10. By Dr Webfter's table in 1755, 
the numbers were 1415. From the appearance of ruined 
houfes on the north fide of the parifh, an opinion has pre- 
vailed, that the inhabitants were once more numerous than 
they are now j but by a numeration which was made at the 
firft feating of the church in the year 1697, it appears that 
the number of inhabitants then mud have been under 1350. 
The baptifm roll, at an average for the laft 30 years, gives 
only 47 each year, which would denote a population confi- 
tlerably inferior to that which is here given 5 but many who

3 l8 Stati/lkal Account 

attend the church are carelefs about enrolling their children 
names ; and Seceders often do not enroll at all in the parifh 
regifter. 

No foreign trade is carried on, nor is any confiderable ma- 
nufatfure eftablifhed in the parifh ; the inhabitants (except- 
ing colliers) are moftly employed in agriculture, or in the oc- 
cupations connefted with it. Twenty-two are farmers, and 
140 farm fervants are employed by them. Nine are fmiths 
or journeymen, 8 carpenters, 20 weayers, 26 fhoemakers, 7 
taylors, 4 mafons, 4 millers, and 40 colliers. 

About a twelfth part of the whole number may be Sece- 
ders. 

The people, in general, are induftrious and fober. Few of 
them go into the army or navy. Very few crimes are com- 
mitted, and punifhments, accordingly, are but feldom re- 
quired. 

Rate of W ages.— Farm fervants generally receive 3 1. 8 s. 
in money, half a boll barley, half a boll peafe, 6 bolls and a 
half oat-meal, and a cow's pafture, which, altogether, may 
amount to 12 guineas, or 13 1. a year. The wife's labour in 
liarveft pays for the cottage which they inhabit ; and they 
pay kane (a few fowls) for their garden. Women fervants, 
living in the houfe, have from 50 s. to 70 s. a year ; men fer- 
vants, in the fame fituation, have from 5 1. to 7 1. Day-la- 
bourers earn 10 d. a day in winter, and 1 s. or j 4 d. in fum- 
mer. Carpenters earn is. 2d. in winter, and is. 6d. in 
fummer ; mafons, 1 s. 8 d. and is. 1 o d. 

The wages of the colliers depend upon the work which 
they perform ; when the feam of coal is about a yard in 
thicknefs, one aftive collier will employ two bearers, and, 
with their help, will earn a guinea or 25 s. a week. At prc- 
fent, when the ftratum of coal is only two feet thick, evert 



an

w induftrious collier can employ but one bearer ; with her 
help, he throws out from 80 to 90 loads of coals in the week, 
esch'load weighs 200 lb. and for this he is paid 2d. 
* In general, over the whole country, (a ftrong and a pleaf- 
ina proof of its improvement), the wages of labour are in a 
itate of rapid progreffion ; in time of health, they are equal 
to all the neceflary expences of the fober labourer, and even 
enable him to rear a numerous family. 

' Poor and Poor's Funds.— But ficknefs and other misfor- 
tunes are unavoidable, and will often reduce the moft induf- 
trious families to unexpected diftrefs j in fuch cafes the aid 
of public charity is required. This parifh admits no vagrant 
poor to receive parochial aid, farther than is neceflary for 
tranfporting them, when lame, beyond the bounds of the pa- 
rifh, therefore no common beggars refide within its bounds. 
The fettled poor are maintained in their own houfes, or are 
boarded with any relation who is willing to receive them. 
To prevent improper claims, the kirk-feffion require an aflig- 
nation of their effects, from all who become regular penfion. 
ers. There are at pre fent 21 of this defcription upon the 
poor's lift, who receive, at an average, about 40 s. a year 
each. This, with charity to occafional penfioners, and fef- 
fion clerk's falary, make the whole annual expenditure a- 
mount to about - - - L. 55 o o

and the deficiency is made up by an aflefsment laid equally 
upon the heritors and tenants. 

Befides the public parochial fund, the poor of this diftrift 
derive confiderable advantage from private friendly focieties, 
inftituted by themfelves. Into the funds of thefe, they pay 
a fmall proportion of their weekly earnings, and receive a 
comfortable allowance in cafe of ficknefs or diftrefs. This 
is the moft effectual method yet devifed, for preferving the 
induftry, and at the fame time relieving the wants, of the 
labouring poor; 

Church and Schools —The church was built in the year 
1695 5 'he manfe was eretted 30 years later ; both were late- 
ly repaired, and are now in very good condition. The pa- 
ri fh having been principally formed by annexations from the 
parifhes of Tranent and Haddington, the King and Earl of 
Hopeton, who are patrons of thefe two churches, are alter- 
nately patrons of Gladfmuir. The glebe contains between 
5 and 6 acres of indifferent land. The ftipend confifts of 
34 bolls wheat, 35 bolls barley, 31^ bolls oats, and 18 1. of 
money. 

There is a parochial fchool at the church, which is attend- 
ed by about 60 boys and girls. The mafter has a pretty 
good houfe and garden, and 81. 6 s. 8 d. a year as fchool. 
mafter, which, with 40 s. as feffion clerk, and perquifites on 
regiftering births and marriages, together with fees of teach- 
ing, make an income of 24 1. or 25 1. a year. There are, 
befides, two lefier fchools on the north and fouth extremities 
of the parifti. The mafters are allowed 1 1. 2 s. 2d. by the 
heritors, and teach about 30 children each. 

Eminent Men — This parifti gave birth to George Heriot, 
founder of the hofpital in Edinburgh, which ftill bears his 

name, 



of Gladfmuir, 



flame. His anceftors were proprietors of the fmall village 
of Trabrowne, and their names appear fometimes on the roll 
of the Scotch Parliament. What is ftill more to the ho- 
nour of the parifh, it was the firft fettlement of Dr Robert- 
son, the hiftorian of Scotland ; and his Hiftory of Scotland 
was compofed here. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—Qn the 2lft of July 1789, a 
thunder ftorm began in, the north, and came gradually nearer, 
having circled round by the weft. The fchool, where above 
70. children were then affembled, unfortunately flood in its 
way. The thunder burft upon the houfe, and feemed at firft 
to have levelled it with the ground. The walls were rent, 
the windows Shattered, and the roof demolifhed. A thick: 
darknefs, caufed by the fmoke and duft, for a while conceal- 
ed the extent of the mrfchief ; when it fubfided, the neigh- 
bours, who firft entered, anxious for the fate of their chil- 
dren, had reafon to fear the worft ; for few figns of life ap- 
peared, the whole crowd of little ones, either ftunned or ter- 
rified, lay ftretched ufon the ground, beneath the tables or 
benches where they fat. Many were quite fenfelefs, but af- 
terwards recovered. Two boys were killed outright, and the 
mafter, with many others, much injured. The effect of fuch 
a fcene is not foon worn off from the minds of children ; a 
black cloud ftill terrifies the whole fchool, and a clap of 
thunder, more than ordinarily loud, fcatters the whole little 
troop in an inftant. 

The pref'ent incumbent was not then minifter of Gladf- 
muir, but he has fince been at pains to obtain information as 
to all the particulars of lb uncommon an event. The fol- 
lowing, amongft others, is Angular : Two boys, who were in 
a feparate apartment in the weft end of th,e fchool, (the 
Vol. VII. Sf thunder 



3 2 2 Statiflical Account 

thunder came from the weft) declared that they f aw a ball ctf 
hre, which hovered for a few inftants over their heads. 

There was a Iky light in this part of the houfe ; but it was 
through the tiles, or rather within the roof, as the boys ima- 
gined, that the glare of this meteor was feen. They had no 
apprehenfion of danger; and were fl 111 gazing at it, when it 
burn- with the fatal explofion. 

Accidents like this, however, but rarely occur, and, upon 
the whole, the inhabitants of this diftridt are very well fatis- 
fied with their lot, nor have they any partial or local incon- 
venience to complain of. One great improvement, indeed, 
might be made in the fituation of all the lower clafs of inha- 
bitants, in this corner of the kingdom, by fuch an alteration 
in t,he excife laws, as would enable and induce them to drink 
good ale, for their common beverage, in place of whilky and 
other Ipirituous liquors. Such a change would be favourable 
to the health, the morals, and the induftry of the people.

of Culdees ; and, in the reign of King David, was erected in- 
to a bifhop's fee *. It is uncertain at what time, or by whom 
the cathedral was built. The chartulary, and other records 
of the bifhopric of Dunblane, are not to be found. The 
diocefe confilied of part of Perth and Stirling fhires. The 
rental of the bifhopric, at the Reformation, was nearly as

In 1673, he mortified the fum of 1024 Scotch money, to

the library the fum of 360 merks Scots, and his own collec- 
tion of books.— The Reverend Mr James fnglis, Epifcopar 
minifter at Muthill, left his books to the library.— Mrs Im- 
bry, fifter and executrix to the Reverend Mr William Sim- 
fon miniffer at Dunblane, left 300 merks Scotch to the ft-

Scotland gave 20 1. Sterling to the library, out of the vacant 
impend of Dunblane— Confiderable additions have, from time 
to time, been made to the library, out of the intereft of the 
mortified money, befides paying the librarian's falary, and re- 
pairing the houfe — The library is under the direction of the 
following truftees, nominated by Mrs Saphira Lightmaker, 
and Mr Edward Lightmaker, executors of the Bifhop, in 
their deed of mortification, viz. The Right Honourable the 
Vifcount of Strathallan, Sir Hugh Paterfon of Bannockburn, 
Sir James Campbell of Aberuchil, John Graham commiflary-

the preibytery of Dunblane, chofen by the fynod of Perth 
and Stirling. 

Mr Lightmaker fent a very rich marble ftone, of oval 
figure, well cut, having on it Bilhdp Leighton's arms, with 
this inferiptiori, Bibliotheca Leightoniana, and a gilded mitre 
on the top of it, which is fet upon the front of the houfe 
towards the ftreet, as Lord Strathallan had advifed. The 
infeription and carving are now very much defaced. 

Situation and Surface. — This parilh, which is about 9 miles- 
long, and 6 broad, is fituated within the weftern diftri&amp;of the 
county of Perth. It is the feat of a prefbytery, which bears 
its name, and fubjecT: to the fuperior jurifdiction of the fynod 
of Perth and Stirling. The foil is various. A great part of 
the pari/h confifts of arable land. But the greateft part of 
it is moorland, covered with heath and fwampy. The 
grounds, in general, have a gradual declivity from the fur- 
rounding hills to the river Allan, which runs through the 
parilh, giving the name of Strathallan to a confiderable track 
of land along the river, Thefe hills are partly green ; but, 
for the moll part, covered with heath. There are a confi- 
derable number of fheep, and fome black cattle, grazed up- 
on them ; but very few of either, in proportion to the extent 
of furface. There is a great deal of moor game here; and 
the low grounds produce plenty of hares and partridges* 
which afford excellent courfing and (hooting. 

Climate, Difeafes, csV.—The climate is in general healthy. 
The rheumatifm is a very frequent diforder among the lower 
ranks, and a great number die of confumptions. Several* 
have furvived 90, during the incumbency of the prefent mi. 
irifter ; and many now living are above 80. The ravages

made by the fmall-pox have fometimes been very great, oc- 
cafioned by the averfion of the common people to inoculation. 

Births, Deaths, and Marriages.— There is no exaft regifter 
of the births and deaths in this parifh. This is partly owing 
to the negligence of fome, and to the uhwillingnefs of other?, 
to pay the tax and trifling dues on births, to which the fef. 
fion-clerk is legally entitled, for his trouble in filling up the 
regifter. According to the mod probable account, the buri- 
als in the parifh church amount annually to about 30. But 
fome families bury in the chapel ground at Kilbryde, and 
Others in the chapel ground at Ardoch ; fo that no certain 
conclufion can be formed from this article. The number of 
births is fuppofed to exceed 70 per annum. The number of 
marriages, at an average, for 6 years paft, amounts to 23 ; 
but there are fome irregular marriages in this parifh and 
neighbourhood. 

Rivers.— The river Allan, which runs through this parifh, 
takes its rife at Gleneagles, in the parifh of Blackford, about 
the diftance of 1 1 miles from Dunblane. It abounds with 
burn trouts, and in fome places with pike. Some falmon, 
gilfes, and fea trout, are got in fummer floods. Its courfe is 
rapid for feveral miles. Afterwards it flows in beautiful 
curves through wide and fertile haughs. And, in the laft 
part of its courfe, it is rapid, its banks fteep, and moftly co- 
vered with wood, and falls into the Forth, after it leaves this 
parifh, a little above Stirling Bridge— The river Ardoch, 
which takes its rife at Lochmahaick, in the parifh of Kilma- 
dock, likewi'fe runs through the weft part of this parifh. It 
abounds with burn trout. 



'Rent.— -The valued rent of the parifh is 757S 1. 6 s. 8 d. 

Scotch. 



ef Dunblane.

Scotch. The real rent cannot be eafily afcertained. The 
rent of the land varies. The farms are, in general, fmall \ 
two thirds of them kept in grafs, and the other third under 
tillage. Some farms let from 5 s. to 15 s. per acre. Land 
in the immediate neighbourhood of Dunblane lets from 1 1. 
5 s. to 2 1. 2 s. per acre. 

Proprietors, &amp;c. — There are 1 1 greater, and feveral fmallcr 
proprietors. Four of the former refide in the parifh, viz. Sir 
James Campbell, Baronet, of Aberuchil, William Stirling, 
Efquire, of Keir, John Stirling, Efquire, of Kippendavie, and 
Alexander Jaffray, Efquire, of Gleffingall. There is a com- 
miflary, and fheriff-fubftitute, a furgeon, and four writers or 
attorneys. 

Antiquities. — The Cathedral, and the ruins of the Bifhop's 
Palace, are the only antiquities in this parifh. The Cathe- 
dral has been elegant and regular ; but great part of it is in 
ruins. The length of it is 216 feet, breadth 56 feet, and the 
height of the wall to the battlements 50 feet. The fteeple 
appears to be a more modern building, in height 128 feet. 
In it are two fine toned bells. The quire, which is ufed as 
the place of public worfhip, is almoft entire. Several of the 
prebends ftalls remain in good order, as likewife the original 
roof and cieling. 

Church and Poor. — There are three clergymen in the town 
of Dunblane 5 the minifter of the eftablifhed Church, of the 
Burgher, and of the Antiburgher Seceders. The King is 
patron of the parifh. 'The living confifts of 32 bolls of meal, 
and 16 bolls of bear; 61 1. 13s. 4d. in money, including 
3 1. 6 s. 8 d. for communion elements ; a manfe, and a glebe 
of 41 Englifh acres. The minifter's ftipend was originally 
the Dean's living ; and, befides what is paid from the teinds 

of

of the parifh, confifts of feu-duties paid from Deanflcier, \» 
the parifh of Muthil ; from Dean's Lundie, and Deanftown, 
in the parifh of Kilmadock ; from Gogar, in the parifh of 
Logie ; from Craigarnhall, in the parifli of Lecropt ; and of 
tdnd-duty from Logie Almond, in the parifh of Monzie. 

The number of poor upon the roll of this parifh is 34. 
Some years it has been above 40. They are maintained by 
afiefiments. Thefe commenced in 1775. The number of 
poor then upon the roll was i 9 ; and the aflefiment 7 s. 6 d. 
was on the 100 1. Scotch of valued rent- The afferent has 
gradually rifen to 20 s. on the 100I. Scotch. Laft afTeflment 
was fixed at t S s. The deficiency is made up from the intereft 
of money mortified for behoof of the poor. Occafional cha- 
rities, given by the kirk-feflion to poor houfeholders not on 
the roll, amount to about 5 1. per annum. Thefe are given 
put of the colleaions at the church-doors, dues of mort- 
cloths, &amp;c. 

Crops — The principal crops are oats and barley. A con- 
fiderable quantity of flax and potatoes, alfo of clover and rye. 
grafs, are fown in this parifh. More grain of every kind 
(except wheat, which is fown only in fmall quantities) than 
what is neceflary for the maintenance of its inhabitants, is 
raifed in this diftricl. 



Roads and Bridges. — The roads were originally made by 
the ftatute labour; but it is hardly fufficient to keep them in 
repair. The great military road to the north pafles through 
nearly the length of this parifli ; and, being one of the great- 
eft thoroughfares in Scotland, would require more than the. 
ftatute labour to keep it in fufficient repair. Many of the 
landed gentlemen are of opinion, that it fhould be made a 
turnpike j but this has been prevented by a different opinion 

prevailing 



of Dunblane.

prevailing in the diftrift to the north of this parifh. — The 
bridges on the Allan are good. There are no lefs than 6 
upon it, 4 of which are within the parifh. The Bridge of 
Dunblane, and the other bridges upon the public road, are 
kept in repair by the ftatute labour and convirfion money. 

Fuel. — The greateft part of the inhabitants ufe coals, 
brought from pits in the neighbourhood of Alloa, at the 
diftance of 10 or 12 miles. Many of the farmers ftill ufe 
peats dug in the moors. But the great length of rime fpent in 
working them, and the moderate price of coals, have induced 
the greateft number to ufe this laft as moll comfortable, and, 
upon the whole, the cheapeft. 

Manure. — There are feveral pits of excellent fhell marl in 
the parifh ; and plenty of lime, by water carriage on the 
Forth, is to be got at the diftance of a few miles ; and it is 
much ufed in improving the grounds. 

W sods. — In this parifh there is plenty of coppice woqd and 
other kinds, fuch as oak, elm, beech, plane, &amp;c. befides 
many plantations of firs. 

Plane at K'ippenrofs —This plane is fuppofed to be one of 
the largeft trees in Scotland. Its dimeniions are :

33° Staiiftical Account 

Population.— ¥y a late furvey, it is found that there are in' 
this parifh 2750 fouls; and it is fuppofed that the popula- 
tion has not increafed much for 40 years ; but no exadt ac- 
counts of it have been kept. The return to Dr Webfter in 
1755 was 2 7 28 f° uls - 

Schools. — In the town of Dunblane there are, befides the 
parochial fchool, three others, to which the generality of the 
people fend their children to be initiated in the principles of 
the Englilh language, previous to their being fent to the 
principal fchool. Owing to the extent of the parifh, there 
are three other fchools in different quarters of it, for the 
accommodation of thofe who cannot come into the town. 
The number of fcholars at the parifh fchool is, at an ave- 
rage, about 60. The fchoolmafter's falary is 12 1. Sterling 
in money, and 7 ftones of cheefe, a houfe, and garden, in 
value about 6 1. Sterling. He is likewife fellion-clerk. The 
perquifites of which office are, including the falary, about 
jo 1. Sterling. 

Alehoufesy Inns, vSV. — There are no lefs than 41 hcufes 
where ale and fpirits are retailed, 29 in the town of Dun- 
blane, and 1 2 in other parts of the parifh. Thefe are the 
caufes of mifery and poverty prevailing among many of the 
lower rank, who, laying afide their induftry, become diffi- 
pated and abandoned, and at laff, through difeafe, age, and 
infirmity, become, with their families, a burden upon the 
parifh. In this manner the number of poor has increafed 
much of late years. The greateft number of thofe upon the 
roll are virtuous labouring people, who are aged and infirm ; 
but there are among them feveral of the above defcription.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1017537">INVERURY</name>. 

{County of Aberdeen — Prejbytery of Gariocb. — Synod of 

Aberdeen.") 

By the Reverend Mr William Davidson.</head> 



<p>Name. 

TNVERURY, fo called from its fituation at the confluence 
-jL of the rivers Don and Ury, lies in the county of Aber- 
deen, and that diftricl: thereof called the Gariocli, 14 miles 
north- weft from Aberdeen. 

Soil. — The parifli of Inverury contains about 4000 acres, 
but fcarce 2000 are arable. — The land near the rivers is gene- 
rally a light rich mould, on a bed of fand, and produces ex- 
cellent crops, efpecially in fhowry fummers, and earlier than 
moft of the neighbourhood. From the rivers it rifes gra- 
dually to the Ikirts of the mountain of Benochee, which lies 
within a mile of the north- weft boundary of the parifh ; and 
the foil is not fo fertile on the higher, as on the lower ground, 
by the rivers. 

The Borough. — The town of Inverury, where the parifli 
church ftands, is a royal borough. Tradition fays, that it 
obtained this privilege from King Robert Bruce, on occafion 
of a fignal viclcry obtained by him there, over Comyn Earl 

of 



3 3 2 Stati/lical Account 

of Buchan,. the- king of England's general in Scotland, which 
proved the beginning of that good fortune that attended 
him ever after during the whole of his reign. The oldcft char- 
ter is a novodamus by Queen Mary, narrating, that « Inverury 
had been a royal borough time immemorial, but the charter of 
its erection loft in the time of the civil wars." It is govern- 
ed by a provoft, three baillies, a dean of guild, a treafurer, 
and three counsellors. It does not appear to have ever been 
a place cpnfiderable for trade or manufactures. A great part 
of the townfmen are mechanics, fuch as weavers, fhoema- 
kers, taylors, cart and fquare Wrights, and blackfmiths ; and 
they are all employed in working for the inhabitants of the 
town and neighbourhood ; none in manufacturing articles for 
market. At the fame time, they cultivate their Small pieces 
of property, of from one to fix acres of land. There are a- 
bout 6o of thefe fmall proprietors of land within the borough, 
called port wrier s ; and the Earl of Kintore is proprietor of a- 
bout one half of the land. When let to tenants, it pays 
from io s. to 40 s. Sterling the acre, according to its qua- 
lity. The women are generally employed in knitting {lock- 
ings for the Aberdeen manufacturers, and earn from 18 d. to 



2 s. a week. 



Bridges. — The Situation of Inverury, between two fuch 
confiderable rivers, and Sometimes in land .floods inacceffible 
even with boats, on all fides but one, has been a great obsta- 
cle to its improvement. This obstacle is now, however, in a 
great meaSure, happily removed. Ey the public Spirited ex- 
ertions of the Earl of Kintore, and Doctor Thorn the prefent 
provoft, Subscriptions have been promoted for a bridge upon 
jDon ; and an elegant and Stately one was built laft year, at 
the (outh end of the town, which coft 2000 1. Sterling. The 
accommodation, however, is not complete, without a bridge 

upon 



of Inverury, 



333 



upon Ury too. This will not coft near fo much as the o- 
ther ; and it is hoped fome aid will be obtained from govern- 
ment, as the King's high-way, from Aberdeen to Elgin, Fort 
George, and Invernefs, paffes through Inverury and there is 
a faring of 14 miles by travelling that road, rather than the 
lower one by Old Meldrum and Turreff. 

Heritors In the country part of the parifh there are 7 

heritors ; none of whom refide in it but one, viz. Mr John- 
fton of Woodhill, who occupies a well improved farm on the 
banks of the Don. He has planted 50 or 60 acres of the 
higher ground with various kinds of foreft trees, principally 
Scotch firs, and they are in a very thriving condition. 

The names of the old farm towns appear to be Gaelic, 
though this language has not been fpoken in that part of the 
country for many centuries. 

Agriculture. — The farms are of various fizes, from 4 1. to 
40 \. of yearly rent. The mode of cultivation is confider- 
ably improved of late, but much yet remains to be done in 
that way. Oats and barley are the principal crops. The a- 
verage of the returns may be reckoned 4 of the former, and 
r of the latter. 

The farmers have only of late begun to bring lime from 
Aberdeen, in any confiderable quantities, to lay on their land. 
Every one now fows turnips, and plants potatoes in the field, 
and the ground next year is fown with barley and grafs feeds, 
for hay or pafture. 

Kent. — The valued rent of the parifh is 1634 1. Scotch, 
exclufive of the borough, which has no valuation in the col- 
lector of the counties books. The real rent of the whole 
parifh is about 700 1. Sterling.

They are all members of the eftablifhed Church, except S

Mifcellaneous Obfervations There are in the whole parifl, 
about.600 black cattle, 130 horfo, and 1000 fheep, mo% 
of a fmall fize. The people are generally fober and induf- 
trious, and appear contented with their condition. A very 
remarkable alteration to the better has taken place within the 
laft 20 years among them, in their drefs, diet, and Jodping 
but efpecially in the firft of thefe articles. 

The greattft inconveniency they labour under, is fcarcity of 
fuel. There are neither peat nor turf in the parifh. They 
are obliged to fetch their fuel from other parifhes, at a con- 
fiderable diftance } and this takes up their time for great part 
of the fummer, when they ought to be more profitably em- 
ployed. Coal are brought from Aberdeen by the people of 
the town. A boll (36 ftone Amfterdam weight) cofts 4 s. 
6 d. at the flup, and 2 s. 6 d. for carriage to Inverury. An- 
other inconvenience, moft fenfibly felt of late by the farmers, 
is a fcarcity of fervants. Both men and women fervants are 

repair- 



of Iiivefury* 335 

repairing to Aberdeen, where they readily find employment 
in the extenfive manufactures lately eftablifhed there, and get 
high wages. The confequence is, that fervants wages in the 
country are at.leaft double of what they were a few years 
ago, and it is very difficult to get them at any rate.— There 
is an ancient Druidical temple in the parifh, but nothing very 
remarkable about it. At the fouth end of the town of In- 
verury, and near the confluence of the rivers, there (lands a 
curious artificial mount of fand, covered with a fine green 
fward. It is called the Bafs. It is a truncated cone, very 
regular, and 40 feet of perpendicular height. Adjoining to it, 
on the eaft fide, is another about 20 feet high, but not lb re- 
gularly fhapen. The vulgar tradition, about this mount, is a 
very fenfelefs one. Probably it was a moot-hill, or place 
where courts were held for adminiftering juftice. A noted 
antiquarian, fome years ago, when on the fpot, pronounced it 
to have been fuch, and pointed out the places where the 
judges and the parties ftood. 

Churchy School, and Poor.— The church of Inverury was 
built in the year 1774, and the manfe in 1762. The fti- 
pend is 37 1. 10 s. Sterling, and 64 bolls of meal and bear, 
with a glebe of 4 acres. The Earl of Kintore is patron of 
the parifh. 

The fchool matter's falary is 100 1. Scotch, and the number 
of fcholars about 40 in winter, and 30 in fummer. 

There are no parochial funds for maintenance of the poor. 
About 14 1. Sterling, collected in the church annually, are 
diftributed by the church-fefiion among 12 or 14 poor peo- 
ple,

<p>Situation. 

rTIHIS parifh is compofed of foar Wands, Roufay, Egli-s 
(hay, Weir, and Inhallow, and two fmail holms or 
uninhabited iflands. They are fituated about three leagues 
north-weft of the county town, Kirkwall, and lie contiguous 
to each other. 

Roufay, — The largeft ifland of the parifh, is altogether one 
range of hills j and the arable ground is feparated from the 
hill ground by a poor irregular earthen dyke. The hili 
ground is covered with heath, and contains deep mofs. It is 
a pleafant ifland, and healthful, and abounds with moor 
game. In it are abundance of fprings of the pureft water, 
and of rivulets which iflue from fmall lakes, of which there 
are numbers in the ifland. All around the ifland is fafe har. 
bour for flapping of any burden. The foil is good ; and 
might produce plentiful returns, were it Well cultivated. 
There is a fmall church, about five miles diftant from the 
manfe, dedicated to our Lady. The number of inhabitants 

is, 



of Roufay and Eglifoay. 337 

is, in this ifland of Roufay, 772, the youngeft child being 
included. 

Egliftay. — Eglifhay is a pleafant, low lying ifland, with a 
fmall Gothic church in the weft part of the ifland, which 
has been dedicated to St Magnus, the tutelar faint of all 
Orkney. It has a pyramidical fteeple at the weft end, and 
a vaulted quire at the eaft end, which joins to the body of 
the church. In Egliihay there is a fmall lake of frefh water ; 
and the foil is very good, and fit for culture ; but it is poorly 
cultivated. There is a fmall bay of fhell fand, of the belt 
kind, on the weft fide of this ifland, and a large track of 
fand on the north fide, with much bent, and many rabbits. 
Sponge is caft on fhore in October, in great abundance, about 
this ifland. The number of inhabitants in this ifland of 
Eglifhay is 210, the youngeft child being included. 

W nr Ifland.— Weir Ifland is a fmall low lying ifland, not 
fo large as is Eglifhay; The foil is the fame, and the culture 
very poor, and the crops unequal to what might be expected 
from proper management. There is a ruinous church here, 
and a quire, but no fteeple ; and there is the veftiges of a for- 
tification on a rifing ground, a little from the place where 
the church ftands. There is mofs ground in a part of this 
ifland ; and many feals are to be feen on the rocks at the 
weft end of this ifland. The number of the inhabitants is 6 5i 
the youngeft child included. 

hihallonu #7W._Inhallow Ifland is very fmall, but very 
pleafantly fituated, being overlooked by the hills and head, 
lands of main land, on the fouth, and of Roufay, on the 
north. The foil is good, but not fkilfully managed. The 
number of inhabitants is 25, the youngeft child being in.

includes in it 1072 perfons. In 1755, the numbers were 
rated at 978. 

Manners. — There is no difference in manners and habits 
between the cottager and the mafter of the farm. The maf- 
ter often turns to cottager, and the cottager fometimes be- 
comes the mafter. They all take focial fnuff together. Their 
houfes and their furniture are exadlly the fame. They all, 
without diftin£lion, fit at the oar in their boats ; and at land 
they all jointly perform the fame labour and work. Youth 
and old age conftitute the only diftinction of rank. The old 
often are fo reduced, that they betake themfelves to going 
from houfe to houfe for fuftenance •, and then they are well 
received ; and it is not accounted beggary when they do fo.

boats, in Weir 6 boats, in Inhallow 2 boats, making in all 
44 boats, each being about the value of 3 1- Sterling. With 
thefe they ufed to go to fifli j but, for fome years paft, the

Cattle. They plow with horfes of a fmall fize, which are 

brought from Strathnavern when two years old, and lbme 
Shetland horfes. Three horfes, or, at the moft, four horfes 
are put into the plough. Thefe horfes are, of value, from 
3I. Sterling to 4I. never hardly above 5 1. Sterling. There 
are in the parifli upwards of 200 ploughs. There are a pro- 
digious number of black cattle, no lefs than 2500, almoft all 
cows, from which they make greafe butter. The value of 
the cows may be from 2 1. to 2 1. 10 s. hardly ever 3 1. Ster- 
ling — The fheep in this parifh have fine wool, and, for the 
molt part, two lambs at a birth. The fheep, when fold, coft 
4 s. a head, or thereabout. The number of fmall fwine is 
confiderable, as are the flocks of geefe. The fwine fell for 
3 s. or 4s. and the geefe at 1 s. There are no mice in the 
ifland of Inhallow, and no rats in any one of the other 
iflands of the parifli. — There is a great quantity of kelp made 
annually in this parifh from May to July. The people em- 
ploy themfelves at this work. There is a little woollen fluff 
made, and fome linen, but to no amount. Thefe they trade 
with to Shetland, and fell at the great annual market at 
Kirkwall.

By tie Reverend Mr George Gleig.</head> 



<p>Town, CSV. 

ABERBROTHOCK, or Arbroath, is a royal burgh, 
fituated on the difcharge of the fmall river of Bro- 
thock into the fea, from whence it has its name, Aber imply, 
ing fuch a fituation. In conjunaion with Aberdeen, Bervie, 
Montrofe, and Brechin, it fends a member to Parliament. 
The poft-road from Edinburgh to Aberdeen runs through it. 
It is diftant 1 7 miles from Dundee, and 1 2 from Montrofe. 
It is the general opinion, that it was erected into a royalty 
by King William the Lion about the year 1 1 86' ; but this 
cannot be properly afcertained, owing to the lofs of the ori- 
ginal charter, which was taken away by force out of the Ab- 
bey of Arbroath, where it was lodged in the time of the 
civil wars, during the minority of James VI. by George 
Bifhop of Moray, called Poftulat of Arbroath. It was, how- 
ever, confirmed in all the privileges of a royal burgh, which 
it had formerly enjoyed, by a novodamus granted by James VI. 
in the year 1599. The town is pleafantly fituated within an 
amphitheatre of a ridge of fmall hills, enjoying a fouth ex- 
, and having a fair and extenfive profpecl: of the Lo- 
thian 




of Arbroath. 341 

thian Kills, the eaft coaft of Fife, and the entries into the 
Frith of Forth, and the river Tay. The profpect towards 
the north is bounded by the Grampian Hills. Few places 
equal it in point of Situation. It is governed by a provoft, 
two bailies, and 16 counfellors. The dean of guild and 
deacon convener of the trades are members of council ex 
officio. Befides the town-clerk, there are 5 writers, who are 
notaries public, and 2 meffengers at arms. The revenue of 
the town amounts to about Bool, which arifes principally 
from rents of land, harbour dues, town's mills, and 2 pennies 
Scotch on each pint of ale fold within the royalty. There 
are 7 trades incorporated ; fraiths, glovers, taylors, weavers, 
Ihoemakers, wrights, and bakers. 

Trade.— Before the year 1736, Arbroath had little or no 
commerce, unlefs a little traffic in fifli, and a kind of contra, 
band or fmuggling trade deferve. the name. It had no ma- 
nufactures ; and any piece of cloth that was made was car- 
ried to Montrofe, and fold there. It imported nothing, ex. 
cept now and then a fmall cargo of wood from Norway. 
Flax, iron, and other commodities, were purchafed by the 
inhabitants from the merchants in Montrofe and Dundee. 
A few years fubfequent to that mentioned above, feveral 
gentlemen of property jointly undertook to eftablifh the 
manufacture of Oznaburghs, and other brown linens here, 
and to import their own materials. They laid out consider- 
able fums of money on different kinds of machinery, which 
were executed on a very complete and extenfive fcale. Suc- 
cefs attended their fpirited exertions ; and, at that time, the 
Arbroath fabrics procured a fuperiority, ' and commanded a 
fale, in preference to any other of the kind, which they fiill 
hold. From this eftablifhment, the rife and progrefs of the 
trade and manufactures of Arbroath are to be dated. The 

principal 



342 



Statiflical Account 



principal manufactures are fail-cloth, Oznaburghs, and other 
brown linens. From November 1790, to November i-;i, 
1,055,303 yards of the two la(l were manufactured in the 
town and ftamp-oflice diftricl, which extends about 6 or 8 
miles round the town, equal in value to 39,6601.6s. tod. 
There is likewife yearly manufactured in the town, fail-cloth 
to the fame amount •, and nearly 500 looms are employed. 
The greateft part of the linen and fail-cloth is lhipped for 
London. A fmall part is fent to Glafgow and Dundee. 
The principal imports are flax and hemp from Ruflia, and 
wood and iron from Norway and Sweden. Of the two firft, 
there were imported laft year from 700 to 800 tons ; and 
wood and iron to the value of 4000 1. A very confiderable 
trade is likewife carried on in lime and coals. Of the for- 
mer, there are unloaded at the harbour about 18,000 bolls of 
{hells 5 and from 6000 to 8000 tons of the latter yearly. 
This quantity will not feem fo great, when it is confidered 
that this town not only fupplies its own neighbourhood, but 
fends a great quantity of coals to Forfar, Brechin, and their 
neighbourhood. A repeal of the coal- tax would consider- 
ably affect the revenue of this town, and be a lols to indi- 
viduals, who deal folely in the coal-trade ; yet the people are 
not fo felfilh as to throw any obftacle in the way of a repeal, 
fo ardently defired by their northern neighbours, nor fo 
blind to their own intereft as to folicit its abolition. About 
18,000 bolls of barley are yearly fhipped here, and the trades 
import about 3000 bolls of oat-meal — There is a tan-yard, 
which employs 6 men ; and hides are yearly drefled, to the 
value of 2500 1. During the late war, and fome time prior 
to it, a great number of fhoes were exported ; bur, fmce the 
peace, that trade has almoft, if not entirely failed. A fhort 
time ago, a cotton manufactory was eftablifhed, which em- 
ploys 18 men, women, and children. Yarn is fpun to the 

value 



of Arbroath, 343 

value of 1000I. ; and 6 looms weave of calicoes to the 
' amount of 500 1. yearly. There is allb lately eftabliflied here 
a manufacture of particular kinds of brown linens, never at- 
tempted in* this part of the country. The number of looms 
employed is 1 8. The cloth is moftly ufed by coachmakers 
and upholfterers ; and the proprietor has a fhop in London 
for felling it. One of the kinds is remarkable for its thin- 
nefs, and more properly may be termed gauze than linen, of 
which a perfon will weave 40 yards a day, though it is yard 

wide. The common price of this lafl: is per yard. 

In the year 1740, a thread manufactory was eftabliflied, 
which was for many years carried on to a great extent, and 
turned out to good account. By it thoufands of people gain- 
ed a livelihood. For fome time part it has been greatly on 
the decline, owing to the high prices of flax, the great rife 
on fpinning, the high wages allowed to labourers in the Oz- 
naburgh and linen manufactories, and more efpecially to the 
want of a proportionable rife of price for the thread in the 
London market. From thefe caufes, the thread trade in this 
place may be faid to be turned thread bare. But, though it 
has failed, trade goes brifldy forward ; and, to fhow its in- 
creafe, the increafe of the imports and exports, it is only ne- 
ceflary to mention, that the harbour-dues were this year 
(1792) let at public roup for 293 I. exclufive of the guildry- 
dues, when 40 years ago they did not bring more than 70 1. 
guikhy dues included. 

Harbour.— -The harbour was originally at the end of the 
JEaft caufeway, and built in the year 1 194. There is yet ex- 
tant an agreement between the abbot of Arbroath and the 
inhabitants, concerning the building of it, by which both 
parties were bound to contribute their proportions ; but the 
largeft fhare fell to the abbot, for which he was to rsceive an

yearly tax, payable out of every rood of land lying within 
the burgh. The pier was built of wood, and but ill con- 
ftructed to defend the veiTels in ftormy weather, from the 
heavy furgcs which roll on {hore. In the year 1725, a brief 
was obtained for building a new one, which is fituated a little 
to the weft of the old. It is ftrongly built of ftone all round, 
fmall, but very commodious, and fo conftrufted that a velTel 
can lie to at any part of it, either to receive or difcharge her 
cargo. It is likewife perfectly fafe, being contracted at the 
entrance to the width of 3 1 feet, and defended by what is 
called the gates, which are 14 or 15 ftrong beams of wood, 
let down in a groove on each fide, and locked in on the top 
by iron bars. Thefe beams, which are eafily put in or taken 
out in 15 minutes, by means of a crane made for the purpofe, 
completely break the force of the fea, which runs into the 
harbour, fo that it is fida Jlatio carinis. It is always dry at low 
water ; but has a fluice on the north fide, by which the water 
of Brothock is admitted, when it is thought necefiary to clean 
it. At fpring tides there is, at its entrance, a depth of 15 or 
16 feet ; and at neep tides, of 9 or 10 feet water. 

In the year 1781, there belonged to this harbour no more 
than 1 7 or 18 veffels, making all together only about 900 
tons; now there are 32 veffels, making 1704 tons, which 
employ about 160 feamen. There are befides two vefTels on 
the flocks, together above 150 tons. 

To this harbour belong alfo 3 fifhing boats, befides the pi- 
lot boats, which employ 14 fifhermen ; but thefe depend 
upon a living more on what they make by pilotage, than on 
what they can earn in the filhing trade, which has moftly 
failed *.

the

fired a few fhot into the town ; after which falute, he fent a flag 
of truce on fhore, with the following letter :

years a,o, the magiflrates planted 110 acres of muir with 
Scotch firs, which are thriving very well, and in a fhort time

To this letter the magiflrates fent a verbal mefTage to Fall, 
that they would be glad to fee him on (hore, and hoilled a flag 
of defiance on the Ballall Hill. Finding his threats to be in 
rain, after firing fome few ineffectual fhot, he weighed anchor, 
and failed in purfuit of fome Hoops which came into the offing, 
which he captured, but did not return. 

To prevent all infults of this kind, from fo mean an enemy, 
for the future, a battery was propofed to be built. A fubferip- 
tion was opened for this purpofe, which was foon filled up. 
Government was applied to, and Captain Andrew Fraier was 
fent down to plan the work, which was quickly finished. The 
battery, mounting 6 1 2 pounders, is built fomewhat in the form 
of a half-moon, of ftone and lime, and faced with large banks 
of fods The platform is paved with ftone, and below it there 
are vaults bomb proof, for keeping powder and Ihot, with other 
neceffanes. It is built on the Ballall Hill, between the haibour 
and the fea, and has a compleat command of the Bay, fo that 
now no Fall, with his Fearnought, dare infult Arbroath with 
impunity.

Population, Iff the year 1755, the numbers were 

2098. In the year 1 776, the number of fouls in the panfh 
amounted to 3943 ; the total amount this year, (1792), in 
town and country, is 4676, of which there are, in the coun- 
try? r 3* and 4545 m towru But to gain a complete lift of 
the number of people in the town of Arbroath, we muff add 
the number of fouls in that part of it belonging to the parifh 
of St. Vigeans, which is 638, and then the number of fouls in 
the town is exactly 5183. 

In this parifh there are 517 females more than males. An 
exact regifter of births and deaths has not hitherto been 
kept : For the year 1791, it ftood as follows :

For fome years paft the town has increafcd confiderably. 
Laft year 30 houfes were built, many of them of confider- 
able value ; and this year there is much about the fame num- 
ber, though not of equal value. This increale is no doubt 
owing to our manufactures ; and from the afpect which they 
at prefent wear, there is every reafon to look for a rapid in- 
creafe of population^ and confequently of buildings. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — Arbroath, which formerly belonged to 
the parilh of St Vigeans, was erected into a parochial charge 
about the year 1560. Befides the eftablifhed church there 
are meetings both of Englifh and Scotch Epifcopalians, Anti- 
burgher Seceders, and Independents ; and in the fuburbs be- 
longing to St Vigeans parifh there is a meeting-houfe, the 
property of the Methodifts. The church is built in the 
fouth.weft corner of the Abbey ground, and the tower ferves 
for a bell ftceplc. It was repaired and enlarged about thirty

years ago, and fitted up in a very neat and commodious 
manner, capable to contain from 1800 to 2000 people. It 
is now rather fmall for the congregation, and it will be foon 
necefiary to have another, or a chapel of eafe. The right of 
patronage formerly belonged to the Earl of Panmure, but fell 
to the Crown by forfeiture in the year 1 715. The ftipend 
is 6 bolls of wheat, 22 bolls 2 firlots 3 pecks and 1 lippie of 
barley, 23 bolls 2 firlots and 2 pecks of meal, and 54 I. 8 s. 
Jod. including the rent for the church- yard grafs, 4I. 3 s. 
4 d. for communion elements, and 4 1. 8 s. 1 1 d. for houfe- 
rent. There is neither rnanfe nor glebe. — A forry ftipend 
for fo large a place. Arbroath is a lingle charge, but the 
minifter has an ordained afliftant who a£ls the part of a col- 
league. His ftipend arifes in part from the intereft of 565 1. 
mortified by a Convener Mill for that purpofe ; and lome 
gentlemen in the town have bound themfelves to make it at 
ieaft equal to 50 1. 

School. — There is only one eftabliflied fchool, which was 
built about 20 years ago. It is fpacious, and in every refpeft 
well fituated, fit to accommodate with eafe 120 fcholars. 
There is only one matter and an afliftant. The mafter's Hi- 
lary which is paid by the town is 10 1. and the emoluments 
arifing to him from being feflion-clerk and precentor in the 
church may amount to about 12I. The number of fcholars 
for 26 years paft has been between 70 and 80. The fchool- 
fees are 2 s. 6 d. for each fcholar per quarter, and have been 
the fame for more than 30 years ; of which the mafter re- 
ceives is. 6d. and the afliftant is. The afliftant has 9 1. 
2 s. 2 d. as falary, of which the town pays 5 1. and the reft is 
paid by the kirk-feflion. The branches of education taught 
are Englifti, writing, arithmetic, Euclid's elements, menfura- 
tion, geography, navigation, Latin, Greek, and French, but

the two laft are feldom required. There are like wife two or 
three private fchools, one of which is fupported by a num- 
ber of the principal inhabitants of the town, who give the 
matter 36 \. per annum for teaching 36 fcholars. 

Poor. — The funds for the fupport of the poor arife from 
rents of land, mort-cloths, feats in the church, marriages, 
legacies, and collections at the church-door. There are di- 
ftributed yearly among them, about Martinmas, between 70 and 
80 bolls of coals. The weekly penfioners receive among them 
16 s. per week; and about 16 1. or 1 7 1. are divided among the 
poor at the facrament ; befides, they receive occafionally as 
circumftances require. The diftribution, communibus annis, is 
about 130 1. The number of poor is about 120. There is 
alfo a fund for the fupport of feven poor widows of fhipma- 
fters left by John Carmichael fliipmafter, about 60 years ago, 
in money, houfes, and land. This charity is not confined to 
Arbroath, but extends to Montrofe and Dundee. Widows 
of the names of Carmichael, Pearfon, and Strachan, have a 
preferable claim, and after them, widows whofe hufbands 
have been of any of the preceding names. None can be ad- 
mitted upon this charity who do not live nine months in the 
year in Arbroath, or whofe yearly income amounts to a fum 
equal to that which they can receive from the fund An im- 
proper behaviour alfo excludes from the benefit of this cha- 
rity. 

This fund is under the direction of the magiftrates, mini- 
fter, kirk-treafurer, and boxmafter to the fraternity of fea- 
men in Arbroath ; and by the care and attention of the ma- 
nagers, it has increafed confiderably for fome years paft, fo^ 
that each of the widows inftead of 5 1. or 6 1. which they 
formerly received, now draw above 13 1. yearly. 



Climate,

Stalijlical Account 



Climate^ C5V.— -The air is dry and falubrious The people 

in general healthy. About 20 years ago, intermittent fevers 
were very prevalent, particularly during the fpring months ; 
but fince the lands in the neighbourhood, in confequence of 
a keen fpirit for agriculture, have been drained of their exu- 
berant latent moifture, the difeafe has totally difappeared. 
Continued fevers, which ufed rarely to occur, have been more 
frequent within thefe laft two years ; they are of a type be- 
tween the nervous and inflammatory, and feldom prove fatal. 
They probably owe their exiftence to our winters havinc 
been uncommonly open and moift. Comparatively fpealcing, 
Arbroath is a remarkably healthy place, and the people live 
to a good old age. There are many of 70 and 80, and a few 
considerably above 90 years. I know five per (bus whole ages 
added together make 476 ; one of thefe is an old woman \- 
ged 97, yet flrong and healthy, who never drank a dram. 
Another of them is an old man aged 96, whofe wife, not in- 
cluded in the above number, is 85. — She is the man's third 
wife, and he is her third hufband. Prejudices againft ino- 
culation for the fmall pox are almoft entirely eradicated. 

Mineral Spring. — About a quarter of a mile to the weft- 
ward of the town, in a high ground called the Common, 
there is one of the ftrongeft Spaws, or Chalybeate fprings, in 
Scotland. It is much frequented by people affcJted with 
fcrophula, nervous, and ftomachic diforders, and other dil'ea- 
ies arifing from relaxation of the habit ; and in numberlefs 
cafes, the medical practitioners are ob.iged to acknowledge 
the fuperior effect of the water, as a corroborant to any re- 
medy they can prefcribe. Probably this fpring would be 
more frequented, if there were fome attention paid to the 
well, and proper accommodations for the reception of its vs. 
fitors. An inducement to the invalid to repair to this place, 

is

is the opportunity of Tea- bathing, which is the pureft exer- 
cife of health, and perhaps does no lefs good, than the in- 
credibly large gulps of water, which many in faith of its 
healing powers, force themfelves to fwallow. 

Price of Lalour and Provifions. — A common labourer re. 
ceives hum 1 s. to is. 2 d. per day. The wages of a jour- 
nevman frnith are from 5 1. to 7 1. a-year, with his victuals. 
A fhoemaker will earn from 6 s. to 8 s. — a houfe. carpenter 
about 8 s. — a mafon 10 s. — a flater 12 s. — and a weaver from 
7 s. to 1 os. per week. A gardener has is. 3d. per day. 
The wa^cs of a baker are much the fame with the fmiths ; 
and a taylor receives from 6 d. to 8 d. per day, with his vic- 
tuals. The common wages of a fervant-maid is 3 1. ; fome 
receive 3 !. 10 s. and fome 4I. per annum. 

I3eif, mutton, lamb, veal, and pork, are fold at from 3 1 d. 
to 5 d. per lib. — Butter from 8 d. to 1 1 d. fer lib. which is 
24 ounces. — Chetfe, 5 s. per ftone. — Eggs from 3^ to 4 d. 
per dozen. — Fowls from is. 8 d. to 2 s. per pair. — Oat-me2l 
{'old this year for 15 s. 6 d. — Wheat for 1 L 1 s. — and barley 
from 17 s. to 18 s. per boll. 

Mijeellaneous Obfcrvations. — The town is well fupplied with 
butcher meat ; and nearly 500 head of black cattle, and 350 
calves, befides fheep, lambs, and fwine, are flaughtered at the 
fhambles. Formerly, fifh were plenty, now they are fcarce, 
and confeqacntly very dear. The coaft being rocky, we 
have plenty of crabs and lobfters, which find a ready mar- 
ket ; but the greatelt part of the latter is fent to London j

THE parifh of St Quivox contains about 3500 acres of 
land, all of which is arable, except fome part of the 
banks of the river of Ayr, which are fteep, and covered with, 
natural wood or plantations. The foil is various i neareft 
to the fea it is fandy — a fmall part of it is a light gravelly 
foil, with a dry bottom : Towards the eaft it is more clayey ; 
and in general has a hard bottom of till or rotten rock, 
which makes the uneven furface ftratum, fpringy, and wet. 
There are about 1 00 acres of meadow land ; a part of which 
is much injured by the overflowing of a fmall rivulet, that is 
flopped in its courfc by a mill-dam. There are likewife a- 
bout 100 acres of wood and plantations. The whole parifli 
has been inclofed with hedge and ditch within the laft 30 or 
40 years, and in general the hedges are in a thriving con- 
dition. 

Population — In 1755, the population was 499. In the 
country part of the parifh there are at prefent 96 families, 
which contain 490 fouls of all ages. There are two excel-

lent modern built manfion-houfes, pleafantly fxtuated on the 
banks of the river ; the one belonging to Mr Ofwald of Au- 
chencruive, and the other to Mr Campbell of Craigie, who 
refide in them occaaonally. Two-thirds of the parifh are 
the property of Mr Ofwald, and the other third is divided 
among 7 different heritors. Three of thefc farm their own 
property. Thirty families live by farming ; 4 blackfmiths, 
4 mafons, 5 colliers, 4 houfe-carpenters, j weavers; the 
remaining 43 are labourers, or poor, or employed in differ- 
ent ways about the collieries.

Rent and Produce.— The lands are fet from 12 s. to 40 s. 
an acre, and even fome fo high as 3 1. ; but the average of 
the whole parifh is about 20 s. an acre. There are in the pa- 
rifh about 132 horfes, - value L. 1475

None of the farmers keep a regular flock of fheep on account 
of their hedges. A few are bought in occafiotially to be fat- 
tened for the butcher, and a few of Englifh breed are kept 
as pets.— Thefe together may be valued at 50 1. The annual 
produce of a milch cow, befides her calf, is from 3 1. to 4 1. 
the average 3 1. 10 s.— Butter, 9 d. per lib. of 24 ounces ; and 
cheefe, from 2^ d. to 6 d. the fame weight. 



Agriculture — As to agriculture, the general practice is to 
plough the land for 3 years, and lay it out into grafs for 6 ; 
after which, it is again plowed for 3 years, and fo on during 
the tack. Lands are commonly let for 19 years; and the 
above courfe of management is fpecified in the tacks ; how- 
ever, a better rotation of crops is fometimes followed, ift, 
Potatoes with dung, or (though feldom) turnips. 2d, Bar- 
ley with red clover, 10 or 12 lib. to the acre. 3d, Red clo- 
ver. 4 th, Oats. Then, 5th, Potatoes with dung, and fo 
on as before. This is round to be a good plan on dry land. 
But the flaple articles with the farmers here are oats and 
bear. Small patches only are fown with wheat, peafe, beans, 
and barley. Lime is univerfally ufcd as a manure; it is laid 
upon the grafs a year or two before the field is to be plowed ; 
the quantity about 100 bolls per acre ; that is, 200 Winchef- 
tcr bufhels of unflacked lime, which commonly yield 400 
bulhels of flacked lime. Sometimes it is laid upon a fallow, 

but

but feldom. Lime cofts 5 d. per boll, and the carriage 4d. ; 
the kilns being 6 or 7 miles diftant. Hence, at the rate of 
loo bolls per acre, it cofts the farmers 3 1. 15 s. They fow, 
for two fucceffive years, 6 or 7 Winchefter bufliels of oats 
per acre, in the month of April, and reap from 4 to 10 bolls, 
in the month of September or October. The third year, 
the whole dung of the farm is applied as far as it will go, for 
bear, of which they fow 4 bufliels per acre, and reap from 4 
to 7 bolls. Along with the bear, they fow 3 bufliels of 
rye grals feed, 8 lib. of red clover, and 5 or 6 lib. of white 
clover. The crop of hay is fometimes 200 ftone, 24 lib. to 
the {lone, each acre ; but more frequently does not exceed 
100 ftone. It is ufually cut for 2 years; then paftured for 4; 
after which it is plowed for oats, 

Wages. — Men fervants receive from 61. to 81. a year of 
wages. Women fervants from 3 1. to 4 1. a year ; but they 
are commonly hired for half a year only. A labourer re- 
ceives a fliilling a day; for mowing hay, i8d. ; a mafon, 
20 d.— The farmers plough with 4, or 3 horfes with a dri- 
ver, or with 2 horfes without a driver, as they think the 
nature of their foil requires ; but moft generally with 3 horfes 
and a driver. The plough moft in ufe is the Scotch plough, 
with a curved mould-board. — The price of all forts of pro- 
vifions is fixed by the markets at Ayr. 

Wallacetoiun. — About 30 years ago, the late Sir Thomas 
"Wallace of Craigie began to feu houfes and gardens from the 
north end of the old bridge at Ayr. At that time, there 
were not above 8 or 10 ftraggling houfes about the Bridge- 
end ; and now, in 1 792, by a gradual increafe, there are 250 
.families living in Wallacetown, fo named after its founder. 



of St £uivox.

This increafe of inhabitants has been owing, ift, to, the ex- 
tcnlive collieries which have been wrought on the Blackhoufe 
eftate in this parifh, and on the lands belonging to the com- 
munity of Newton adjoining to it. 2d, Many farmers ad- 
vanced in life, or unwilling to take their farms at a high ad- 
ditional rent, find houfes in Wallacetown, to which they car- 
ried their capital, and became dealers in grain, meal, malt, 
&amp;c. 3 d, Mechanics of all forts flocked into it, and feued 
houfes, or rented thofe that were built by others, with a 
view to profit. They are here exempted from the laws or 
regulations of the incorporated trades in the adjoining royal 
burgh of Ayr. 4th, A confiderable number from Ireland 
and the Weft Highlands fettled here, as weavers, day-labour- 
ers, &amp;c. becaufe they could get higher wages than at home. 
It is a confiderable difadvantage to this populous and thriving 
town, that there are no eftablifhed magiftrates refiding in it ; 
an evil which is the lefs likely to be foon remedied, as the 
prefent fuperior of Wallacetown refides at a diftance, and has 
little more connection with it than to uplift the feu-duties. 
The attention and activity of the magiftrates in Ayr and 
Newton to preferve good order in their towns, often drives 
diforderly people, and vagrants of different defcriptions, in- 
to Wallacetown. By the aftivity of fome of the principal 
inhabitants, who, from regard to peace and good order, offi- 
ciate as conftables, this evil has been in fome degree checked j 
and the managers of the collieries^ have much merit in their 
attention to the morals of the people employed by them. 
When it is confidered, that the inhabitants are a mixture of 
Englifh, Irifli, and Highlanders, with the original feuers, who 
were natives of the county of Ayr, it will be found that there 
js as much peace and decency of behaviour among them as 
can well be expe&amp;ed. They are 3 miles diftant from the 
parifh church, in which they have no feats j but have good 

opportunity

Newton, which is built at the weft end of one of their ftreets, 
or at the Seceding meeting-houfe, which ftands at the eaft 
end of it. 

Population of Wallacetoivn The town contains 250 fami- 
lies, in all 960 fouls, 187 married pairs, 38 widows, 8 wi-

Baptifms. — The regifter of baptifms for the whole parifh 
is regularly kept, and alfo the regifter of marriages ; but as

Day-labourers live comfortably upon i s. a day ; all of them

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5015800">CABRACH</name>. 

{County of Banff.— Prefbytery of Alford.— -Synod of 

Aberdeen.') 

By the Reverend Mr James Gordon.</head> 



<p>Name. 



THE name is derived from the Gaelic language, and %_ 
nifies the Timber Mofs : Accordingly, the parifh is full 
of mofs and fir. Every place within the bounds, except fuch 
as are new, has a name of Gaelic extraft. 

Boundaries, Extent, ^.-Cabrach is 30 miles diftant from 
the county town, viz. Aberdeen, and furrounded by a range 
of hills, not very high, covered with heath. The length of 
this parilh, at a medium, from fouth to north, i s . 5 miles - 
the breadth, from eaft to weft, 3 miles, (all computed). ' 

Climate, Soil, Produce, csV.-In fummer the climate is plea, 
fant enough , and, for the benefit of goats milk, is reforted to 
from the low country by many of weak conftitutions, or la- 
bouring under confutation, for whole accommodation there 
are 4 goat whey quarters. In winter, the frofts are more in- 
tenfe, and fnow lies deeper and longer here, than in fome of 
the ne.ghbouring parifhes $ but from this the natives feel no 
inconvenience : They have an inexhauftible mofs at their 

Vol. VII. Zz a

doors, and depend not more for fubfiftence on the produce 
of their fields, than on the profits of a traffic they carry on 
in (heep and black cattle. The foil is wet, and full of 
fwamps, productive enough in provender for cattle i but 
owing to the froft, mifts, and hoar froft in autumn, the annual 
produce of grain does not exceed the confumpt of the inha- 
bitants. 

The farmers fow bear and birley Oats only ; and thefe in 
the upper parts of the parifti are always more or lefs affected 
by the frofts, in fo much that if the feafon has not been ex- 
tremely favourable, they never depend on their own bear, 
and but feldom on their birley oats for feed. 

Sometimes one half of a field is frofted, and the other 
fafe ; and what is ftill more extraordinary, the upper half of 
the ear has been found to be affected, while the lower was 
fafe* Daily experience evinces, that the corns on the heights 
and eminences, run lefs riflt than thofe on flat low grounds. 
For the moft part they begin to fow in the end of March, 
and reap in September and October. Potatoes are the moft 
uncertain of their crops. Turnips thrive j but for want of 
inclofures through the whole parifli, experiments are not 
tried on a large kale. Clover and rye-grafs have been fown 
in yards with fuccefs - t cabbages are common. 

Agriculture and Employments. — The mode of culture is per- 
haps the fame at this day which it was a century ago. The 
plough in ufe is the old Scotch, drawn by 6, 8, or 10 oxenj, 
or cows and oxen, or horfes and oxen together. The dung 
Js, in a great meafure, carried out in creels, on the horfes fides,, 
a method by which there is a great wafte of time that might 
be gained, 3' of thefe loads being only equal' to one of a cart. 

Men and women are employed, and as foon as the feed 

time is done, the plough and harrow are laid afide } the far- 
mers

mere mind little elfe but their cattle ; the women, befides 
their ordinary domeftic affairs, are employed in providing 
coarfe cloths for the family, and fpinning linen yarn to the 
manufactories. 

Neverthelefs, with all thefe peculiarities of climate and 
cuftoms, the tenants, efpecially within the four hills of Ca- 
brach, are in good circumflances enough for their rank, and 
are thriving. Nature feems to have intended the country 
more for pafturage than agriculture ; aware of this, the inha- 
bitants pay their attention chiefly to fheep and black cattle. 
Early in the fpring, they flock their little farms with the for- 
mer, and, about Whitfunday, with the latter. During the 
courfe of the fummer, they are ever buying and felling at 
home and in markets. About the end of Auguft, they clear 
their towns, if the fale is briflc, of all except as many as they 
have provender to fupport in the winter : If the market has 
been bad, they keep more than their ufual number, and buy 
corn and ftraw for them in the neighbouring parifhes.— By 
thefe means they feldom meet with much lofs, nor indeed can 
it ever be great ; their flocks are fmall, and the circle of 
their trade but narrow, of courfe, the little fpeculation that 
is here, depending merely upon the appearance of a good 
grafs crop, or a demand from the fouth, is feldom attended 
with bad confequences, even if the crop fhould happen to be 
fhort. Accordingly, one year with another, they replace the 
capitals employed in this trade, with a fmall profit, deducting 
all charges.

Quarries. — Thofe who refide in the northern parts, con- 
tiguous to Mortlach, burn and fell annually about 4.000 bolls 
of lime, at 6 d. per boll ; two firlots Aberdeen meafure make 
a boll. Lime is little ufed here as a manure, on the fuppo- 
.fition that it turns the crop late. It is prefumed, however, 
that in foine parts it would be attended with advantage. 

Befides great numbers of lime ftone quarries, there is a 
Hate quarry, of a light grey colour on the Hill of the Bank ; 
there being little demand for the flates, the quarry is not in 
leafe. They are not fold, but given gratis. r 

Forrejls. — The banks of the river Dovern, about half a 
century ago, were covered with birch, although, fince the 
fale of it, there is not a plant of wood to be feen there, or in 
any part of the parifh, except in Glen-Feddich, where there 
are fbme old trees, and on the burn of Bank, where there 
are fome young bufhes. The Feddick, which run? into 
the Spey, between Aberlour and Boharn, rifes between Ca- 
brach and Glenlivet, and runs into Mortlach. On its banks 
the D ke of Gordon has a houfe for a hunting feat in a beau- 
tiful romantic fpot, but within the parifh of Mortlach. He 
has another farther up on the Black- water, in the fame pa- 
rifli. The forefts of Qleneddich and Black-water are ftored 
with red deer and roes ; the hills all around, with innumer- 
able flocks of muir-fowl. Here there are partridges, hares, 
foxes, otters, wild ducks, and black cocks. The migratory 
birds are the fwallow, the plover, and cuckow, who appear 
about the middle of April.

Churchy School, and Poor — The minifter's ftipend is 45 1. 
Sterling, and the fervices; befides 2 1. 15 1. 61 d. Sterling 
for communion element money \ with a glebe of 19 acres 
arable, and 2 of pafture ground. The parochial fchool falary 
is 5 1. lis. 1 |d. Sterling. The charity fchool was taken 
away from. Dovernfide in 1779, a want which the people 
there feel much. To remedy this in fome degree, they hire 
a country man to teach their children to read and write in 
winter ; the only time they can difpenfe with them from 
herding their cattle — The number of poor on the roll who 
receive occafional fupply are 12. The weekly contributions 
amount annually to 2I. Sterling, befides a fund of 50 1. Ster- 
ling at intereft, under the management of the heritors and 
kirk-feffion. 

Religion, Seilaries, &amp;c — Befides the eftabliflied Churchs 
there are two chapels ; one for Papifts, who are not half the 
number that they were 30 years ago, and one for Seceders, 
who are much on the decline. One great reafon for the 
.decline of both fects, is the moderation with which they are 
treated all over this country. Intermarriages with Proteftant 
families have been frequently obferved to bring over Papilts, 
efpecially the female part, from their former perfuafion. 

Charatler, Difeafcs, tsfc. — The inhabitants, whofe ordinary 
fize is 5 feet 1 o inches, though variable from 5 feet 6 inches 
to 6 feet, are induftrious, fober, and healthy ; live much bet- 
ter, are neater and cleanlier in their drefTes and dwellings 
than their predeceflors were fome generations ago, when 
men and beafts lay under the fame roof. They all read and 
write ; are intelligent in the ordinary and even fome of the lefs 
common affairs of Ufa* beyond what could be expeded from 
their opportunities, and of an obliging difpofition. Notwith-

{landing the temptations infeparable from the fpecies of traf- 
fic they are conftantly engaged in, in the cattle markets, the/ 
are not addicted to drinking. — However unaccountable, in 
fuch a place, the want of inns and alehoufes may be, there is 
not one in the parijjj ; a circumftance perhaps not unfriendly to 
health and morals ; nor are the inconveniencies attending it 
felt by travellers, becaufe of the hofpitality of the people. 
"With all the necefiaries, and fame of the conveniencies of 
life, they live happy and content at home. They are not in 
general litigious ; nor are law-fuits frequent, which is a con- 
fequence of their honefty in dealings. That the natives of a 
place full of mofles, and interfperfed with fwampy ground, 
ihould be healthy, and fubject to no local diftempcr, may 
appear a little problematical ; yet, excepting a few fevers, 
which are by no means frequent or fatal, the hooping cough, 
smeafles, and fmall-pox in the natural way, are the only dif- 
eafes known here. The moft common difeafe of which they 
die is old age. Of late, the confumption has appeared in 4 
inftances; in each of them fatal, excepting one cafe. Thofe 
who died of it were attacked when at fervice in other coun- 
tries. It is not pretended to account for the healthinefs of 
the people. Perhaps the great fires conftantly burning in 
their houfes, have confiderable influence in counteracting the 
effects of the exhalations which are continually riling from 
the earth. Strangers, not accuftomed to them, catch cold.

The fervices which ufed to be paid to the principal tackfman 
were happily done away when the prefent leafes were given 
by the Duke of Gordon, by getting tacks immediately troax 
himfelf ; the beft thing he could have done to this country. 

Population, fcsV. — The number in 1755 was 960. 
Within the parifh are above 8 years of age, catechife- 

able, - - - - 550 

Children below 8 years of age, - - - 150

Each marriage, at an average, produces 4 children. 

Remarks. — The number of inhabitants has decreafed about 
200 fince 1782 and 1783 ; at which period the houfeholders 
or crofters were driven in quell of fubfiftence to other coun- 
tries and towns, where manufactures are carried on. The 

upper part of the parilh in Aberdeenlhire feldom produces 
fufficiency of grain for itfelf. The lower part of the parifh. 
in BanfHhire produces fufficiency of grain for itfelf, and dif- 
pofes of about 200 bolls, which would make up the deficient 
cy in the upper part, was it not difpofed of to the neighbour- 
ing diftilleries. The defect is made up from other places. 
The ftate of the inhabitants then, (in 1782) when few places 
hereabout had enough for themfelves, may be learned from 
this circumftance, that the mill multures of Cabrach amount- 
ed to a ninth part only of what they are in ordinary years ; 
yet, by means of the indulgence of the Duke of Gordon, 
who allowed them to detain their rents for buying meal, and 
fupporting their families, till they were able to pay without 
hurting them, and the fpirited exertions of individuals, par- 
ticularly John Gordon, E% of Craig, who imported grain 
of different kinds for a fubfiftence to the indigent poor, which

he gave to this and fome of the neighbouring parifhes, no 
body fuffcred for want ; but their circumftances were much 
impaired ; there was no demand for cattle. Meal was fold 
at is. 6 d. and 2 s. per peck, 9 lib. Servants fuffered moft ; 
for every body reduced their numbers ; and day-labourers 
got little if any employment. 

So early as the 15th September 1782, there was a great 
fall of fnow, which laid all the corns, then hardly begun to 
fill, in moft places* The frofts were often intenfe, and vege- 
tation was ftopt here. 

The corns which had milky juices in the ear were totally 
ruined ; thofe which had only watery juices wanted feafon ; 
there were none of them perfectly full or ripe. They were 
therefore given moftly unthrefhed to the cattle. It was after 
Chriftmas before they were all cut. The meal made of what 
was threfhed was bad. To fome it may appear trivial, to 
others worthy to be remarked, that, in fpring 1783, cows 
had calves much earlier, and in greater numbers, than was 
ever remembered ; a fortunate circumftance, in a year when 
the victual of home produce was exceffively bad, and in a 
place where milk is a conftituent part of ordinary fare. It 
was obferved, too, very truly, as to this parifh, that there 
was lefs ficknefs that year than ufual ; a fact which the curi- 
ous will, no doubt, trace up to feveral caufes.

Population*, 



37° Statijlical Account 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 1736 
fouls. In June 1791, there were of inhabitants, above feven 
years of age, 1150; below feven, 190 — In all, 1340. In the 
year 1761, there were in all 1580; decreafe, 240, which is 
accounted for by the emigration of work people to the ma- 
nufactories about Aberdeen by fome of the heritors taking 
large farms into their own management •, by a few of the te- 
nants not choofing to have any fubtenants ; and by a very 
uncommon mortality which prevailed in winter 1789 and 
1790. For feveral years immediately fubfequent to 1761, 
the number of people increafed greatly, and it is only with- 
in the laft 14 or 16 years, that the decreafe has taken place. 
There are at prefent 260 inhabited houfes, fewer by 60 than 
in 176L 

Agriculture and Stock.— -In the y 'ear 1758, there were but 
two carts in the parifn, now 120. Horfes about 260 ; fheep, 
3250; black cattle, 1300; but have not been exactly num- 
bered. The fheep are of a fmall fize ; and have much de- 
creafed in number in the courfe of the laft 50 years, partly 
owing to the inability of farmers to ftock their pofleffions 
properly, and partly becaufe the flocking manufactory, the 
only manufactory carried on here, has been fupplied with 
Englifli wool, by the boners of Aberdeen ; which manufac- 
tory is of confiderable extent, and has been the only means 
of raifing the land rent, at leaft one-third of its prefent value. 

The ftate of agriculture is, in general, much the fame as it 
has been in the memory of man. More grain of the com- 
mon kinds, oats and bear, is raifed than is confumed in the 
parifn ; but the export not great, nor well afcertained. It is 
believed, that there is much lefs now raifed than was 50 or 
60 years ago, as the flocking of farms is much diminished, 
and particularly, the number cf oxen employed in tillage, is 

not

not the one half. Potatoes, of which every occupier of land 
raifes fome, would feem to be the only real improvement. 
Of turnips, fown grafs, on inclofed fields, the fpecimens hi- 
therto exhibited, are poor indeed. Of near 90 farmers, of 
one kind or other, 4 pay of rent 50 1. Sterling, and upwards; 
moft of them lefs than 20 1. and many lefs than iol. there 
are not above fix or feven who can be faid to have attempted 
any improvement. It muft be acknowledged, that fome of 
the proprietors, particularly Mr Baxter of GlafTel, and Sir 
Robert Burnett of Leys ; alfo, Mr Ruffel in the near neigh- 
bourhood, have done, and are doing much in this refpedT: ; 
but examples fet by gentlemen, of inclofing and dreffing 
fields, appear not to be minded by ordinary farmers, who by- 
inability, and the fhort duration of their leafes, cannot be ex- 
pected to imitate. If ever this part of the country is impro- 
ved, it muft be by the heritors themfelves, or by their pitch- 
ing on farmers of good character,- who poiTefs judgment, fpi- 
rit, and means for it, and affording them fuch encourage- 
ments as prudence and good fenfe may direct, as may induce 
them to leave the old tract. In this way, and by examples 
fet by fuch, much might be accomplished, at a fmall expence 
to the landholders, if accompanied with leafes of at leaft two 
19 years — the converfion of mill multures, and almoft all 
kind of fervices — enforcing winter herding — and fixing pro- 
per plans of inclofing and croping. There is plenty of lime- 
ftone on both fides the river Dee, near the middle of the pa- 
rifh, of an inferior quality indeed, but found very ufeful for 
building, as well as for manure. It is of late years much em- 
ployed, and a great proportion of it burnt with Englilh coals ; 
which, confidering the high price of that article, and unequal 
tax on it when brought near to this diftricl, and 1 8 miles 
land carriage, is no bad proof of the fpirit and induftry of 
the people. 

Rivers. 



37 2 Siatl/licdl Account 

Rivers, — The river Dee is in general pretty rapid ; it* 
banks for moft part are adorned with natural woods, and 
plantations of various fpecies of trees, forming beautiful and 
pifturefque fcenery in many places. This is much heighten- 
ed at Bunchory Tarnan, by the junction with Dee of a fmall, 
but impetuous, and often impaffible river called Freuch. It 
is- a collection of many ftreams which come from the Gram- 
pian hills ; and over this river, near a fine cataract and fall of 
its waters among rocks, and alfo near its conflux with Dee, 
almoft oppofite to Banchory, Mr Ruflel of Blackhall, has 
lately erected a fubftantial ftone-bridge of four arches, and 
likewife made good roads leading to it, to the great benefit 
of the country, even to a confiderable diftance. 

The air by the river fide is very falubrious, the foil being 
dry and fandy ; and throughout the parifh, it is moftly of a 
light quality, though generally on a clay bottom ; but a mile 
or two north of the river, "the wholefomenefs of the air muft 
fuffer abatement, frbm the low marfhy fields and moftes, which 
are found from the one end to the other. There is a loch, 
called the Loch of Drum, between 2 and 3 miles in circuit, 
at the eaftern extremity ; and another of the fame dimenfions, 
near the middle of the parifh', called the Loch of Leys, ha- 
ving an artificial ifland, on oak piles, with ruins of houfes, 
and of an oven upon it \ but there is no tradition concerning 
the ufe which may have been made of the antient ftruclure. 
Thefe lochs, and low wet lands, muft be unfriendly to the 
health of the people. Accordingly, there are no inftances 
of great longevity. At prefent, there are few above 80 years 
of age : Many of the young are fubjedt to fore throats, con- 
fumptions, and efpccially to fcrophulous diforders, and of late 
there have been four or five inftances of chorea fancli viti.—

Uemical fevers are not unfrequent. — The fmall-pox is feldom 
mortal, even in the natural way. 

Church, School, and Poor. — Tn the year 1 775, there was an 
elegant new church built. The manfe is very old ; its age 
unknown. The glebe and toft want more than one-fourth 
of an acre of the legal extent. The ftipend is about 42 1. 
Sterling, with 4 chalders of victual, one- third bear, befide 
the annualrent of 100 1. Sterling, mortified for behoof of the 
minifter, by Dr Alexander Reid, whofe father had been a 
minifies here. 

There is a fchool for teaching Latin, Erigliih, writing, and 
arithmetic ; and what is Angular, no part of the falary is paid 
by the heritors or tenants. It is 16 1. Sterling ; which, with 
1 1. Sterling fet apart for upholding the fchool-houfe, is an- 
nualrent at 4-L per cent, of a fum mortified by faid Dr Reid, 
and of 50 1. Sterling by another gentleman. The whole 
was originally intended for the fubfiltence of a head mafter, 
■and two affiftants. There is alfo a woman's fchool, for the 
education of young girls ; the fund for the maintenance of 
•the miftrefs is 2000 merks, mortified alfo by Dr Reid. 

The poor at prefent are 80 in number, which high propor- 
tion is very much occalioned, by the more than common pro- 
vifion made for them here, by which induftry is abated, and 
ftrangers induced to obtain a fettlement in the parifli, while 
a degree of difcontent and envy is unhappily excited in the 
minds of the poor. Hence it might be inferred, that it would 
be better they were relieved by charitable cotemporaries, to 
the advancement of fympathy in the one, and of gratitude in 
the other. The funds are 350 1. Sterling, mortified by one of 
the family of Leys, for the benefit of the poor on that eftate 
in the parifli ; 100 1. Sterling by Dr Reid ; 100 1. by Alex- 
ander Shank of CaMerig, a fon of one of the minifiers ; and

church are between ij s. and 6 s. Sterling each Lord's day, 
and about 5 1. or 6 1. Sterling on communion occafions. The 
poor are fupplied at feveral annual diftributions, and as they 
are found to ftand in need. The average of marriages, for 
the laft 30 years, is 13 ; of baptifms, 29. No regifter for 
burials. 

CharaBer. — The people in general are induftrious, fober, 
and peaceable. There has been no criminal profecution of 
any inhabitant for a long time paft. Whether, within the 
laft 30 or 40 years, the people have improved in morals, and 
the ornaments of the mind, fhall not be pofitively affirmed ; 
perhaps there is no great difference ; but in external attire, 
there is a ftriking alteration to the better, efpecially among 
the young men and women. None are of the Popifh perfua- 
fion ; 3 are of the Englifh Epifcopal church; and about 30 
Seceders, of the Antiburgher perfuafion. Thefe laft obtain- 
ed liberty more than 20 years ago, from one of the heritors, 
to build a meeting-houfe. They have another in the parifh 
of Echt, but no fettled clergyman in either parilh. — The fpi- 
rit of feceffion has been, and is declining in this diftrift.

(County of Lanark. — Prefbytery of Hamilton. — Synod of 
Glafgow and Ayr.} 

By the Reverend Mr John Bower.</head> 



<p>Situation and Name. 

LYING in the heart of a populous and manufacturing 
county, and on the great road betwixt the two chief 
cities of the kingdom, this parifh furnifhes ample room for 
ftatiftical obfervations. 

The origin of the name is obvious. The monks, who 
ufually fixed on a pleafant fituation, had a refidence here ; 
and there exifts a tradition, that a certain pilgrim, in order 
to do penance for fome fin, was obliged to carry a particular 
ftone in this diredion from Glafgow; and, when he could 
bear it no farther, to build a church at his own expence. 
The ftone is ftill to be feen. 

Ecclefiajlical State, and Education. —T\\z tythes of this parifh, 
amounting to 349 bolls, together with grafiums at giving 
leafes, belong to the Univerfity of Glafgow, being part of the 
fubdeanry which was purchafed by the College from the fa- 
mily of Hamilton about the year 1652. Out of this the mi- 
nifter receives only 8 chalders of grain, and 50 merks for 
communion elements. The church, being rebuilt in 1790, 

is 



Statiflical Account 



is a large and commodious houfe. The manfc was complete- 
ly repaired in 1791. The fituation has often been remarked 
for its beauty. The parifh is 10 miles long, and 3 1 in 
breadth. — Befide the legal fchoolmafter, there are 4 public 
teachers in the parifh, two of whom have very good houfes 
built by fubfcription. Though the abilities of the mafters 
are unqueftionable, fome of the fchools are but thinly attend- 
ed. The boys and girls get wages for tambouring, fewing 
muflin, &amp;c at fo early a period, that there is great danger of 
their education being neglected. It is alfo worthy of obfer- 
vation, that, though this parifh is in the vicinity of Glafgow, 
very few young men belonging to it attend the Univerfity, or 
profecute any of the learned profeffions. 80 foon as they 
can write, and underftand any thing of arithmetic, they ob- 
tain good encouragement in the mercantile line, which they 
naturally prefer to the more gradual and uncertain emolu- 
ments of law, divinity, or phyfic — Sunday fchools feem not 
to be unexceptionable inftitutions •, for, how pious foever may 
be the intention of their promoters, they undoubtedly weaken 
the authority of parents, and tend to make them negligent in 
their duty. — The poor are tolerably provided for. None 
beg ; nor is there here any affeffment. The weekly collec- 
tions, which may be about 35 1. per annum ; the third part 
of what is obtained at Shettlefton Chapel, (which was built 
partly to accommodate the weft end of this parifh), and the 
intereft of fome ftock, enable the feffion to give decent relief 
to the diftreffed. The various focieties inftituted among the 
trades people, alfo afford affiftance ; and one cannot help re- 
marking, that it is inexcufeable in heritors who do not re- 
fide, or do not attend the church, not to contribute to this 
important purpofe. By this means an affeflment might be 
avoided, the conferences of which are always to be dreaded. 



Population 



if Old or Weft Monkland. 377 

Population and Manners. — There are, at prefent, 4000 fouls 
in the parifli. The number in 1755 was only 1813. This 
rapid increafe of population is owing to the eflabliihment of 
manufactures. With a few exceptions, the whole people ad- 
here to the church, and are regular in attending on religious 
ordinances. About 800 communicants are ufualiy at the 
Lord's Supper. In the prefent manner of difpenfing that 
holy ordinance, there is great need of a reform. Owing to 
the crowds which affemble, much irregularity takes place. 
It would be more decent in itfelf, and produ&amp;ive of higher 
comfort to ferious perfons, were every congregation to com- 
municate quietly by themfelves. The people are very fond 
of controversial Divinity. Indeed, knowledge of every kind 
is univerfally diffufed * and there is icarcely a family that 
does not regularly read the newipapers. The heritors and 
elders choofe the minifler, according to aft 1690 ; and it is 
not impertinent to notice, that, though popular elections are 
frequently attended with flrife and difcord, yet here, and in 
the New Monkland, which is in the lame predicament, the 
greateft peace and harmony have always prevailed on thefe 
occafions. There are 44 heritors, more than the half of 
whom refide in the parifli. 

Face of the Country, Cultivation, &amp;fc._Thc old valuation is 
6000 1. Scotch. The real rental may be near 5000 1 Ster- 
ling. A great par, of the parifli is inclofed, the advantages • 
of wh.ch are univerfally allowed. "Befide a vaft quantify of 
natural wood, there are more than tooo acre, planted. This

this parifh for 9 or 10 miles, there is a flxong clay. Here are- 
produced luxuriant crops of every grain, efpecially of wheat •, 
fometimes from 12 to 16 bolls are taken off an acre. The 
middle of the parifh is a light fand, affording excellent crops 
of oats and potatoes. A farmer fells an acre undigged at 
from 13 1. to 1 7 1. Sterling. Towards the north are confi- 
derable tracks of mofs. The rivers above named abound 
with falmon in the proper feafon, and trout of every fpecies. 
There is alfo plenty of pike and perch in the Monkland 
Canal, and in the great lochs on the north fide of the 
parifh ; the taking of which, from fmall boats made for the 
purpofe, is a pleafant amufement. — The improvements of 
agriculture are carried on to a vaft extent. Several plowing- 
matches have been inftituted : Thefe create a fpirit of emu- 
lation and a defire to exceU The farmers are uncommonly 
intelligent. They have formed themfelves into a fociety, 
which meets on the firft Thurfday of every month. Their 
object is to communicate their knowledge, and purchafe the 
mofl proper books relating to their bufinefs. In the parifh 
are feveral threfhing-mills, which have been found of great 
ufe. The plough commonly ufed is an improvement of the 
old Scptch one. Small's would not clofe the ftiff lee of this 
parifh. The beam is 6 feet ; the ftilt 6 feet 3 inches. It 
turns the fteepeft ground ; and, being very light, 3 horfes 
will perform as much work with it as 4 with the old one.— A 
confiderable difadvantage under which the farmers labour, is 
the diflance from lime ; but this will, it is hoped, foon be 
removed, at leaft in fome degree ; as, after the junaion of 
the twq canals, lime may be brought from the north by wa- 
ter carriage, and as there is a bridge to be erected over the 
Clyde, on the fouth. The ordinary rotation of crops is this :

low and wheat ; then peafe and beans ; and then oats and

grafs feed. Proprietors of land have begun to pafture the 
greateft part of their eftates. This method, they find, brings 
as good a rent, and tends to improve their property. Some 
of this ground fets at 1 1. 17 s. per acre. It is to be obfervedj 
that the rife of their rents always makes farmers thrive : It 
calls forth their induftry, and compels them' to be active. 
Though the value of land be vaftly increafed, the people live 
and drefs much better than formerly. Property, here is of- 
ten transferred from one owner to another, as is the cafe in 
the neighbourhood of every great commercial town. Indeed, 
the reafon why this pariih is in fuch a high degree of culti- 
vation, is, that when a merchant has been fuccefsful, he pur- 
chafes a piece of land, builds an elegant villa, and improves 
his property at the deareft rate. This accounts for the vaft 
number of gentlemen's houfes with which the pariih is adorn- 
ed, many of them finifhed in the greateft tafte.— There are 
kept in the pariih 1 coach, 5 chaifes, and 5 phaetons. Ow- 
ing to the numerous inclofures, there are few Iheep. The 
large kind, which feed with the cows, are very prolific. One 
ewe, for inftance, in 9 years, produced 30 lambs. 

Mifcellaneous Qbfervations.— Wherever manufactures and 
commerce feat themfelves, their influence on landed property 
is felt in an inconceivable degree ; and how much is it the 
intereft of landholders to cherifh and protect, them ! conse- 
quently, the rife of the value of land in this parifri is afton- 
ilhing. One farm, which, about the year 1730, coft 300 1. 
was lately fold for 2 100 1.— As the gentlemen pay particular 
attention to that bufinefs, the roads are kept in excellent re- 
pair. The ftatute work is commuted. The great road from 
Glafgow to Edinburgh, by Whiteburn, runs through this 
parifli, on which there is a toll-bar, worth a vaft fum yearly. 
There is alfo a toll at Langloan, on the road from Glafgoy* 

to 



3 8o 



Stalijlical Account 



to Airdrie. This road pafles near the church, and traverfe* 
the parilh 7 miles. By an aft of Parliament juft obtained, it 
is to be extended to Edinburgh by Bathgate ; and, when ex- 
ecuted, will be the moll: eligible way between thefe cities, not 
only as being fhorteft, but moft level, and free from pulls. 

Age, Dtfeafes, &amp;e, — Though there is no inftance of re- 
markable longevity, it may be concluded, that the fituation 
is healthy, fince there are alive feveral perfons above 90, and 
many above 80. Prejudices againft inoculation, though not 
entirely eradicated, are gradually wearing out. Local dif- 
eaies are unknown. Fevers and confumptions are moft fre- 
quent. The former prevail after harveft, if the weather has 
been hot. Two families who refide at Lochend, (betwixt 
two large lochs), are regularly attacked with this difeafe at a 
certain time, when it does not vifit any of the neighbours. 
This muft be owing to the exhalations from the water, which 
ftagnates and grows putrid. Several young women of this 
parilh have fallen into confumptions by fitting too long on 
the damp ground at tent preachings. 

Alehoufes There are no lefs than 30 inns or publichoufes 

in the parilh. Thefe, it muft be confeffed, are attended with 
the moft pernicious effects to the health and morals of the 
people. It is no uncommon thing for a labouring man to 
fpend all his wages in thefe houfes, and fuffer his unhappy 
wife and children to continue in want and wretchednefs. 
Government could not adopt a wifer meafure than to raife 
the price of Iicehfes. If a reformation of manners is not 
happily eftecled, what muft be the confequence of fuch ex- 
ecrable practices, it is not difficult to fay. There is a certain 
gradation in the political, as well as in the human body. 
Trade produces affluence : Affluence is the parent of luxury

and difiipation, which infallibly undermine and diflblve the 
fabric. " Righteoufnefs exalteth a nation, but fin is the re- 
" proach of any people." 

Flax. — A confiderable quantity of flax is raifed in this pa- 
rifh, which is generally fown on ground well manured with 
dung or lime, after one crop is taken from it. \Such ground 
fcts at from 4 I. to 7 1. per acre. The Riga feed is preferred. 
The time of lowing flax is the month of April, and it is rea- 
dy for palling about the ift of Auguft. Nine women, at 
10 d. will pull an acre in a day. There are two lint mills, at 
which flax is flculched and drefled, at 2 s. 6 d. per ftone. The 
produce is 16 ftone per acre, and will fell at 12 s. or 13 s. per 
itone. Within thde 10 years, the raifing of flax is greatly 
increafed ; cne man has generally 30 acres, which circulates 
2^0 1. yearly. He has got feveral premiums from the truftees. 

W ravers.— Of thefe there are no lefs than 400 ih this pa- 
rim, who all work to the manufacturers of Glafgow. They 
generally marry young, to which their high wages are an in- 
ducement : We may luppofe that they produce a circulation of 
i4,4col. annually. This valuable body of men have formed 
themfelves into a lociety, which is governed by a deacon and 
4 mailers. Their object is to affift members in diftrefs ; and 
they have now a confiderable capital. Inftitutions of this 
fort, when properly conducted, are extremely ufeful. It may 
be added, under this article, that about 200 girls are employed 
in dotting, tambouring, &amp;c. ; fome of them begin at 8 or 9 
years of age, and, at that early period, gain 6 d. or 8 d. per 
day. Though this may be profitable to one clafs, it is attend- 
ed with material inconvenience to another. Farmers loudly 
complain of the high wages of fervants, and fometimes find

difficulty in procuring them at all. Is there no remedy for 
this growing evil ? 

Pottery. — Near the bank of the Monkland Canal, was 
erected, in 1785, a large brick and tyle work,' where are ma- 
nufactured blue, pan, and flate tyles, the firft of the kind in 
Scotland. Thefe tyles are preferable to red ones, in point 
of durablenefs ; and fo fimilar are they, in fhape and colour, 
to flate itfelf, that it requires a nice eye to difcover the diffe- 
rence, when put on the roof. The motive for fettling here 
was the abundance of coal, and the vaft variety of common 
and fire clay that is found in the lands. At the fame place, 
in 1788, Mr Creelman commenced a pot-work for making 
fait ware ; this manufacture is glazed with fait, which is 
the reafon of its obtaining that name. It is alfo called brown 
ftone, or grey-beard ware. It is excellent for holding fpi- 
ritous liquors, and is mofrly exported to America and the 
Weft Indies. This branch was borrowed from the Dutch 
by the Englilh, and is the firft manufacture of the kind in 
Scotland. On the fame grounds is a free-ftone quarry, of a 
fuperior quality, and beautiful white colour. The ftones are 
carried to Glafgow by the Canal, where they are ufed for 
hearths, ftair-cales, and pavement ; they are alfo fent to Ire- 
land, America, and the Weft Indies. It is fo portable, that 
you may have it from 1 to 6 inches thick, and in boards of a 
yard fquare, and fo fmooth, as to require very little polifhing : 
A high value is fet on this ftone. About 70 people are em- 
ployed at thefe works. 

Monkland Canal — In the year 1770, an act of Parliament 
was obtained for making a navigable cut or canal, from the 
Monkland collieries to the city of Glafgow and the river 
Clyde. The defign of the undertakers was to open an eafy 

com- 



of Old or Weft Monk/and. 383 

communication with the interior parts of the country, and 
by reducing the price of coal, to be of advantage to the ma- 
nufacturers of Glafgow. — The original fubfcription, however, 
being found defficient, and the trade of this country brought 
to a fiagnation by the American war, the fcheme was inter- 
rupted until 1782, when the flock was fold by public auction. 
Meflrs. Stirling, who purchafed the largeft lhare, and who 
ultimately became the fole proprietors, began to finiGi the 
plan ; and, with great fpirit and perieverance, have extended 
the navigation to the river Calder, 13 miles eaft of Glafgow, 
and formed a junction with the great canal at Port Dundas. 
The canal is 1 5 feet wide at the bottom, and 30 at the fur- 
face, capable of admitting vefTels which draw 44. feet water, 
equal to about 60 tons burden. — The height of the canal, 
above the level of the fea, is

The whole of thefe works are completed, except the locks 
at Blackhill, which are in great forwardnefs. A waggon 
road is alfo finifhed between the bafon and Glafgow, which 
renders carriage cheap and eafy. The total expence will be 
30,000 1. The Canal trade is at prefent as follows :

this navigation have hitherto been greatly circumfcribed 5 but 
there is reafon to believe that they will now be felt more fen- 
fibly, on account of the certain increale of the coal trade, 
and the probability of other commercial operations. The 
prefent tonnage is only 6d. ptr cart of 12 cwt. although the 
proprietors have a right to levy 2d. per tun each mile. Coals 
are delivered at Glafgow, by this conveyance, 3 d. lower per 
cart, than at any coal work around the city. 

This immenfe undertaking begins to enhance the value of 
the adjacent land, as lime and dung can be brought by the 
veffels which convey the coal. Mr Stirling brings about 
3000 carts yearly to his own eftate. There are alio various 
other productions, as iron ftone, which may be turned out to 
advantage, and leveral favourable fituations for cotton machi- 
nery. Next hammer Mr Stirling means to eftablilh a track- 
boat, which will be a pleafant mode of conveyance to Glaf- 
gow. Eefides its own proper advantages, the Monkland Ca- 
nal affords a convenient aqueduct to the Forth and Clyde na- 
vigation, by conveying water from the refervoirs in the 
higher parts of the country. 

The chief fupply of water is from the Calder, which is 
conducted into it by a dam at Woodhall mill ; it never 
fails in the drieft feafon. This plentiful refource, which can 
be increaled to double the quantity, at the very higheft part 
of the country, with many other favourable circumfrances, 
open an inviting track for the extenfion of the canal to Edi 1- 
burgh, a plan at prefent in agitation, and which, when exe- 
cuted, will be productive of innumerable benefits to the coun- 
try. The track that has been furveyed, fouth of the Shotts 
hill, rifes 522 feet above the height of the prefent canal, and 
betwixt Edinburgh and Glafgow is cq miles. But a prefer- 
able track can be found north of the Shotts hills, which rifes 
not fo h'gh by 140 feet, and is 10 miles fhorter. A parti-

Bleachfalds — There are two in this parifh, though that at 
Wellhoufe is now partly removed into the Barony parifh, the 
original field is in Old Monkland. Meffrs. Gray laid out 
their ground with great judgment and expence. They were 
the firft in this country who bleached after the Dutch me- 
thod ; and for their diligence and ingenuity obtained a confi- 
derable premium from government. Bufinefs is ftill carried

Carmylefe/d— Was erected in 1741, by Mr M'Kenzie, an 
enterprifing merchant of Glafgow. Nothing can exceed the 
beauty of its fituation, having a fine fouthern expofure, 
wafhed by the Clyde. About 50 people are employed ; men 
get 7 s. women 5 s per week. Many thoufand pieces of light 
muflin are done here annually. This field, which contains 
upwards of 10 acres, has fome peculiar advantages : There 
is a well 6 feet deep, which fills in 12 hours. The water is 
carried 510 feet, and runs 3 gallons in a minute. Much 
praife is due to the proprietors for their attention to the mo- 
rals of their fervants.

Dunlop of Garnkirk, Efq. The Clyde company began to e- 
rect thefe works in 1786. There is abundance of coal with- 
in 

Foreign wood for building, flax, yarn, bar-iron, pitch, tallow, 
foap, feeds, Scots manufactures from the eaft to the weft, fpirits 
from the diftilleries from the eaft to the weft, wines and other 
articles to Hamilton, and the intermediate country. The num- 
ber of tons of the above articles rnuft be very confiderable, ex-, 
clufive of what wijl pafs along the Great Canal ; and many of 
the articles can afford to pay high toll, as the revenue of a Ca^ 
nal ought to be rated according as each article can afford to 
pay, to draw the greateft toll from it. 

Articles of commerce from the Clyde to the Frith of Forth. 
Naval ftores, fugars, rice, and tobacco, from America and the 
Weft Indies ; linen, gauze, and cotton manufactures, herrings, 
and other fHh, kelp, flate, fkins, and lead, from the weft coun- 
try ; hay, veal from Strathaven and the weft, which the Edin- 
burgh market is fupplied with, and various other articles not 
thought of: Trade increafing, and the country confequently 
flourifhing, and every gentleman's eftate made more capable of 
improvement, by the Canal palling through it ; and manufac- 
tures would be eftabliftied from 'Edinburgh to Glafgow along it 
to a vaft extent, as they ever will go where coal is cheap, and 
their goods readily brought to market by an eafy communica- 
tion. E»ung, by return of coal boats, would alfo pay very con- 
fiderable toll, as the quantity carried weft would be great. 

Should the propofed Canal take place, coals of exceeding good 
quality can be fold at Edinburgh for 7 s. 9 d. the 24 cwt. the 
common quantity of two carts, which would be a faving to the- 
inhabitants of 3 s. 3 d. on every two carts, and on ioo,oeo tons; 
at 6s. 6 d. per ton, a faving of 13,333 P er annum ; and the 
advantage on other articles of confumption, where the price is 
at prefent enhanced by land carriage, would be in proportion 
reduced. 

Exclufive of the confumption of Edinburgh and Leith, which 
is 160,000 tons a year, the merchants of Leith have offered to 
export 40,000 tons, provided it is put on board fhip in Leith at 
8 s. ^rrton; and if the Car.al takes place, it will be put on 
board at Leith much cheaper from the weft country. 

Mr Whitworth, the engineer, will determine the expence of 
the Canal; but it is fuppofed, by calculations already made by 
an engineer verfant in canal-making, that the expence of 4

in 200 yards, and plenty of iron-ftone in the neighbourhood. 
About 20,000 tons of coals are confumed yearly, which 
quantity will no doubt be greatly increafed, when forges are 
completed for converting pig-iron into bar-iron. Two blaft 
furnaces are working, and there is prepared a boring-mill 
for cannon, cylinders, &amp;c. About 300 manufacturers and 
labourers are employed : They begin to mould fmall goods fo 
early as 10 years of age. Men's wages, according to their 
department, are from 7 s. to 21 s. per week. After being 
fmelted in the furnaces, the iron is made into a variety of 
caff- iron goods, as pots, pans, boilers, &amp;x. From the enter- 
prifing fpirit and abilities of the proprietors, there is reafon 
to expeft, that thefe works will be foon extended to a very 
large fcale. Contrary to what one would imagine, the peo- 
ple are healthy, and live long. This warm bufinefs feems to 
be friendly to population — moft of the workmen have nume- 
rous families. The fcite of Clyde iron-works appears to have 
been a burying-ground of ancient date. When digging the 
foundation of the buildings, a great quantity of human bones 
were found, depofited betwixt two flag- ftones. Thefe ftones 
were fo placed, as to form a cavity of confiderable extent, 
and this cavity covered with a ftone of the fame kind. In 
the earthen urns were contained afhes, mixed with fmall 
bones, on fome of which were evident marks of fire. In a

for building, &amp;c. are included.

fiiells of different fea animals, wholly petrified. 

Coal. — This parifh abounds with coal ; and what a bene- 
fit is it for Glafgow and its environs, to be fo amply provided 
with this neceflary article ? There are computed to be a 
greater number of colliers here, than in any other parifh in 

Scotland. 

1. Fullarton coal-work, belonging to Mr Dunlop, is in 
the wefiern extremity of the parifh. The coal is opened to 
128 yards depth, in which are 6 feams 23 feet thick, produ- 
cing all the different kinds of coal that are found in Scotland, 
and of excellent quality ; the fplint is reckoned inferior to 
no coal in Britain for a blaft furnace. A large fteam engine 
drains a field of 8co acres. The coals are carried out of 
the pit by a machine, in place of a horfe-gin. — 75 colliers 
are employed, befides an equal number of artificers, labour- 
ers, &amp;c. Wages are from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. 6 d. per day. The 
price at the pit is from 3 s. to 4 s. per ton. From its near- 
nefs to Glafgow and Clyde, this work rauft greatly increafe. 

2. About a mile north of Fullarton, and 4 miles eafi of 
Glafgow, lie Barrachnieand Sandyhills coal-works. Though 
thefe works are connected, it is to be obferved, that near one 
half of the works and men are in the Barony parifh. The 

feams of coals; wages, &amp;c. are the fame as at Fullarton .90 

colliers are engaged, befides about 60 bearers, boys, &amp;c. 
Here, laft fpring, Mr Hamilton erected a machine for draw- 
ing up the coal, to go entirely by fteam.— It is on an impro. 
ved plan, and the firft of the kind in Scotland. It is found 
to be the cheapeft, and moft expeditious way of doing that 
bufinefs ; for could colliers be placed in the pit to keep her 
conftantly employed, fhe would turn out about 200 ton^r 
Iay. the prefent out-put is 35,000 tons per year.

ed, befides workmen, &amp;x. The greateft part of the coal is 
conveyed to Glafgow by the canal, as ftated already. 

4. Captain Chriftie alfo carries on confiderable trade in 
coal. He has made a collateral cut from his land to join the 
canal. He has about 50 men engaged. Thefe coals too 
are moftly fent by the canal.

It has been obferved by coal-mafters, that no inftance is

crime, though they are generally efteemed a rough and ob- 
ftreperous clafs of men. It is alfo to be remarked, in honour 
of the caufe of liberty, that fince the xra of their emancipa- 
tion, the colliers are become a more refpedtable body than 
before. Inftead of being confidered as inferior beings, which 
was formerly the cafe, they now behave and drefs like their 
■ fellow citizens.

how much, may we fay, does the country ftand indebted to 
the gentlemen connected with it. Let other nations adore 
their warriors and butchers of mankind, we will pay a juft

NUMBER XXXIX. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5315660">DUNROSSNESS IN ZETLAND</name>. 

(County of Orkney. — Prejhytery of Zetland.) 

By the Reverend Mr John Mill.</head> 

<p>Name and Situation. 

DUNROSSNESS means the hill of the promontory of 
Rofs. This parifh is on the fouthern extremity of 
Zetland. It is a peninfula wafhed by the fea on three fides, 
and is comparatively the moft fertile diftrift in the Zetland 
Ifles. Two other parifhes are united with Dunrofsnefs, un- 
der the charge of the fame minifter. Thefe are Sand wick, 
which means the Sandy-bay ; and Cunningfburgh, the fame 
name with Koningfberg, which, in the Norfe or Scandina- 
vian language, means Kingfburgh. 

Soil, Air, and Produce. — The foil in the arable parts of the 
parifh is various. In fome places fandy ; in others loam and 
clay. — Confiderable tracks are of mofs, and confequently of 
little value. The air is moift in a great degree, but by no 

means unhealthy. Many of the people live to a great age 

fome to i oo years and upwards. The hills in this parifli 
are green, and the land for the moft part firm. By thefe 
circumftances it is rendered more valuable, as well as a more 
agreeable refidence, than the black mountains and morafles 

to

to the north. The arable grounds are chiefly by the fea- 
fhore, and on the margins of the creeks, which on all fides 
run up into the country. On thefe grounds barley and oats 
are raifed j large fields of potatoes are alfo planted, which are 
of great benefit to this country. Cabbages, turnips, carrots, 
and other kitchen (tuffs, are to be found in the gardens of 
the Zetlanders, in the fame abundance as on the continent of 
Scotland. No grafs feeds are fown in this parifh ; but it is 
remarkable, that on the fandy grounds, when properly pro- 
tected from cattle, natural crops of clover and rye-grafs 
fpring as richly as on the fown fields in other parts of the 
kingdom. — No trees are to be feen in this region, excepting 
a few fhrubby, roan trees, and willows in the more flickered 
valleys. The fpray of the fea, which is blown over the whole 
country by the wefterly winds, forms a natural obftacle to 
the fuccefs of plantations. The force and duration of the 
tempefts from the weft, are among the mod ftriking features 
of a Zetland winter ; and if to thefe are added, the thunder 
and lightening which often occur in that feafon, it will ap- 
pear, that the Zetlanders have their (hare of the inclemency 
of the heavens, although they have lels of froft and fnow 
than the inhabitants of wider countries. 

Minerals. — There are many mineral fprings in this parifh, 
as in other diftricts of Zetland, which bear the appearance of 
iron-ore. Near the ifland of Whalfey, which lies to the eaft- 
ward, mariners have obftrved, that the compafs reels, and 
cannot fix as ufual to a point, which is believed to be owing 
to the attraction of iron-mines in that place. In the years 
1789 and 1790, Zetland was vifited by ibme gentlemen from 
London, who found on the eftate of Quendal a rich irofl- 
inine \ and, in various parts of the iflands, the ores of copper, 

lead, 



of Dunrojfnefsi 293 

lead, and iron, faraples of which were carried to Londonj 
particularly of copper, in confiderable quantity. 

Agriculture, Cattle, and Sheep. — The lands are reckoned by 
a peculiar meafurement, by what are ceiled merks-Iand. — Each 
merk-Iand ought to contain 1600 fquare fathoms. To each 
one cow is allotted ; and the parifh contains 2000 of thefe 
merk- lands, and confequently as many cows. In Sandwick 
and Cunningfburgh, the farmers plough chiefly with oxen, 
and at Nefs with horfes ; 4 oxen or 4 horfes in a plough, 
which go all abreaft ; but the ground is chiefly laboured with 
fpades of a light kind ; with thefe, 5 or 6 men and women^ 
will turn over as much land in a day, as a Scotch plough ' 
with 8 or 10 oxen. The oxen, with the young cattle, are 
about 1000. The parifh of Dunrofsnefs, having more arable 
and lefs pafture ground than the neighbouring parifhes, the 
number of fheep is, of courfe, fmaller than in the other di- 
ftrifts. It was, however, confiderable, till within thefe few 
years ; a large Englifh fcabbed ram was imported into this 
diftritf, which infefted the flock to which he was brought 
and the infection has fpread among the fheep through the 
whole parifh, notwithftanding every precaution and c ff ort of 
the farmers to prevent it. In confluence of this unhappy 
circumftance, the whole number of fheep in the united pa 
nines of Dunrofsnefs, Sandwick, and Cunningfburgh, does 
not now exceed 5000.

pril, or beginning of May, they migrate to Norway, where 
their young are hatched. The ember goofe, as it is here cal- 
led, is a bird larger than the tame goofe ; has a long bill, and 
doleful cry •, it feldom leaves the fea — its legs are fo fliort, 
that it can hardly walk?' Of ducks there are various fpecies, 
which refort to the lochs above mentioned. Befides the wild 
duck, are fc ale- drakes, equal to the wild duck in fize j the 
points of their bills turn up a little ; they are of a beautiful 
brown colour, and hatch their young in rabbit-holes. There 
is a large fpecies called the ftock-duck, and fmaller fpecies 
called teales and attiles. Sea birds of various kinds abound, 
feveral fpecies of which become white in winter. There are 
aiio here in their feafon, the lapwing, the grey and yellow 
plover, and the night-rail. 

pjj Jt The lakes already mentioned produce confiderable 

quantities of trouts of a large fize, which refemble grilfes or 
young falmon, and abundance of large eels. At fea, the fifhes 
moft ufually caught are ling, cod, tulk, and feth ; thefe laft 
are taken in the tide-ways, and chiefly at the fouthern extre- 
mity of the parifh few of thefe are fold in Zetland, either 
frefh or dry faked ; they are lent to Hamburgh or Leith, or 
where the beft markets can be found. For the ufe of the 
inhabitants, the fifhers take abundance of turbot, fkate, fmall 
cod, haddocks, whitings, herrings, mackarels, flounders, &amp;c. 
particularly in the fpring feafon. The fifii, butter, and oil, 
lent to the Hamburgh market, yield a return to Zetland of 
wines, fpir.ts, tea, coffee, fugar, tobacco, linen, hooks, lines, 
ckc. The rocks on the coaft produce abundance of lobllers, 
crabs, oyfters, &amp;c. 

Population.— In the three united parifhes, in 1755, the 

Dumber of families was 4.5 1 J of fouls, according to Ur Web- 

Hers 



of Dunrojfiiefs.

fter's lift, 2295, befides the Fair Ifle, which had about 200. 
In 1770, the families, including Fair Ifle, were 561 ; the in- 
habitants, 2942. In 1790, the families, including Fair Ifle, 
were 570; and the inhabitants 3327. The number of fe- 
males greatly exceeds the males, as the young men leave the 
country in numbers every year ; being commonly inclined 
to a feafaring life, they refort to England and Holland, 
but chiefly to London, where they ferve on board the navy, 
merchant mips, or Greenlanders. The annual number of 
marriages depends much on the feafons : In good years they 
may amount to 30 or upwards ; but when the crops fail, will 
hardly come up to the half of that number. 

Church and Poor. — A handfome church, with a pavilion 
roof, covered with Eafdale flate, was built a few years ago at 
Dunroflnefs. There is another church for the diflricts of 
Sandwick and Cunningfburgh, whether the mhum-r goes to 
officiate every third Sunday. That church has a kirk-feflion 
of its own, and ought to form a leparate parochial charge, if 
there were funds fufficient for the fupport of a mini/ter. lhe 
united parilhes altogether form what is termed a mimjhy ; and 
this miniftry is 12 miles in length, and, in fonje places, 6 mile* 
broad. The flipend is icoo perks Scotch (55 I. us. 3d. 
Sterling), and 50 merks ( 2 \. , 5 s. 7 | d.) for communion 
elements. The whole people are members of the eftabliihed 
Church. The prelbytery of Zetland is not fubjeft to the j„. 
rifdiclion of any provincial fynod, but depends immediately 
on the General Aflembly. 

The poor are fupported by weekly collections, and the 
fines levied from delinquents ; the diftribution is made by 
the kirk-feffions. The number of poor was fmall, and feme 
httle flock was happily accumulated previous to the year r 782

made it neceffary to give' away both ftock and income. For 
5 years fucceflively, beginning with 1782, the crops almoft 
wholly failed, and above 100 poor perfons came upon the fef- 
fions of this miniitry. No country in the world can bear a 
failure of crop better than Zetland, if the lea continues to 
render its fupplies, particularly when the fmall fry of feth or 
cole fifh fill the bays in their ulual abundance ; but from 
1 78 1 to 1787, the feaj as well as the land, withheld its ufual 
produces. Thcfe circumftauces were attended with a great 
murrain and mortality among the fheep and cattle. In this 
fituation, the people owed their relief to the bounty of go- 
vernment. Veflels, loaded with provifions, arrived feafbnably 
from England ; and it was underftood in this country, that 
the fupplies were haflened by the anxious fympathy of our 
gracious Queen. In the event, no perfon died of want. 

Mifcellanecus Obfervat'wns. — Sponges are found upon the 
fhore in great plenty, fhaped like a man's hand, and called 
by the people Troivie Gloves. There are no beacons or light- 
houfes on the coaft. The principal creeks are Quendal Bay, 
Grutnefs, and Weft Voes, which lie on each fide of Sum- 
burgh Head, feparated by a neck of land. In Lerwick 
Sound, fhips anchor and ride fecurely, as they do alfo in 
Aithfvoe of Cunningfburgh. On the Fair Hie in this mini- 
ftry, the flag fhip of the Spanifh Armada was wrecked in 
1588; and the Duke of Medina Celi refided for fome time in 
the houfe of Quendal. 

There are no manufactures here, ur.lefs for domeftic ufe, 
viz. blankets and coarfe cloth, excepting, perhaps, fome 
ftockings, gloves, and garters,, fold to the Dutch fifhers. A 
linen manufacture was attempted here fome years ago by the 
gentlemen of the country, and a confiderable fum of money 
^vas expended, but the adventure came to nothing : For its 

failure 



of Dunrojfnefs, 



397 



failure two reafons may be affigned. The want of a profef- 
fional owner, to combine his intereft and lk.il! in the manage- 
ment ; and the choice of the fpot, which was inconvenient. 
The fitteft place for works belonging to this manufacture, 
would be the Loch of Sound near Lerwick, where there is a 
regular refort from all parts. — The prices of provifions are 
greatly raifed within thefe 30 or 40 years. A fat ox or cow 
was then 30 s.. now it is 3 1. 10 s. and other provifions in pro- 
portion. Butter, from 4 s. is now 7 s. or 8 s. per 30 lb. weight. 
The proprietors, in letting their lands, proportion the extent 
of farms to the number of perfons in a family. Thus two merks- 
land is ufually let to a man and wife at firft ; but, as the family 
mcreafes, they may have 3 or 4 merks-knd. The great objedl 
is to fct out as many boats as pcffible to the fifhing, as, through 
this medium, the rents are paid. Hence the price of land 
on fale in this country is higher in proportion to the rent 
than almoft any where elfe. The eftate of Sumburgh, to the 
furprife of the gentlemen of Edinburgh, was bought at 52 
years purchafe : It was a good bargain, not becaufe the rents 
were low, but from the mode in which they are paid. The 
rents of this country are chiefly paid out of the fea. The 
tenants have from their landlords threepence allowed for a 
ling, a penny for a cod or tufk, and a halfpenny for a feth, 
(colefifh); and thefe, when falted and dried, will, in the 
Hamburgh market, yield four or five times as much, befides 
debentures from Government. Add to this, double or triple 
the prime coft for goods brought back and fold to the people, 

viz. linen, tobacco, fpirits, hooks, lines, &amp;c There are three 

forts of boats ufed in the fifhing trade, a larger and a fmaller 
fize of 6 oared boats, and 4 oared boats. In all, there are 
about 200 boats through this miniflry. Some brigs have 
formerly belonged to owners in this diftrift, the laft of which 
was captured by the French. Of late, a fmall floop that goes 

upon

Stati/lical Account 



upon the fifhing, and to different parts of the country, was 
built by one Robert Thompfon, a native of Fair Ifle, and who 
was for ieveral years a fthoolmafter there, under the Society 
for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. He is now a farmer 
and mariner, an excellent cooper, a wright, and mafon, by 
the force of a mechanical genius, without having ever been 
an apprentice to any of thefe pi ofiffions. His floop was built 
from the keel, and completely rigged and equipped by him- 
felf. — One of the principal means of improvement to this 
country would be good roads, as, at prefent, no cart or car- 
riage whatever can be ufed for the tranfport of goods on the 
foft lurface of the country, particularly to the northward. 
Two roads are efpecially needed, viz. from Lerwick to Scal- 
loway, the two principal towns of Zetland, the ciftance is 
only 4 miles ; and from Lenvic^ through Tingwall parifh, to 
the parifh of Delton, and thence to Yell found, through the 
very heart of the country, which is not above 12 miks ; but, 
in fome places, the peat mols is fo deep as to be impaffable 
: n horfcback. — Another great improvement on the ftate of 
country would be a better divifion of the finall farms, 
which are parcelled out in difcontiguous plots and run -rigg, 
termed here rigg and rendal. Even the mo ft inconfiderable 
merk-lands, lying fcattered in feveral patches, intermixed 
with patches poffeffed by other people. This unaccountable 
arrangement produces endlefs quarrels and vexations among 
neighbours, on account of trefpaffes which mull unavoidably 
occur almoft daily while the fields remain thus interwoven.

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, &amp;c. 

THE ancient and modern name of the parifli is Glafs* 
It is faid to be called fo from the greennefs of its hills, 
on which there is very little heath ; and that the word Glafs, 
in Irifh, fignifies green. — The river Dovern runs through the 
parifli ; and the church is fltuated on the north fide of faid 
river, the courfe of which is from fouth-weft to north-eaft. 
The extent of the parifli, from north-eaft to fouth-weft, Is 
full five computed miles j and, from north-weft to fouth-eaft, 
upwards of four computed miles. The country is variegated 
by a number of green hills, which afford pafture for black 
cattle and flieep, of each of which, numbers are produced and 
bred in the parifli. The foil, in general, is a pretty deep 
loam. What lies along the river fide is tolerably early ; but 
thofe parts which lie at any diftance are rather cold and late, 
and the harveft very precarious. The roads, in general, are 
very bad ; for, though the ftatute labour is exacted, yet it is 
very fuperficially performed ; and, by the fwampinefs of the 
ground, the communication from place to place is little 
tended. Bcfides this, Dovern is frequently impaflable, as. 

there

there is no boat or ftone-bridge over it : Hence many acci- 
dents happen. Not fewer than 7 perfons have loft their 
lives in the river within thefe 30 years paft. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report in 1755, 
the number of fouls was 1000. For thefe 34 years paft, 
the amount of examinable perfons, at an average, was about 
900. Laft year, the number of fouls was 942. This pre- 
fent year, (April 1791), the number is 970, which is confi- 
derably lefs than for years before 1782. There are about 12 
or i4Seceders, fome of whom have families, and thefe are 
not reckoned. When the prelent incumbent entered, there 
were about 45 Papifts, and 4 Nonjurors ; but, at prefent, 
there are none. During 36 years, from 1756 to 1791 in- 
clufive, the baptifms in this parifh were, — males, 345, — fe- 
males, 350. 

Effecls of 1782. — The King's bounty in 1782, tranfmitted 
by the Barons of Exchequer, of 50 bolls meal, with what the 
funds of the parifh afforded, preferved the lives of the poor. 
The people, at that period, were meagre and ghaftly ; but 
the difeafes that were apprehended did not follow, owing, as 
was fuppofed, to their feldom getting a full meal of fuch 
corrupted victual as the feafon produced. So little produc- 
tive was the oats or barley, that many were known not to 
have a peck of meal from a boll of dried corn ; and the co- 
lour fo black, that it refembled more the ordinary duft in the 
mills, than meal for the ufe of man. The tenants were great- 
ly reduced; and many of their cottars were obliged to retire 
to the manufacturing towns for employment, by which the 
numbers are fewer than before. 

Rent, Prices, Wages, and Crops. — The valued rent is 2250 1. 

Scotch ; 



of Gldfs. 4 oi 

Scotch; the real rent about iooo I. Sterling, converting the 
victual at ios. per boll. Rent of acres is from 6 s. 8d. to 
20 s. Sterling. Moft of the farms have pafture grafs, on 
which they feed cattle. The young ftore, the butter and 
cheefe they make from their cows, and the linen yarn fpun 
by the women to the manufacturers in Huntly, are the prin- 
cipal funds for paying their rents. Butter fells from 5 d. to 
7| d. per pound j cheefe at 4 s. and 5 s. per ftone ; and beef 
and mutton at from 3 d. to 41 d. per pound. Men's fervants 
wages run from 4 1. to 5 1. and fome 6 1. per year ; and wo- 
men's wages, at an average, may be computed at 2 1. 5 s 

Oats, barley, and a few peafe, are the ordinary crops the, 
country produces; only, of late, fome few have fown turnip,' 
and planted potatoes in the fields after the plough ; and have, 
with next crop, laid down clover and rye-grafs, which have 
fucceeded very well. 

Church, Poor, and Schsol.-Tht Duke of Gordon is patron. 
The ftipend is 36 bolls oat-meal, 16 bolls bear, and 46 1. 6 s. 
8d. Sterling of money, with a glebe of about 15 acres of 
arable and grafs ground. The manfe and office-houfes were 
built in 1772. The church, which was quite ruinous, is this 
year very fufficiently rebuilt. There are only two heritors, 
neither of whom refide— There are few begging poor in the 
parifh, but feveral houfeholders that are in indigent circum- 
ftances ; and thefe, to the amount of between 30 and 40, 
get fuch affiftance as the funds will admit. The collec- 
tions in the church do not exceed 7I. or 81. at moft in the 
year; but mortifications, to the extent of 150 1. Sterling* 
help in part—The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 merks. There 
were, this winter, 32 fcholars at the fchool.

<p>Situation and Soil. 

rTpHE parifh of Oldhamftocks lies 6 miles eaft of Dun- 
JL bar, and 20 miles weft of Berwick. It extends from 
the fea up into Lammermuir, being in length from N. E. to 
- S. W. abcut 6 Englifh miles, and from 2 to 3 miles in 
breadth, from N. W. to S. E. The face of the country is 
compofed of little hills, gradually rifing above e?ch other, as 
the diftance from the fhore increafes. 

The foil is generally fharp and dry ; very fertile towards 
the fea, but more barren and heathy as you advance from the 
fhore ;— the higher part of the parifh being ufed chiefly for 
flieep pafture. The air is dry and healthful. 

Minerals.— In the lower part of the parifh we find lime- 
ftone, free-ftone, iron-ftone, and coal. The coal has former- 
ly been wrought ; but it was only the upper ftratum, or crop 
coal, the level from which, as appears from the drain, was 
nearly equal with the fea at low water. There may poflibly 

be

be feveral ftrata of coal below this, referved for fome future 
period, when fuel may not be fo eafily procured as at prefent. 

Improvements.— -Improvements in hufbandry have, within 
thefe laft 30 years, made rapid progrefs in this and the adja- 
cent parilhes, efpecially in fallowing their land-, clearing it of 
irones, regular rotations of crops, with turnip and grafs. 
The farmers on the higher grounds have likewife begun to 
pay attention to their breed of flieep j and by the crops of 
turnip and hay which they now raife, have, in a great mea- 
fure, fequred their flocks from the fatal effects of an hard 
winter. Within the fame period, the mode of living is alfo 
much changed to the better, not only among the fanners, 
but even among the lower clafs of people ; to which change, 
the feeding of fwine, and the habit of eating pork, have con- 
tributed not a little. One farmer has erected a threlhing 
machine, conflructed by Mr Meikle. — Sc\ crals of thefe ma- 
chines have been erected in this neighbourhood, and are 
found to anfwer the purpofe intended. One capital improve- 
ment, efpecially upon the higher lands, is ftill wanted — that 
of inclofures. This gives the country a bleak appearance, 
and deprives it of that Ihelter, which might haften and in- 
creafe vegetation. There is almoft no wood in this pari!h, 
except about the houle of Bunglas. The natural woo J, with 
which it once abounded is, for want of care, almoft entirely 
deftroyed.

Decreafe, . I24 
From Table I. the parilh appears to have been more popu- 
lous about 70 years ago than at prefent. This decreafe is 
owing in fome rneafure, to the country being thrown into 
larger farms than formerly. Thefe require fewer hands for 
the labour than the fmali farms j and the farmers wjflx to fup- 

port

port no more houfes upon the ground than are fufricient for 
the hands employed on the farm. About the beginning of 
this century, there were alfo coal and faluworks in this pa- 
rifh, both which have been long ago given up, and the hands 
therein employed, removing with their families, would con. 
tribute fomething to the decreale of population. 

Price of Labour. — The average of wages of houfehold fer- 
vants is, for men fervants, 6 1. Sterling per annum ; far a good 
woman fervant, 3 1. Sterling; common day-labourers, with- 
out victuals, men, i s. women, 6 d. per day ; common la- 
bourers, with vi£tu^ls, per day, men 8 d. or lod. women, 
4 d. ; during harveft, reapers wages vary from 8 d. to i s. 
4d. The greater part of the farm-work is performed by 
hynds, or fervants who live in their own houfes, whole wives 
and children are alfo occafionally employed on the farm.

harveft, beiitlcs his own work. Upon the above yearly in- 
come, with the induftry of their wives and children, their 
families are fupported in a comfortable and decent manner. 

FjfJji'ig. — The fifh caught cn this coaft are turbot, eod, 
£::.:c, herring, haddotks, whitings, flounders, lobfters, and 
crabs. The ufual tame of the herring fifhing is betwixt the 
20th of July and the i2lh of September. Great numbers 
are bought up by the country people, for prefent ufej and 
when they can be fold fo low as i s. or 15 d. per hundred, 
they then become an object for the merchants, by whom they 
are cured into white or red herrings. The lobfter fifhing 
begins about the end of October, and continues till the end 
of April. The fifhers are bound by a contract, for i certain 
number of years, to fend them to Dunbar, for the London 
market, at 5 s. Sterling for fizable labfters, and half that fum 
for the underiized ones, per fcore. — The fifhers on this coaft 
ufc two kinds of boats ; the largeft, called ccb.es, are different 
hem the hilling boats generally ufed, being remarkably flat 
in the bottom, and of a great length, mcafuring about 30 
feet in keel, and 33 or 34 feet aloft from Mem to ftern ; ex- 
treme breadth, ~\ feet, and depth, from floor to the top of 
the gunwale, 4 feet. Thefe are ufed only in the herring 
timing, each carrying men and a fkipper, with 8 nets; each 
net being 60 yards long, and 13 yards in depth.

The fifhers in this parifh and in the neighbourhood are

early in life, raife numerous families, whom they educate and 
provide for in a comfortable manner, in their own line. 

Churchy School, and Poor.— The prefent church was built 
anno 170 1, and is in good repair. The manfe was built anno 
1677 ; but fince that time has undergone feveral repairs, and 
fome additions, and is now a good houfe. The minifter's fli- 
pend, including communion elements, is, per annum, Sol. 
us. i-fd. Sterling paid in money. The glebe is 4 Scotch 
acres, of no great value. The prefent patron is Hunter of 
Thurfton, Efq; — There is only one public fchool in the pa- 
rifh, which is attended by about 40 children yearly. The 
fchoolmafter's falary is 61. 13 s. 6 d. per annum, with a houfe 
and fmall garden. School wages are very low ; teaching to 
read Englifh, is. 6d. per quarter ; writing, 2 s. ; arithmetic 
and Latin, 2 s. 6d. Mathematics, geometry, book-keeping, 
navigation, &amp;c. are taught each by the courfe, at a guinea 
per courfe. — There are very few poor upon the parifh roll. 
Thefe are fupported by the church offerings, the money rail- 
ed from the pall, and the intereft of a fmall fum belonging 

to 



of Oldhamjloch. 



to the parifh, amounting in all, commumbus arwis, to 1 2 1. 
Sterling. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The number of heritors is 8. 
Sir James Hall of Dunglafs, Bart, is the only refiding heritor. 
The whole valued rent is 3675 1. is. 10 d. Scotch ; real rent, 
about 2000 1. Sterling. The houfe of Dunglafs ftands on 
the weft fide cf the fmall river, which divides Eaft Lothian 
from the county of Berwick. The banks of the river are 
fteep, and covered with remarkably fine wood, through which 
a variety of agreeable walks are cut, and kept in good repair. 
The Caftle of Dunglafs is frequently mentioned in the Scot- 
tifh hiftories. It belonged, for many years, to the Earl of 
Home's anceftors, and from this he has the title of Lord Dun- 
glafs. It was here that James VI. lodged with his retinue, 
the firft night after he left Edinburgh, on his journey to Lon- 
don, 1603. This fort was, by accident or treachery, blown 
up, anno 1640, when Lord Haddington, and a number of the 
neighbouring gentlemen, perifhed in its ruins. The prelent 
houle, a modern building, is railed on the very fpot where 
that fort flood. Near it ftands an old chapel, which, though 
not now uled for the purpofe it was originally intended, is 
ftill kept in good repair. It was built about the middle of the 
fourteenth century by Sir Thomas Hume, who married Ni- 
colas Pipdie, heirefs of Dunglafs.

defcriptive of its fituation : Foigh-ritudh, or a meadow along 
the fide of a hill. — The principal part of the parifh lies in a 
valley, furrounded with hills, to the north, weft, and fouth, 
with an extenfive opening to the eaft. There the valley has 
a commanding view of the town and parifh of Dingwall, 
which lies to the north-eaft of it. The name of this valley 
is Strathpeffer. About three-fourths of the inhabitants of 
the parifh refide in the valley. Befides it, there are feveral 
fmall glens, which extend to fome diftance along the open- 
ings of the hills. All thefe are, however, completely infula- 
ted from the bulk of the parifh, being furrounded with the 
neighbouring ones, and lie much nearer the churches of 
D.ingwall and Contin than to Fodderty. The extent of the 
valley is nearly two miles long, by half a mile broad. 

Climate. — The air throughout the parifh is pure and 
healthy ; and there are many inftances of longevity in it.

Several men and women are now refiding in the parifh who 
call themfelves near 90 years of age. 

Dijlempers, — There are no diftempers peculiar to this pa- 
rifli, except fuch as are common to the neighbouring places. 
The fmall-pox often rages here, and frequently proves mor- 
tal, as inoculation has never been attempted except by a very 
few families, who recently introduced it with fuccefs. The 
prejudice of the people is, however, very ftrong againft it. 

Minerals. — There are appearances of coal mines in the 
parifh. A perfon was, fome time ago, employed to work a 
part of the coal, when it was found to be of a remarkably 
inflammable quality ; of a clear black colour, fo that it ap- 
peared to approach nearer to a bituminous fubftance than to 
coal. — There are feyeral mineral fprings here, all of which 
are of the fame quality, and feem to be impregnated with 
fulphur. One of thefe has, for about 20 years back, been of 
fome note. Great numbers of the lower clafs of people from 
the counties of Inverneft, Sutherland, and the weftern dif- 
trifts of Rofs-fhire, have reforted hither, and ufe the water 
of this mineral for all kinds of dilbrders without exception. 
Moft benefit has been derived from this mineral by thofe 
troubled with fcorbutic complaints, and all kinds of external 
fores on the body. It has been ufed with fuccefs in the gra- 
vel and ftomach complaints. 

Hills.— The moft remarkable hills are, lft, Beuivas, which 
is one of the higheft hills in Scotland, and lies immediately 
to the north of this valley ; 2 dly, Knockfallaric. This hill 
is fituated on the fouth fide of the valley : Its form is coni- 
cal ; and the vulgar tradition is, that Fingal had one of his 
caftles upon the top of it. What probably gave rife to this 

opinion^

opinion, was the ruins on the fummit of it, which arc yet to 
be feen. They furround a plain of nearly an acre in extent, 
and are compofed of (tones cemented by a vitrified fubftance. 
What the origin or the ufe of this building was, cannot 
eafily be determined ; but certain it is, that the work muft 
have been eft'efted at a great expence of labour, and with 
prodigious force of fire. 

Woods.— There are great numbers of plots of afh, hazel, 
and alder wood, interfperfed with the corn fields along this 
valley : When thefe, and the fields around them, are in ver- 
dure, it forms a beautiful fcene. There are about 200 acres 
of firs lately planted upon the fummit of the hill, to the fouth 
of the valley.

It is to be obferved here, that the number of black cattle has 
decreafed within thefe two years, by the introdu&amp;ion of fheep 
farms, which hns increafed the number, and improved the 
breed of fheep in the parifh.

Rent and Farms. — The valued rent of this parifh is 3543 I. 
3 s. 4 d. Scotch money. The real rent is chiefly paid in. 
bolls, fo that its value is annually altering ; converting thefe, 
however, at a moderate price, the rent is fuppofed to be near- 
ly 1400 Sterling per annum. There are 8 proprietors in the 
parifh, none of whom have ever refided in it. There are 10 
principal formers here, who pay rent to the value of 40 I. 
Sterling each per annum ; 1 50 fmaller tenants, who pay from, 
16 1. Sterling per annum each, to 2 1. Sterling per annum each ; 
and ico cottars, who pay from 2 L Sterling per annum each, 
to 2 s. Sterling each per annum. 

Crops, and Method of Culture. — The only crops raifed here 
are barley, oats, peafe, and potatoes. The old method of 
conftantly crcping, is generally followed by all the claiTes of 
fanners. Some attempts have of late been made by a few 
towards altering the fyftem of farming, by the introduction 
of fown grafs, fallow, and turnips ; but thefe elTays have al- 
ways been checked by the want of encouragement fliown 
to thofe who tried them, none of the proprietors here having 
ever allowed any of their tenants to derive any advantage 
from their improvements, or offered them any affiftance to 
enable them to carry them on. 

Manners and Emplsyments of the People. — There is for fome 
fcafons of the year, a very great want of induftry among the 

inhabitants

inhabitants here. During the weeks of feed-time and haf- 
veft they exert themfelves to a great degree ; but during the 
remainder of the year, having no field for fimilar exertions of 
mduftry, they indulge themfelves to a great degree in indo- 
lence and inactivity. The want of employment here, forces 
thofe who are induftrioufly inclined, to go and find labour 
in the fouthern diftrifts of Scotland ; fo that great numbers 
of both fexes, leave their homes in the months of May and 
June, and return again in November, with from 10 s. to 42 s. 
which is the fruit of their induftry. Sloth feems to be the' 
greateft enemy to the morality of the people here, as thofe 
who will not procure their own fubfiftence by labour, are 
forced to ufe diOioneft means for procuring it. They are 
much addicted to the ufe of fpirits, and will go every length 
to procure it. 

Churchy School, and Poor.—hXl the inhabitants of this pa- 
rifh. except two, are of the eftablifhed Church, and thefe are 
of the Church of England. The living confifts of 6 chalders 
and a half of barley— 25 1. Sterling money— a glebe, and the 
minifter has a right to the fmall tithes. The patron is Ken- 
neth Mackenzie of Cromarty, Efq. The falary of the 
fchoolmafter is 1 1 1. 2 s. Sterling. The fchool-houfe was 
built anno 1779, and is now in a good ftate of repair. There 
are now on the poors roll 50 perfons, who receive a part of 
their fubfiftence from the funds allotted to them. There are

By the Reverend Mr William Anderson.</head> 



<p>Name and DimenJIons. 

STRICHEN, (from Strathion, John's Strath), was erected 
into a parifh in 1627; and confifts of 38 ploughs, 32 of 
which were taken off from the parifh of Rathon, and the 
other 6 (called the 6 ploughs of Saithley), from the parifh of 
Fraleifburgh. — It confifts of about 8000 acres, and is of an 
oblong form, Hoping gradually towards the banks of the river 
Eugie, which pretty nearly divides the parifh, and fails into 
the fea 13 miles below, at Inverugie, near Peterhead. There 
are plenty of trout and eels in the river, and formerly there 
were a great many otters, but few of them are now to be 
feen, the breed being almoft worn out in this part of the 
country. 

Population — In Dr Webfler's lift, in 1755, the population 
was 1 158. The number of inhabitants is 1400. In 1776, 
a lift was taken, and they amounted to 1 100, claffed as fol- 
lows : Under 7 years of age, 178 ; from 7 to 80, S 78 ; above 
80, 44- The increafe is owing to a village which has hern 
lately built, and to dividing the farms, few of which exceed

•jo 1. and the greateft number being not above 10 I. or I2.h 
Sterling of yearly rent, which is punctually paid. 

Improvements. — The increafe of population has tended not 
a little to the improvement of the land in this parilh. Po- 
tatoes, turnip, flax, and artificial graffes, were introduced about 
50 years ago by the late Lord Strichen. He alfo introduced the 
ufe of lime for the ground, and began the improvement of 
the roads, which are in this parilh kept in excellent order. 
The culture of flax is reckoned a confiderable object here, 
which has been very much promoted by the encouragement 
of the Honourable the Board of Truftees for manufactures, 
&amp;c. in giving a premium for erecting a lint-mill, and diflri- 
buting lintfeed gratis; but moft effectually, by the eftabliih- 
ment of a yarn-market, which holds in the beginning of 
March and middle of May, at which the capital manufactu- 
rers and dealers attend ; and the country people are not only 
lure of a fale, and ready money, but of the higheft price 
their yarn is worth. The truftees gave premiums of 10 X! per 
annum, for 5 years, to the perfon who purchafed the greateft 
quantity of yarn, made from flax of the growth of the 
. country. This occafioned a competition among the buyers, 
in which the fellers found their advantage ; fo that at thefe 
markets, where there ufed not to be a tingle fpincile djfgofecl 
of, upwards of 4000 fpindles have been fold for fome years 
paft by the country people ; and the markets, which promife 
to improve, are of great fervice to all concerned, and will be 
of permanent ufe to the country. 

Price cf Labour — The price of labour is confiderably. in- 
/creafed of late, and is daily rifing. The yearly wages of a 
man fervant is 5 1. ; a maid fervant, 2 1. ios. with their main-

tainance ; a houfc-carpenter, i s. per day ; a mafon, i s. 4 d. ; 
ordinary labourers, 8 d. and 9 d. ; a hay-cutter, 1 s. 6d. and 
9 reaper, i s. 

Church, School, and Poor. — The church was built in 1627, 
but has been repaired and enlarged fince. The ftipend (in- 
cluding 1 1. 17 s. 6 d. for providing communion elements), is 
30 1. in money, 3 chalders of meal, and 15 acres of land gi- 
ven the late incumbent, by a private agreement, inftead of an 
augmentation in money. This deed was executed by the 
late Lord Strichen, with the unanimous approbation of the 
prefbytery about 40 years ago. The patron is Mr Frafer of 
Strichen.:— The fchool, including falary, fcholars fees, and 
other perquifites, maybe worth about 30 1. a year. The 
fchoolmafter has a very neat houfe of two ftories high, and a 
glebe of 8 acres, given him by the late Lord Strichen.— 
There are 30 poor on the lift : About 30 1. Sterling is divid- 
ed among them, according to their neceffities, arifing from 
the collections in the church, mort cloth dues, and the inte- 
reft of about 140 1. which belongs to the fefiion. In 1783, 
they funk upwards of 60 1. out of their funds, in purchafing 
and lowering the price of grain for the ufe of the parifh. 

Village. — There is a village in the parifh, which was 
founded in 1764, containing 200 inhabitants. There are a 
good many weavers, and other tradefmen in it ; and the lint- 
mill, bleachfield, and other improvements, which are going 
on in the neighbourhood, afford conllant employment to la- 
bourers, fo that it is in a thriving flate, and increafing. It 
has a charter for a weekly market. There is a poft- office in 
it, and good roads to it in every direction. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatlons. — The whole parifh, unlefs a ve- 
ry 



of Siricben. 4*9 

ry inconfiderable part, belongs to Alexander Frafer, Efq. 
There are feveral plantations of fir and foreft trees in the 
parifh, made and planted by the late Lord Strichen, which, 
from the beauty of contrail., make a great addition to the 
appearance of the place, in a country where there is little 
wood. Among thefe plantations, there are a good many old. 
trees, (fuppofed to haye been planted about the beginning of 
the iaft century, 150 circles being counted on fome of them, 
which were cut down 35 years ago). They drew a compli- 
ment from the late Dr Johnfion, who fays, in his Tour 
through Scotland, that « he had travelled 200 miles, and 
« s had only feen one tree not younger than himfelf ; but at 
" Strichen, he faw trees of full growth, worthy of his no- 
" tice." — The animals and bird tribe are the fame that are 
common in the reft of the country. There have been, for 
40 years paft, great numbers of the regulus, or golden creft- 
ed wren, goldfinches, thrufhes, and lapwings, all of which 
have been in the cuftom of building and hatching here. Of 
late the goldfinches have quite difappeared, and the lapwings 
are much fewer. Black-birds, ring ouzel, and dobchick, 
which ufed to come only in winter, with great flocks of fnovv 
birds, and fieldfares, remain now, and build their nefts ; the 
fnow-birds and fieldfares leave the country in May. Of late 
years, in the month of November, bulfinches, Carolina chat- 
terers, and different kinds of woodpeckers, make their ap- 
pearance, and continue through the winter. — The parifh has 
the advantage of an excellent lime quarry in the center of it, 
and of great plenty of peat for firing. There are 5 well fre- 
quented yearly markets held in it. The people are, in general, 
iober and induftrious, go neat and clean, and are of an ex- 
tremely obliging benevolent difpofition The ftones on the 

fide of an high hill in this parifh are of a whitifh colour, and 
of the nature of the white flint, of which porcelain is made.

<p>Name, Situation, Boundaries, Surface, &amp;c. 
npHE name of this parifh is very antient ; it is of Celtic 
■f" ori § in  and is $.d to be derived from Les or Lis, a 
green or garden, and Macute, the natpe cf the tutelar faint 
of the place, who is reported to have hern a bifliop and con- 
feflbr of the 6th century, thus lignifying Sr. Macule's Green, 
which, in latter times, has been changed inro Abbevgreen, 
the prefent name of the village built round the church, for- 
merly belonging to a monaftery now demolilhed, which 
flood hard by it, and was a priory, dependent on the Abbey 
of Kelfo. All that remains of this antient building is a 
fquare tower, with battlements upon the tops of the walN. 
It is now covered with a pavilion roof, having a belfrey on 
the top, and ferves for the fteeple of the prefent church, 
which Hands adjoining to it. 

This monafrery was founded by King David I. in the year 
1 140. The church belonging to it was dedicated to St. Ma- 
ry. This church, which appears by the marks of the beams 
in -he wall cf the tower, to have been much loftier than the 
prefent one, has been twice deftroyed by fire ; firft by John

of Lefmahagoe.

Planta^enet, brother to Edward III. King of England ; and 
a fccond time at the Reformation, when all the ancient mo- 
numents and relics were deftroyed by the reformers. And 
indeed the marks of conflagration feem ftill vifible on the 
Wall of the tower, on the fide adjoining to the church. 

The parifh is fifuafed in the upper ward of the county cf 
Lanark, in the prefbytery of that name, and fynod of Glas- 
gow and Ayr. It is of a broad oval figure, the longeft dia- 
meter being about 14 miles, and the fhorteft about 12. It 
lies upcn the fouth-weft fide of the river Clyde, which runs 
along the border of it for about 9 or 10 miles ; and in this 
courfe are the flupendous falls of the river at Bonnitown, 
Corhoufe, and Stonbyres, fo well known, and repeatedly de- 
fer ibed. 

The banks of the Clyde in this parifh are very bold, rifing, 
in many places, abruptly into hills of a conhderable height, 
every where divided by deep gullies, formed by the nume- 
rous brooks and torrents which fall into the river. The in- 
termixture of coppice woods, plantations of fcreft trees, and 
floping open glades, of fwelling eminences, deep ravines, and 
towering hills, on both fides of the river, added to the wind- 
ings of its copious flream, and the magnificent falls above 
mentioned, exhibit to the eye of the paflenger, at every 
change of fituation, new landfcapes ftrikingly fublime and 
beautiful. 

The foil is various. Part of the northern corner of the 
parifh is of a clayey nature, but light friable moulds are more 
frequent ; in fome places it is fandy, in others ftoney and gra- 
velly. The face of the country is every where uneven; and to- 
wards the fouth and weft becomes very mountainous, and the 
foil mofly and muirifh. The tops of the mountains are co- 
vered with bent, grafs, and heath ; towards the bottoms/where 
mofs does not prevail, there are green paftures and arable 

lands. 



42 2 St 'atijlical Account 

lands. Upon the whole, the foil of the parifli i s far from 
being of the moft fertile quality, and is better adapted to 
pafturage than tillage. Here it deferves to be remarked, that 
tillage has been purfued to a much greater extent, at fome 
former period, than at prefent ; for there are every where to 
be found, even almoft to the fummits of the higheft moun- 
tains, large traits of land, which have been regularly formed 
into ridges, and fmoothed by repeated culture, now over- 
grown with bent, heath, and moffes. How it comes to pafs, 
that land on which corn would not now ripen, fhould have 
been attentively cultivated fome centuries ago, is left to the 
curious to enquire ; for there is no tradition to be traced 
here, which would ferve to throw any light upon the fubjecl*. 

The moft remarkable mountains are the great range which 
feparates this parifli from thofe of Douglas and Muirkirk, 
called the Cumberheadhills, the Knotberrylaw, the Warlaw,' 
the Todlaw, the Birkenhead, and the Grayftonehill, on the 
weft fide ; the Blackhiil, the Dullars, and the Boreland, to- 
wards the Clyde, on the eaft fide. 

Rivers.— The Logan rifes in the range of mountains which 
divides this parifli from Muirkirk ; and running eaftward for 
6 miles joins the Nethan, , which has its fource in the fame 
mountains, a few miles to the eaft. The joint ftream, which 
then takes the name of Nethan, runs north and eaft through 
the parifli, dividing it nearly into two equal halves, and fails 
into the Clyde a little above where the pariflies of Da'.ferf

* It alfo appears, that this part of the country is Jefs fertile 
than formerly, by an old charter belonging to the monaftery, 
which mentions a confiderable quantity of wheat, payable from 
the neighbouring lands. Few people now attempt to cultivate 
wheat on thefe lands; and fuch as have tried it have abandoned 
it from ill fuccefs.

and Lefmahagoe meet. This is -a beautiful paftoral ftream ; 
the banks of which are finely diverfified with hanging woods, 
floping paftures, and cornfields. The Ponicle runs along the 
fouth border of the parifh, till it falls into the Douglas river; 
and afterwards the united river, the banks of which are high- 
ly pidturefque, forms the boundary on that fide. The little 
river Kype divides this from the parifh of Avondale. The 
Calner, which runs northward, and feparating the parifhes of 
Stonehoufe and Dalferf, falls into the Avon, takes its rife in 
the weftern part of this parifh, in the eftate of Blackwood, 
by the proprietors of which its banks have been adorned 
with ftately groves of foreft trees. Befides thefe, number- 
lefs brooks, and fountains of the pureft water, flow from the 
fides of every hill. 

In the Nethan and Logan, as well as the rivers by which 
the parifh is bounded, are found plenty of trout and filver 
eel. Salmon, alfo, from the Clyde, go up the Nethan, and 
even to the Logan, in the month of Augufl, and fpawn 
there ; but a cruive now put acrofs the mouth of the firft, 
obftru&amp;s them greatly, and is likewife thought to have dimi- 
nifhed the number of trouts. 

Air, — The fituation of the parifh being elevated, the air is 
fomewhat moift, and fo cold and {harp as greatly to retard 
the progrefs of vegetation in the fpring, confequently the 
harveft is not early. In autumn, too, the frofty vapours 
fettle in the narrow plains in the neighbourhood of the 
mountains, and frequently injure the crops. The air, how- 
ever, feems not to be unfavourable to animal life. The inha- 
bitants are healthy and robuft, little fubjecl: to difeafes. 
There are feveral inftances of vigorous longevity among them ; 
from which the following is felefted as being known" to the 

writer. J Forteous, about 20 years ago, after having 

compleated the hundredth year of his age, walked from his 

houfe 



424 Statijlical Account 

houfe near the village of Abbeygreen to Hamilton, 12 miles 
diftant, and after having done his little bufinefs, returned the 
fame day alfo on foot. He lived 5 or 6 years after ; and en- 
joyed fome degree of health and vigour almoit to the laft. 

FoJJds. — There is a great variety of minerals in this parifh, 
which might furnifh ample field for the inveftigations of the 
mineralogift and the philofopher. The rocks and ftones in the 
bed of the river Clyde, oppofite to Stonebyres, and indeed aU 
moft all the (tones which appear in that neighbourhood, are 
of the colour of burnt bricks, and look as if they had fuffer- 
ed the action of fire. The ftrata of rock in the bed of the 
Nethan, which moftly lie in a fituation very much inclined, 
have a different appearance, and feem to be of a different 
quality, at every few paces, as one paffes along. Among 
thefe, a gentleman of fome Ikill in mineralogy, who v\i:, 
fome years ago, on a vifit in the parifh, afferted that he dif- 
covered the real porcelain earth in a petrified form. In this 
river are found large maffes formed of fmaU ftones of diffe- 
rent kinds, united by a fubftance which feems to have been 
in fufion ; and alfo various petrifactions, particularly pieces of 
wood of different fizes. The Cumberhead mountains are 
known to contain veins of lead, which are faid to be very 
rich. Attempts were made to work them in the year 1720, 
and again in the year 1758 ; but, from fome mifmanagement, 
mifgave. Coal is found in different parts of the pariih. Pit 
coal has been wrought at Stockbridge, Coalburn, Gun (green, 
and Weftown ; and is fold at the pit from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. per 
ton. There is alfo wrought at Woodfhoufe, belonging to 
the Duke of Hamilton ; at Auchenheath, belonging to IWr 
Weir of Blackwood j and at Blair, belonging to Lord Dou- 
glas, beds of an inflammable fubftance, having fome refem- 
blance of jet, here called candle- coal, or light coal, much va- 
lued for the ftrong bright flame which it emits in burning, 

"This

This is fold for about 5 s. per ton, and fome of it is carried 
to places 40 or 50 miles diftant. Peats, which when dried 
are almoft as hard as coal, and burn with a ftrong flame, are 
dug in feveral moffes in this parifh. Beds of iron-ftone are 
feen in different parts of the parifh. Beds of lime, of a great 
thicknefs and excellent quality, are found very near the fur* 
face in many places. Some of thefe beds are not lefs than 
30 feet thick ; and the quality of the lime fo good, that upon 
an analyfis 29 parts of 30 have been found to be pure calca- 
reous earth. Various petrifactions, fuch as fliells of different 
figures, parts of the fculls and horns of fheep, and bits of 
flicks, are found in the lime quarries. In the upper part of 
the parifh marl has been lately difcovered. In one place 
there is a vein of grey marble, blocks of which fome old peo- 
ple mention to have been carried to Hamilton houfe and 
Douglas houfe, but it is not known how it proved. There 
is alfo fome appearance of a flate quarry in a moor called 
Dunfide moor ; but as it has not yet been fully explored, 
the quality is not afcertained. Huge maffes of granite or 
whin rock, form the bafis of the mountains ort the weft fide 
of the parifh. Amidft this great variety of foffils, free ftone 
of a good quality for building, is obtained only in a few- 
places - x fome of the quarries, however, are of a remarkable good 
quality, particularly on the banks of the Nethan, where 
large blocks of ftone are cut, which are fo beautifully vein- 
ed, and take fo fine a polifh, that it gets the name of Craig- 
nethan marble, and is much valued for columns and fteps of 
large ftairs. 

Cattle, Cultivation, and Produce. — It has been already ob- 
ferved, that the greateft part of this diftricl, from the inequa- 
lity of the furface, the nature of the foil, and the great ele- 
vation of the country, is better adapted for pafture than cul-

tivation. The high moorifh parts of the parifli are chiefly 
applied to rearing and pafturing flieep, and fome are kept 
through the whole. The number is about 7000. Thofe of 
the moors are generally black faced and black legged—have 
very rough coarie wool, and are always fmeared with tar. 
They are of a little fize, but hardy and well boned, and feed 
to a confiderable weight when put upon rich pafture. Some 
of mixed bree.ls, of larger body, and finer wool, are kept on 
the lower grounds. The number of cows kept are about 
1600, befides young ones which the farmers are always rear- 
ing j of which there cannot be lefs than 400 bred annually. 
The diftrift contains 1 30 ploughgates •, and no great refine- 
ment in agriculture being yet introduced, 4 horfes are for 
the moll part yoked to each plough, lb that the number of 
horfes are about 520, befides young ones annually reared, 
probably about 100. The horles in this part of the country 
were formerly of a fmall fize, and ill lhaped ; but of late the 
breed is much improved, and horfes of a confiderable value 
are now reared here. There are alio 12 horfes kept by car- 
riers in and round the village, who carry goods to and from 
different places. The people of this part of Scotland had 
formerly a fuperftitious prejudice againft 1'wine ; but now 
there are a number reared and fed in this parifli. It does 
not appear, however, to be a very advantageous kind of eco- 
nomy to feed hogs in a barren country, where every thing 
the land produces can generally be otherways confumed to 
greater advantage. It can only be beneficial for farmers who 
keep no more hogs than they can fupport, on fuch of the 
offals of their dairy as they can turn to no other purpofe, 
and feed them up in the autumn with potatoes. Of thole 
animals there may be about 70 or 80 killed in this parifli an- 
nually. 

As 



of Lefmahagoe. 



As the greateft part of this parifti, from the nature of its 
foil, expofure, and climate, is not the moft inviting fubject 
for cultivation, fo neither have improvements in agriculture 
made great progrefs in it. Fallowing is not pradlifed, ex- 
cept in a few farms in the lower ground ; nor is paring and 
burning the thick turf on the old pafture, which would tend 
much to forward vegetation in a cold country, thought of. 
The ancient diftinftions of croft and outfield are ftill kept 
up ; and the greateft part of the manure made about the farm 
laid upon the former. The latter, after lying a few years in 
pafture, and fometimes a little compoft laid upon it, is crop- 
ped with oats for two or three years, and again left to reft. 
Upon the crofts the feeds of clover and rye-grafs are now 
frequently fown, and a crop or two of hay taken ; and after 
the land has been two or three years paftured, it is cropped, 
firft with peafe, then with barley, with two plowings and 
dung, next oats, &amp;x. Lime, except by a few people, is but 
fparingly applied. The Scotch plough, nearly in the fame 
ftate as it has been for this century paft, is almoft univerfally 
uled, it being only near the Clyde where any modern im- 
provement is begun to be introduced. 

There is no wheat raifed in this diftridt, except in the low 
parts in the north corner of this pari fh. Oats are the princi- 
pal grain ; and, from the report of the tenants of the mills in 
which they are ground, the quantity produced feems to have 
greatly climinifhed in the courfe of the laft 20 years. Whe- 
ther this deficiency be owing to the land having been former- 
ly exhaufted— to lefs favourable feafons— to a lefs fkilfull or 
lefs attentive culture— or whether it be not from deficiency 
. of produce, but from the corn being confurned otherways than 
by grinding it into meal, it is not pretended here to deter- 
mine. It is certainly in fome part owing to the laft ; for in 
the firft place, farmers, whether purely ' from the pride of 

feeing 



4 2 &amp; Siat i/f teal Account 

feeing their horfes make a better appearance, or whether 
they find that they enhance the value of the animal, in the 
full proportion of the additional food given it, allow their 
horfes more oats than formerly ; and fecondly, the number 
of horfes, and the demand for oats to feed them, having 
greatly increafed in the country of late years, hufbandmen 
frequently find it more advantageous to fell their oats unma- 
nufactured, than to make them into meal, efpecially in back- 
ward feafons, when the oats are lefs productive. The barley 
of this parifh has been efteemed of a good quality, not in- 
deed large bodied, but plump and thin hulked. Upon the 
fale of this grain the farmers formerly chiefly depended for 
payment of their rents ; but it is a fact, not lefs remarkable, 
nor lefs difficult to be accounted for, that the quantity of it 
produced is alfo diminifhed. The concurring teltimony of 
every hufbandman advanced in life confirms this fact. 
Undoubtedly, therefore, either the feafons of late mult have 
been unfavourable to cultivation, or a lefs accurate and dili- 
gent culture muft now prevail. Probably both muft be ta- 
ken into the account. While the cold backward fprings 
have difcouraged the delicate growth of the new fprung crop, 
the roots of the various kinds of hardy weeds, which have 
been allowed to accumulate in the foil from defective cul- 
ture, have fprung up to choke it. Peafe feldom prove a va- 
luable crop in this parifh. They are frequently either over- 
run by the numerous weeds which thrive greatly in the light 
foil, or pufhed too much to ftraw by the latter rains, and yield 
little grain. Such has been fo much the cafe of late years, that 
the hufbandmen have been greatly difcouraged in cultivating 
them, and many fow fewer than formerly. There is but a 
fmall part of this parifh on which it has been thought pru- 
dent to attempt the culture of beans. Flax is only cultivated 
in fm .11 quantities for domeftic ule i but from the valuabre

returns which have frequently been obtained from thefe, it 
is reafonable to think that much of the land is well adapted 
to the growth of that plant. The culture of turnip, for 
which much of the foil is alfo well adapted, has not yet been 
attempted to any confiderable extent, nor with that afiiduity 
neceffary to make it advantageous. Every hufbandman 
plants potatoes, to the extent, perhaps, of half an acre to a 
ploughgate, at an average ; and this root fucceeds extremely 
well in moft places, when fufficient pains is beftowed on the 
culture. There are no confiderable orchards in this parifh ; 
but towards the foot of the Nethan, and all along the Clyde 
below the falls, apple, pear, and plum trees are planted in 
every little garden ; and in thofe narrow warm vallies, fhel- 
tered by the high land on all fides, thefe trees, particularly 
the plum trees, generally produce a confiderable quantity of 
good fruit. 

Befides annual productions a confiderable quantity of wood 
grows in the parifh, much of the hanging ground by the 
fides of the different rivers being clothed with coppices. 
Some of thefe are very extenfive, particularly Stonebyres 
woods, which are arranged into fuch a number of lots, that 
one of them is always ready to cut annually, for the fale of 
fuch fmall timber as is commonly ufed in the country. Only 
the banks of the Logan and the Kype are naked, they having 
their courfes through high moorifh ground, the bottom of 
which is whin rock, for the moft part adverfe to the growth 
©f timber. The juniper tree, a plant not to be found in the 
neighbouring country, abounds on the fides of the hills in 
the eaftern part of this parifh. 

State of Property.— The valued rent of the parifh is 9841 1. 
Scotch. The Duke of Hamilton is the greateft proprietor. 
There is only befides part of the eftates of Blackwood, Stone- 
byres,

byres, and fome farms formerly belonging to the Hamihons 
of Raplock, which are held immediately of the Crown ; all 
the reft is either the property of the faid Duke, or held of 
him in feu. 

There are feveral undivided commons of confiderable ex- 
tent, on which the adjoining proprietors have a right of paf- 
turage, according to fome eftablilhed proportion ; but thefe 
are all moorilh grounds, which do not feem capable of very 
important improvements.

The population of this parifh feems to have been confider- 
ably upon the increafe during the firft part of the prefent 
century. There is frill extant an examination lift of the one 
half of the parifh, made out by the Reverend Mr Robert 
Black in the 1705, containing the names of 840 examinable 
perfons ; and, fuppofing both halves to have been then, as they 
are at prefent, nearly equally populous, the total inhabitants, 
who were deemed examinable, were 1680. But the late 
Reverend Mr Thomas Wharry, who was a native of the pa- 
rifh, had filled firft the one cure, and then the other, and 
was minifter for 50 years, has left an accurate examination 
lift of the whole parifh, enumerated with his own hand, which 
contains 2448 names, of 10 years old and upwards, taken in 
the year 1730; and, fuppofing thofe under 10 years to be, 
as at prefent, a little more than a fourth more, the number 
of fouls was then above 3000. The fame gentleman has alfo 
left a copy of anfwers to queries, from a committee of the 
General Afiembly, in which he fays, the number of perfons 
above 10 years was between 2900 and 3000. This paper has 
no date ; but it is probably the anfwer to the inquiry fet on 
foot by Dr Webfter about the year 1755, as Mr Wharry was 
often heard fay, in the latter part of his life, that the num- 
ber of examinable perfons was about 3000. He died in the 
year 1761. Since that period, the number of the people 
has been upon the decreafe, as well as the fertility of the 
foil.

Statiftical Account 



beyond its rude domeftic ftate. Many of the houfe-wlves 
not only manufacture the greateft part of the wearing ap- 
parel for their refpedtive families, but have their wool and 
flax wrought up into yarn or cloth for fale in the neighbour- 
ing markets. Some of the weavers are employed in this 
way ; others by the manufacturers in great towns, in weaving 
fine linen and cotton cloths. The women belonging to the 
villages and cottages are moftly employed in fpianing linen- 
yarn for the manufacturers in other places, there being people 
who go about to diftribute the flax, and receive the yarn. 

Though this parifli has not yet made great advances, it is 
not improbable it may one day make a confiderable figure 
among the neighbouring diftridts, fhould the various materi- 
als which may be collected from its furface, or drawn from 
its bowels, attract the attention of the opulent and enter- 
prifing. If it fhall be found, by means of the patriotic ex- 
periments now making by the Society for the improvement 
of Britifh wool, that the bleak mountains here, on which 
fheep only of the coarfeft fleece now ftray, are equally capa- 
ble of rearing thofe which will yield plenty of fine foft wool ; 
jf flax were cultivated with all the attention which the foil 
feems to invite ; thefe, with the various treafures which lie 
buried under ground, would furnifh an ample fund of em- 
ployment and wealth to a numerous people ; while the abund- 
ance of fuel, and the many fprings and water falls, would be 
ready inftruments to facilitate every undertaking. At the 
fame time, a more improved and populous fociety would tend 
to enlighten the minds, and ftimulate the induftry of the 
peafantry ; to improve the land, and fpread a pleafant ver- 
dure over fields, new clothed in /ombre heath.

Roads and £r^/—Befides the bridge over the Clyde 
lately mentioned, there are 3 bridges over the Nethan, on 
different roads one of which is upon the poft road, which 
runs through this parifh, from Glafgow to Carlifle. On the 
fame road is a bridge over the Fonicle, by which this is 
joined to Douglas parifh. There are feveral other arches 
over the other rivers and brooks, where moft ncceffary. 
Many of the roads through this parifh are fteep and incon- 
venient, partly owing to the great inequality of the furface 



of Lefmahagoe.

and partly to a want of proper attention to the nature of the 
country, at the firft laying of them out ; whence more eafy 
and convenient tracks, which might have been got by ma- 
king fmall deviations, have been difregarded. A bill is now 
propofed to be brought into Parliament for making a road 
from Lanark to Hamilton, to pafs through this parim, along 
the banks of the Clyde, to wind along in a level courfe, 
fliunning all fudden riflings and declivities, which, when ex- 
ecuted, will not only greatly promote the internal intercourfe 
through this part of the country, but entertain the paflenger 
with a view of the molt majeftic natural fcenery.

<p>Soil and Climate. 

5Hp»HIS parifh is fituated on the fhore of the Atlantic. 

-S- i he country is low and level. The foil in general is 
fertile. It is a mould in which the clay predominates. — It is 
not deep, bur it is true; and will' not difappoint the hufband- 
man who will bellow any labour or expence in the cultiva- 
tion of it. But the climate, which is extremely moift and 
variable, often blafts the mod flattering appearance, and dis- 
appoints the farmer's hope. The air, owing to the vicinity 
of the weftern ocean, and the clouds thence rolled in by the 
S. W. wind, is continually, for nine months in the year at 
leaft, charged with vapour ; and in the months of July and 
Auguft, which determine the fate of the barley and oats, 
there is generally fuch moift rainy weather, that the crop ei- 
ther lodges, or never fills ; and, upon the whole, the average 
return from oats is not above three feeds, nor from barley above 
four feeds. — Sometimes a furious gale from the N. W. black- 
ens and breaks the potatoe ftalks, and deprives the poor peo- 
ple 



of Craignijh. 42 

•pie of the only ftaff which they have to lean to for fubfiis 
ence. This was remarkably the cafe in the 1 790. 

But the climate, though unfriendly to agriculture, is quite 
falutary to the human fpecies, and every other animal. The 
people enjoy good health — Though no remarkable inftances 
of longevity have, for fome time paft, occurred among them, 
they in general arrive at the ordinary period prelcribed to 
the human race ; and fome of them who are verging towards 
80, poflefs an uncommon degree of bodily ftrength and men- 
tal vigour. Far removed from that intercourfe which, while 
at polilhes the manners, corrupts the heart, and undermines 
the conftitution of man, it was their happinefs to have led 3 
Ample frugal life; and as they were ftrangers to thofe ex 
cefles to which luxury leads, they are now unacquainted with 
thofe diilcuipers which it generates. The fever, indeed is 
the greateft enemy they have to dread. Some inflances of a 
droply in the belly occurs ; and, it is affirmed by the a £ ed 
upon whole experience and obfervation in this cafe we muft 
reft that this complaint is much more prevalent through the 
whole country, than it was 50 or 60 years ago, and that it is 
becoming more general. Suppofing this to be a faft it is not 
eaiy to account for it. The caufe, however, which is com- 
monly afligned, and which feems moft obvious and plaufible 
IS the ^moderate ufe of the potatoe root.-What qufcy' 
of wholefome nourilhment this pl ant is naturally qualified to 
impart to the human frame cannot be determined ; but it is

Grangers to mutton.— Nay, for a confiderable part of the 
year, while the potatoes abound, many of them do not tafte 
bread. 

Tides and Fijh. — In the channel between this parifh and 
the iflands to the weft the tide is very rapid, and the fea 
generally very boifterous. The tide of flood fets in from the 
Irifh Channel, between the main-land and the ifland of Jura. 
A branch ftrikes off" to the weft, between Jura and Scorba, 
through the narrow gullet called in Gaelic Corryvracken y or 
the Gulf of Brachan. The tide of ebb fets down this chan- 
nel from the north, and a branch pufhes in from the weft 
through the above gulf with uncommon violence. The rage 
of the tide in this narrow pafs, efpecially when irritated by 
the winds, is inconceivable. The people, at the turn of the 
tide, fifh about it in moderate weather j but in the calnieft 
day they muft make for the fhore, before the tide (hall ac- 
quire any degree of ftrength. Another branch of the chan- 
nel tide paffes to and repafles from Lochcrinan to the fouth, 
by the point of Craignifh. At the point, and between two 
iflands which lie a little to the weft, it is remarkably violent ; 
and ftrangers in open boats have often been fatally deceived 
by keeping clofe to the land for fecurity. Some years ago in 
particular, two fmall boats were loft in this current. They 
were part of a frail fleet from the North Ifles, loaded with 
fifh, and preffing under every difadvantage round the Mull of 
Kintyre to a market. 

The only fifh that is caught in any quantity on the coaft 
is a kind of grey fifh called Seathe. When the weather ad- 
mits of it, this fifh may be had in great abundance. In an 
evening and morning, the only time of the day when it will 
take the fly, a man may, to his own fhare, catch 9 or 10 
fcore. The fifh, indeed, is not very delicate, but it is whole- 

fome; 



of CraignlJIo. 339 

fome; and it yields a confiderable quantity of oil, which is often 
fold at i6d.Jer Scotch pint. Perhaps cod and ling might be 
found } but no attempt has been made to difcover the banks 
which they haunt. Indeed, while the country fhall remain 
in its prefent deprelTed condition, without trade and without 
manufactures to collect its inhabitants, to increafe confump- 
tion, and circulate money, it is morally impoffible that the 
exertions of induftry fhould, in this, or any other refpeit, aim 
at more than bare fubliftence. The herring fo metimes find 
their way to the finall creeks upon the coaft ; but the-great 
tide is fo near, that they are foon fwept away;' and, as this 
kind of fifhing is precarious, the people are feldom proper- 
ly prepared for it. If, however, they continue for any time 
upon the coaft, a man with a few nets will more than fupply 
his own family. The price depends on the quantity of falc 
in the country at the ti ne. If this commodity, as often hap- 
pens, is Icarce, it is vain to fifth more than they can eat, un- 
til a fupply fhall come from Ireland; but if there is plenty of 
fait, the herrings will fell at 1 s. and fometimes 1 s. 6 d. per 
hundred. When a fupply from Ireland is mentioned, it is 
proper to obferve, that fait, under the prefent fyftem of ma- 
nagement, is an article wirh which the people in the High- 
lands can never be properly fupplied. The want of ftores ju- 
dicioufly difpofed through the country— the bonds and pro- 
vifos that ftand in the way, render it impoffible to make fl 
general provifion for a herring fifhing which, on many parts 
of the coaft, is tranfitory and precarious. Thus fmuggling is 
encouraged, nay, made neceffary ; and thus the fiihing in 
general is difcouraged-and thus many opportunities of con- 
tributing left or more to the wealth and profperity of the na- 
Jion, are for ever loft.

Cultivation and Productions. — In this, as in moft Highland 
parifhes, the people follow the old fyftem of agriculture with 
little or no variation. They have neither lkill nor encou- 
ragement to attempt any material change. They hold their 
farms, Ipme of them, on fhort or no leafes. They are fub- 

jected 



of Craignijh. 44 i 

jetted to fervitudes, which muft be performed at whatever 
rime they are exacted. Their fields are neither regularly 
formed, nor properly inclofed ; and there is no lime, marl, 
or fhell fand which they can conveniently get to improve 
their land. Thefe circumftances concurring with the natural 
indolence of the people, lead to an eafy conjefture of the 
confequence,— arva, fqualentque coloni. But, though 
their mode of cultivation is injudicious, and their efforts in 
the profecution of it are feeble, they derive much advantage 
from implements of hufbandry, lighter and better conduc- 
ted than thofe formerly ufed, particularly the plough. They 
all now have neat light ploughs, which, with two horfes, 
perform more work than the old machines could do with 
four. Carts have been lately introduced ; and more would 
be ufed, were the roads made pafTable for fuch carriages. 
But thefe are quite neglected. The ftatute labour is not 
employed on them ; and it is probable the commutation for

fhe planting of potatoes in drills is another change which 
has lately taken place in their mode of cultivation. Bv this 
change the labour is diminifhed, and the produce increafed.

couraged to follow his example, much advantage would re- 
fult to the inhabitants ; for, in fuch a moift and change- 
able climate, they might depend upon green crops with 
greater fecurity than on any other. They fow their oats in 
the latter end of March, and their barley in the beginning of 
May. The latter they reap in Auguft, and the former in 
Oftober, and later, if the ieafon is cold ; but all that they 
reap from their labour is not fufficient for the whole year. 
Every fummer they buy fome meal. 

Language.— The Gaelic or Celtic is the only language of the 
inhabitants, though they, in general, can fpeak a little Englilh. 
The names of places are derived from the Gaelic, and are 
expreffive either of the fituation, appearance, or poffeffion. 
Thus Grianaig, from. Grian, fun, fignifies a fpot expofed to 
the fun, or a funny fpot ; Lergachony, the molly country 
fide ; Barrackan, the eminence of Brackan. But there are 
two farms in the parifh, Soraba and Gemmil, whofe names 
are evidently Danifh. What thefe words fignify, it is im- 
poffibie to trace ; but they are left behind to prove, along 
with the rude forts on the hills, that the brave and adven- 
turous Danes once occupied the low as well as the high 
grounds of the country. 

Manners.— The people are fimple and frugal in their mode 
of drefs and living. They are attentive and prudent in the 
management of their bufinefs ; difcreet and judicious in their 
convention; hofpitable, as far as their circumftances will 
admit ; and addifted to no vice in a remarkable degree. No 
capital crimes $ no banifhments ; feldom a quarrel, which 
3tft circumftance may be much owing to the want of public 
houfes. There, is but one ; but that one is unluckily too 
near the church. It is, however, a general grievance in 

country 



• of Craignijh. 443 

country pariflies, that thefe tabernacles of iniquity fhould be 
placed too clofe to the houfe of God. 

Church and School. — The church has lately been repaired ; 
but the manfe, which, at firft, was built very fuperficially, 
and without offices, never was repaired, and is now in a ruin- 
ous ftate. The ftipend is 92 bolls meal, 8 ftone weight, and 
about 23 1. money, including 5 1. for communion elements. 
The whole, at the common converfion, not exceeding 661. 
exclufive of the allowance for the elements. To this the 
glebe makes little addition, as it will hardly graze two cows, 
if the four acres of arable, and thefe of the worft quality, are 
cultivated. The incumbent muft difpenfe with the conve- 
nience of having a horfe, or find grafs for him ; rather a 
hard alternative for a poor country parfon.— The fchool fa- 
lary is only 100 merks, and 50 s. ariiing from a mortification, 
wh.ch, along with perquifites, may amount to about 20 1. 
per annum ; a referable allowance to a man of genius for 
employing his time and talents in qualifying the rifing gene- 
ration to fill up the vacant ftations in fociety with honour 
What a reproach to the people of Scotland, that this moft 
uieful clafs of citizens, in their late attempt for a fmall aug- 
mentation of falary, could not find, among all thofe who re- 
ceived the early benefit of their inftruflion, one to fupport 
their honeft caufe ! At this rate, the ages of darkneis will 
agam commence ; and Scotland will, ere long, be as remark- 
able for wealth and ignorance, as it was formerly for poverty 
and learning. 

Wages A day-labourer has x s. ; a taylor has 8 d. per 
day and his meat ; a fhoemaker 6d. for each pair of ftocs. 
and his maintenance. Servant men have from 4 1. Ios . to 
6 1. per annum, and fervant maids from 2 1. 1 o s. to 3 1. It

is not cafy to calculate the earnings of a common labourer, 
or the expence of his family, for the year. As there are no 
works of any importance or extent carrying on, they cannot 
have regular employment. Though, therefore, a labourer 
has i s. per day, the amount of his earnings at the year's end 
may not exceed 9 1. or 10 1. Out of this he mud pay a fmart 
rent for the miferable hut which helps to fhelter him. He 
muft ferve his fuperior for 1 2 days. His children, until they 
are fit for herding, are a dead weight upon him ; and his 
wife can contribute little to the common (lock •, for (he muft, 
in fome places, fpin fo much to the landlady without food or 
payment ; and (he muft draw money from the poor hufband's 
pocket to purchafe half a dozen of hens and eggs, to be given 
alfo to the landlady as a prefent, or rather as a further token 
of vaffalage. Yet, under all thefe difadvantages, they make 
Ihift to bring lip a family, or to keep them alive. 

Antiquities. — In this parifh are many fortified eminences, 
fuppofed to be Danifh forts. Thefe ftrong holds of the ear- 
ly but uncivilized inhabitants of the country are rude in con- 
duction, and narrow in extent. They were reared without 
lime or mortar of any kind. Stones of enormous weight 
were dragged from a diftance, and up hill 5 and thefe ftones 
were all placed lengthways, towards the center of the wall. 
The dimenfions of one of thefe towers was taken. It is of a 
circular form, a figure which the fituation of the ground 
compelled them in general to adopt. The diameter is 27 
feet, the breadth of the wall 7, and the height 12 feet, as 
far as can be conjectured from the ruins that lie fcattered 
at the foot of it. Upon the whole, thofe wretched retreats 
of barbarity and violence afford a ftriking proof of the 
ftrength and perfeverance of the inhabitants at that early 

period,

period, but none of their tafte or genius ; and, when viewed 
with a philofophic eye, they muft excite, by contraft, the 
moft pleafing fenfations in the breaft of the beholder : For, 
whether they were built by Danes or Celts, or both, they 
imprefs ftrongly on the mind the violence and wretchednefs 
of the times in which they were conftructed ; and muft en- 
dear to the prefent race that fecurity and happinefs which 
they enjoy in a period more enlightened, and under a govern- 
ment better regulated. 

In the ftrath of the parifli many monuments of death ap- 
pear, which, in an artlefs, but ftriking manner, record the 
battles of former times. There many grey ftqnes rear their 
heads in the heath, to mark the graves of fallen heroes. A 
clufter of thefe rude obelifks is to be feen quite clofe to Ge- 
neral Campbell's houfe of Craignifti. This curious collec- 
tion, the General, with a laudable refpecl for antiquity, has 
allowed to ftand unmolefted. Farther up the valley, towards 
the mountains, one of more than ordinary fize was ere&amp;ed, 
to diftinguifti the grave of a warrior, who, as is faid, fell* 
there in the purfuit. Some remains of cairns, or heaps of 
ftones, that covered the graves where the alhes of the dead 
were depolited, are alfo to be feen. This place is reported 
by tradition, to have been the fcene of a bloody engagement 
between the Danes and the natives. In this adtion, Olaus, 
faid to have been a Ion of the King of Denmark, was flam' 
Near the field of battle, there is a little mount or tumulus] 
which is dignified by the name of this hero ; it is called, to* 
this day, Dunan Aula, or the Little Mount of Olaus. There, 
it feems, he was interred ; and not many years ago, as fome' 
workmen were employed in inclofing this fpot, they difco- 
vered, after removing fome loofe ftones, a grave compofed of 
four flags. Upon inking this repofitory, they found aa 
urn. Imagimng they had got a treafure, they broke it ; but 



to

446 Statiftical Account 

to their great difappointment, they found nothing there but 
the afhes of Olaus. — General Campbell converted this mount 
into a family burying place. It is inclofed and planted. On 
the top of it a neat monument is built j and there the Ge- 
neral lately depofited the remains of his only fon, a pro- 
mifing youth of 3 or 4 years of age, whofe death muft have 
deeply wounded the paternal feelings, as he was given to his 
parents at an advanced period, and cut off in the blofibm of 
life. Though it is impoffible to fix the date of the above 
battle, it mull: certainly be very remote, previous, at leaft, to 
the conversion of thefe northren nations to the Chriftian 
faith ; for the practice of burning the dead, if it was common 
in thefe countries, was difcontinued upon the eftablifhment of 
Chriftianity among them. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — This parifli has no peculiar 
local advantage, but it has one in common with others on the 
weft coaft, its convenient fituation for the fiftiing. To over- 
balance this, it labours under fome difadvantages. The fuel, 
which is peats, is fcarce, and of a bad quality. Lime-ftone 
is not eafily procured ; and though it were, they could not, 
for the above reafon, avail themfelves of the advantage to 
any extent. Befides, by the intervention of the point Kin- 
tyre, a commercial intercourfe with the low country is ren- 
dered very difficult and expenfive. To meliorate their con- 
dition in all thefe refpefts ; to promote, at the fame time, the 
profperity and happinefs of the Highlands in general, and 
to raife its inhabitants to that degree of political importance, 
which their local advantages might enable them to attain, 
two things are neceffary, an exemption from the coal duty, 
and a canal at Crinan, to open an expeditious and fafe com- 
munication with the more improved and opulent parts of the 
kingdom. To accomplifh either of thefe objefts, is no doubt, 

a 



of Craignifi. ^ 

a matter of confiderable difficulty j but from the liberal po- 
licy of this enlightened age, and from that fpirit of patrio- 
tifm which is already fo forward to devife and execute plans 
of public utility, it is reafonable to hope, that neither of 
them may prove impracticable, if the public attention is once 
engaged by their importance. To extend the coal tax, to a 
country circumitanced as the Highlands is, may be confider- 
ed as a meafure, at once grievous and injudicious. In many 
places there are few or no peats j in others they are at a 
very inconvenient diltance from their habitations ; and in all 
it requires fo tedious a procefs to fecure any quantity, that 
the people, idle as they in general are, feldom provide enough 
for the feafon; and the leakinefs of the climate • often de- 
ftroys all. This was in a remarkable manner the cafe in the 
1788, when the poor people were obliged, in the middle of 
winter, to come from many of the iflands to the mainland, 
and carry heather from the tops of the mountains. Thus 
circumftanced many are compelled, though at a vaft expence, 
to get coal from the low country ; and more would provide 
in the fame way, were they able to bear the accumulated ex- 
pence of freight, duty, and cuftom-hpufe fees. Indeed the 
heavy freight would render coal a dear article in the High- 
lands, independent of duty and cuftom-houfe dues ; but when 
thele are fuperadded to the extraordinary expence they muft 
mcur from their particular iituation. it is a great grievance, e- 
fpeaally when an infignifica, t duty, laid on at the pit, would 
be more productive, and Ids felt, and when many methods 
of commutation might be deviled.-But it appears not left 
mjud.ctous than gnevous.-Smce the ieparation of the Ame- 
rican colon.es, the attention of the nation has been very wife- 
ly deeded towards the improvement of the natural refourc« 
of the country. The unimproved ftate of the Highlands has, 
?n this view, excited a degree of public fpirit that does honour 



to

to the heart and understanding of many noble and refpedb. 
able individuals. Liberal fubfcriptions have been made ; and 
villages are now a building, for the purpofe of introducing 
arts, manufactures, and induftry, into that deprefled and ne- 
glected corner of the kingdom. But this very patriotic de- 
fign will, in a great meafure, be frustrated, by the fcarcity of 
fuel, or the labour that muft be beftowed upon it. The pro- 
grefs of improvement will be checked, for want of proper 
materials to burn lime j and manufactures, under this parti- 
cular difadvantage, can never flourifh •, for it is well known, 
that meal, at a moderate price, and fuel eafily procured, are 
two things necefTary for their encouragement in this country. 
— A canal acrofs the neck of land; between Crinan and 
Lochgilphead, would greatly improve the above advantage, 
by rendering the provision of fuel more certain, and lefs ex-? 
penfive. And without remarking the benefit that would re- 
fult from it to the trade of the nation in general, in peace or 
war, it muft appear necefTary, in a particular manner, for the 
encouragement of the fifheries on the western coaft ; for 
though this coaft is fo extensive, and the fifhing stations are 
fo numerous, nothing will call forth the exertions of the 
people, with any degree of vigour or fuccefs, but a conve- 
nient market. This, in their prefent fituation, they cannot 
have ; they will, therefore, become the prey of a few greedy 
monopolizers. A few ftores supplied with neceffaries, and 
thefe neceffaries charged at double value, will draw into a few 
hands the profits of the whole bufinefs, and the poor people 
will be compelled to part with the fruit of their labour for 
half value ; besides, that many lives that are loft upon the 
boisterous Mull of Kintyre might be faved. But the neceffi- 
ty of opening this communication, and the encouragement it 
would give to trade in the Highlands and Ifles, will appear 
in a ftrong light, by just remarking the labour and perleve- 

rancc 



of Craignljlo. 449

ranee with which the inhabitants have endeavoured, in time 
part, to force trade with the low country, in their open 
Birlins.— Through the founds, between the iflands and main 
land, they proceed with tolerable fecurity to the coaft of 
Kintyre; but there they are faced by the Irifh- Channel, and 
the raging tides on the point of Kintyre : Juftly terrified by 
this profped, they pufh into Weft Loch Tarbert-there tiny 
unload their cargo, drag the boat and cargo acrols the nar- 
row neck, refhip their goods on the eaftem ftiore, and pro- 
ceed to Clyde. 

Upon the whole, it is to be hoped, that the generous fo- 
ciety who have already made fuch exertions to ra?fe the 
Highlands from its prefent ftate of obfebrify and infignifi. 
cance, will make fome attempt to accomplim the above" im 
portant object It is alfo to be hoped, that every cnlM^. 
ed and hberal fpirit in the nation, wiil co-operate in the laud- 
able defign. And it would be injurious to fuppofe, that g0 
vernment, who are appointed for the fecurity and happinefs 
of the people, and whofe ends are ultimately fcrved by the 
encoura gement of arts and improvement fc ^ ' 

the kingdom, would refufe to mitigate the fait and coal »i»

<p>Sanday and North Ronaldfiay. 
rTHHE extent of the ifle of Sanday is 12 miles long, and 
X varies in breadth from one mile, or lefs in fome places, 
to two or three miles in others. Its form is very irregular; 
and by reafon of its feveral extended points and indented 
bays, refembles a lobfier, as Mr Murdoch M'Kenzie fays, 
who is a native of this country, and furveyed thefe iflands 50 
years ago. The ifle of North Ronaldfhay is about two miles 
Ion,, and one mile broad. Its ancient name is the fame 
with the modern one, as appears from Torfeus, who calls it 
Rinarfeya.-The ifland of Sanday is bounded by the fea; fe- 
parated from the ifle of Stronfay, on the fouth, by a channel 
of a league broad ; from the ifle of Eday, on the weft, by a 
channel of half a league; and, on the north, from North 

Ronald lhay, 



of Crofs, Burnefs, &amp; c . 451 

Ronaldfliay, by a channel from 1 to i\ leagues The ifles 

of Sanday and North Ronaldfliay are both of them low and 
flat, particularly on the eaft coaft ; fo that they cannot be 
feen from the fea but at a fliort diftance, which occafions 
their being fo dangerous to fliipping. When the fpring- 
tides are high, the fea fometimes meets at one place, and 
covers the plain, where flieep and cattle formerly paftured ; 
but this happens but rarely. In many places the fea gains 
upon the land ; and, in a few places, the land gains on the 
fea, by throwing up banks of ftones and fand, which ferve as 
ramparts or dykes againft its future attacks. 

Wtf/^.-Traditions refpefting the incroachments of the 
fea are, jj, That a fhoal, 2 miles from the fliore, on the 
north fide of the ifle of Sanday, called Rinnabreck, was for- 
merly land, and a field where they ufed to play at the foot- 
ball ; 2 dl y That the Bay of Otterwick, (by fome thought a 
corruption of Odens Wick, the Scandinavian deity), on the 
north fide of the ifle of Sanday, now of extent a league long, 
was formerly land, and that it was covered with trees. In 
fupport of this tradition, are mown what looks like the de- 
cayed roots of trees, along the Ihore, only to be feen at the 
lowcft ebbs. How far this tradition is to be credited, is un- 
certam fince Torfeus fays of the Orkney iflands,/^ cannt - 
but, when he relates, the ftratagem by which an expelled 
Count of Orkney, who fled for afiiftance to Norway, reco, 
vered the country from the ufurper, he fays, large piles of 
wood were la.d in every ifland, to be fet on fire upon the

wood, if none grew in the iflands, fince their intercourfe 
then wilh woody countries tnuft have been very limited, as 
thefe Counts difputed the pofleflion of thefe iflands about 
the loth century ? If we go as far back as the days of 
Offian, we find he fays there were woods in thefe iflands j 
for in his poem of Carrie- thura, in which he relates Fingal's 
expedition to affift Cathulla King of Iniftore, or Orkneys, he 
lays, a rock bends along the coaft, with all its echoing wood. 
This is perhaps only a poetical licence ; but, as he. is the 
Homer of Scotland, if we pay the fame regard to the truth 
of his geographical defcriptions, as the Greeks did to thofe 
of Homer, his teftimony is of fome weight. Be this as it 
may, it is certain there are no trees in any of the Orkney 
Kflauds at prefent". 



Soil. — The foil is almofl: every where mixed with fand, and, 
in many places, is entirely land •, and, where this laft is the cafe, 
it ib not cultivated, unlefs there be plenty of fea.ware to ma- 
nure it with. 8o Horfe loads of fea-ware have been fometimes 
carried half a mile, to be laid on a p'ece of fandy ground, 
which produced bur one boll of bear id return. The black 
earth mixed with f,md, and ciay mixed witli land, are the 
beft foils. As a great quantity of corn muit be paid in kind 
to the fuperior, or Lord Paramount of thefe iflands, the 
farmers cannot afford to meliorate the foil, by fallowing or 
by green crops i and therefore it may be thought, that the 
foil is, in fome degree, exhaufted •, for it is agreed, that this 
fca-ware ddd not better the foil beyond the prefent crop ; 
and, by the accounts of former crops, it appears they were 
tetter ; at the iame time, it is indifputable that farming is 
now better uuderftood. The foil cannot be called bad, fince 
it has produced bear and oats, in content fuccc-flion, part the 
memory of man, wh.ch an fctfgli&amp;S or Lothian farmer would 

think 



of Crofs, Burnefs, hfc. 

think incredible. The foil in the ifle of North Ronaldftay 
is alfo fandy, but has a greater mixture of red clay. 

-dir.— The air is rather moift and raw, which, by obftruc- 
ting the perfpiration, often occafions colds The moft pre- 
vailing diftempers are colds, colics, cutaneous eruptions, fcor- 
butic complaints, and rheumatifms, which laft the people 
generally call the gout : All which probably proceed from 
cold and wet clothes. There are fome inftances of the fcro- 
pfrala, or King's evil, and 2 or 3 perfons afflitfed with the 
white fwelling. Fevers fometimes prevail ; and, when they 
feize one perfon in a houfe, they often affefl the whole fa- 
mily. Relapfes are frequent, as they are not at pains to 
waft the bed-clothes when they have recovered—The fea 
ccafts of the ifle of Sanday may be about 1 2 leagues or more j 
that of North Ronaldfhay 2 or 3 leagues. The ftore is ge- 
nerally flat and fandy in both iflands, efpecially on the eaft 
coafts. 



i^.-The fift caught are cod, ling, fcate, holybut j-but; 
the fift rnoft generally caught, and the moft ufeful, is a grey 
fift here called cuths, of the fize of fmall haddocks, and is 
the fame with what on the fouth coaft is called podley, only 
the cuth is of a larger fize. The inhabitants eat them ; and 
they produce oil for houfehold ufe. No fift 0 f any kind, or 
oil are exported to any foreign market ; the people bein- em- 
ployed in making kelp during the fummer fcafon, have not 
t-me for fifting. Lobfters ape ^ 

London market by fmacks ; but none of the peopfe of thef 
t- dlands are employed in catching them, f 0r the reafon- ai- 
ready m o d. The forefaid grey fift arc ht ^

is fometimes, but rarely caught. A variety of fea plants arc 
thrown afhore by ftorms. Sponges are found. — Not many 
fhells or corals. Cockles are found in two places only, and 
in ftill water. — No oyfters. In the ifle of North Ronaldlhay 
they catch feals in nets ; but they alledge the light -houfe 
lately erected there frightens them from their coafts. The 
people there have been in ufe to eat the young and tender 
ones. 

Manure. — The general manure in thefe iflands is the fea- 
weed or ware, which is driven aftiore in ftorms, fo that the 
farmer anxioufly waits for a gale of wind from that quarter 
of the compafs that will fupply him with it, and as thefe 
iflands receive it from every quarter, if the gale is ftrong e- 
nough to break it away from the deeps of the ocean where it 
grows, it always fupplies fome place : but the tides often car- 
ry it away from the fhore, fo that when it comes, every other 
work is fufpended, until it be carried from the reach of the 
fea, which neceffarily occafions the farmers keeping a greater 
number of lervants and horfes than they would otherwite do, 
for if the fandy grounds are not well manured with this they 
give no crop. In the Weft India iflands where they ufe this 
fea-weed, or varech, (as it is there called), they fuppofe that 
the fugars therewith produced, are of inferior quality to thofe 
produced from other manures, fo likewife, the corns raifed 
by it here, are of inferior quality to thofe raifed by cotnpoft 
manures, at leaft the boll weighs leis, although the quantity 
produced from an acre is more than the produce of an acre 
done with compoft manure. 

Kelp. — It is about 70 years fince kelp was firft made here. 
The quantity at firft was inconfiderable, and the price low. 
For 30 years paft it has been the ftaple commodity of thefe 

iflands, 



of Crofs, Burnefsy hfc, 455 

iflands, and by the fuperior Ikill in making it, the quantity 
is doubled. Forty , years ago the price it gave at market was 
40 or 50 s. per ton ; but for 20 years paft, it has given from 
5 1. to 7 1. or even 8 1. a ton, which has greatly ftimulated 
the induftry of the people to make it. It was thought for- 
merly that only the tang which grows on the rocks could 
be made into kelp ; but within thefe 20 years it is found, 
that fea plants of whatever kind can be made into kelp, and 
of equal quality, as well as more abundant quantity, than the 
other, provided the falts are not warned away by rain, for 
great rains render it ufelefs, or, if burnt, produces but little 
and bad kelp. 

There is no ifland in the Orkneys of the fame extent of 
fea coaft, that produces equal quantity with the me of San • 
day. It generally produces one-fourth or one-fifth of the 
whole kelp made in all the Orkney iflands j fo that when 
2500 tons are made in all the Orkneys, 500 or 600 tons of 
that is made in Sanday. Highland kelp is preferred at Li- 
verpool ; but at Newcaftle, and on the eaft coaft of En: ' rod, 
the Orkney kelp is preferred, efpecially by the manufacturers 
of crown glafs. The alkaline falts are what conftirute the va- 
lue of this commodity s and chemifts fay, thofe contained in 
kelp are of the moft impure kind, and not equal to the ba- 
nlla from Spam, produced from the herb call, and there- 
fore kelp fells for one-fifth of the price of barilla.-^o tons 
have been made in Sanday one feafon ; but the ufual or ave- 
rage quantity may be from 500 to 5Sotons.- I2o tons has

Tides and Shoals. — The tide of flood fets eaftward, and that 
Of ebb weftward, with fome variation occafioned by the re- 
fiftance it meets with either from fhoals or head-lands. Its 
velocity on the weft end of Sanday is 6 miles in the hour. 
There is a tide fets on the north fide of Sanday, 14 days in 
one direction. The fhoal of Rinnabreck on the north fide 
of Sanday is two miles from the fhore ; and tradition fays it 
was formerly united to the ifland, and that the people ufed 
to play at the foot ball on it. It has been long an opinion, 
that a light- houfe might be of fervice on the eaft coaft of 
thefe iflands ; and the truftees, by order from government, 
have at laft erected one, two years ago, on the north-eaft 
point of the ifle of North Ronatdfhay, of the height of 70 feet. 
By the report of fome captains, they have already been bene- 
fited by it. Some are of opinion, it might have been of 
more fervice on the Start, or eaft point of Sanday. Time 
will fhow if it diminifhes the number of wrecks ; for in time 
paft, thefe iflands have been as fatal to fhipping, as the ifle 
of Providence, and others of the Bahama iflands in the Weft 
Indian Archipelago *.

* That a light houfe was necefTary will bed appear from the

The moft remarkable are Spurnefs, on the fouth-weft j Elf-

Thus it appears, that from 1773. Co the P refent both in- 

clufive, that is 18 years, there have been wrecked on theie 
iilands 2830 tons Britilh, value 75,5001.— 70° tons Dutcn  va " 
'ue 10,0001—950 tons Danifh, value 20,000k— and 400 tons 
Dantzick property, value 4000 k— In all nearly 5000 tons, and 
above ico,oook value. It is true, that many or thefe veffcls 
were got off and repaired, and the cargoes partly laved ; but 
when the expence attending this is confidered, and the check it 
cives to the fpirit of commerce, and the low prices the damaged 
Soods bring, it is affirmed by fome, that it would be for the m- 
tTereft of the concerns if the whole was totally wrecked. If ac- 
count had been kept of the wrecks in former years, it would, it 
is believed, have equalled the above in the number, and fur- 
palled it in the value loft. In 1740, the Suxc.a Eaft Ind.aman 
of Sweden, was totally loft on the fhoal of Reep-dyke, on the 
eaft Hde of North Ronaldlhay. Her cargo was fuppofed to be 
the moft valuable ever (hipped for Sweden, and, it is fa.d coll 
at Bengal , 50,000 1. Sterling ; in confequence of which lofs the 
aff.irs of the Swedilh Eaft India Company were greatly embar- 
raffed. 1 think it was about the year , 760 the Crown Prince 
of Denmark, Eaft lndiaman, outward bound, was wrecked on 
North Rona dfliay , with 60 chefts of Giver aboard. 1 he money

Encroachments.— It fometimes happens, that in the high 
fpring tides in the month of March and April, when there is 
a ftorm, the fea forces itfelf through a fandy bay on the 
fbuth fide, and fpreads over a low plain, which is not above 
3 feet above the level of the fea, and is as fmooth as the fa- 
mous plain of Runnamede, near Staines, and much refembles 
it, except that it has not the fame rifing grounds around it. 
If the fea disjoins this ifland, it muft be here. The re- 
port already mentioned, of the largeft bay in the ifland 
having been once a wood, and that the fhoal of Rennabreck, 
was once a part of the ifle of Sanday, is all that tradition 
hands down, and affigns no period when it happened. If 
the fea gains fo much on St. Mark at Venice ; if the Good- 
win Sands were once land; if the Roman fleet ufed to an- 
chor on the coaft of Italy, where cultivated lands now are, 
we m ay readily believe, that the land and fea encroach on 
each other, in an ifland like Sanday, fo low on the eaft coaft •, 
ns it is obferved that bays are more frequently formed on the 
eaft coaft, by reafon of the earth's motion eaftward, ,n con- 
ference of which the waters are protruded with more vio- 
lence.

Animals. — The quadrupeds are fuch as are common ; horfes, 
bulls, cows, fheep, fwine, and rabbits. — The domeftic birds 
are geefe, hens, and ducks. — The wild fea fowl, foland geefe, 
fea gulls, auks, and a great variety of ducks. Swans refort 
here in winter, and go northward in fpring.— Wild land fowl 
are, eagles, ravens, c^ows, hawks, pigeons, and other common 
birds. A fmall bird, rather lefs than a fparrow, reforts here 
in winter, fuppofed to be the fame with what is by fome cal- 
led the Emprefs's bird in Ruffia, and is called by the people 
here oat-fowls, becaufe they prey on the oats. Some who 
have eat both kinds {ay, this bird is equally delicate eating as 
the ortolan. Grey plovers are here in great numbers in 
winter. The lapwing comes in February ; and hatches here 
in fbmmer. Thefe ifhnds are not remarkable for breeding 
cattle of any lingular qualities or value. 

Population.— The population, either in the charge of Crofs- 
kirk, or in that of Ladykirk, cannot be precifely afcertained 
preceding 1787. Subjoined is the population then and at

Statiflical Account 



By the above ftatement of the population, in the 3 united 
parifties of Crofskirk charge, it appears, that the population 
in the two pariflies of this charge, which lie in the ifle of 
Sanday, were precifely equal, at the two above mentioned pe- 
riods, the one parifli having increafed two, and the other de- 
creafed two. In the ifle of North Ronaldfliay, the increafe 
is 36 ; but from this we ought to deduct for a family of 9 
perfons, brought there to the light-houfe, and then there re- 
mains 27 increafe from the inhabitants. This increafe is 
probably owing to a greater number of marriages there of 
late years, than is ufually at an average, and confequently a 
greater number of births. 

Population in Ladykirk PariJIj, now vacant. 
In 1755, the numbers were - 750 
In Auguft 1787, by an exact enumeration, taken by the 
late incumbent's affiftant, the number of fouls in this

If it is wiflied to have the population of thefe iflands fepa- 
rately, it only remains to ftate them from the above thus : 
April 26. 1 79** The number of fouls in Crofskirk parifli 
were - 579 
April 28. 1 79 1. The number of fouls in Burnefs parifli, 390 
Auguft 1787. The number of fouls in Ladykirk parifli, 
which is now vacant, were 803 ; and as the above 
two parifhes are precifely the fame as they were in 
1787, we may fuppofe they are nearly the fame in 
this parifli j fay then in Ladykirk parifli, which is 
vacant, ----- 803

By Mr M'Kenzie's map, the ifle of Sanday contains i 9 
fquare miles, and, as there are 1772 perfons in it, this is 
93tV perfons to a fquare mile. If the proportion of the 
feveral parifhes be wanted feparately, it is thus : 
Crofskirk parifh, 7 fquare miles and 579 perfons, is 824 to 
a fquare mile. 

Burnefs parifh, 4 fquare miles and 390 perfons, is 92 * to a 
fquare mile. 

• Ladykirk parifh, 8 fquare miles and 803 perfons, is ioa§. to 
a fquare mile. 

Ifle of North Ronaldfhay, 4 fquare miles and 420 perfons, 
is 105 to a fquare mile. 
By this it appears, that the ifle of North Ronaldfhay has 
the greateft number of perfons to a fquare mile, which con- 
firms the fuppofition ufually made here, that this ifland is well 
peopled for its extent.

Auguft 1787, there were in Ladykirk parifh, 393 410 
As this charge is vacant, the precife population at prefent 
cannot be afcertained. 

By the above it appears, that the proportion of males to 
females, in the f'everal parifhes, is as follows : 

In Crofskirk parifh, April 1787, as 5|f maIes t0 7lf females. 
In ditto, April 1791, as 5|£ males to 7 females. 
In Burnefs parifh, April 1787, as 4^° males to 5^4. females. 
In ditto, April 1791, as 4^ males to 5^ females. 
In ifle of North Ronaldfhay, April 1 787, as 4^- males to 4|£ 
females. 

In ditto, April . 1 79 1, as 5^1 males to 4^ females. 
The whole population of the 3 united parifhes of this charge 
when taken together, were, in April 1787, as 15*^. males to 
1 8|4 females. 

Ditto, in April 1791, as 16^- males to i8|| females. 
It muft ftrike the attention of the reader, that the males in 
the ifle of North Ronaldfhay bear a much greater proportion 
to the females, than in the two other parifhes of this charge ; 
and, in April 1791, are nearly equal. The reafon of this 
may be, that the young men of that ifland have not the fame 
inclination for going abroad as thoTe in the ifle of Sunday 
have, from a notion they entertain, that thofe that leave the 
' SfYand

In this period of 19 years, from I77r to 1789 inclufive, the 
yearly average of males is i8 T 8 -. The yearly average of fe- 
males 1744. The yearly average of both 36. The propor - 
tion of males to females as 23, fay 23 males to 22 females. 
Thefe are the births in the united parifhes of Crofs, Burnefs, 
and North Ronaldfhay, the population of which is 1353 ; fo 
that the births are to the population as 1 to 3744.. 

By the foregoing ftatement, it appears that the population 
can fcarcely be fupported, although there are few that emi- 
grate - r 



of Crofsy Burnefs, &amp; c . 4 fy 

grate ; and there are no ravages from any uncommon difor- 
,ier$. If, in Penfylvania, the population is doubled in '25, 
20, or even 15 years, according to Dr Franklin ; if, even in 
Martinico in 1766, according to Raynal, the births were as 
1 to 30 whites, and as 1 to 25 negroes, we might wifh to 
know what reafons can be affigned for the inferior proportion 
of births in a free and commercial empire ; the learned and 
philofophical will fay, that the fouth is more favourable to 
population, and the means of fubfiftence more eafily pro- 
cured. But may we not fuppofe, that great inequality of 
property, and accumulated taxes, are unfriendly to popula- 
tion. Perhaps the want of fuel in thefe ifUnds is a particu- 
lar reafon ; as Lord Kaimes fuppofes, that warm lodgings are 
neceflary to promote population, which the poor of thefe 
iflands have not. 

The number of marriages for the firft period of 19 years, 
that is, from 1748 to 1766 inclufive, is 179, which is, at an 
average, o T «- yearly .—The number of marriages for the fe- 
cond period of 10, that is, from i 77l to 1789, both inclu- 
five, ,s ,70, which is, at an average, 8 £ yearly. It is 
to be remembered, that births and marriages are com- 
puted only for the charge of Crofs, Burnefs, and North 
Ronaldmay, the population of which is 1353-The number 
of farmers in the ifle of Sanday is 47. The number of farm- 
ers in the ifle of North Ronaldfhay is 44. It muft flrike the 
attention of the reader, that, in fuch a fmall ifle as North 
Ronalafhay, there mould be nearly an equal number of farms 
asm Sanday although ^ . extent or ^ 
-b e a fourth part of the ifle of Sanday. The Weft farms

yearly ; and, that the males baptifed are, to the females bap- 
tifed, nearly in the proportion of 9 to 8, or as 9^ males to

By this it appears there has been an increafe of 5 houfes in, 
Burnefs parifh, and the ifle of North Ronald {hay, from April 
1787 to April 1 79 1 ; and that there has been a decreafe of 
3 houfes in Crofskirk parifh, which makes the increafe on 
the whole only 2. 

The number of houfes in I^adykirk parifh, when laft num- 
bered by the laft incumbent's affiftant in Auguft 1787, were

the other parifhes except North Ronaldfhay, where the po- 
pulation has been increafing ; and there they are rather more

pear there are a great number of horfes, which mufl be kept

two wooden creels, which are fquare and ribbed, and one 
placed on each fide of the horfe, the bottom of which o pens

livercd to the fucceffive tenants, who mud deliver, on leav-

flocking entirely belongs to the tenants. The flocking in 
Sanday, belonging to the proprietor of the ground, is called 

Jleelbow. 

Meafurement and Culture. — The only map of thefe iflands 
is that done by Mr Murdoch M«Kenzie, who furveyed 
them in 1746 or 1747. As his principal intention was to 
furvey the fea-coafts, the area, or true extent of the furface 
of thefe iflands cannot, perhaps, be exactly afcertained, by 
reafon, too, of the very irregular figure of the ifle of Sanday. 
But as Mr M'Kenzie makes the length of the ifle of Sanday 
to be 12 miles, and its mean breadth nearly li- miles, this is 
1 8 fquare miles ; and, by the moft exact meafurement of his 
map, made by the afliftance of Mr John Trail of Burnefs pa- 
rifti, the ifland of Sanday contains 19 fquare miles; and the ifle 
of North Ronaldfhay 4 fquare miles. If then the ifle of Sanday 
contains 19 fquare miles, and as 640 acres EngliCh meafure 
make a fquare mile, then 640x19=125160 acres, in the 
ifle of Sanday. If the ifle of North Ronald fliay contains 4 
fquare miles, then 4 X 64c— 2560.— The quantity of acres 
employed in raifing corn, roots, &amp;c. cannot be afcertained 
with any degree of precifion, as there is no furvey or mea- 
furement taken of the feveral farms, one or two excepted. 
The number of acres employed in raifing cabbages, turnips, 
or potatoes, is very fmall, when compared with what is em- 
ployed in raifing bear or bigg, and oats, which two laft are 
generally in equal quantities, and they alternately fucceed each 
other. In the opinion of the moft intelligent farmers here, 
the arable grounds may be computed at from 11 to 22 acres 
to each plough in the ifland of Sanday. As the farms are 
fmall, and many ploughs kept in the ifle of North Ronald- 
{hay, it is fuppofed there is not more than 8 or 9 acres to a

in Sanday, and 8 acres in North Ronaldfhay to a plough, it

The arable grounds are fown with bear and oats alternate- 
iy, and in equal quantities to each, in the ifle of Sanday. In 
the ifle of North Ronald (hay two-thirds of the arable grounds 
are fown with bear, and one-third with oats. Each houfe 
has a fmall cabbage garden, for rearing from 400 to 1500 or 
2000 cabbages, but there are no cabbages in the fields. Thefe 
iflands ufually raife more grain than is fufficient for the in- 
iiabitantSTand alfo fupply themfelves with beef, pork, mutton, 
and poultry. There is ufually fome bear or bigg, and fome 
oatmeal exported from thefe iflands, except in years of fa- 
mine or great fcarcity. After paying to Sir Thomas Dundas, 
as fuperior. about 30 or 32 chalders bear, and a little oat- 
meal, as feu duties, there is ufualiy exported from the ifle of 
Sanday one or two fmall cargoes of 50 or 60 tons each, or 
from 400 to 800 bolls bear, befides what is fold in lefler 
quantities by the fmall farmers, which cannot be afcertained, 
but is not confiderable. This ifland alfo exports or fells u- 
fually from 300 to 500 bolls oatmeal annually. After pay- 
ing 4| or 5 chalders bear to Sir Thomas Dundas as fuperior, 
and alfo to the proprietor 13 chalders or more as rent, from 
the ifle of North Ronaldfhay, the farmers there fell fome bear 
and meal in fmall quantities, which cannot be afcertained, 
but is not confiderable. 

Advantages and Difcdyantages.— -The advantages of thefe 
iflands are, \fl t That as they are dry and level, the roads are 
never obftrutfed, even by the greateft rains. 2d!y, The ifle 
of Sanday has two pretty good harbours, that of Kettletoft 
on the fouth fule, and that of OtteiTwick on the north fide. 
3 //y, As the fhorcs are flat, with fevcral indented bays, the 
fea ware is lodged at different places, which is convenient to 
the farmers. . 4%, As the fhores (helve by a gentle defcent, 
the" produce more kelp than in many other places, and from 
* 1 ■ this 



ofCrofs, Burnefs, &amp;c. 47 5 

this circumftance, too, the fhores are more eaflly wrought, 
StMy t As there are few high or craggy cliffs in thefe iflands, 
the crop is not in fuch danger in harveft from the fea fpray, 
which is often hurtful in other parts of this country. 

The difadvantages of thefe iflands arc as follows, r/, Al- 
though there is a great proportion of thefe iflands in com- 
mon or wafle grounds, they have, through the fcarcity of 
fuel, been moftly cut up, and confequently produce but a ve- 
ry fhort heath, on which, indeed, the cattle are let out to 
pafture; but it yields but a fcanty nourifhment, and they 
muft be fed with ftraw, until the grafs comes up, which is 
not ufually before June, as the fields are all open, and herd.- 
ing not in ufe till then, idly, There are no mofTes in thefe 
iflands from which to cut peats, fo that the inhabitants are 
obliged to go over to the ifland of Eday, and cut them there, 
which occafions them great trouble and expence. Thofe few 
who can afford it partly ufe coals from Newcaftie, which, by 
reafon of the duty are dear; and therefore they juftly confide* 
the duty as a great hardfhip, fince it fubjeas the poor inha- 
b.tants of the extremity of the empire to the fame expence in 
this, as the rich inhabitants of the fouth, and to pay to go- 
vernment, while thofe of the rich counties of Lothian ami 
Fife are exempted. 3^, There are no ferrymen appointed, 
which is a great inconvenience in going to and from thefe' 
and many other iflands in this county. 4/% There are no 
public or regular markets at which the farmers can fell the 
produce of their farms, or fu PP Iy themfelves with, what they 
want to buy. s th! yi As almoft all the proprietors refide elfe- 
where, the rents are all carried away to be fpent out of thefe 
iflands, and none of it returried either to labourers, or to the 
poor in arts of charity and benevolence, (except 81. Sterling 
yearly from Mr Traill, fheriff-depute of Caithnefs) as would 
be the cafe if they were refident. Cthly, The weights are 

different 



Statijiical Account 



different from what is ufed in other parts of the kingdom, 
and the ftandard of them not exactly afcertained, fo that an 
equalization of weights and meafures would be very accept- 
able to this country. 

Language. — The only language fpoke here is the Englhh. 
The names of places, it is fuppofed, are moftly derived from 
the Norwegian or Tuetonic. This may be judged of from 
the names of places fubjoined. — Tourfnefs, or Torfnefs, fup- 
pofed to be a corruption of Ihorf-nefs. Otterfivick, formerly 
called Odirif-iuick, is a good harbour. Odinf-/kar, the name 
of a houfe. Hilly-how, the name of a houfe, and town of 
land. Rojl, or Roqft t a tide, where the fea ufually runs high 
with ebb. Hecla-bir, the name of a piece of craggy-fhore, 
of a curious appearance. The names of the extended points 
of land are as follows — Spurnefs, Elfnefs, Trefnefs, Lopnefs, 
Stromnefs, Lamienefs, Strankquoy. The oldeft firnames of 
people here are Torfes, Tulloch, Swanny, Muir, Fea. 

Weights  Meafures, fe'r.— Before proceeding to give the 
rental of thefe iflands, it is neceflary to obferve, that a great 
part of the rent is paid in kind •, and that it is payable upon 
the pundlar and bifmar, and that thefe are a ftandard of 
weights peculiar to this country, and have been ufed here e- 
ver fince the Danes had poiTeffion of this country. To make 
thefe weights be underftood by thofe who are only acquaint- 
ed with the ftandard weights and meafures in ufe in other 
parts of Scotland, it is neceflary to ftate how thefe weights 
effeir, and what proportion they bear to the meafures and 
weights of Scotland.— There are two pundlars : The one cal- 
led the malt pundlar, fo called becaufe ufed only to weigh 
malt and meal. The other is the bear pundlar, fo called be- 
caufe ufed to weigh bear only. The malt pundlar is as fol- 
lows 



of Crofs, Burnejs, &amp;c. 477 

]ows — 24 merks make 1 fetting, equal nearly to 32 lib. 
Dutch. — 6 fettings make 1 meel, equal nearly to 11^. ftone 
Dutch. The bear pundlar is to the malt pundlar nearly as 
2 to 3, and has the fame names to the different portions of 
its weight, that is — 24 merks make 1 fetting, nearly equal to 
1 ftone 5 lib. Dutch. — 6 fettings make 1 meel, nearly equal 
to 7^ or 7* ftone Dutch. The bifmar is a fmaller weight; 
and weighs from 1 to 24 merks, which laft is denominated a 
fetting or lifpund. The malt pundlar is ufed in weighing oat- 
meal or malt. The bear pundlar is ufed in weighing bear or 
bigg only. The bifmar is ufed for weighing butter, and o- 
ther things. The accounts of the rents payable in oatmeal 
and malt are kept in meels, fettings, and merks, all of the 

denomination of the malt pundlar, as above -The accounts 

of rents payable in bear or bigg are kept in chalders, meels, 
fettings, and merks, all of the denomination of the bear 
pundlar, as above — The accounts of rents payable in butter 
are kept in barrels, lifpunds, and merks, which two laft are 
ufually paid by the bifmar. It is further necelfary to ob- 
ferve, that a chalder of bear confifts of 36 meels on the bear 
pundlar ; and, as the bear is of inferior quality, and ufually 
weighs only from 1 1 1 to 14 ftone Dutch the Linlithgow boll, 
therefore 1* or if of a meel of bear is ufually equal to a boll 
of meafure, and confequently the chalder will contain 20* or 
2 1 bolls of Linlithgow meafure. But, as this may not be un- 
derftood even after the above explanation, it may be proper, 
1 ft, To ftate the rents of thefe two iflands in the manner in 
which they are paid by thefe weights ; and then to convert 
them into Scotch meafure by the Linlithgow boll.

This, indeed, is not all clear revenue to the proprietors. 
There are high feu-duties paid to Sir Thomas Dundas the 
fuperior; then the land-tax and miniflers ftipends are to be 
deducted, the amount of all which cannot be exactly afcer- 
tained ; but, we may venture to fay, that thefe two iflands are 
not far fhort of 2000 1. yearly value to the proprietors, while

kelp holds its price. It is proper to obferve, that the above 
cannot ftriclly /peaking be called the rent for the land only, 
fince part of the above rent is paid on fome farms for the 
flocking, part of which belongs to the proprietor, and is 
called fteelbow. This flocking is appretiated to the tenant at 
his entry, and he muft pay 10 per cent, or more for it yearly, 
and leave the fame value at leaving the farm but for milch 
cowsthus in fteelbow, the tenant pays yearly one lifpund, that is 
equal to 3 2 lib. Dutch of butter. The whole flocking in the ifle 
of North Ronaldfhay belongs to the tenants, and the fteelbow is 
only on fome farms in the ifle of Sanday. The writer of this 
cannot afcertain how much ought to be deduced from the 
rent for the fteelbow rent, nor will he hazard a conjefture con- 
cerning it. The converfion of the forefaid rent in grain, as 
it correfponds to the meafures and weights ufed in Scotland, 
is as follows, viz. 79 chalders 6 meels bear or bigg of Ork- 
ney weight is at 21 bolls Linlithgow meafure, from the Ork- 
ney chalder, equal to r 66 2 f bolls, or 103 chalders 14 bolls 
2f firlots Scotch meafure; and 136 meels 2 fettings 12 
merks oatmeal, of Orkney weight, at 1 1 • ftone Dutch to the 
meel, is at 8 ftone to the boll equal to 191^ bolls. It i s Ur _ 
neceffary to convert the butter, as 7 lifpunds are allowed to 
the barrel, and the lifpund, as it ftands at prefent, is 32 lib. 
Dutch, that is, each barrel contains 14 ftone Dutch.

exaft price of the pound of butcher's meat cannot be afcer-

price gtven for a cow was 10 s. Sterling. As a good cow here 
weighs ufually about 2 cwt. if we deduft 4 s. for the hide and 
tallow, at the then prices, there remains 6 s. as the price of 
2 cwt. beef, that is, 3 s. per cwt. or 6 d. per ftone of l6 lib

each, if we deduct 6d. for the Ikin and wool, the mut- 
ton would not be above a halfpenny per pound.— Pork. The 
beft ivvine then fold for half a crown or 3 s. ; and, as they 
ufually weigh 60 or 70 pound, this was about a halfpenny per 
pound. Pigs not ufed to be fold. Geefe feldom fold ; but, 
when fold, were 5 d. or 6 d. each. Lambs were then 
fold from 4 d. to 6 d. each. Rabbits never fold. Butter 
was then fold from 4 s. to 5 s. per lifpund, of 32 pound 
Dutch, that is, from ii-d. to 2d. per pound. Cheefe was 
never ufually made for fale. Bear or bigg thea fold from 

2 s. 6d. to 3 s. per meel, on the bear pundlar ; and, as i£ or 
j|. of a meel ufually meafures a boll, according to the quality 
of the grain, bear at 2 s. 6 d. per meel, is equal to 4 s. 2 d. or 
4 s. 7 d. per boll. Bear at 3 s. per meel is equal to 5 s. 6fd. 
or 6 s. i-^-d. Sterling per boll. Oats was never ufually fold 
until reduced to meal. Oat-meal then fold from 7 s. 6d. to

oat-meal at 10s. per meel, is equal to 7 s. i-J-d. per boll. 

Prefent Prices. — Beef. A good cow that weighs 2 cwt. 
fells for 2 guineas. If we deduct 10 s. as value of hide and

bear, at 7 s. per meel, is equal to 1 1 s. 8 d. or 12 s. 10 d. per 
boll, according to the quality. Thefe prices will appear low, 
if it is not attended to, that the quality of the grain is infe- 
rior, as it weighs only from 11 to- .13*, or, at moft, 14 ftone 
per boll. Oat-meal fells from 12 s. to 20 s. per meel, on the

^/.-Labourers are feldom employed in hufbandry by 
the day. When employed, their wages are from 4 d. to 6 d. 
a day, with maintenance. During the kelp feafon, a labourer 
will earn, in that bufinefs, nearly 1 s. a day, without mainte- 
nance ; but they are not hired by the day, but paid according 
to the quantity they make. Carpenters will earn from 1 s. to 
1 s. 6 d. or 2 s. per day. Mafons will earn from 9 d. to 1 s 
3 d. per day, but not maintained. Taylors are paid by the 
pece, but may earn from 6 d. to , s. per day, and maintained. 
Weavers are paid by the yard of cloth, but may earn from

15 s. more than this. Thefe fervants they confider as cheaper 
than their cottagers ; but they are not always to be got ; and 
they feldom engage for a whole year ; and they ufually divide 
the year into 3 parts ; that is, from the 1 ith November to the 
1 ith June, they engage in the fervice of the farmers $ from 
the 1 ith June to the laft of Auguft, they burn kelp; from 
the Iaft of Auguft to the 1 ith November, they engage for

more than if they were to engage for the whole year at the 
above wages. For their work in harveft, they receive pay- 
ment in bear. A woman receives about a boll of bear, a 
man about i£ boll ; and this befides their maintenance during 
the time. The wages of domeftic fervants alfo vary. The 
wages of a fervant-maid is from 10 s. to a guinea yearly, in 
proportion as they are capable. Befides this, they receive

can undergo great labour and fatigue, although they are not re- 
markable for ftrength or fize. It is thought they have a more 
florid complexion than thofe of the other Orkney iflands, 
by reafon of their not having fire in fuch plenty, and that by 
this they can be ealily diftinguifhed ; fo that the inhabitants 
of the other Orkney iflands have the fame obfervation with 
regard to them, as Tacitus makes reflecting .the northern 
nations, M Sanguine plena redundantur Septenirionales The 
people, in fo far as can be judged, are not remarkable for any 
perfonal or mental qualifications, but are not deficient in na- 
tural parts and fagacity. There are fome few that are indo- 
lently inclined, and plead inability for hard labour j but the 
generality of the people are induftrious, or at lead laborious, 
as may be prefumed from this circumftance, that there is no 
place in the county where a greater quantity of grain is raifed, 
or kelp made, by an equal number of people. There is no 
manufacture carried on in thefe iflands, unlefs kelp may be 
reckoned one. They manufacture linen and coarfe cloths 
for their own ufe only. 

Seafaring and Fijhwg. — From being accuftomed to manage 
boats, the people have acquired fome knowledge of the fea ; 
and, if not fond of a feafaring life, at leaft have no averfion 
to it. Although the kelp and grain exported from thefe 
iflands might keep 2 or 3 fmall veffels in confrant employ, 
yet there is not one belonging to thefe iflands. There are 
boats, from 5 to 10 tons burthen, for the pnrpofe of carrying 
peats from the -ifls of Eday, as alfo feveral fmaller ones of a 
ton burthen, a little lefs or more. Thefe laft fcrve for car- 
rying peats, for filhing with, and for crofling the ferries oc- 
cafionally, and alfo for fhipping the kelp. The number of 
boats are as follows :

Oeconomy As in other places, fo alfo here, fome are 

more oeconomical than others. As the method of living is 
a good deal different from what it was formerly, and more 
grain expended, by reafon of the increafed labour in making 
kelp, fome of the old people complain of the extravagance of 
the young, and efpecially of their turn for finer clothes than 
was formerly ufed. If we except a few of the gentry and 
proprietors, all the people formerly came to church drefled 
in their own manufactures ; but now there are few of the 
young who have not fome pieces, and often the raoft of their 
drefs, of foreign manufactures, which is principally aicribed 
to the greater influx of money from the labour in kelp ; fo 
that were this fource of wealth to be leflened or withdrawn, 
there would remain a propenfity to thefe conveniencies it has 
introduced, without tlie fame means to fnpport it. There is, 
however, one happy change among the poor people within 
thefe 30 or 40 years, which is, that there is not one fourth 
part of the fpirituous liquors ufed now as formerly. The 

proprietors, 



49- Stalif ikd Account 

proprietors, fenfible that it wafted the means, and corrupted 
the morals of the people, have endeavoured to check it, by 
fuppreffing the retail of it. Thus, the poorer fort are mo- 
derate from neceffity ; thofe of the higher rank are fo from 
choice.— -There has been only a part of two eftates fold with- 
in thefe 30 years. The Lift fold, about 3 years ago, for 20 
years purchafe of the land rent. The kelp mores were alfo 
fold at 50 1. Sterling, purchafe money, per ton, of what the 
fhores ufually yielded, that is, at 20 years purchafe alfo, flip- 
pofing the kelp to give a neat profit to the purchafer of 50 s. 
per ton only. Landed property was formerly fold cheaper 
than this, which is perhaps high enough, as the farms are, 
and have been, it is generally allowed, too high rented. It 
is fuppofed, that the rents of many farms could not be made 
effectual, if it were not for fome advantages which the farm- 
ers have, by the price allowed them for making the kelp, 
which, in fome places, is 40 s. per ton, or more ; and the 
c ttagers make it for 20 s. or 24 s. per ton ; fo that the farm- 
er has the difference to go to his credit, in payment of the 
]and rent. Without fume affiftance of this kind, the land 
rent would be nominal only, and not effectual ; by reafon 
that it is neceffary to keep a great number of horfes, for the 
purpofe of manuring the land with the fea-ware ; and the 
price of horfes is double of what it was 50 years ago, and 
the wages of fervants nearly treble of what it was then, while 
the advance in the price of grain does not hold pace with 
the expence of railing it ; and befides, there are no fixed 
markets to which the farmers can bring their grain and other 
articles to fale. The people, in general, are well difpofed to 
humane actions. There are few whofe circumftances will 
admit of their performing generous ones, although fome in- 
ftances might, too, be given. The afliflant to the late in- 
(cumbsnt in Ladykirk parifli had bed and board at the houfe 

Of

of the only refiding gentleman heritor \n the hie of Sanday 
for 8 years, without paying any board-wages, although this 
gentleman's eftatc did not lie within the bounds of that parifh, 
and although he had no connedtion either with the incum- 
bent or the affiftant. 

Humanity to the fjip-wncked.— It is alledged by fome, that 
frequent fcenes of diftrefs render the feelings callous, and 
harden the heart againft the fufferings of others. If this 
theory fhould be fupported with refpect to certain places, 
particular facts, or particular profeflions and defcriptions of 
men, yet I cannot think it holds with regard to the treat- 
ment of the unfortunate people who are fhip-wrecked on 
thefe iflands. In no place of this county have fo many (hip- 
wrecks happened as on the coafts of thefe two iflands, as will 
appear from the lift inferted in this paper, and yet in no place 
have they had lefs reafon of complaint againft the inhabitants. 
While the treatment of the unfortunate feamen wrecked on 
the coafts of Cornwall, and other parts of the kingdom, and 
even in many places of this county, makes us lament the de- 
pravity of human nature, and roufes our indignation, it is 
with pleafure we bear teftimony to the conduct of people 
among whom thefe rapacious exceffes have not been com- 
mitted. It cannot be fuppofed but fome of the poor people 
will pilfer wood, and fome other fmall things, but feldom or 
never has any thing of value been taken away except in one 
or two initances. The proprietors or principal farmers on 
whofe Chores the veffels are wrecked, ufually take charge, in 
aflifting the captain and crew, with their fervants, cottagers, 
carts, and horles, in faving what can be faved. Some of 
thefe farmers can raife and command 40 or 50 men from 
their grounds, with horfes and carts fufficient to employ 
them ; and, all thefe under the command of one man, can 

do

do a great deal ; and, as they are alfo in fear of his difplea- 
fure, as well as of the law, they are reftrained from rapaciom 
plundering, if they had the inclination. Thus, although 
fome little pilfering is prattifed, feldom any thing of value is 
taken away. If a veflel is wrecked either in feed-time or har- 
veft, it muft be a great lofs to the farmers to order all their 
labouring fervants to the wrecked veflel ; and therefore they 
charge fometimes pretty high for their trouble ; and their ac- 
counts have been difputed in the Vice^ Admiral's court, but fel- 
dom modified or reduced. The proprietor of the ifle of North 
Ronaldfhay has been twice complimented with a fiber vafe, 
*nd other pieces of filver plate, bearing a grateful infeription, 
from the Danifh Weft India Company, and others, for his 
fidelity and attention ; and this befides ready payment of his 
charge. The owner of a Dantzic veflel was fo well fatisfied 
with the condu&amp; of a farmer in the ifle of Sanday, on whofe 
ihores his veflel was wrecked, that he authcrifed him to fell 
what of the veflel and cargo was faved. Thefe, with that of 
the captains themfelves, are the beft teftimony of the atten- 
tion and fidelity of the people here. One of thefe captains, 
whofe fhip was wrecked in 1774, faid, that, if he was to be 
wrecked, he would wifh it to be in the ifle of Sanday. IT;s 
veflel was run afliore near to the houfe of the only refiJing 
gentleman heritor in the ifle of Sanday, and the captain and 
crew hofpitably entertained at his houfe. 

Means propofed to meliorate the condition of the Poor. — As th; 
.fcarcity of fuel is one of the moft diftreffing things the pon r 
feel, the taking off the duty on coals would tend to make 
their condition more comfortable, although even then they 
could not afford to buy a neceflary quantity of it. 2dly, As 
their houfes are generally bad, this might, in fome menfure, 
be remedied, if the proprietors would give long leafes to the 

principal 



ofCrofs, Bumefs, &amp;c, 495 

principal farmers, at a moderate rent, upon condition that 
their cottage* Ihould be lodged in houies that are comfort- 
able and warm, the expence of which might be fettled 
between the proprietor and tenant, and each pay a fhare. 
3 dly, It would be for the advantage of the cottager to have 
an acre of inclofed ground adjoining to his houfe, for grafs, 
cabbage, and turnip, which alfo the proprietor could make 
an article in the tack to the tackfman, and which the cotta- 
ger might be bound to do upon receiving fome affiftance. 
4 thly, As it is, perhaps, one of the greateft hardfhips attend- 
ing their lot, that after they have worn out their ftrength in 
hard labour, when old age arrives, they are often and gene- 
rally deftitute-. As their children, if they have any, do in- 
deed affift them ; but when thefe have families of their own, 
it is but a fcanty fupport they can give them, fince they have 
enough to do to find the neceffaries of life for their own fa- 
milies and, as the funds for the poor in thefe iflands, are 
not fuch as can afford them an adequate fupply, if any plan 
could be deviled, fimilar to that entered into by the benevo- 
lent and virtuous inhabitants of the Bermudas iflands, for 
giving them affiftance at a certain age, provided they had 
been indutlrious in their younger years, would be for the ho- 
nour of the man who mould promote fuch a plan. If the 
heritors were refiding in thefe iflands, they would fee the 
wants of the poor and the aged, and relieve them. A pro- 
prietor in Crofskirk parifh, in the ifle of Sanday, bequeath- 
ed in 1762, for the aged cottagers that fhould be on his e- 
ftate, b acres of land, appointing the kirk-feffion as truftees 
unon this mortification. This gentleman and his forefathers 
had refided on their eftate in this ifland, for eight or nine 
generations. It is to be doubted, if fifheries, although they 
were encouraged, would be of great fervice to the poor, bc- 
caufe in fo far as has been tried, the fifhing is not common-

ly good on this coaft, and the labouring poor arc, perhaps 
as profitably employed in making kelp during the fumnJ 
'ealon, which is the beft for filhing, and their profits in the 
kelp manufacture arc more certain ; but, what has been al- 
ready mentioned would greatly better their condition ; and 
thefe, and many other things might be promoted, provided 
that the proprietors were refident in thefe iflands, and men 
of generous and benevolent principles. 

Tears 1782 and 1783.— The fituation of thefe iflands in 
1782 and 1783, was truly deplorable. Farms that ufually 
produced 100 bolls oatmeal, did not produce 20 bolls, and 
the leffer farms proportionally deficient. The quality too, 
was in many places as inferior, as the quantity was little. 
The quantity of grain then imported into thefe iflands can- 
not be exactly afcertained ; but from the accounts of the de- 
ficiency of the crop, it may be inferred the imports were 
confiderable, and that ftill the fufferings of the people were 
great. Some of the non-refiding heritors furnilhed fome 
fupply to their tenants ; and thefe iflands received 20 or 30 
bolls, as their fhare of what government gave for the aflift- 
ance of the north of Scotland. The beft afllftance, however, 
•was given by Mr John Traill, a gentleman refident in the 
parifli of Burnefs, in the ifle of Sanday, who was factor on 
the eftate of his brother, then in the Eaft Indies. This gen- 
tleman imported corn, meal, and peafe from Leith, and occa- 
fionally fupplied not only thofe on his own grounds, but alfo 
the people on the other eftates, without any profit, and alfo 
upon credit, until they fliould be able to repay it, which ma- 
ny could not do for fome years. Thus by means of thefe 
affiftances, and the humane conduct of this gentleman, toge- 
ther with the afllftance given by the principal farmers, to the 
people on their own farms, none periflied of want, as was the 



cafe 



• 



ef Crofs, Burhefs, &amp;c. 497 

cafe in the year 1635 or 1636, when three or four thoufand 
people periflied of famine in the Orkney iflands. 

There was, however, very little grain imported into the 
ifle of North Ronaldfhay in 1782 or 1783 ; and this has been 
ufually the cafe in that ifland, even in fome pi' the worft 
crops. This may be accounted for in the following manner : 
1 ft, They generally preferve fome ftock of grain or meal ori 
hand of the former crop. 2dly, They do not expend fo 
much grain as the fame number of people in the ifle of San- 
day, becaufe they do not, perhaps, labour fo hard, either iri 
agriculture, or in making kelp, and confequently require lefs 
food. They have more fheep too in proportion to the peo- 
ple, than are in the ifle of Sanday, and confequently can eat 
more mutton, and therefore require lefs bread. 3dly, Their 
farms are fmall, and their harveft is quickly over, fo that' 
they have a better chance to efcape the ftorms and bad wea- 
ther, by which the crop is often hurt in the laft of harveft. 
The grey fifh called cuths, afforded fome fupply in 1782 and 
1783 ; as alfo a cockle-fand in the ifle of Sanday, where it 
was ufual to fee from 50 to 80 people gathering cockles, iri 
the months of April, May, and June. 

Schools. — Crofskirk charge. The prefent incumbent has 
endeavoured to have fchools in the two parifhes of his charge 
which lie in the ifle of Sanday. About 16 years ago there 
was one in the parifh of Butnefs by fubfcription. There was 
another alfo by fubfcription in the parifh of Crofskirk, about 
4 or 5 years ago, but neither of thefe continued above a cou- 
ple of years. As few or none of the heritors are refident 
here, the minifter has never been able to get a parochial 
fchool eftablifhed in thefe parifhes ; and, as the Society 
fchools are not granted, where ther^is noffirft a parochial 
fchool, one of^thefe could not,. be'obtained. There has been 

Vol. VII. 3 R no

no fchool in the Me of North Ronaldfliay for 25 or 30 years 
paft ; and yet almoft all the young people can read, and u- 
pon examination, appear to be as well acquainted with the 
Scriptures, and the principles of [the Chriftian religion, as 
they are in many places where regular fchools are eftablifhed. 
As the farms there are all fmall, they have a great deal of 
fpare time, and the parents then teach their children to read. 

Ladykirk parifi fchool.— The fchool of this parifh has 
been eftablifhed and continued for 40 or 50 years, or more. 
It is not a parochial fchool, nor is the fchoolmafter paid from 
the heritors and tenants as thefe are. He is paid from a do- 
nation or mortification for this purpofe. The intention df 
the donor, it is faid was, that he fhould teach the children 
of the poor people upon one eftate only ; for the fchool is 
placed on this eftate, at the extremity of the parifh, and he 
has not a houfe large enough to contain many fcholars. He 
feldom has above 6 or 8 fcholars, and thefe are moftly from 
the eftate from which he is paid ; but he does not refufe 
thofe that chufe to come to him from any other part of the 
parifh. He fays he receives no fchool fees ; and his yearly 
falary, as paid from the above eftate is 9 meels bear or bigg, 
equal to about 5 bolls bear.— 4 fettings oatmeal, equal to a- 
bout 1 boll oatmeal. — 12 merks butter, equal to about 16 
pounds weight,— Value about 2 1. or 2I. 5 s. Sterling. 

Alehoufes and Inns.— About 15 or 20 years ago, there were 
a dozen or more alehoufes in the ifle of Sanday. At prefent 
there are in Ladykirk parifh, g 
In Crofskirk parifh, - - 2 

In Burnefs parifti, - - none. 

In the ifle of North Ronaldfhay, - none. 
Thefe 5 alehoufes in the ifle of Sanday retail ale only occa- 
' ilonally. It is the general opinion, that this decreafe of ale- 
houfes 



of Crofs, Burnefs,

houfes contributes to the fobriety, and confequently to the 
induftry and morals of the people. As they do not diflipate 
their money this way fo much as formerly, they lay out what 
they can fpare in buying fine cloaths, which is fure a 
more venial and excufable way of expending it. There are 
no eftablifhed inns in either of thefe iflands, although one 
might be necefTary in the ifle of Sanday, for the accommoda- 
tion of Grangers. The want of them, however, is not felt 
by ftrangers, as the gentlemen and principal farmers are very 
hofpitable, and people on bufinefs or boatmen, are well lod- 
ged at their houfes, and pay nothing.

{County of Selkirk.— Prejbytery of Selkirk.— Synod of 
Merfe and T eviotdale.) 

By the Reverend Mr Robert Russell.</head> 



<p>Extent. 

"^7" ARROW, though inferior in extent to fome parifties 
JL in the north, yet exceeds in magnitude any in the 
fouth of Scotland. Its greater* length cannot be eftimated 
at lefs than 18, nor its breadth than 16 miles. 

Surface and Soil — The general appearance of the country 
is mountainous. On all fides the hills erect their towering 
heads, and foon terminate the profpect. The foil is various. 
In the haughs, in fome places, it is deep and fertile; in others, 
it is light and unproductive. Upon the hills it partakes al- 
fo of confiderable variety. In lome parts, the fides are dry 
and arable ; in others, they are fpongy and fufceptible of no 
cultivation. The tops are generally mofiy, and fit for no- 
thing but paflurage and fuel. The crops are frequently in- 
different. Some years they fcarce repay the labour and ex- 
pence incurred in raifing them. This is occafioned by the 
general dampnefs of the atmofphere, which produces, efpe- 
cially in the upper parts of the parifii, a Iuxuriancy of ftraw,

but hinders the grain from coming to great maturity. In 
dry and hot feafons, which occur rarely, the cafe is other- 
wife : Then the grain is fufficiently ripened, and abundantly 
productive. 

Climate.— The air for the moft part is moift and raw. 
This is owing to the mifts that fo frequently float upon the 
fummits of the hills, and the vapour that is continually ex- 
haled by the fun from the marfliy grounds. It does not ap- 
pear, however, to be unfavourable to health, as the people 
here attain to as great longevity as thofe of drier climates. 

Lochs and Rivers There are two lochs adjoining to each 

other, partly in this parifli, and partly in Etterick. The 
one is called the Loch of the Lows, and the other St Mary's 
Loch. Thefe are noticed in the account of the parifli of Et- 
terick. — The only rivers in this parifli are the Etterick and 
Yarrow. The courfe of the former has been already defcri- 
bed, vol. 3. page 295. The latter takes its rife from St Ma- 
ry's Loch, and after an eafterly courfe of 1 5 miles is abibrb- 
ed in the Etterick, a little above Selkirk. Both rivers run, 
with great rapidity, and fwell to a prodigious height. Small 
falmon occafionally afcend their ftreams ; but the fifh with 
which they chiefly abound are trout of a moft delicious fla- 
vour. 

Mountains and Hills. — The hills are, in general, fleep and 
towering. The moft remarkable are thofe called Blackhoufe 
Heights. The higheft point of elevation, above the level of 
the fea, meafures 2370 feet. For the moft part, the moun- 
tains exhibit a green appearance. Upon fome few, there is 
a confiderable quantity of heath. No rocks are vifiblc 

Sheep, 



5 02 - Statijlical Account 

Sheep, Horfes, and Black Cattle.- The fheep conftitute the 
chief part of the animal productions of this pariiii, and are 
of a fuperior quality, in point of good carcafe and delicate 
tafle. The horfes and black cattle do not rife above medio- 
cnty. Their refpeftive numbers, as nearly as can be ascer- 
tained, are as follows; fheep, 55,000; horfes, 149; black 
cattle, 545. 

Wool.— -The wool is of various qualities. In the lower 
part of the parifh, it is of a confiderably fine texture, and 
fells at the rate of 18 s. the ftone. In the upper part, it is 
of a very coarfe pile, and does not bring more than 6 s. or 
7 s. For a great feries of years, the fheep farmers paid no 
attention to this valuable article. Their chief ftudy was to 
produce a good carcafe, rather than a fine fleece. Hence 
the coarfe black faced kind of fheep conftituted their prin- 
cipal ftore. Of late years, however, their fyftem of rearing 
fheep hath undergone a confiderable alteration, particularly 
in the lower diftrift of the parifh. Induced by the high 
price of fine wool, the farmers in this quarter are gradually 
quitting the old fpecies, and introducing the Cheviot breed. 
For this purpofe, they are at great pains every feafon to pro- 
cure tups of a fine quality. Nor have their laudable efforts 
to improve their ftock of fheep been unrewarded. Some, 
who began early their career of improvement, have trebled 
the price of their wool. Others again, who were later in 
their commencement, have doubled it. But thefe improve- 
ments are folely confined to the farms about and below the 
church. All above remain in their former unimproved ftate. 
Still the old breed of fheep are reared, whofe wool is of the 
coarfeft kind, and little adapted for manufacture. Although 
convinced of the great advantage refulting from rearing the 
Cheviot fpecies, yet the farmers there are afraid to try the 

experiment 



of Varrow. 



experiment, from an idea that their lambs could not fuftaint 
the fpring colds and ftorms to which their farms are fubjecT:. 
That their farms are in a high elevation, and greatly expofed 
to the winter ftorms, and the fpring blafts, is beyond all 
controverfy : But, whether their fears and apprehenfions 
upon this head are well grounded, remains yet to be pro- 
ved. No experiments have been made, and confequently 
no certain conclufions can be drawn. Some, who have had 
a good deal of experience in rearing the fine woolled fheep, 
alledge that they are not fo delicate as many reprefent them, 
and that they would thrive very well in many places where 
a tenacious adherence to ancient maxims and cuftoms have 
as yet prevented their introduction. This being the cafe, it 
is to be hoped that thofe ftoreniafters who have hitherto 
been prevented from rearing the Cheviot breed, by long 
cftablilhed habits or groundlefs fears, will foon furmount 
thefe, and concur with fpirit and vigour in forwarding the 
improvement of the ftaple commodity of the country, which 
tends both to promote the profperity of the nation, and to 
advance the intereft of individuals. 

Birds. — The tame are geefe, turkeys, hens, and ducks. 
The wild confift of the partridge, moorfowl, hawk, crow, 
wood-pigeon, thrufh, blackbird, bullfinch, lark, linnet, and 
the fparrow. The migratory may be reduced to the lapwing, 
cuckoo, plover, woodcock, and fwallow. In fevere winters, 
fwans have alfo made their appearance in the lochs already 
mentioned. x 

Population.— In Dr Webfter's lift in 1755, the numbers are 
rated at 11 80. In this there was probably fome miftake. 
From a furvey of the parifh taken this year, the inhabitants 
amount to 1230. Of thefe, 584 are males, and 646 are fe- 
males. 



5°4 Stati/iical Account 

males. What the ancient population was, cannot now be 
well afcertained, as all the old records were burnt about 30 
years ago along with the manfe. The aged people all agree 
in afferting, that it confiderably exceeded the prefent ; and 
their teftimony is corroborated from the numerous remains 
of old houles. Various caufes may be affigned for this de- 
population. One, undoubtedly, may be imputed to the mo- 
nopoly of farms, which diminifhes the number of farmers 
families. Another may be attributed to the averfion of the 
farmers to rebuild cot-houfes, which decreafes the clafs of 
cottagers. A third may be afcribed to the manufactures car- 
ried on in other parts of the country, which draw off the in- 
habitants from fuch parifhes as this, where they have not as 
yet found their way.

Longevity — In this parifh, fcarcely any perfon ever attains 
to 100 years. There is, however, one inftance of this re- 
membered. A woman died here feveral years ago at the 
great age of 106. At prefent, there are feveral perfons bor- 
dering upon 90, but none exceed it. 



Eminent 



of Tar row, 505 

Eminent Perfotis. — This parifh has given birth to a famous 
military character, Colonel William Ruffell of Afhyfteel, 
whofe heroic exploits in India reflect honour upon himfelf, 
and do credit to his country. One, in particular, deferves 
to be recorded, as it difplays the moft undaunted fpirit, and 
the moft intrepid valour. When Manilla, the capital of the 
Philippine Ifles, was ftormed by the naval and military forces 
under the command of Admiral Cornifh and General Dra- 
per, he, at the head of a felecl party, was the firft man that 
entered the breach, and took pofleffion of the city. Never 
was courage put to a feverer teft, and never was heroifin 
more difplayed. When the arduous and dangerous nature 
of the enterprife is duly confidered, it may well be compared 
to the moft celebrated martial atchievements either of an- 
cient or modern times. 

Mary Scott, " the flower of Yarrow," fo highly celebra- 
ted in fong, was alfo a native of this parifh. According to 
tradition, flie was the daughter of Walter Scctt, Efquire, of 
Dryhope, and was reckoned the faireft and moft handfooie 
woman in the foreft. Hence fhe had a number of fuitors, 
who folicited the honour of a matrimonial alliance with her. 
In preference to all other candidates, fhe gave her hand to 
Scott of Harden. From this marriage there fprung a daugh- 
ter, who was wedded to the eldeft fon of the Baronet of 
Stobbs, commonly called « Gibby with the golden garters." 
From them are defcended the prefent Sir William Elliot of 
Stobbs and Lord Heathfield. A circumftance relating to 
their marriage-contract merits a place in hiftoric records, as 
it ftrongly marks the predatory fpirit of the times. Finding 
it inconvenient to take home his wife, Gibby befought hit 
father-in-law to lodge her for fome time. With this requelt 
he complied, upon condition that he was to receive, for her 
board, the plunder of the firft harveft moon. A moft fin-

gular paction, and highly charafteriftic of the licentioufnefs 
and barbarity of the age in which it was made. 

Farmers. — In former times, the farmers were much more 
numerous than at prefent. Several farms, which were oc- 
cupied by 2 or 3 perfons, are now pofTefled by one man, 
which has occafioned a great diminution of the farmers. 
Their prefent number amount to 40, who rent farms from 
60 1. to 360 1. per annum. 

Agi '-culture. — This parifh is not remarkable for agriculture, 
never attempted, as both the foil and climate are 
dly to its growth. Sown grafs and flax are but rare- 
aifed. Barley, oats, peafe, potatoes, and turnips, are the 
chief crops produced, and thefe but in fmall quantities. The 
number of acres annually employed in raifing thefe may be 
eftimated at 1000. The remainder of the parifh confifts 
wholly of fheep pafture. But what may be the quantity of 
acres it contains in whole, cannot be accurately defined, as a 
complete meafurement has never taken place. Calculating 
upon the number of fheep, horfes, and cattle, maintained by 
it, they cannot be lefs than 60,000. 

Seed-time and Harvc/l.—ln favourable feafons, the farmers 
begin to fow about the middle of March, and to reap about 
the middle of September. Both feed-time and harveft are 
often, however, by reafon of the prevalency of rains and 
colds in this country, much later. April is fometimes con- 
fiderably advanced before fowing commences, and Novem- 
ber is frequently far gone before the crops are all cut down 
and lodged in the barn-yard. 

Imports and Exports. -Ovtmg to the little arable land in

the parlfli, it is unable to fupply itfelf with provifions. 
Hence confiderable quantities of meal of all kinds are an- 
nually imported. But, on the other hand, to counterbalance 
this difadvantage under which the parifh labours, it exports 
yearly an immenfe number of fheep, a few horfes and black 
cattle, and a confiderable quantity of wool and cheefe. 

Wood.— This parilh formerly abounded with wood, info- 
much that it received the defignation ftill belonging to it, of 
Etterick Forejl. But the name is now egregioufly mifapplied, 
as every remnant of the old wood hath entirely difappeared. 
From the great quantities of oak ftill found in the molTes, it 
feems to have conftituted the principal fpecies. The new 
plantations are but rare and frnall. At Hangingfhaw, the 
once beautiful, but now ruinous feat of the Murrays of Philip- 
haugh, there is a confiderable quantity of thriving wood. 
Small clumps of planting are alfo found upon moft of the 
farms belonging to the Duke of Buccleugh, and which, in a 
few years, will be of great fervice to the parifh. At prefent., 
it labours under a great difadvantage, from the fcarcity of 
this ncceffary article. 

Church, School, and Poor. — In former times the parochial 
church ftood in a fituation, and went by a name, very diffe- 
rent from its prefent pofition and denomination. It was fi- 
tuated upon the fide of St Mary's loch, and was filled St 
Mary's kirk. As this is the very weftern extremity of the 
- parilh, it was found extremely inconvenient for the generali- 
ty of the parifhioners. Confequently, about the year 1640, 
it was judged neceffary to alter the place of worfhip, and to 
erect the prefent church, which is about 8 miles to the eaft- 
ward of the old one, and much more centrical for the parifh. 
But although the fituation of the church was changed, that

of the glebe was continued and ftill is, which confifts wholly 
of fheep pafture, and contains at leaft 200 acres of ground. 
The old burial ground alfo remains, and is ftill employed as 
fuch. In it feveral families, both of this and the adjacent pa- 
rilhes, inter their dead. The ftipend, including the rent paid 
for the above mentioned glebe, may be valued at 120 1. Ster- 
ling. There has been no augmentation fince the year 1731. 
At that time it was confidered as a good living. The funds 
for augmentation are ftill very great. The right of patron- 
age is vefted in the Crown.— The parochial fchool is at pre- 
f.nt in a very flourifliing ftate. Englifti, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, land-furveying, and mathematics, are taught 
after the neweft and mo ft improved methods. The falary is 
only 1 co merks Scots, which is a fum by no means adequate 
to the extent and land rent of the parilh, and totally infuffi- 
cient either to fupport the dignity of a fchoolmafter, or to 
reward him for his ufeful labours. The fchool-houfe is in 
excellent repair, and accommodated for lodging feveral board- 
er?. Laft winter, the fchoolmafter had 8 fcholars boarded 
with him. Befides the parochial fchool, there is another fi- 
tuated upon the Etterick river, where the branches of edu- 
cation already mentioned are alfo taught. For this fchool 
there is no falary allotted. The fchoolmafter has nothing to 
depend upon for his fubliftence, but the emoluments arifing 
from the fchool fees, and a guinea gratuitoufly given annually 
by that benevolent nobleman the Duke of Buccleugh. Were 
the other heritors to imitate his laudable example, and thus 
countenance a feminary of learning highly neceflary for the 
place, it would furely be highly for their honour. As they 
are noblemen and gentlemen of the moft refpecluble charac- 
ters, and generous difpofitions, it is to be hoped, t this will be 
brought about upon a proper application to them. The 
Ichool houie is in good order, being built lately, partly by

There are 57 perfons upon the poor's roll at this time. None 
of them are permitted to ftroll and moleft other parifhes. 
They are liberally fupported at their own homes. Every 
perfon's cafe is duly confidered twice in the year, and a fum 
is allotted to them fuitable to their exigency. Befides the 
weekly cohesions on Sunday, the funds appropriated for 
their maintenance are the affeffments upon the heritors and 
tenants. Since their firft inftitution thefe have incrcafed 
confiderably. At their commencement they were moderate, 
owing to the fmall number of penfioners. Now thefe are 
greatly multiplied, and the poor's rates are egregioufly fwel- 
led. Laft year they amounted to 120 1. Sterling. Though 
eftablifhed upon generous principles, and deflined to relieve 
virtuous poverty and diftrefs, yet their benevolent defign is 
in fome meafure counteracted, by the temptation they hold 
out to floth and diflipation. There is reafon to fufpett, that 
many taking advantage of this provifion for indigence and 
trouble, fquander away what they earn, and are at no pains 
to fecure for themfelves a fubfiftence, either when laid upon 
a bed of ficknefs, or fubje&amp;ed to the infirmities of old age. 
But notwithstanding its abufe in fome inftances, it is furely a 
noble inftitution, and reflects the higheft honour upon this 
country, which is attentive to every clafs of citizens, and de- 
li rous that every individual fhould enjoy, if not the comforts, 
at leaft the neceflaries of life. 

Fuel.— The fuel generally made ufe of is peat. In the up- 
per part of the parifh it is of an excellent quality, and found 
in great abundance in the lower it is both very fcarce and 
bad. Upon which account the farmers in this diftricT: com- 
monly make ufe of feveral cart load of coal, which they drive

all the way from Lothian. But thefe as they coft 3 d. the 
ftone by the time they are laid down here, are far beyond 
the purchafe of the poor people. Their fole dependence is 
upon the peat and the heather. 

Land Rent — On account of the rifing prices of fheep and 
wool, the rent of the parifh has increafed very much of late 
years. At prefent it amounts to 7000 1. Sterling. The va- 
lued rent is 31,377 1. 9 s. 8d. Scotch. An immenfe valua- 
tion for a fingle parifh. 

Wages.— The wages ufually paid to fervants employed in 
hufbandry are from 6 to 7 1. Sterling to males, and from 3 1. 
10 s. to 4 1. to females. Day-labourers receive 8 d. together 
with victuals, without them 14 d. Taylors, fhoemakers, 
weavers, mafons, and wrights, earn from 15^0 20 d. per day. 
Wages of all kinds have rapidly increafed of late years, and 
are ftill upon the riling hand. 

Antiquities.— Throughout all the parifh, there are nume- 
rous remains of old caftles, formerly the feats of the feudal 
barons. Their conftruction and fituation highly mark the 
rufticity and ferocity of the times in which they were built. 
They are for the moft part conftrutted upon the fides of the 
hills, in the rudeft and ftrongeft manner ; and have been 
evidently defigned to prote£t the poffeflbrs of them from 
the affualts of neighbouring chieftains and- Englifli inva- 
ders, with whiam they lived in a ftate of perpetual war- 
fare. 

JDi/hdvantages. — This parifh labours under feveral difad- 
vantages, one of which is the diftance of coal and lime, to. 
gether with free-ftone j the former of which are diftant 30, 

the 



of T jrrow. 5 1 1 

the latter 18 miles. Another originates from the diftance of 
market towns. Selkirk is the neareft, and even it is diftant 
8 miles from the manfe. The bad ftate of the roads confti- 
tutes a third. It is only of late years that any attention hath 
been paid to them. Now a communication for carriages is 
opened up the Yarrow river, from Selkirk to Moffat and the 
weft country. Another road is carried up the Etterick river, 
as far as Etterick church; but both thefe, efpecially that of 
Etterick, require' great amendments. The crofs roads are all 
in a ftate of nature, and in fome places are exceffively deep. 
The fnow alfo at times is productive of great inconveniency 
and hardftiip to the ftoremafters in the upper diftricl: of the 
parifti. Frequently they have been obliged to fly to the low 
countries for provifion for their flocks, and after all their toil 
and expence many of them have been cut off. In the years 
1772 and 1774, they fuftained immenfe lofles. Some whole 
farms were almoft deflated by the mortality among ths 
flieep, occafioned by the feverity of the winters. The fear- 
city of bridges is likewife a great drawback upon this parifli. 
Frequently is the traveller, by the fwelling of the 
vers, either obftrufted altogether upon his route, or obli- 
ged to go many miles about, in order to purfue his jour- 
ney. 

Mifcdlaneous Obfervations '.—No particular manufactures are 
carried on in the parifti. Houfehold expences are greatly 
increafed of late years. Landed property feldom changes. 
The beft arable land is not worth more than a guinea per 
acre. Very litrie of the parifli is inclofed. The drefs of the 
inhabitants is much altered from what it was 20 or 30 years 
ago. A fpirit for feuing at prefent prevails among the peo- 
ple. One whole farm belonging to the Duke of Buccleugh 

was

was this year feued out into fmall parcels, upon which the 
feuers are building very neat houfes. 

The people are in general fober, devout, and induftrious. 
None have been banifhed the country in the memory of any 
perfon now living. They enjoy in a confiderable degree the 
comforts of life, and appear to be contented with their cir- 
cumftances and fituation.

<p>Name. 

CARSEFAIRN or Carfefern, compounded of Carfe and 
fern, moft probably derives its name from the fitua- 
tion of the church, which is upon an extenfive plain on the 
banks of Deugh, and which at the time of its ere&amp;ion had 
been covered with Jem. 

Soil, Produce, CSV. — Excepting the plain on - which the 
church is fituated, and a few more very fmall fpots on the 
banks of the rivers, the country is all hilly. The high hills 
are all green — the lower ones generally covered with heath, 
and interfperfed with large flats of mofs. The foil for paftu- 
rage is chiefly of two kinds : The fpongy and wet, which 
yields the moft luxuriant herbage ; and the dry, which is by 
far the moft nutritive pafture. It is reckoned, however, an 
advantage for a farm to have both kinds, and moft farms 
have this advantage. There are perhaps 1000 acres of ara- 
ble ground in the parifh, though feldom above a tenth part 
in tillage. Double that quantity of meadow grounds ; a good

deal of which is cut only once in two years. About re* 
years ago wood had abounded ; now any that remains fcarce- 
]y deferves to be mentioned. Iron ore might be found in a- 
bundance, and formerly iron mines were wrought y but dis- 
continued as foon as the wood for charcoal was exhaufted. 
Were the working of iron to be again refumed, it is proba- 
ble from the expence of coal, and the great diftance to any 
fea-port, it would yield but little profit. Almoft all the 
fprings are chalybeates, fome of which are excellent ; but as 
they lie remote from any habitation, it is probable they never 
will be frequented. 

Air, Climate, and Difeafes. — Much more rain falls here 
than in the lower parts of the county; and as the Situation is 
high, and the grounds in moft places wet, the air muft be 
comparatively moid, yet it is extremely falubrious. Epkie- 
mics are rarely known. An intermittent never was a na- 
tive of the parifh. They are indeed occafionally imported 
by the cattle drivers, when they return from the fens of 
England ; and in a variety of inftances it has been obferved, 
that the difeafe did not make its appearance for feveral weeks 
after the infection had been received. Other fevers here are 
of the flow nervous kind. They appear only among fome of 
the lower claries, and are evidently owing to cold damp 
houfes, want of cleanlinefs, and of proper food. Scurvies 
are little known, though moft of the inhabitants live all the 
year round on fal'ted provifions, which they ufe in great a- 
bundance. The pernicious confequences of this mode of li- 
ving are obviated by the plentiful ufe of potatoes, and other 
vegetables. The rheumatifm, it might be expected, would 
be a prevalent diforder in a cold and damp country, parti- 
cularly when it is confidered, that the fhepherds muft often 
after being greatly overheated in climbing the fteep moun- 
tains,

Cains, be expofed to the piercing air on their fummits, and that 
they often continue wet for whole days and nights. That in is 
not fo mull be attributed in a good meafure to the difcreet ufe 
of warm woollen clothes, particularly the plaid, with which 
every inhabitant of the parilh male and female is provided *. 

State 

* It may not, perhaps, be improper, to take notice of one o- 
ther difeafe which formerly prevailed in this, and (till prevails 
in many other places of the fouth of Scotland, viz. the 
yaws. This difeafe is always caught by infection. The vi- 
rus which fpreads. the contagion, is evidently of the venereal 
kind ; but the mode of receiving it is different in this and in 
the lues venerea. The infeftion is almoft invariably commu- 
nicated by the faliva of the perfon difeafed. The firlf. fymp- 
toms are ufually a pricking pain, with a flight inflammation, 
and fometimes a fmall ulcer in one or both fides of the throat. 
The inflammation often extends over the fauces and uvula. 
The amygdalae, and fometimes parotids, fwell on one or both 
fides. In this ftage of the difeafe, it is impoflible to diftinguilh 
it from a flight cynanche, or common fore throat. Afterwards 
the pain and inflammation, inftead of being removed by the 
means which ufually prove effectual in the cure of the cynanche, 
gradually increafe for feveral weeks or months, by this time 
the whole of the fluids are tainted, and the difeafe further makes 
its appearance on the fcrotum, penis, and fides of the thighs, 
or perhaps more frequently in tumours in the anus, which foon 
break, and become painful ulcers. Red or purple fpots fome- 
times appear on the breaft, or other places of the fkin, and the 
whole habit of body is difordered. Though the difeafe ufually 
begins in the fauces, yet the palate is feldom much injured, or 
the cartilage of the nofe affected, as in cafe of lues when of 
long (landing. The writer has feen no cafe where the bones 
either of the legs or arms were affected. 

The mode of cure is exaclly the fame as in a confirmed hies, 
by the ufe of mercury, to fuch a degree as gently to affect the 
mouth, and for fuch a length of time as may remove every 
fymptom, which will feldom be lefs than fix weeks or two 
months, and ofien confiderably more. An effectual mode of 
preventing it is neither to fup from the fame dilh, drink from 
the fame cup, or fmoke from the fame pipe, which hath b: a

Pnjlurnge. — Though agriculture is yet in a rude ftate, this 
is by no means the cafe with refpect to the management of 
fheep and black cattle. In this, perhaps", the farmers in this 
parifh are inferior to none in any part of Galloway. Few of 
them have lefs than 2000 fheep; and they are attentive to e. 
very method of improving them, and guarding them againfl

very troubkfnme dif'order is removed from this parifh, and 
might fpon be extirpated every where.

the various accidents to which they are liable. The princi- 
pal methods of improvement which have been adopted of 
late years are, flocking lightly ; taking low farms for winter, 
or referving winter grafs in the loweft parts of the fame 
farm; felefting the beft rams, which they often bring from 
diftant places where they can find them, of better fize and 
iliape, and equally hardy felling off the weak ewes in the 
latter end of the feafon, and the fmall lambs either at that 
time or about Lammas. Where the farm is large, dividing 
the fheep into different flocks, which are kept feparate all 
the year round, and changing the rams from one flock to an- 
other ; fending the rams to richer pafture in the winter and 
fpring ; fmearing much lighter than was formerly the prac- 
tice. It is never found advantageous to give up fmearing al- 
together, though it has often been tried. The fheep always 
became worfe, and the wool lefs in quantity, and inferior in 
quality, unlefs the feafon was remarkably mild. 

The farmers here have certainly given lefs attention to the 
improvement of wool than it merits. The only fheep ufed is ' 
the common black and grey faced, and no fair trials have 
been made, whether any other fpecies with finer wool would 
thrive with them, though they are invariably of opinion that 
they would not. Hence the wool is in general coarfe. It 
fells thefe two years part from 6 to 8 s. per ftone, or 26 lib. 
averdupois. The mutton is excellent, and improves in qu^ 
lity till the wedder is 6 years old. They are ufually fold at' 
three. A wedder of this age weighs 10 or 11 lib. averdu- 
pois per leg, has 6 or 7 lib. ditto of fat, and fells at 11s, 
Part are fent to the markets in the north of England in fum- 
mer, but the greateft quantity to Edinburgh in the end of

merly to fwecp away the half of a ftock, but feldom now 
make very great havock. The means to prevent the former 
is to ftock light, and after bad feafons to fell off every one 
that is fufpected. The beft method of preventing the latter, 
is to take the young fheep which are moft liable to it either 
to a different farm, or to another part of the fame farm, 
where the quality of the foil is different. The cure of either 
is never attempted, though there can be no doubt it would 
often fucceed, if the difeafed fheep were obferved on the 
firft attack. The proper cure of the rot would be fait mar- 
fhes, or houfe feeding. The ficknefs is an inflammation of the 
inteftines, and ought certainly to be treated by bleeding, in- 
jections, and warm fermentation. 

In one or two farms a difeafe alfo prevails termed the 
vanquijh. It arifes from feeding on dry barren mofs, void of 
all nourifhment, to which the creatures are fo attached, that 
they will never leave it till they die of emaciation. In this 
difeafe the horns ufually become red. This difeafe almoft 
conftantly proves fatal, nnlefs the fheep are removed to the 
low grounds, and put on better pafture, which always ope? 
rates a cure. 

Another difeafe very common on fome farms is termed 
the gripping. This is evidently a paraletic or nervous affec- 
tion, where one or more of the limbs, or fometimes the whole 
body is affected. It might probably be cured by laudanum. 
The cold bath is often ufed with advantage. 

The fturdy or hydrocephalus is alfo a well known difeafe 
among the fheep. It admits of no cure but cutting and ta- 
king out the water, which fometimes proves fuccefsful, even 
when performed by the coarfe hand of the fhepherd, with no 
other inftrument than a common knife.

The farmers in this parifh are alfo well Jkilled in the ma« 
! nagement of black cattle, and breed great numbers of them. 

They never attempt to raife them of a large fize j but are 

very attentive to the fhapes both of bull and cow, and ac- 
j cordingly rear them very handfome. It is a well known fact* 

that in muir farms where the pafture is coarfe, a fmall cow 
i will not only give as much milk, but even breed as good a 
! calf as one much larger. By a little more attention to the 

breed of horfes, which they now begin to pay, they might 
(produce fome of the hardieft and moft ferviceable for riding 

or light carriage of any in Scotland*

conveniences, and fome of the luxuries of life ; favoured 
with many intervals of leifure without enticements to diffipa- 
tion, they have been careful to cultivate their minds; they 
Ipleafe themfeives with rural or innocent focial amufements, 
of which they are extremely fond ; and, upon the whole, 
appear to be in that middle ftate betwixt opulence and want, 
:barbarity and refinement, which is perhaps of all others moft 
ifavourable to happinefs. Pride, envy, and ambition are, per- 
haps, the moft prevalent vices : Sobriety, induftry, and hofpi- 
jtallity the moft diftinguifhing virtues. The writer of this

By the Reverend Mr William Smith.</head> 



<p>Name and Jppearance. 

THE name of Bower, as of moft places in this country, 
feems to be derived from the Danifh language, and is 
faid to denote a valley, (or what in Scotch is called a carfe). 
The parifh is 7 miles in length, and 3 in breadth. The cul- 
tivated land is, in general, a long extended vale from weft to 
eaft, formed by a gently rifing ground on the north and 
fouth, but interfered about the centre by a ridge of green 
hill, running from north to fouth throughout the whole 
breadth, which afterwards being directed eaftward, is the 
boundary between Bower and Watten. 

This parifh is, in general, flat and low lying; and, like the 
reft of the {hire of Caithnefs, can hardly be faid to have hills 
in it. On the above mentioned ridge of rifing ground, 
which almoft equally divides the parim, betwixt Bower Tower 
and Brabfter, to the weft of the kirk, is a large ftone, about 
8 feet above ground, called Stone Lnde or Lutt, perhaps from 
a great man Liotus, mentioned by Torfaeus, who is faid to 
have refided in this neighbourhood ; or from Loda, and may 
have been a place of Pagan wOrfhip. Befides feveral tumuli,

or heaps of flones, fuch as the Crofs of Bower, the Cairn of 
Heather Cow, the Cairn of Ufhally, and many others, filia- 
ted on every eminence in the parifli, and in the country in 
general. Some make Ludgate to denote Lord's gale, and fo 
called as it leads to St Paul's at London. 

The Cairn of Heather Cow is furrounded by 6 or 7 circles, 
defcribed at different diftances around by large ftones fet on 
edge, and feems to be fome monument of Druidical antiquity. 
It is fituated about an Englifli mile fouth from the kirk, from 
which the ground rifes by a gradual afcent, till it terminates 
in a round top. On this eminence, which is the higheft 
ground in the parifli, there is a circular building of ftones, 
about 9 feet in diameter, and 4 or 5 feet high, afcending by 
2 or 3 fteps, like a ftair, on one fide. From it there is a 
very extenfive profpeft of the country, and part of every pa- 
rifli in it. In a clear day, we may here have a view almoft 
of the general outlines of the country : Of the hills which 
feparate Sutherland and Caithnefs ; of the Strathnaver hills ; 
of part of the North Sea and Pentland Frith ; fome of the 
Orkney Hies ; and the entrance mto the Murray Frith at 
Riefe Bay. From this hill and its environs moft of the fuel 
of the parifli is taken ; and of it there is great abundance. 

Soil and Produce. — Moft of the commons in this parifli are 
covered with green, and may be very eafily converted into 
good arable land. But, by the manner of cultivating them 
hitherto in patches, and by building fmall cottages on them, 
there is no very valuable acquifition of arable land obtained, 
and the pafture ground is much diminifhed — The arable land 
confifts of various kinds of foil, but principally ftrong clay 
and loam, and might be much improved by draining the low 
and marihy grounds. — The grains chiefly cultivated here are 
bear and oats, but moft of the latter ; and it is believed, that 



~of Bower o 



5 2 3 



* greater quantity of oat-meal is brought to the market from 
this than almoft any parifh in Caithnefs. The quantity of 
viftual fold annually by the proprietors alone, out of their 
rents and farms, will be upwards of 2000 bolls.— The parifh 
is divided at prefent among fix proprietors, two of whom re* 
fide in it. 

Rent and Services.— The. valued rent of the parifh is 2761 U 
1 6s. Scotch; the real rent about 1500 1. Sterling; and 
would, no doubt, be much advanced, if the farmers had 
fufficient encouragement to improve and inclofe their poflef- 
fions, by getting leafes, and by being exempted from tbe fer- 
vices and cuftoms which are ftill more or lefs exacted almoft 
every where in this parifli, according to ancient practice ; 
though, in many places, fome of them are converted into 
money, and not unlimited as formerly. Benjamin William- 
fon, younger of Bannefkirk, feems to have done moft in 
abolifliing the fervitude on part of his eftate in this parifh, 
and has further encouraged fome of his tenants, by giving 
leafes of 19 years. The converfion of fervices has hitherto 
been gradual and progreflive ; and perhaps the moft advife. 
able plan, for the prefent, is to exact victual rather than 
money for them, as the poor people are frequently at a lofs 
in turning their commodities into money to the beft advan- 
tage, and are bad oeconomifts of it when they have got it. 
In the firft ftage -of fervitude it was unlimited, the people 
being obliged, upon any occafion, and at any time, when 
called upon, to come out to their mafter's work ; and the 
fervice performed was executed in the moft flovenly and fu- 
perficial manner poffible. Befides the unprofitablenefs of" 
this fcheme, it was moft pernicious in a moral view, as it laid 
a foundation for every indolent and difhoneft habit. In the 
next ftage, a pajtial limitation and reftriction took place ; 

and 



5 2 4 Siatiflical Account 

and a certain piece of work was agreed upon ; which being 
known, was executed more fpeediiy, and was all in favour of 
the active and induftrious, as they had more the command 
of their time, and might apply themfelves with more fucccfs 
to the management of their own affairs. 

Former and Prefent State compared. — A proprietor let a cer- 
tain fmall extent of land to his tenants, for winch he received 
the greater part of his rent in victual, and a very (mall ac- 
knowledgment in money, (fpecie being then very rare in the 
country), in name of grofs rent. The tenants of this de- 
fcription were bound to pay the following fervices : 'filling, 
dunging, fowing, and harrowing, a part of an extenfive farm 
or mains, in the proprietor's natural polTeffion. They pro- 
vided a certain quantity of peats for his fuel, carried feal and 
divot, thatched a part of his houfes, and furnifhed fimmons 
for that purpofe, as well as for fecuring his corns in the barn- 
yard : They weeded the land, led a certain quantity of mid- 
den feal from the common for manure to his farm : They 
mowed, made, and ingathered his hay, the fpontaneous pro- 
duce of the meadow and marfhy grounds : They cut down, 
ingathered, threfhed out in part, manufactured, and carried 
to market, the growth of this farm. Befides thefe fervice-, 
the tenants paid in kind the following articles, under the 
name of cuftoms, viz. ftraw-cazzies, which were ufed as 
lacks for carrying victual ; fide ropes, made" of hair, for 
drawing the plough-halters ; flofs or reeds^ ufed for thefe and 
fimilar purpofes ; teathers made of heather ; ftraw for thatch, 
ckc. Befides thefe, the tenants wintered a beaft or more 
each, according to the extent of his pofTeffion, paid vicarage, 
or fmall teind, meat lamb, wedder, or more, hawk, hen, and 
eggs, out of each houfe, with more poultry, according to the 
extent of their farms ; meat and teind gcefe, meat fwine,

Highlands paid veal, kid, butter, and cheefe, &amp;c. And te- 
nants on the Tea c'oaft paid teind and quatel fifh, and oil, out 
of each boat belonging to them, and carried fea-ware for 
manuring the proprietor's farm. Amongft other articles of 
rent, the parfonage, or great teind, being the tenth fheaf of 
the tenant's produce, was alfo till lately drawn in harveft by 
the proprietor in fome few places in the country. They alfo, 
in general, fpun a certain quantity of lint for the landlady, 
who likewife had from them a certain portion of wool annu- 
ally. — All thefe different payments obtained generally in the 
county of Caithnefs 30 or 40 years ago. Of late, they have 
been converted, in many places, by fome proprietors in the 
country, into money or victual, or not exacted. The abfence 
of proprietors from their eftates, which, in that cafe, were let 
to great tackfmen, or to factors, in fome inftances, has pro- 
moted the converfion ; while others, from entertaining dif- 
ferent views of their intereft, whether prefent or abfent, have 
continued to exact the above payments, lefs or more, accor- 
ding to ufe and wont. In the country, in general, within 
the laft ten years, a different and more approved fyftem of 
farming has begun to be practifed in many places ; and men, 
being convinced of the fuperior advantages of it, it will, no 
doubt, in a few years univerfally prevail ; in confequence of 
which, the wages of fervants, and the price of provifions, 
have confiderably rifen in value, and will continue to '\o fo. 
At the period above mentioned, the wages of a man-fe?vant 
employed in farming were about 1 2 1. Scotch, or 1 1. oter- 
ling, per annum, with 5! bolls victual, half barley-meal, and 
half oat-meal ; of a woman or boy, half of the above. At 
prefent, the man-fervant has about 3 1. Sterling, with 6 or 7 
bolls of victual ; the others half of that. A day-lwbourer's 
wages may be eftimated about 6d. Ok 8 d. without meat.;

but there is feldom work performed in this way The price 

of beef, mutton, and pork, is at prefent, at an average, about 
2 d. per lib. ; of a goofe, 1 s. 2 d. ; poultry, 4 d. each ; which 
is double, in fome inftances treble, their value, at the period 
above mentioned. Butter, of 24 lib. to the ftone, 10 s. ; 
and cheefe, 4 s. per ftone. — At the period above mentioned, 
moft of the wearing apparel ufed by the people in the coun- 
try confifted of coarfe woollen fluffs of their own manufac- 
ture, on which they beftowed no very expenfive dye. This 
cloathing, though lefs elegant and gaudy than the prefent 
fafhion, fufficiently anfwered the purpofes of decency and 
warmth, and was accounted fully adequate to the fituation 
and circumftances of the inhabitants. Of late years, by the 
extenfive importation of cloths, of various kinds, from the 
fouthern parts of Scotland, and from England, the home 
manufactures of woollen fluffs, at leaft, have been much dif- 
couraged, and almoft laid afide — The cultivation of flax, 
and the weaving of linen cloths, however, feem to be daily 
more and more increafing in the country. 

Condition and Manners. — The inhabitants of the country 
in general, efpecially of the lower ranks, live on a very fpare 
and fcanty diet, and perhaps much lefs comfortably than 
formerly, the profits of their labour being principally ex- 
pended in purchafing fineries, of which they are exceffively 
fond. By the number and vigilance of revenue officers, and 
by the high duties lately impofed, the manufacturing of malt, 
and brewing of beer, is much difcouraged and prevented ; 
and, as to fpirituous liquors, the encouragement given by the 
legiflature to the erecting of a number of fmall diftilleries, 
feems to be very unfavourable both to the health and morals 
of the lieges, efpecially on account of the confumption in 

public 



of Bower.

public meetings, or at markets and country fairs, which are 
very frequent in Caithnefs. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants in this parilh 
were, in 1755, 1287 on 23d February 1 791, as follows : 

Examinable perfons 6 years and upwards, 

Males, 639 
Females, 744 

1383 examinable. 

Under 6 years of age, — Boys, 105 

Girls, 104 

209 children. 

In all, J 592 fouls. 

The people are all of the eftablifhed Church, except 20 
or thereabouts, who attend the Antiburgher Seceder Meet- 
ing-houfes in Wick or Thurfo. The firft fettlement of the 
Seceders in Caithnefs was in Wick about 20 years ago. The 
caufe of their difaffedlion, they fay, is principally on account 
of the moral doctrines preached up by the eftablifhed clergy, 
whom they accufe of placing too much weight on the prac- 
tice of morality. 

Church and Poor. — In the parilh of Bower, the number of 
people at prefent on the poor's roll are about 35, who 
receive only about 2 s. 6 each, at an average, per annum, 
out of the weekly collections at the kirk, the contributions 
being, in general, very trifling ; but, on particular occafions, 
in collecting for individuals who have fallen into diftrefs, the 
country people, in proportion to their circumftances, fliow 
themfelves very liberal.— The ftipend is 4 chalders of vi&amp;ual,

and 600 merks money, with 100 merks for corimunion ele- 
ments; being 38 1. 17 s. 9-fd. Sterling, befides the victual. 

School. — The fchoolmafter's falary is 1 chalder, or 16 bolls 
oat-meal. The fchool here was formerly one of the moil 
flourifliing in Caithnefs ; but, for 1 2 years paft, has had no 
legally qualified teacher. Mr Alexander Miller merchant in 
Thurfo, beftows 5 1. a year on a private fchool in this parifh 
for teaching poor children.

<p>Situation and Name. 

THESE parities have, for a great number of years, been 
united, or perhaps never were two diftinct parifhes. 
For a long time they have had the names which they at pre- 
fent bear. The track of land which ftretches around Kirk- 
wall, and which forms the country parifh, under the name of 
St Ola, was, in all probability, a parifh before the town was 
built, and derived that name ; but at what period, or on 
what occafion, it is uncertain, from Olaus or Olave, a faint, 
'and alfo perhaps a King of Norway. Near the center of 
that parifh ftands the ancient burgh of Kirkwall, built in a 
narrow ftrath, extending from the Harbour of Kirkwall, on 
the north, to the Bay of Scalpa, on the fouth, which are 
about two miles diftant from each other. The direilion of 
the town is in that of the ftrath. It is wafhed on one fide 
by the fea, which forms the Road of Kirkwall ; on the other 
by a pleafant inlet of the fea, which flows by the back of the 
gardens at high water : It is near an Englifh mile in length j 
its breadth is very inconfiderable j and it has only one ftreet, 
Vol. VII. 3 X firetching 



53° Stati/lical Account 

ftretching from end to end, very inconvenient from its nar- 
rownefs, as well as from the badnds of its pavement ; and, 
towards this ftreet, the ends or gables of the houfes are ge- 
nerally placed, which gives the town rather an aukward ap- 
pearance. The time when, and the perfons by whom this 
place was founded, are both of them loft in the darknefs of 
antiquity. If credit is to be given to the Poems of Offian, 
to the time when they are thought to have been written, and 
to the interpretation that has been given of them, it was of 
confiderable note at a very early period. This was perhaps 
the Carricthura of that juftly celebrated work, where was 
the Palace of Cathulla King of Inniftore, which was be- 
lieged by Trothal, on account of an indignity which he ima- 
gined he had received from that Prince, and which was af- 
terwards delivered by Cathulla's good friend and ally the 
tnighty Fingal. The Danes, we are informed, called it Kirk- 
ivog, which both Buchanan and Forfeus improperly thought 
fhould have been written Cracoviaca; and that this word 
had firft been corrupted into Circua, and thence to Kirkwall. 
But all thefe words are faid to fignify the fame thing, name- 
ly, Kirkvaa or Kirkwaa, the Great Church, or perhaps the 
Church of St Magnus. — The number of houfes it contains 
amounts to about 300; and, though it be the common prac- 
tice for one family only to occupy a houfe, yet it fometitnes 
happens that a houfe lodges two, or even more families. 
Many of thefe houfes bear ftrong marks of old age, as the 
doors and windows are very fmall, the walls uncommonly 
thick, and almoft all the apartments narrow, gloomy, and 
irregular. To this form, however, there are alfo many ex- 
ceptions ; for fuch of them as have been lately repaired or 
rebuilt, and particularly fuch new ones as have been ere&amp;ed, 
may, both for elegance and conveniency, compare with thofe 
of any other town of the fame extent in Scotland. 

Cathedral, 



cf Kirkwall and St Old, 53 1 

Cathedra/.— The Cathedral of St Magnus, the King's 
Caftle, and the Bilhops and Earl's Palaces, are the only- 
buildings here that are any ways remarkable. The firft of 
thefe is a large Gothic pile, reared by the fuperftition of the 
dark ages, nearly in the fame form and dimenfions with many 
others in different parts of the kingdom. Rognwald, Count 
of Orkney, we are told, laid the foundation of it in the year 
1 138. Bilhop Stewart, who lived in the time of King 
James IV. made an addition of three pillars or arches to the 
eaft end of it, with a window, which, for grandeur and 
beauty, is far fuperior to any others in the fabric ; and Ro- 
bert Reid, the laft Popifh Bilhop of this fee of Orkney, 
added three pillars to the weft end of it, which were never 
completely finifhed, which, in point of elegance, are much 
inferior to the former. The length of this ftately fabric, on 
the omfide, is 226 feet ; its breadth 56 ; the height of the 
main roof is 71; and, from the level of the floor, to the top 
of the fteeple, is 133 feet. The roof is fupported by a row 
of 14 pillars on each fide, befides four, the moft magnificent 
of the whole church that fupport the fteeple. In it there is 
an excellent chime of bells, which, by the infeription upon 
them, appear to have been made by Robert Borthwick, in 
the Caftle of Edinburgh, 1528 ; and they were furnifhed 
to the Cathedral by Bilhop Robert Maxwell. The window- 
in the eaft is 36 feet high, by 12 broad, including a circular 
rofe window, at the top 12 feet diameter. There is a win- 
dow in the weft end fomewhat fimilar, but much fmaller ; as 
alfo a rofe window on the fouth gable of the crofs, of like 
form and dimenfions with that on the top of the eaft window. 
The circumference of the pillars that fupport the roof is 15, 
and that of thofe on which the fteeple ftands is 24 feet nearly. 
This church is built of free ftcne, cut both 00 the out and 
infide, covered at prefent with grey flatej and is certainly the 

moft 



S3 2 Staiiftical Account 

moft entire one in Scotland, St Mungo's at Glafgow not ex- 
cepted ; in which ftate it has been preferved by the judicious 
management of the kirk-feflion, out of the feat rents, and 
other trifling funds, without any the leaft expence to either 
the town or the country heritors. 

Cajlle and Palaces — Oppofite to the Cathedral of St Mag- 
nus, on the weft fide of the ftreet, flood the King's Gaftle of 
Kirkwall. Time, and the ravages of war, have long fince 
laid it in ruins. No tradition remains by whom it was 
founded ; though it is probable, as Wallace obferves, from a 
ftone placed in the wall next the ftreet, on which there was 
leen, even in his time, engraven the mitre of a Biftiop with 
his arms, that it has been built by fome Bifhop of Orkney. 
The walls of it are very thick the dimenfions are large ; 
and the ftones with which it is conftrucled are fo firmly 
cemented together, that it is more difficult to dig them from 
the rubbifh of it in which they are buried, than it would be 
from a quarry. This fortrefs feems to have been in good 
repair, and a place of no inconfiderable ftrength, in the days 
of Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney. This man was fon of 
Robert Stewart, natural fon of King James V. who, in 1581, 
was created Earl of Orkney. His fon Patrick, who was a 
man of a haughty turn of mind, and of as cruel a difpofition, 
committed many atfs of oppreflion againft the people, and 
of rebellion againft his Sovereign ; and, in order to fcreen 
himfelf from the punifhment he fo juftly deferved on that 
account, he took refuge in the Caftle, which he maintained 
with much defperate valour for fome time againft the King's 
troops, till it was at laft taken and demolished. This fame 
Earl had built that exrenfive and elegant manfion on the eaft 
• fide of the town, known now by the name of the Earl's 
Palace. From the date above the principal door, which is 
■ H s ftift 



cf Kirkwall and St OJal 533 

Hill legible, it appears to have been built in 1607, and indi- 
cates much vanity in the founder ; for there are engraves 
on ftones, on many parts of it, the capital letters P, E, O, 
the initials of his name and dignity. This Palace has walls 
remarkably well built, though only of grey ftone. They are 
at prefent as ftraight as if they had been erected only 20 
years ago ; and there are on feveral parts of the building, 
particularly on the corners, projections of hewn ftone, in the 
form of turrets, but, in fa£t, balcony windows. One very 
fpacious and elegant hall is the chief part of the manfion : 
Its dimenfions are 58 feet long, 20 broad, and 14 high. 
There is a very large chimney on the fide, and a lefler one 
on the north end of it. A fine Gothic window, 1 2 feet by 
13, lights it from the fouth ; and, on the eaft, there are no 
fewer than two, not much different in form, and 1 2 feet by 
1 2 each of them. The building, though confiderably long, 
confifts of only two ftoreys, which renders it lels pleafant to 
the eye, and gives it rather a mean appearance. The ground- 
floor is divided into a great many vaults or cells, with little 
flits of windows •, and this circumftance muft have them made 
hot only dark, but damp ; and, of confequence, if ever they 
were inhabited, very inconvenient and difagreeable habita- 
tions. Near the door, which is entered from the north, is 
the bottom of a beautiful ftair, which, by three flights of 
fteps, leads to the hall 5 below which is a well built of cut 
free ftone, and furnifhed with water by leaden pipes under 
ground, from the high land to the eaft of Kirkwall. Like 
other fabrics reared at the fame period, variety feems to have 
been more ftudied here than uniformity. For a long time 
paft, it has been unroofed ; and no perfon has dwelt in it 
fince Dr M'Kenzie was Bifliop of this place, who died in 
1688. 

Almoft 



534 



Statiftical Account 



Almoft adjoining to this ftands the ruin, denominated the 
Bifhop's Palace, of much greater antiquity ; for neither re- 
cord, nor even tradition, has ventured to aflert any thing re- 
quelling either the time or circumftances of its foundation. 
So long ago as 1263, the year in which Haco, King of Nor- 
way, undertook an expedition againft Alexander III. King of 
Scotland, on account of a difpute that had arifen about the 
Weftern Iiles, it would appear to have been a place of confe- 
quence. This Monarch, on returning from the mouth of 
the Clyde and the Highlands of Argylefhire, where he had 
fpent the fummer in waging war with the Scotch, with little 
fuccefs, refolved to winter in Orkney ; and, for this purpofe, 
ftationed his fhips in the harbours about the main land, and 
he himfelf took up his quarters in Kirkwall. Here he kept 
court in a hall in the Bifhop's Palace for fome time, till, 
worn out with difeafe, occafioned perhaps by difappointmenr, 
and the fatigues of his unfuccefsful campaign in the fouth, 
he expired, after a lingering illnefs, and was interred with 
much pomp in the Cathedral Church of Kirkwall, near the 
fteps that lead to the fhrine of St Magnus, Earl of Orkney. 
Bifhop Reid repaired, we are certain, or, more properly, re- 
built feveral parts of this ancient manfion; for, on more 
than one place, there are to be feen, engraven on ftones in 
the wall, the firft letters of his name, and below them his 
arms and his mitre. The whole of that round tower, to the 
north-weft, was raifed by him ; and, on the fide that looks 
to the town, there is a fmall nitch in the wall, occupied, even 
at prefent, by a rude ftone ftatue of that very celebrated Pre- 
late. Near to this Palace, on the weft, this beneficent 
churchman mortified to the town of Kirkwall a piece of 
ground, for the purpofe of building a college, for inftrucling 
youth in grammar and the various branches of philofophy, 

with a very confiderable fum of money, for carrying his 

pious 



of Kirkwall and St Ola, 



535 



pious defign into effed : But his death, which unfortunately 
happened foon after, on his returning from France, where 
he had been witneffing Queen Mary's marriage with the 
Dauphin, prevented any part of this excellent plan's being 
carried into execution. 

Private Houfes.—No marks can be obferved of the town's 
being ever of greater extent than it is at prefent ; nor are 
there any houfes in it uninhabited nor fallen into ruin, and 
no new ones built on their foundation. So far is this from 
being the cafe, that a good many houfes have been built be- 
yond the precincts of the burgh, though fo near it as to make 
a part of the town ; and within it a houfe no fooner goes in- 
to difrepair, or tumbles down, than a new one is raifed in its 
ftead, of more than double or treble its dimenfions. Befides, 
houfes of every fort have become of more requeft of late 
than they ufed to be, from a competition among thofe who 
wifh to rent them j and they cannot be obtained but with 
much difficulty, and at a rent more than double of that 
which was formerly given for them. Provifions, too, of eve- 
ry fort, are raifed in as great plenty as they were at any for- 
mer period, and brought into the town in as confiderable, if 
not in greater quantity j and yet they cannot be purchafed 
now for lefs than double the money they coft 20 or 30 years 
ago. To this it may be added, that, fince the writer of this 
account was fettled minifter here, 1782, an accurate lift of 
the people has been twice taken by him, or under his eye, 
and at his direction ; and, though the interval between them 
was only about 6 years, the latter lift exceeded the former by 
near 200. 

Trade. — The commerce of this place, though it can by no 
means be called flourifliing, is, without doubt, rather in an 

improving 



'536 Statiftical Account 

improving condition. The catalogue of the commodities 
which this country produces, and which are carried out of it, 
either over feas or coaftways, as well as of the articles 
brought into it, is very confiderable, as will appear evident 
from a detail of particulars. The principal articles which,, 
are generally exported are beef, pork, butter, tallow, hides, 
calf Ikins, rabbit fkins, fait fifh, oil, feathers, linen yarn, and 
coarfe linen cloth, kelp ; and, in years of fruitfulnefs, corn in 
confiderable quantity. The chief commodities imported are 
wood, flax, coal, fugar, fpirits, wines, muff and tobacco, 
flour and bifquit, loap, leather, hard-ware, broad- cloth, 
printed linens, and printed cottons. The imports, in the 
following account of their value, are ftated at the prices 
given for them at the places from which they are commonly 
brought ; and thefe are London, Manchefter, Newcaftle, 
Aberdeen, Glafgow, and Edinburgh. The value of the ex- 
ports, on the other hand, is eftimated from the prices they 
mod commonly bring at the markets where they are fold } 
and thefe are, for the raoft part, the above mentioned places, 
with the addition of Dunbarton, Liverpool, and Briftol. For 
both the kind and the quantity of the articles imported and 
exported, the information is drawn from the cuftomhoufe 
books; and, where thefe feemed to labour under any de- 
feats, they have been fupplied from the books of merchants 
and other traders. To give a clear idea of the trade, three 
years have been taken, 1770, 1780, and 1790; and the va- 
lue of the imports and exports for thefe years, at the rates 
above ftated, is as follows :

ManufaBures. — If we except linen yarn, 
and coarfe linen cloth, and kelp, which 
with propriety may be considered as^he 
chief commodity, there is no manufac- 
ture here of any confequence. About the 
beginning of this century, indeed, and a 
little earlier, the wool of the country is 
faid to have been wrought into cloths 
and (luff's for the wear of every rank of 
the inhabitants, and even for exportation. 
It is excellently fitted for the purpofe, 
for it is in general very fine; fome of it 
is fhort, and would make excellent broad 
cloth, and fome of it being long, is as 
well calculated for fluffs and {lockings. 
In fome families ftill cloth, of an excel- 
lent quality, is made of it for their own 
ufe ; and, not very long fince, ftockings 
have been wrought by lb me of the wo- 
men, who 3re by no means very expert 
at the bufinefs, which have been lold in 
the public market for near about 30 s. 
Sterling. Now, however, the iheep which 
were once very numerous, and are conli- 
derably fo ftill, and the wool which they 
bear, are equally neglected, as ahnoft ail 
the articles for men and womens wear, 
which were formerly manufactured of 
Orkney materials, to the great benefit of 
the place, are now almolt all of them im- 
ported. 



The manufacture of linen yarn was introduced 1747, and 
as every innovation commonly is among a rude and ignorant 
people, it was at firft very unpopular. Soon, however, it 
triumphed over thofe difficulties that arofe from vulgar pre- 
judice ; it was diffufed pretty generally among the iflands ; 
and is laid in years of extreme dearth and fcarcity to have 
preferved the lives of fome poor people, who otherwife woul I 
have died of want, and certainly made thofe who were em- 

Vol. Vil. 3 Y ployed 



538 Statijllcal Account 

ployed in it live much more comfortably. For the fpace of 
15 or 20 years, while it was under the management of one, 
or a very few men, who attended to and were fufficient jud- 
ges of the bufinefs, it flourifhed much, and produced for ex- 
port annually near 25,000 fpindles of yarn, which, in the o- 
pinion of thofe who faw and examined it, was as good as any 
in Scotland. After that period it began to decline *, for fome 
people obferving with regret the profits which they imagi- 
ned thofe by whom it was introduced and conducted made, 
refolved to {hare of them, by importing flax, drefling it, and 
giving it out to fpin among the people. The confequence* 
naturally was, that the fpinners no fooner obferved a compe- 
tition among their employers, than they were more carelels 
about performing their labour ; the yarn was ill fpun, worfe 
meafured, and worfe counted ; and by this means, in a very 
few years, it loft all the character which it had formerly gain- 
ed in the market. The fhopkeepers in Kirkwall and Strom, 
nefs, and alfo fome of thofe in the iflands, give almoft all of 
them out lint to fpin, and even fome of the landholders exact 
the fpinning of yarn from their tenants as a part of their 
rent j and this circumftance of its being at prefertt in fo many 
hands muft, it is evident, have gone far towards haftening 
the ruin of the manufacture. Still there is fome lint fpun 
here, and carried to Edinburgh, Giafgow, and wherever the 
price of yarn is higheft ; and when the price is low, which 
has been the cafe for fome years paft, the yarn is manufac- 
tured into linen cloth, moftly for the Englifh market. Be- 
iides the yarn which was fent fouth laft year, and the quan- 
tity bartered with the merchants who come over from Mur- 
ray, which is fometimes confiderable, there was ftamped by 
Mr Magnus Lin d fay about 30,000 yards of coarfe linen in- 
tended for fale, and not for private families. Much more 
advantage might this manufacture have been of, had the yarn 

been- 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 539 

been fpun from flax raifed in the place, where the foil is be- 
lieved to be very fit for the purpofe. 

The manufacture of kelp has been much more fortunate 
than that of linen yarn. Ab ut the year 1730, it is faid to 
have been introduced, and had long to ftruggle hard againfl 
the ftrong and rapid ftream of popular prejudice. Averfe to 
have any kind of labour introduced among them, but what 
they had been accuftomed to iee and hear of, they reprefent- 
ed to the proprietors, how hurtful that new bufinefs was like- 
ly to be, for they could have no doubt of its driving the filh 
from the coaft, and it would therefore ruin the fifhing; they 
were certain it would deftroy both the corn and the grafs, 
and they were much afraid, that it might even prevent their 
women from having children. As the price was very low 
for the firft ten years, the quantity made was but trifling. 
From the year 1740 to 1760, the price is reported to have 
been 45 s. per ton, and the money which it is believed to 
have brought into the country during that period near about 
2000 1. per annum. The average price for the fubfequent ten 
years amounted to about four guineas per ton, and the whole 
value to the place to above 6oco 1. Sterling per annum. Of 
each ton at the market from the year 1770 to 1780, the 
price rofe at a medium to about 5 1. and the grofs fum which 
the proprietors in that time received for it was not lefs than 
1 0,000 1. per annum- For 13 years preceding the prefent 
1791, the value of a ton was neareft to 6 1. and the quantity 
each year to the fum of 17,000 ]. Sterling. Thus, in the 
fpace of 50 years, the proprietors of thefe ifUnds, where the 
feafons are very deceitful, and the crops can by no means be 
depended upon for fublifting the inhabitants, have received 
in addition to their eftates, the enormous fum of 370,000!. 
Sterling. A fum of this extent introduced in a country 
where money was formerly fcarce, where there could not be

faid to be any other kind of manufacture, and where fifherics 
which might have been fuppofed to conftitute the riches of 
the country, were neglected, muft, it is evident, have produ- 
ced the mod remarkable confequences. That it has done fo 
here, may appear from the ilighteft obfervation. The ma- 
nufacture of kelp for fome years paft has employed near 3000 
hands, and every one of thofe during June and July, the 
months when it is commonly manufactured, will earn about 
40 s. Sterling. Since the year 1780, there has been fuch a 
failure in the crops for 6 or 7 years, that Orkney has fome- 
times been almoft vifited by a famine, and if the people had 
not had the produce of this very beneficial article to de- 
pend on, many of the poor in all likelihood would have ftar- 
ved ; while the lairds, inftead of being able to help them, 
would have been ftripped of their eftates, and reduced to 
bankruptcy. Many other effects befides preferving the lives 
and the eftates of thofe connected with it, have been produ- 
ced by this manufacture. Induftry, which was before very 
low, has confiderably increafed. The lower clafs of people 
live much better in point of food, clothing, and houfes ; and 
fince they began to know of what importance they are to 
their fuperiors, they are throwing off by degrees, that fervile 
iu bj eel ion under which thefe iflanders were formerly kept, 
and difcovering more and more of the fpirit of liberty. But 
while we trace with plea(ure the advantages which it has 
produced, candour forbids us to conceal its diladvantages. 
Owing to the kelp manufacture, every fpecies of provifions 
has greatly increafed in price, which makes it difficult for 
thofe to live who have only fixed incomes. Wages are much 
higher. Agriculture, which in every country is the firft, 
and moft neceffary of all arts, is greatly neglected; and a ftile 
of living has been introduced among the proprietors, which 
their lands can by no means fupport, and which, if ever this 

manufacture

manufafture fhould fail, muft bring certain ruin upon them, 
their tenants, and their families. 

Kirkwall is compofed of feveral forts of people, namely 
the gentlemen of property, who with their families generally 
refide here fhopkeepers, who have multiplied almoft ten- 
fold of late;— tradefmen, failors, boatmen, and domeftic 
iervants. 

Education. — Here we have an excellent fchool, under the 
direction of two regularly bred, and well qualified mafters, 
who with much fidelity teach the learned languages, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, and the various branches of ma- 
thematics. This one is for boys, and another is juft now 
to be eftablilhed for girls, who are to be inftructed by a wo- 
man fufficiently accomplifhed for the purpole, in reading 
Engliih well, and writing it gramatically, all kinds of needle- 
work, the French language, and inufic. To diffufe the blefs-r 
ings of education among the poor as well as the rich, a cha- 
rity-fchool has lately been erefted, and in it are taught read- 
ing, writing, accounts, and the principles of the Chriftian re- 
ligion. 

Soil and Culture. — The foil through this parifh is very va- 
rious. In fome parts, efpecially towards the hills or high 
grounds, we meet with a mixture of cold clay and mofs j 
near the fhore it is generally of a fandy nature ; rich black 
loam is alfo to be met with in fome few places, efpecially 
near Kirkwall ; and not only there, but in almoft every other 
parilh in the country, the foil \s (hallow, with a bottom of 
rock that is foft and mouldering. In mnft places it is very 
fertile, conftdering the way in which they manage it. The 
plough which the ordinary clafs of people ufe, is of a Angular 
f onftrudtion, having only one ftilt, and ftrange kind of irons, 

With

With this they only fcratch the furface of the ground in the 
fpring, for they labour none in winter nor in harveft. The 
only manure they ufe is rotten ware or fea-weed, alone or 
mixed with turf, and without ever giving it a fummer fallow 
to deftroy the weeds, with which it is generally overrun. 
They fow on it the only grain they have, a fmall kind of 
black oats, and a puny fort of bear alternately. 

Air. — The air in Kirkwall and around it through the pa- 
rifh, muft be confeffed to be rather moift than dry ; and yet 
it cannot with juftice be faid that the place is unhealthy, for 
no epidemical diftempers are generally prevalent here, if we 
except the fmall-pox, meafles, chincough, and others of that 
nature. To damps, however, occafioned by the great quan- 
tity of rain that falls, efpecially in the winter feafon, and the 
fpongy nature of the loil that retains it, together with fmall 
lochs of frefh water here and there to be met with, are to be 
afcribed, perhaps, thole difeafes that affect us moft frequent- 
ly. The moft common of thefe are pains in the ftomach, 
and in the bowels — the king's evil — frequent colds and 
coughs, with afthma, confumptions, rheumatifms, and drop- 
fies. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom . — There is only one mineral 
fpring, fo far as has been difcovered, in the parifli, and 
that is about a mile and an half from Kirkwall, on the poft- 
road to Holm. It has been long known by the name of 
Elakeleys-well, for what reafon is not faid. It feems to be a 
chalybeate ; and has been frequently ufed with much effect in 
removing complaints of the ftomach and inteftines. — The 
Ihores not very high but rocky, are wafhed by the fea for a- 
bout 15 miles; in which there are fometimes caught filaks 
and cuths, which are the young of the feath fifh, fmall cod, 

haddocks. 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 543 

haddocks, mackrel, herrings, lobfters, partens, cockles, muf- 
cles, and fpouts or razor fifh. Kirkwall is the place where 
they come for fale; and their price cannot be eafily eftimated, 
for they are purchafed for meal, fait, bent, a kind of tough 
grafs for making ropes to bind their horfe's and cows, and 
potatoes, and the quantity of thefe articles given for them va- 
ries much, according to the feafons of the year, and the plen- 
ty or fcarcenefs of the commodity. Sea weed is every where 
ufed as manure, though there be marl at no great diftance, 
feemingly of an excellent quality, and were this applied to 
their land in a judicious manner, it might greatly improve 
the fields. The kelp which conftitutes the chief ingredient 
in the manufacture of glafs, foap, allum, and of fome others, 
is formed of the alhes of the different fpecies of fea weed, 
burned in a round hole in the earth made for the purpofe, 
and the average quantity of it which the parifh of St Ola 
produces, may be about 50 or 60 tons annually. 

To the north the road of Kirkwall, to the eaft the bay of 
Miel and Ingonez bay, and towards the fouth the bay of 
Scalpa, the ordinary landing place from Caithnefs, are the 
principal roads we have; and both the bay of Ingonez, and 
the road of Kirkwall, are large, fafe, and commodious har- 
bours. 

Almoft all the quadrupeds are of the domeftic kinds. Ac- 
cording to a very abfurd cuftom the horfes are generally 
bought from Caithnefs when they are a year old, though 
they might certainly be raited, as experience demon fixates, 
in as great perfection in the country. They are well fhaped, 
though of a fmall fize ; they are neither deficient in ftrength 
nor in mettle, and when they are trained with any degree of 
care, they are fit for the draught as well as the faddle. To- 
many difeafes they are fubjeft through bad management ; for 
they have often improper provender given them, both in the 

ftable

ftable and in the field they often want food in fufficient 
quantity, and they are expofed to heavy rains after being 
warmed with riding or with work ; — the houfes in which 
they ftand are commonly dirty, and no attention is ever paid 
to cleaning the lkin of that moft ufeful animal. Great num- 
bers of them are kept on every firm, more it would appear 
than are neceffary, and as they bring when in their prime 
about 5 I. Sterling one with another, and many of them die 
before they are old, the expence of labouring with them mull 
be confiderable. This has induced fome gentlemen to turn 
their attention of late to the rearing and ufing of oxen ; and 
thefe animals which here anfwer very well, have now become 
pretty numerous. They are much lefs liable to difeafe than 
horfes ; their original price is not above one half of that of 
the other ; they can be fed fully as cheap ; and when through 
old age they become unfit for fervice, they will bring as much 
money as they at firft coft from the butchers in Kirkwall and 
Stromnefs. The cows of this place are alfo fmall, but well 
formed, and they give milk of a good kind, and in fufficient 
quantity, which confidering the great numbers of them which 
are every where kept, and the fmall quantity and coarfe kind 
of food they have, is really furprifing. The ordinary fize of 
country cows when about 6 years of age, fell at prefent for 
about 40 s. or 45 s. and this price is more than double of 
what the fame cows would have brought 20 years ago. 

Animals. — The fheep though very numerous, there being 
fuppofed to be in the whole iflands about 50,000, turn to 
little account, as their is fo little care taken of them, that 
they are allowed to run wild in the hills, which are almoft 
all of them commontie:. Here thefe innocent and defence, 
lefs animals, with their ears cut into a thoufand different

at large, expofed to all the feverities of hunger and cold, td 
the depredations of ravenous birds of various forts, efpecially 
Carrion crows and eagles, to dogs which here abound, and to 
thieves of the human kind more ravenous and deftrudtive 
than any of them. The breed is fo puny, that 5 s. is confi- 
dered as no bad price for a flieep fit for the knife in autumn- 
Few of them have any horns ; their faces are white or grey, 
and their tails are remarkably fhort they bear at a medium 
a merk, or a pound and a half of excellent wool, which is 
valued here at little more than 6 d. and from the beft infor- 
mation, they feem to be the fame kind with the fheep in 
Shetland. Notwithftanding their want of food and of being 
tended, and all the difadvantages under which they labour, 
they are much more prolific than thofe in almoft any other 
part of the kingdom. Two lambs at a birth is common, 
three we may fometimes meet with, and if the pafture be but 
tolerable, and the ewes are left at liberty and not ihackled, 
which is fometimes the cafe, the mothers have milk fufh% 
cient to maintain them. Their flefli in general is not very 
pleafant ; and of fuch of them as are compelled by hunger or 
led by cuftom to feed upon fea-ware, the carcafe is black and. 
dry, and when cooked the tafte of the mutton fomewhat refem- 
bles venifon. A fadl reflecting thefe animals, which is as 
well vouched as it is curious, muft here be mentioned. In 
the little uninhabited iflands, or holms as they are called, 
which are here in confiderable numbers, fheep, efpecially 
ewes, are put where they remain the whole year for pafture. 
If in the fpring about lambing time, any perfon goes into the 
ifland with a dog, or even without one, the ewes fuddenly 
take fright, and through the influence of fear it is imagined, 
inftantly drop down as dead as if their brains had been 
pierced through with a mufket bullet. Such as die in this 
Vol. VII. 3 Z manner.

manner, arc commonly found to have two, and fometimes 
three lambs in their bellies. 

Goats have never been common here, though one would 
imagine from the hills, and rugged rocks bold and fteep, 
w ith which Orkney in Icveral places abounds, they might 
have been of benefit to the proprietors. — Swine there are in 
vaft numbers-, and as they go generally at large, even in fum- 
mer, they are uncommonly deftructive to the corn and grafs 
ground, and particularly to the potatoes. The kind that is 
here is remarkably fmall, and very ugly, the back being very 
high, and the briftles long and coarfe, and the colour which 
they commonly have a dirty white the pork of them when 
pickled for fbme time makes excellent eating, and fells for 
1 d. per pound, and the whole carcafe of a middle fized one 
nuy be purchafed for 5 s.— There are rabbits in great plenty, 
but no hares ; nor did ever wolves or foxes difturb the 
flocks, or if they did the fpecies has long fince perifhed.— 
Six different kinds of dogs are here, the fhepherds dog, the 
'greyhound, the pointer, the water dog, the maftiff, the hp 
dog, and the terrier.— The black Mufcovy water rat, which 
is the only one now to be met with, has destroyed the grey 
or brown fort, and has proved as deftruftivc as it is prolific. 
There are plenty of feals and otters. 

The domefticated fowls are common here, the 
cock and hen, the tame geefe and tame ducks, turkeys, and 
ca- fowls. The wild fowl of thefe iflands are very numerous. 
Among thefe we may reckon eagles of various forts ; wild 
ceefe and ducks in no fmall variety, herons, hawks of different 
gulls of many kinds, the ember goofe, the dunter or 
eider duck, the fly goofe, the awk, the lyre, and the tyfte, 
the picktcrnie, the norie, and culterneb, the claw, the fcarf 
and the.leapie or the chaldrick. To this lift muft be added 

fwana 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 547 

(wans, gannets, crows, pigeons, curlieus, the green and com- 
mon plover, moorfovvl, and ihipe, the ftarling, and fieldfare, 
the fand and Iky-lark, the fwallow, the fnowflake, the rail or 
corncrake, the wren, the check, the linnet, and the fparrow. 
How many of thefe are natives of this place cannot with 
much certainty be determined. But we do not recollect to 
have feen on the fhores of either England or Scotland the 
ember goofe, which is a bird of a large fize, and an elegant 
form, which is never feen on land, and which is fuppofed to 
hatch her eggs under her wing, where there is a hole which 
nature it is thought has prepared for the purpofe. Neither 
do we remember to have feen in the fouth the dunter or ei- 
der ducks, which are fo remarkable for the fine down which 
they take from their breafts .to build their nefb ; — nor the 
tyfte or lyre, which laft is a bird fomewhat larger than a pi- 
geon, and though extraordinary fat, and morever very fifhy 
tailed, is thought by fome to be extremely delicious. No 
partridges, nor pheafants, nor land-pies, nor cuckoos, are ev&amp;r 
feen in this country. The birds of paffage are pretty nume- 
rous. Among thefe the fwans, the horie geefe, or as they 
are called in England the brant geefe, which take their de- 
parture from Orkney in the fpring for the north to obey the 
dictates of nature, the pickternies, which come here about 
the beginning of the month of May from the ealt or north- 
eaft, and the lapwing or green plover, and perhaps the fwal- 
low, and the rail or corncrake, which come here fome time 
in the fpring from the fouth, are the principal. After a 
hard gale of wind, efpecially from the eaft, fouth-eaft, or 
fouth, birds are often to be feen which are by no means in- 
habitants of this region. Thefe feem to be overtaken by the 
ftorm, and driven hither by force of weather, and as they 
frequently difappear in a fhort time, they either perhaps re-

turn to the places from whence they came, or die through 
the influence of a climate not fuited to their conftitution. 

Population. — Thefe parifhes are now it would appear more 
populous than formerly. In 1755, they were rated at 1989 
fouls. According to a lift recently taken, the numbers are 
about 2550. Of thefe there are near 2000 in the burgh, 
and the remainder compofe the landward parifh \ and the 
proportion of men to women is as one to two nearly in both 
of them. Since the year 1780, the marriages, births, and 
deaths, inferted in the parifh regifter, which, for fome time 
paft at leaft, has been kept with much accuracy, are as fol- 
lows :

The number of people at or above 10 years of age is a lit- 
tle below the proportion of 5 to 1 . Here few inftances of 
extreme old age are to be found. Many, however, reach the 
age of 80 and 85, fome to 90, and fome few years ago there 
died in this town, a gentlewoman who had been wife to Mr 
Thomas Baikie, the firft prefbyterian clergyman of Kirkwall, 
at the age of 95 yefcrs, well authenticated. 

Though the country parifh be fmall, it contains a confi- 
4era.b!e number of farmers. This is owing to the narrow li- 
mits 



of Kirkwall and St Ola* 549 

mits of their poffeffions. They amount to 50, exclufive of 
cottars or cottagers. Their families confift of about 10 per- 
fons each, and this number includes their children, who 
when they are grown up, whether they be male or female, 
remain with their parents in the capacity of fervants. 

In the town the tradefmen are pretty numerous. The 
mafter weavers are 53, their journeymen 8, and their appren- 
tices 14.— The fhoemakers amount to mafters 16, journey- 
men 2, and apprentices 17.— The taylors are mafters 15, no 
journeymen, apprentices 1 1. —The hammermen, which in- 
clude feveral crafts, are mafter wrights 22, with only 1 jour- 
neyman, and 29 apprentices ; mafter mafons 7, journeymen 
16, and apprentices 6; mafter flaters 6, no journeymen, and 
only 2 apprentices ; the fmiths have 4 mafters, 1 journey- 
man, and 4 apprentices ; and there are only 3 coopers, and 
all of them mafters. The number of failors that live here 
varies according to circumftances. In time of war there are 
very few ; peace brings home many of them -, at prefent 
there are about 200, and above 25 boatmen. Befides navi- 
gating the fhips belonging to the place, which employs a con- 
fiderable number, they go generally to fea in fair weather to 
catch a few fifti for the immediate fubfiftance of themlelves 
and families. To the hurt of this country, and perhaps of 
the kingdom at large, there are here no fiftiers by profeflion. 

The town contains 120 domcftic women fervants, and not 
above 10 or 12 domeftic men fervants. Many more refide 
in the country parifli ; for there, every man that rents a farm, 
however fmall, muft have at leaft one male, and two female la- 
bouring fervants. This will make the number of them a- 
mount to upwards of 150. For fome confiderable time pad 
it has been the cuftom, perhaps for the fake of fociety, for 
the gentlemen of property to refide in Kirkwall. This has 
been undoubtedly attended with feveral bad conferences, a- 

mong 



Siati/lical Account 



mong which perhaps may be reckoned, an increafed luxury, 
from an emulation that has been excited amongft them, and 
their tenants being deprived of the benefit of their example 
m improving their lands, and even perhaps in improving 
their manners. To convince us that this obfervation is 
founded, it is obvious, that in fuch iflands and parifhes as 
the proprietors, when they have been men of fenfe and vir- 
tue, have for fome time refided, the people are more decent 
in their appearance, more civilized, and much more induftri- 
ous. There are at prefect a dozen of gentlemens families 
refident here. Two eftablifhed clergymen, i phyfician that 
practices, 2 furgeon apothecaries, and 4 pradtifing proctors 
or attorneys. To the caufes which have been mentioned a- 
bove, as contributing to increafe the population, we may 
with propriety add three more, namely the almoft total fai- 
lure of the crops for fome years, which drove many poor fa- 
milies from the ifles into the town ; the partial fuppreffion 
of fmuggling, which has forced the monied men to lay out 
their capitals in more ufeful, as well as in more honeft in- 
duftry, and the circumftance of many of the owners of kelp 
living here, and laying out a part of their augmented in- 
comes in employing tradefmen. The marriages, efpecially 
among what are called the better fort of people, are ufually 
■very productive. They have often 10, 12. and even 15 
children. There is a clergyman in this Synod ftill alive, 
though above 80 years of age, to whom one wife bore 22 ; 
and the prefent provoft'3 father, who was a native of this 
country, had by only two wives 36 children. — As the trade 
is but fmall, and the manufactories ftill lefs, in proportion to 
the population, every year drives many of the moft promi- 
fing young men abroad in fearch of a livelihood. Many fe- 
male fervants annually leave this place for London, New- 
caftle, and particularly for Edinburgh, from which they fd- 

dom 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 551 

dom return ; for after ferving a while, which they common- 
ly do with much honeft fobriety, they get married, and rear 
numerous families. The tradefmen that are bred here go al- 
io to the fame places in confiderable numbers, where they 
not only fupport themfelves with credit, but fometimes at- 
tain much eminence in their refpective profeffions. But the 
fea, as it might be naturally enough fuppofed, is the element 
of thefe iflanders. Moft of the young men, even from their 
earlieft days, fliow for that element a ftrong predeliction. 
Accordingly, every year many of them engage with the 
Hudfon's Bay Company, with whom they go out, and live 
generally five years in their fettlements. Some inlift them- 
felves with the Iceland, and fome with the Greenland fiflier- 
men, with whom they only continue for 3 or 4 months 
and when they return, the money which they have earned 
inftead of furnifhing the means of induftry, is almoft always 
ipent in idlenefs, and often in diffipation. Many of the men 
are employed alfo in the royal navy ; for in the laft war, as 
well as in fome of the preceding, when the navy books were 
from curiofity looked into, there were found in them up- 
wards of 2000 Orkney men. — Kirkwall and St Ola united, 
contains 400 houfes, and each houfe of confequence lodges 
about fix people at a medium. 

ProduB'wns. — For the plants raifed here we refer to Wal- 
lace's Hiftory, where they are not only enumerated, but fome 
of them defcribed with much fecming accuracy. There are 
almoft no trees in all this country, if we except a few fruit 
trees in Kirkwall. They feem, however, to have grown in 
confiderable numbers, and no fmall fize formerly ; for in the 
peat mofies, which are common in many of the iflands, they 
are dug up nearly as frequently as they are in other parts of 
the kingdom. The natives imagine, that no trees of any 

kind 



55* 



Statljlkal Account 



kind will ever live, much lefs flourifli in Orkney, on account 
of fomething very unfriendly in either the foil or the climate. 
The attempts, however, which have been hitherto made to 
raife trees have not been very judicious. A rich foil in a 
fheltered fituation has not been pitched upon for that pur- 
pofe ; the ground has not been properly prepared $ nor have 
the weeds after planting been from time to time picked from 
it ; nor yet have the fpecies of trees been well chofen ; nor 
planted in clumps thick enough to fcreen each other from 
the influence of the climate in their infancy. Should it af- 
ter repeated judicious trials prove as certain that trees will 
not grow here now, as it is that they did formerly, natural 
hiftory would be called upon to folve a curious queftion, 
What are the caufes of this fo remarkable alteration ? 

The black cattle, confidering the extent of the parifh, muft be 
regarded as numerous : They are upwards of 500 in number; 
and the horfes, young and old, amount to near 300 ; and the 
fheep, that run almoft wild upon the commonty, do not ex- 
ceed 1500. The number of acres it contains has never been 
afcertained by any meafurement ; and therefore the propor- 
tion between the wafte ground, and what has been ufed for 
railing grain, can only be known by conjecture. It is fuppo- 
fed to be as fix to one, or thereabouts. Little or no grafs- 
feed has ever been ufed here, except in a very few places, 
where it has thriven well, and turned out an excellent im- 
provement. A good many cabbages are now planted in ths 
vicinity of the town, which the inhabitants find their account 
in ufing plentifully, though they pay, for every acre of the 
land where they grow, fully 3 I. Sterling. The reft of the 
arable ground is cultivated, though in a very bungling man- 
ner, for the purpofe of producing oats and bear alternately. 
Much of the wafte land might be improved at even a fmall 
expence, into near ten times its prefent value ; and not only 

grain 



of Kirkwall and St Ola, 553 

grain of various forts, and of a quality much fuperior to what 
is produced juft now, might be raifed on it, but alfo grafs, 
turnip, and other green crops, to the no fmall benefit of 
Kirkwall. Such parts as are already in tillage, feem of a na- 
ture well fitted for the production of flax and hemp; and, 
could thefe very ufeful articles be produced here, to drefs 
and to manufacture them, would afford employment for our 
people when they are but too often idle through the tedious 
feafon of winter. But making of kelp roufes the attention, 
and occupies che induftry of almoft all defcriptipns of men 
here. Every employment elfe is regarded as of little mo- 
ment. The farmers here feldom yoke the plough, in order 
to prepare the foil for a new crop, till the fpring feafon ar- 
rives, when there is only time to give it a hafty rude fcratch 
on the furface with the clumfy one-ftilted plough, juft before 
the oats are fown, which happens generally in the month of 
March, or about the beginning of April. The land which is 
intended for bear is commonly ftirred in the laft mentioned 
month ; it is foon after covered with rotten or frefh fea-weed 
as a manure ; and it has the feed thrown into it when it has 
received a fecond plowing in the month of May following. 
Though, at firft fight, it might appear, that, in this remote 
northern climate, the harveft would be late, yet this is by no 
means the cafe. In ordinary feafons, the corn is as foon 
reaped as it is in many places of Scotland ; for they begin 
about the ift of September to cut down the crop, which they 
continue doing for that month ; and, unlefs when the wea- 
ther is very bad, it is generally all in the corn-yard by the 
firft or fecond week of October. 

Language.— The Gaelic language, fo far as can be difcover- 
ed, was never fpoken by the people of thefe parifhes. They 
at prefent, like the reft of Scotland, fpeak a mixture of Scotch

and Englifh, which language has taken place of the Norn o** 
Norwegian, which anciently prevailed much ; and forae old 
people that live near the middle of the main land, are faid 
to have, fome years ago, retained not only many of its words, 
but fome of its phrafes. Many of the names of places feem 
to be derived from that language ; of which Holland, which 
fignifies a houfe built on an eminence •, Garth, Which implies 
a place where there is a fmall patch of ground cultivated a- 
midft a large wafte ; and Cleat, which means a houfe on a 
gently riling ground, are faid to be examples. 

- R en t. — So far as can be afcertained, the land rent of St 
Ola may amount to about 500 L and the rent of the houfes 
in Kirkwall, which it is ftill more difficult to know with cer- 
tainty, is conjectured to make the fum of 900 1. in all 1400 1. 
Sterling. 

Church and Poor. — There are two eftablifhed clergymen 
here who officiate by turns in the Cathedral of St Magnus. 
The firft minifter has a manfe and a glebe, and the fecond 
has neither. The value of the fira living, which is paid in 
malt, butter, and money, at an ordinary converlion, is, in- 
cluding the value of the glebe, 80 L Sterling. The fecond 
ininifter's living, which is paid in much the fame articles, 
is not worth much above 60 1. Sterling. To both thefe 
charges, which were within the bifhopric of Orkney, the 
Bifhop, in the time of Epifcopacy, prefented. The Crown, 
at the abolition of that mode of worfhip, fucceeded to the 
rights of the Bifhop ; and afterwards, either by gift or by 
favour, or fome other way, the Earl of Morton, and then Sir 
-Laurence Dundas, who purchafed the mperiorities of thefe 
iflands in 1 765, have been confidered as the patrons. About 
.ao years ago, the laft mentioned gentleman, wifhing to con- 
fer 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 555 

fer an obligation on Kirkwall, on account of favours received 
or expected, gifred the right of patronage, fo far as it was in 
him, to the magistrates, town-council, and community ; fince 
which time the town has claimed and exercifed the right of 
prelenting the clergymen of Kirkwall. 

i The heritors in the country parifli are 14 in number, and 
only 4 of them are not refident. The poor are not depend- 
ent upon them ; for, though there be commonly 50 or 60 
of them upon the roll, belides others who, through fioknefs 
or misfortune, apply fometimes for charity, they are fupport- 
ed by the kirk-leffion out of funds furnifhed by the ordinary 
collections at the church-door, and occafional donations, 
which, at an average, feldom exceed 25 h Sterling. To 
whatever caufe the number of the poor may be afcribed, 
it furely cannot be the dearth of provifions ; for here they 
are undoubtedly as low as they are in any other diftricT: in 
the kingdom. In proof of this, we may obferve, that beef 
never fells at above 2 d. and feldom at more than 1 1 d. per 
pound. Mutton, lamb, and pork, are much about the lame 
price. A goofe, fit for the fpit, is purchaled for 1 s. ; ducks 
for as much the pair; hens at 4d. each; and chickens at 
2d. The Amfterdam pound of cheefe is worth i\ d. while 
the fame pound of butter is worth 6 d. In years of ordinary 
plenty, the oats, which are of a fmall black coarfe kind, fell 
at about 5 s. 6 d. the Linlithgow boll ; and, while that is the 
cafe, the bear, which is alio very fmall, brings about 7 s. 
Sterling. The labourers in hufbandry not only here, but 
through the other iflands, receive, per day, 8 d. of wages ; 
and tradefmen, particularly wrights and mafons, when they 
do not work for fo much the piece, in the common mode, 
they can earn every day 16 d. or 1 S d. 

fuel. The fuel that is molt commonly made ufe of is peat

and turf, which are procured from mofles at about 2 or 3 
miles diftance. Every cart-load of peats, and the carts are 
very fmall, cofls 9 d. the horfe-load a penny ; and, to furnifh 
this article to an ordinary family, whofe income may be about 
50 1. per annum, it will require fully 5 1. Sterling. As this 
tieceflary of life, as well as almoft every other, has increafed 
very much of late, fome people have begun to ufe coal, car- 
ried from the Clyde, from the Forth, and from Tyne ; and, 
though there be impofed on it a pretty high duty, the moft 
abfurd and impolitic that ever the legiflature thought of, they 
find it to be cheaper, as well as better firing. 

W iges. — To fupport a man, with a wife and four children, 
through the year, it would require at leaft 1 o 1. and perhaps 
ill. or 1 2 1.5 and all that he is able, by his induftry in 
common labour, to procure, does not exceed 8 1. Sterling. 
The wages of fervants employed in hufbandry, and maintain- 
ed in houfes, are, for men, 2 1. 10 s. and for women, not 
above 15 s. Domeftic fervants, though not more ufefully 
employed, are much better rewarded ; for the men that ferve 
in that capacity receive no leis than about 5 1. and the wo- 
men 20 s. Sterling. 

Antiquities. — Through feveral parts of this parifh, as well 
as almoft every other in the country, there are to be met 
with a kind of ruins, many of them of a very large fize, and 
all of them fituated in fome pleafant fpot by the fea-fhore, 
commonly three, or at leaft two of them, within view of, 
and at no great diftance from each other. They are uni- 
verfally known here by the name of Pifts houfes. Such of 
them as we have feen and examined are of a circular form ; 
and, when meafured as near to the foundation as could be 
reached, they have been found to be from 100 to about 50 

feet 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 555? 



feet diameter. They have been built at fome very remote 
period with very large {tones, without any fort of cement, 
contracted gradually from the bafe, as it would appear, to the 
top, which was perhaps clofed in the form of a cone, to cover 
the whole building. Curiofity has looked into fome ; ava- 
rice has fearched others of them ; and, when a few of them 
have been dug, for the purpofe of procuring ftones to build 
with, a great many bones have been found in them, fome of 
them human, and fome of them the bones of other animals. 
For what important purpofes fuch huge piles as thefe were 
at firft erected, and to what ufes they have been afterwards 
applied, cannot now with much certainty be determined. 

Near the houfe of Caldale, fome tumuli have been opened, 
in which ftones, placed in the form of fquare urns, have 
been found, containing human bones, partly confumed with 
fire, intermixed with a confiderahle quantity of afhes. Seve- 
ral other parts of the parifli contain tumuli of a fimilar kind, 
which, were they opened, might perhaps exhibit contents 
alfo fimilar. In moft places where they are to be found, we 
meet with feveral of them, placed almoft clofe by each other 5 
and, in one place, about two miles diftant from Kirkwall, to 
the fouth-caft, not far from the Bay of Scalpa, and near the 
poft road to Holm, there are five of them, fo arranged as to 
form fomewhat of the appearance of a circle ; and this has 
been conjectured by fome to be the Circle of Loda, mention- 
ed in the Poems of Offian. 

Roads — The ftate of the roads is very indifferent at prefent. 
They were made about 30 years ago, through the exertions of 
the gentlemen of the place, partly by contribution, partly by 
road-money, and partly by ftatute labour. One of thefe roads 
leads to the excellent and much frequented harbour of Deer- 
found, on the eaft fide of the main land $ a fecond to Holm, 

which 



Staliftical Account 



•which is the poft road ; and a third to Stromnefs, about \% 
jniles weft of us, which is the principal refort of the fhipping. 
Thefe three, together with fome few more of lefs note, are the 
only roads that have yet been formed. They are now fallen, 
an a great meafure, into decay ; and this has been owing to 
a defect in their original formation. Inftead of drawing a 
ditch at fome diftance from the road, to carry off the water, 
which they ought to have done, they have dug one clofe by 
the fide of it, in which the water, running with rapidity, has, 
in fome places, undermined and carried away the road itfelf. 
From time to time, thefe roads have been repaired by means 
of the ftatute labour, which is performed here with as much 
reluctance, and as imperfectly, as any where, and had much 
better be converted into money. No turnpikes have as yet 
been erected ; and, confidering the poverty of the country 
people, and the vaft number of horfes which they never fail 
to ufe on almoft all occafions, it is probable they would feel 
the expence of them burdenfome. Since they began to ufe 
tarts, however, which they have now done for fome confi- 
derable time paft, roads, they are abundantly fenfible, afford 
-them feveral fignal advantages. 

Land and Services. — Arable lands rent here from about 3 L 
Sterling the acre, which fome ground gives, for the purpofes 
of railing cabbages, near the town, to 10 s. or 15 s. in the 
other parts of the parifli. The value of the meadow and 
grafs ground we have no method of afcertaining. Through 
the whole of this country the farms are uncommonly fmall, 
not being above 10I. Sterling rent, at an average; but thofe 
around Kirkwall are increafing of late, becaufe the gentlemen 
have taken feveral of them into their own hands, and joined 
two or three of them together, in order to furnifh provifions 
for their families, as there are no public markets. Some of 

the 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 5 $9 

the tenants are yet rather in a poor condition. Their" leafes 
are very fhort, being only a year, three years, or at longeft 
feven years ; and the abominable practice of exa&amp;ing graf- 
fums at every renewal is not quite abolifhed. Neither is the 
mil more blameable ouftom of demanding fervices from the 
tenants quite abandoned. In fome places, they are required 
to caft, and win, and lead peats ; to plough fome days in 
fpring, or fhear a few in harveft ; or to go with boats fome 
of their matters errands upon occafion. But, to the credit of 
the proprietors of land, thefe, and fuch like fervices, are 
wearing much out of fafhion ; they are now exacted with 
much lefs feverity ; they are more limited, and better de- 
fined ; and, with many, they are abolifhed altogether. In- 
clofing of ground is with us yet in its infancy, and confined 
to a few gentlemen ; for the country people, who, from their 
attachment to old cuftoms, hate every thing new, have not 
the leaft notion of its utility. 

, Tears 1782, &amp;c.—In the year 1782 and 1783, the people 
fuffered a dreadful calamity. Through the badnefs of the 
feafons, combined with damaged feed, the crops not only 
here, but in all thefe ifiands, failed fo totally, that, had not 
the Government humanely interpofed in their favour, feveral 
of our poor people would, in all probability, have perifhed with 
hunger. To fave their lives till the fupply from the Treafury- 
arrived, the kirk-feflion exerted themfelves vigoroufly, by 
purchafing for them peafe, and other cheap food, from the 
fouth country. Much about the fame time, or foon after, 
the fmall-pox were introduced here, after being for fome 
length of time abfent •, and, in order to overcome the aver- 
fion which fome of the meaner fort of people ftill have to 
inoculation, the kirk-fcffion, on a motion made, agreed to 
bear the expence of inoculating the children of fuch parents 

as

as could not afford to pay for that falutary operation. The 
fcheme fuccceded to their with ; for mapy who fccmcd avcrfc 
before, now, when they had an offer of having their children 
inoculated for nothing, applied. Above 30 poor children 
were, at the expence of the leffion, inoculated in the fpace of 
one or two weeks, and all of them foon recovered perfectly. 

Dij advantages , Advantages, and Manners The former of 

thefe are, it muft be confeffed, neither very few in number, 
nor yet very inconfiderable. Several inconveniencies, it is 
evident, muft arife even from the remote and feduded fituation 
of this place. This deprives the people of a free and frequent 
intercourfe with intelligent ftrangers ; to inftruct them, by 
their convention, in what is ufeful ; and the example of 
more cultivated countries, to excite among them the fpirit of 
improvement. To the fame caufe it is perhaps owing, that 
many of the lower clafs of the people are ftill fo ignorant as 
to be under the baneful influence of fuperftition. In many 
days of the year they will neither go to fea in fearch of fifli, 
nor perform any fort of work at home. In the time of fick- 
nefs or danger, they often make vows to this or the other 
favourite faint, at whofe church or chapel in the place, they 
lodge a piece of money, as a reward for their protection ; 
and they imagine, that if any perfon fteals or carries off that 
money, he will inftantly fall into the fame danger from which 
they, by their pious offering, had been fo lately delivered. 
On going to fea, they would reckon themfelves in the mod 
imminent danger, were they by accident to turn their boat 
in oppafition to the fun's courfe. They do not marry but in 
the waxing of the moon. They would think the meat fpoil- 
ed, were they to kill the cattle when that luminary is wanting ; 
and they would confider it as an unhappy omen, were they, 
by any means, difappointed in getting themfelves married, or 

their

their children baptifed on the very day which they had pre- 
vioufly fixed in their mind for that purpofe. To thefe pre- 
; udices, arifing from ignorance, there are {till connected feve- 
ral of the meaner kind of vices. If they are detected in tel- 
ling a lie to promote their own intereft, in over-reaching 
their acquaintance in making a bargain, or even in pilfering 
their property, they are not fo much afhamed as to argue a 
great degree of civilization. Murmuring at their own poor 
condition, complaining of, arid wifhing to conceal every thing 
they can call their own, and a conftant endeavour to throw 
the thick veil of myftery over every tranfaclion they engage 
in, form the mod: prominent features of their characters. 
Of thefe foibles and vices, however, to which, it muft be 
confelTed, the meaneft of the people are but too much ad- 
dicted, no traces almoft are to be met with among thofe of 
better condition. The ladies here are as agreeable in their 
perfons, as they are polifhed in their manners : They difco- 
ver much good fenfe, and equal virtue ; and, when they are 
raifed from their father's family to that of their hufband, 
they are no lefs remarkable for their faithful affection as 
wives, than they are for their parental attachment as mothers. 
Neither are the men of the fame rank much inferior ; for 
fuch of them as are engaged in trade, are generally reputed 
fair in their dealings. Such as are bred for the navy, rife to 
confiderablerank; and thofe gentlemen that live at home 
upon their eftates, and that have been fortunate enough to 
obtain a liberal education in their youth, need not be afraid 
to bear a comparifon with thofe of the fame rank in other 
parts of the kingdom. To form the minds, and mark the 
characters of the inferior ranks of people here, the illicit 
trade which till lately has been carried on to no fmall extent, 
has, without doubt, contributed very confiderably. Former, 
ly, the money they had, which indeed was but little, ran al-

moft all of it in the channel of fmuggling. This fpecies of 
bufinefs, which has always been the difgrace, and at laft 
proved the ruin of almoft every place where it has been prac- 
tifed to a great extent, enriched indeed a few merchants, who 
circulated their profits in the place. But it alfo contributed 
to introduce, among the farmers, failors, and even tradefmen, 
a fort of low cunning, to give them fuch a tafte for drinking 
fpirits, as not only hurts their health, but ftints their growth, 
to draw off" their attention from fober, honeft induftry, to a 
kind of gambling for gain ; and, what is worft of all, to 
weaken in- their hearts that facred regard for truth and fair 
dealing, which are the principal ingredients in every refpec- 
table character. Though this fhameful trade be now much 
difcouraged by fome of the proprietors of land, who long faw 
with regret its pernicious tendency, and indeed almoft fup- 
preffed by the vigorous exertions of the revenue officers ; 
yet, though the caufe be in a great meafure removed, the 
effe&amp;s,. ftill unhappily indeed, are vifible in Kirkwall. 

The mode the farmers have of paying their rents has alfo 
a confiderable degree of influence in forming their characters. 
They are generally but poor they have very fhort leafes ; 
fome of them are obliged to pay entry or graflum at every 
removal ; and as their tack-duties are for the moft part paid 
in kind, they are anxious to conceal from their landlords, or 
as they are fometimes ftill called their mafters, what the 
lands produces. The feu-duties too, which on many eftates 
are equal to the rents paid to the lairds, are all paid in kind ; 
and as the crops frequently fail, this mode of payment be- 
comes a very heavy burden, both on the tenants and pro- 
prietors. Very unlike the more favoured regions in the 
fouth, where the fpring comes in early with a genial warmth, 
©ur fpring continues cold until the month of June and July, 

when 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 563 



when the vegetation is very rapid, and both corn and grafs 
flourifh much, till they are checked in the month of Auguft, 
which too often blafts the hopes of the hufbandman. A- 
bout that feafon the winds generally blow with fuch fury 
from the weft and fouth-weft, that the fea by da(hing againft 
the rocks, which on that fide of the country are high, 
fteep, and rugged, fpreads a fhower or fpray of fait water 
over almoft the whole iflands. By means of this fpray, the 
grafs which before looked green and healthy, and the fields 
of corn which had promifed plenty for man and beaft, in the 
fpace of one night put on the garb of mourning, looking 
black as if they had been burnt, and are thenceforth almoft 
good for nothing. 

Many inconveniences the people are alfo liable to from the 
nature of their weights, which are peculiar to this place, and 
which were originally derived from Norway. The inftru- 
ments they have for the purpofe of weighing, are a kind of 
ftaterae or fteelyards ; — they are two in number ; and the one 
of them is called a pundlar, and the other a bifmar. On the 
firft is weighed fettings and miels, and on the laft marks and 
lifpunds. — 24 marks make 1 fetting or 1 lifpund, and 6 
fettings make 1 miel, and the articles of oats, and bear, 
and meal, and malt, and butter, are moft commonly 
weighed upon thefe inftrumenrs. So very uncertain are 
thefe weights, that no perfon can fay what fhouid be the ex- 
act quantity contained in either of thefe denominations. The 
deacon of the weights for the time, has the important charge 
of making, and mending, and adjufting thefe inftruments, the 
fmalleft defect in which muft, it is evident, render them very 
falfe ; and even when they are as perfect as their nature will 
admit of, by a fort of flight of hand trick perfectly eafy, and 
perfectly well known to thofe who weigh, great it juftice may 
be done, without almoft the poflibility of detection. Many in- 

telligent 



Staiijlical Account 



telligent people here confidently aflert, that thefe weightf 
have increaled much of late ; and others as ftrenuoufiy con- 
tend, that they are the fame now they were many years ago ; 
but almofl all except a few ignorant or interefted men are a- 
greed, that they are very fallacious. Though this be an evil 
of no inconfiderable magnitude, the pepple muft it feems en- 
dure it j for no permanent and effectual remedy can be ap- 
plied without the interpofition of the legiflature. 

Before any reafonable expectation of improving the condi- 
tion of the people can be entertained, more juft weights muft 
be introduced ; the leafes of land, which are at prefent far 
too fhort, muft be lengthened double or treble at leaft ; all 
the tack and feu-duties muft be converted into money •, bet- 
ter feed muft be lown, and that changed annually ; and the 
barbarous feudal cuftoms of graffums and fervices totally abo- 
lifhed. In order to have a number of fpare hands for the 
purpofe of manufactures and fiflieries, feveral of the farms, 
which are at prefent by much too fmall, muft be thrown in- 
to one ; and were this circumft ance to be attended to, it 
would induce men of fome ftock or fubftance to rent them. 

Lven in the town the people labour under feveral incon- 
veniences. All the intelligence of any importance which 
they have, muft come from the fouth, and it is often very 
flow in reaching them. This, indeed, happens partly from 
the boifterous friths which the poft muft unavoidably crofs 
in his way to Kirkwall. But notwithftanding this circum- 
ftance, were the poft to go out on Friday inftead of Sunday; 
were he to ride through Caithnefs and Sutherland where he 
now walks ; were he to come ftraight from Wick to Houna, 
or fhould he ftill continue to come by Thurfo ; were he to 
crofs the Pentland Frith from Scarfscarry to Walls, in place 
of coming by South Ronaldfhay, they might have the return 
of a letter in one third tefs time than it now takes to come 



of Kirkwall and St Ola. 5 65 

to them from Edinburgh. Were thefe changes brought a- 
bout, and they certainly could be done with no great expence 
to government, the bufinefs of this place would reap from 
them evident advantages. 

But this inconvenjency of the want of quick and regular 
returns of the poft, is trifling compared to thofe the inhabi- 
tants fuftain from the want of regular markets. The Main- 
land is fituated almoft in the middle of the iflands, which 
extend from north-eaft to fouth-weft upwards of 7c miles, 
Kirkwall Hands near the center of the Mainland, or principal 
ifland, which ftretches from north to fouth, in fome parts 7 
or 8 miles, and from eaft to weft about 30. Thus fituated 
in the heart of the whole country, which is abundantly ferr 
tile in all the ordinary kinds of provifions, one would natu- 
rally imagine, the inhabitants could be in no want of any of 
the articles of living. But this is really not the cafe; for if 
we except beef, which can be purchafed in the market from 
harveft till fome time in the end of winter, they are much at 
a lofs to procure any fort of provifions. If they wife to have 
beef, either in fpring or fummer, they are under the difagree- 
able neceffity of fending to purchafe it in different parts of 
the country. In the fame way when they ftand in need of 
malt or meal, of mutton, pork, poultry, or fife, as they can- 
not have them at home, they muft fend for them from the 
Mainland, or from the iflands at a diftance. Numerous are 
the hardfeips to which the want of markets expofes the in- 
habitants of almoft every defcription. Men of landed pro* 
perty, indeed, feel thefe much lefs than others •, for fuch ar- 
ticles as they are in need of, and as the country produces, 
are furnifhed in abundance to their families from their e- 
ftates by an agreement with their tenants. But fuch as have 
no eftates, and efpecially poor tradefmen and labourers, are 
often even with money in their pockets, at a lofs to fubfift 

their 



5 66 Stati/lical Account 

their families. In order to furnifh themfelves with the ne- 
ceflaries of life, they muft watch the country people as they 
come into town occafionally with the produce of their little 
farms for fale; they muft buy them at certain feafons, many 
months before they are needed ; or they muft hire people at 
a confiderable expence to go through the iflands to purchafe 
them. People thus employed, either on their own account, 
or on that of others, have been known in winter, when the 
weather is bad, and the feas ftormy, to have been detained 
five or fix weeks from their labour and their families. 
Thefe, and many other evils of a fimilar nature, which arife 
from their having no regular markets, call aloud for a reme- 
dy, and fhould certainly as foon as poflible be liftened to by 
thofe whofe duty it is to apply it. But the attachment to 
old eftablifhed cuftoms which fo generally prevails here, is 
the parent of many of the inconveniences the people labour 
under, and were this once weakened or deftroyed, they 
might foon be in a better condition. 

Flax might be raifed here, as the foil is by no means unfit 
for it ; and had the people once acquired {kill fufficient to 
fow, to weed, and to water it, they might find a very ufeful 
employment in drefiing it, when they are now almoft idle 
during the winter. To fpin it would employ a number of 
females — to weave it into cloth would give bread to weavers; 
and a manufacture thus carried on from a raw material rear- 
ed at home, would foon introduce an alteration for the better 
into the people's circumftances. Similar advantages might a- 
life from a due attention to the wool, which is certainly of 
an excellent quality. Did the farmers take that care of their 
fheep which their importance merits ; did they employ ikil- 
ful hands to fort and to drefs the fine foft wool which they 
bear ; and were there people of knowledge in that particular 
bufinefs to manufacture it, the people of Orkney might, in a 

very 



of Kirkwall and St Olal S 6 7 

very fhort time, have not only what was diffident for then? 
own wear, bat many thoufand yards of woollen fluffs, as has 
been faid was the cafe formerly, for exportation. 

A brewery might alfo be ereded here, in order to furnifh 
beer of various kinds for the inhabitants, and the fhipping 
that occafionally comes among them. They might have a 
dirtillery, with a view to fuperfede the neceffity of bringing 
Britifh fpirits from the fouth. Hides, which makes fuch a 
confiderable article in the exports, might be tanned here ; 
and as there are kelp and tallow, and butter and oil, which 
are faid to be the chief ingredients in foap, they might alfo 
have a foap manufactory. But neither thefe, nor any other 
kind of manufacture that requires fire will ever thrive here, 
or indeed any where in the north, until the duty on coals 
carried north of the Red-head be no longer ranked among 
the number of our taxes. This tax has undoubtedly dis- 
graced the book of rates, from which it ought inftantly to 
be cancelled, and committed to oblivion; and the member 
who would introduce a bill into the Houfe of Commons, and 
carry it into a law for that effect, would deferve well of his 
country. In almoit every point of view, it is both unjuft 
and impolitic ; for it has an evident tendency to hurt trade, 
to hurt manufactures ; it fubjects thofe that live at a diftance 
from coal to a duty, from which they that refide near the 
coal pit are exempted ; and when it is collected with the ut- 
moft care, it makes but a very inconfiderable addition to 
the reveuue. 

The advantages which the inhabitants of this country 
might draw from manufactures are, except kelp, perhaps not 
luperior to what might be obtained from fisheries. For this 
fpecies of induftry, the people here are admirably well fitua- 
ted. Lobfters of an excellent kind, and in very confiderable 
numbers, have, for many years paft, been caught here ; and 

though 



Stf* Stattflical Account 

though the fishery be at prefent carried on by an opulent 
company, it is confined to the fouth ifles, whereas, were it 
extended, as indeed it fliould be through the whole, twice 
the number at leaft might be annuJIy carried to the Lon- 
don market. There are plenty of them to be found every 
where around the iflands ; and though they be fold at the 
low price of a penny, or a penny farthing each, where they 
are caught, they are faid to bring into the country about 
800 h annually. A fum equal to this might, perhaps, be 
received from the capture of herrings. That moft excellent 
fpecies of fifli comes, it is well known, in feveral great ftioals 
from the frozen ocean in the north, and one of thefe in its 
progrefs fouth, hovers about the northern ifles, and the eaft 
coaft of Great Britain. Vaft multitudes of them are taken 
on the coaft of Shetland in the month of June ; and in the 
end of July, and firft of Auguft, they frequently touch at 
Wick, and other places on the fhores of Caithnefs and Su- 
therland. In the intermediate time and fpace, they might 
certainly be got here in no fmall quantity, for the bays of 
Orkney are, in the months of July and Auguft, in fome 
feafons at leaft, full of them. But the people here, are ei- 
ther fo deftitute of fpare hands, from their prefent mode 
of agriculture, and from the number of people ufefully em- 
ployed in burning kelp through the fummer, or they are fo 
void of enterprize, or perhaps of the means of this fpecies of 
induftry, that though this fiftiery has an appearance, that 
promifes profits fufficient to reward thofe that would under- 
take it, there is fcarcely at prefent a herring net in the whole 
country. No fmall benefit, it is believed, might alfo be ob- 
tained from a cod fiftiing. Every where almoft around this 
country cod are to be found, when the weather permits 
boats to get off to them, which indeed is but feldom the 
cafe, as the banks which they ufually haunt lie at a confi- 

derable 



of Kirkwall and St Olal 569 



derable difhnce. The ftations moft fit for this fifhing feem 
to be the town of Stromnefs, the illands of Stronfay and 
Sanday, of Weftray and Walls, at the laft of which, the 
little farmers on the fhores of the Pentland Frith, in the 
times they could fpare from their labour on land, have been 
known to catch 40,000 fine cod in the fpace of only one 
feafon. Before much can be made of it, however, Ikilful 
fifhers by profeffion muft be procured, as well as boats 
conftructed for the purpofe, and little floops to cover them 
from the rage of the fea, and the inclemency of the 
weather. 

Befides all this, the inhabitants of Orkney are invited by 
their circumftances and fituation to engage in the feal and 
whale fifheries. An evident advantage they have in being 
nearer the fifhing ground than others, their feamen are as 
good, and would ferve for lefs wages, and their provifiorfs 
are ftill much cheaper than they are elfewhere ; and as the 
price of labour is not yet very high here, the fpick or blub- 
ber might, to great emolument, be converted into oil in this 
country. In fine, were they to improve their agriculture 
in proportion to the goodnefs of the foil — were they to in- 
creafe their manufactures, and raife raw materials for them 

at home, or even import them from abroad and were 

they wifely and vigoroufly to avail themfelves of the advan- 
tages of their fituation for carrying on various forts of fifhe- 
ries, and both foreign and domeftic commerce, the people, 
by means of that induftry, the fweets of which they would 
. in that cafe tafte, would in a fhort time become more nu- 
merous and more happy, and the Orkney iflands, by no 
means inconfiderable either in point of extent or fertility, 
would emerge from obfcurity, abd affume the charatfer of a 
refpectable province, and add not only to the ftrength, but 
the fplendour of the Britifh empire.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1813085">R E A Y</name>. 

{Counties of Caithnefs and Sutherland. — Pre/by tery of 
Caithnefs. — by nod of Sutherland and Caithnefs.} 

By the R ever end Mr David Mackay.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

f'TP'HE greater part of the parifh of Reay lies in the coun- 
~sL ty of Caithnefs. A part, however, denominated Strath- 
alladale, is in the county of Sutherland. It is computed to 
be about 17 miles in length, and 8 or 9 in breadth. It is 
bounded by the parifhes of Thurfo and Halkirk, in Caith- 
nefs •, and of Kildonan and Far, in Sutherland. Its figure is 
very irregular. 

Surface, Soil, and Air The general afpett of the country 

is hilly through this parifh ; but a confiderable track, bor- 
dering on the fea, is level. In the Caithnefs divifion, the 
foil is generally fertile. A great part of Strathalladale is 
fhallow, barren, and fitter for pafture than for cultivation ; 
yet, even there, the induitry of the inhabitants, and the fk.il- 
ful ufe of manure, raife excellent crops. The air is dry and 
healthy. Colds, cough, fivers, confumption, and rheuma- 
tifm, are the moft prevalent diftempers. Rheumatifm has 
been known here only within thefe laft 40 years. The fmall- 
pox, meafles, and ch'mcough, carry off numbers of children. 

Fevers 



of Reoy. 



Fevers often occafion a confiderable mortality. The dropfy 
fometimes makes its appearance here in which cafes it is 
fuppofed to be brought on by the exceffive drinking of raw 
fpirits. 

Springs, Rivers, cirV.— In this parifh are feveral mineral 
fprings, all feerhingly chalybeate. The moft remarkable of 
theft iffues at the foot of a rock at Craigtown, on the fea 
lhorc. The river Halladale runs through the ftrath of the 
fame name. Torfs divides the parifh of Reay from the pa- 
rifhes of Thurfo and Halkirk. Of the lakes, which are nu- 
merous, but fmall, the principal is the Loch of Shuriry. The 
fifhes caught in the rivers are falmon and trouts. The fai- 
mons in the river Halladale, weigh commonly from 14 to 20 
pounds. The fifhing of Halladale may be eftimated at 50 
or 60 barrels annually. The river Torfs yields from 12 to 
18 barrels of falmon in the year. The larger falmons are 
estimated at 3 d. a pound ; the fmaller at 2 d. In the months 
of June and July, they are in their greateft perfection. Loch 
Sleital, in Strathaliadale, is remarkable for its large red trouts. 
The river of Halladale might be made navigable to boats for 
feveral miles. 

Sea-coajl, cifr.— The extent of the fea-coaft is computed to 
be about 9 miles. It affords the two bays of Sandfide and 
Bighoufe ; and the creeks of Portfkerry, which is fuppofed 
to be fufceptible of confiderable improvement, and of which 
the fituation is thought an eligible one for a fifhing village. 
The moft improvable, and beft harbour in the parifh, is the 
water mouth of Halladale, where fmall decked veflels can lie 
in great fafety. The principal head-land is Frefgo-head, near 
Sandfi.de. Wrecks have been frequent upon the coaft. A 
brigantine, laden with iron and hemp, was wrecked at the 

mouth 



57 2 Statiflical Account 

mouth of the bay in 1771; another, laden with logs, at 
Dunreay, in 178 1. Two floops were wrecked in the fame 
year j one in the Bay of Bighoufe, the other in the Bay of 
Sandfide. A brigantine, laden with fait, was loft at Lybfter 
in 1788 ; and a herring bufs at Portlkerry in 1789. 

Sea-fJIjes. — The fillies caught upon the coaft are cod, ling, 
turbot, haddock, Ikate, whiting, dog fifti, mackarel, horn- 
back, fand-eels, and flounders. The beft feafon for the cod 
and ling is from the beginning of April to the beginning of 
July. They are taken with the hand line, the great line, 
and the fmall line. Haddocks, the white of the cod's belly, 
fand-eels, limpets, and crabs, are ufed for baits. A fort of 
fmall fifli, of the fize of trouts, named fillach, and fuppofed 
to be the fry of large fiflies, are taken in great numbers 
among the rocks on the fhore with a pock-net, having fome 
broken crabs caft into it for baits. The cods are commonly 
at 2d. ling at 5 d. and ikates at 3d. each. The haddocks 
are in their greateft perfection in December, and fometimes 
large enough to bring 2d. each. Seals abound on the coaft j 
and it has been occafionally vifited by whales, fharks, and 
porpoifes. 

Sea-ware, Shells, &amp;c— The winter ftorms frequently throw 
in broken pieces of fponge ; and, among thefe, now and 
then, whole fponges fpreading out in a bufh, from one ftem. 
Enough of fhell-fand is thrown up on the fhore, but very 
few entire fhells. At flood-mark, indeed, the fhell of the 
fea-urchin often appears. The fea-ware, ufed as manure, is 
thrown by ftorms in great heaps into the bays and creeks, 
and is a mixture of tangle, and other common fea-weeds. 
At Portlkerry, and round the Bays of Bighoufe and Sandfid-, 
about 20 tons of kelp might be annually made. The tide 

flows 



of Reay.

flows from weft to eaft, from the Atlantic Ocean down the 
Pentland Frith. 

M6untaim i Caves, bV._Of Binra, the only confutable 
mountain in the parilh, the fteepeft fide is computed to be a 
large mile from top to bottom. There is abundance of lime- 
ftonc, moorftone, and granite. Four quarries of freeftone 
have been opened; one in the hill above Bighoufe ; another 
in the hill above Sandfide and one upon each fide of Sand- 
fide Bay. Blocks of ftone for millftones are found in diffe- 
rent parts of the hills. Marl has been found in Braabin and 
Dunreay. A {lender vein of lead-ore was lately difcovered 
near Reay, but in circumftances that afforded no encourage- 
ment to work it. Iron-ore is found in different places 
through the parifh. There is, in this parifli, a cave, which, 
when a ftone is caft into it, emits a hollow, echoing found, 
of which the name given it by the country people (glungang) 
is imitative. In Binra, too, is a natural cave, into which 
cattle retire for {belter from ftorms. The entrance is form- 
ed by two natural ftone-pillars, inclining towards each other. 
In the top is an aperture. This cave was once the refort of 
a gang of robbers. The more at Borrowfton prefents a num- 
ber of fmall caves, and a ftrong natural arch, covered with 
green turf, in a level with the adjacent ground, and leading 
over a chafm, about 40 feet deep, into which the tide flows. 

Quadrupeds and Fowls.— The quadrupeds are, black cattle, 
fheep, goats, fwine, dogs, cats, hares, rabbits, otters, foxes, 
badgers, rats, mice, moles, weafels, and wild cats. The rat 
is not to be feen in Strathalladale, nor in any other part of 
Sutherland. The birds are, eagles, hawks, fwans, ducks, 
wild geefe, fea pies, fea plovers, fcale ducks, herns, cormo- 
rants, marrots or auks, kings fifliers, rain geefe, muir fowls, 

plovers,

plovers, partridges, lapwings, fnipes, tame ducks, plover 
pages, tillings, linnets, thrufhes, hill fparrows, common fpar- 
rows, wrens, buntings, larks, fwallows, yellow hammers, wa- 
ter-wagtails, titmice, jackdaws, jackbits, ravens, woodlarks, 
whimbrels, tradings, curlews, redbreafts, cuckows, night rails, 
pigeons, fnow-fowls, rooks ; and, in the higher parts of the 
parifh, woodcocks, blackcocks, and heath-hens, are fometimes 
feen. Of thefe, the fwan, wild-goofe, fea-duck, marrot, 
night rail, redbreaft, cuckow, woodcock, and fnow-iov/l, are 
migratory. 

Population. — The return made to Dr Webfter of the num- 
ber of the inhabitants of this parifh was 2262 fouls. The 
prefent amount of the population is 2298. The males are 
1 1 28 j the females 1 170. The annual average of births in 
this parifh is 75 : The deaths, as nearly as can be afcertained, 
are 36. The number of fouls, under 10 years of age, are 
602 ; — from 10 to 20, 484; — from 20 to 50, 943 ; — from 
50 to 70, 258 ; — from 70 to 100, 11. The heritors are 8 ; 
and, of thefe, 2 refide in the parifh. The farmers, with their 
families, are 328. The handicraftfmen are, 20 fhoemakers, 
1 8 weavers, 1 1 taylors, 4 Wrights, 1 mafon, and 5 fmiths. 
Here are 9 diftillers of whifky. The apprentices are 5. The 
houfehold fervants, male and female, 35. The labouring 
fervants, male and female, 249. 39 of the prefent inhabi- 
tants of this pariih are incomers, not born in it ; and, of 
thefe, 3 were born in England ; the remaining 36 in diffe- 
rent parts of Scotland. All the inhabitants are of the com- 
munion of the eftablifhed Church, except one Seceder. Two 
perfons were banifhed from this parifh in 1772. In 1773, 
feveral families emigrated to North America. Some poor 
people, and one or two reduced families, went from this pa- 
rifh to the cotton mills in Lanark and Stanley in 1788. The 

proportion 



of Rcay. 



575 



proportion of marriageable bachelors to the married men 
is as I to 7325. Within thefe Few years, about 20 cottages 
have been fuffered to fall into ruins, and two good farm 
houfes have been built. 

Produce, CSV.— Bear, black oats, and white oats, are the 
uftial crops. Wheat and peal'e have been tried with ho great 
fuccefs. The gardens afford the common pot-herbs and 
flowers. There are, indeed, few trees— only fome birches 
on the heights of Strathalladale ; nor any fruits, except ap- 
ples and pears. By ancient calculation, the parifh contains 
271 penny lands of arable ground, at 8 acres to each penny 
land. The pafture ground, unfit for agriculture, is very ex- 
tenfive ; nor has its meafurement ever been afcertained. 
The number of black cattle in this parifh may be at a mode- 
rate computation 3441— The fheep 3 1 10— The horfes 982. 
Abundance of all proviiions neceffary for the ufe of the in- 
habitants, is produced in the parifh. The exports are in ge- 
neral bear, oatmeal, beef, mutton, pork, geefe, hens, butter, 
cbVeefe, tallow, malt, whilkey, to the market of Thurfo •,— 
black cattle, fold to drovers from the fouth horfe colts, 
fent to Orkney lambs, to the lowlands geefe, fometimes 
to Sutherland and Rots s— as alfo hides, lkins, goofe-quills, 
and other feathers. Flax is an article of crop which has 
lately been introduced. Grafs-feeds have been fown upon a- 
bout 50 acres of the arable ground. Oats are fown com- 
monly in April — bear in the end of May and are reaped in 
September and October. The lands of this parifh are in ge- 
neral uninclofed. The farms conn ft commonly of what is 
called a penny land— Many farmers poffefs only the half of a 
penny land. The principal farmers pay from 20 1. to 60 I. 
Sterling of yearly rent ; and the rate of the penny land is 
from 5 1. to 8 1. There are in this parifh 181 ploughs, and 

92 



57* 



Statiftical Account 



92 carts. In the Caithnefs diftrict are 10 water-mills, and in 
the divifion of the parifh belonging to Sutherland 4. In 
each diftrict too, there is alfo a highland-mill, having but one 
horizontal wheel immediately under the mill-ftones. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions. — The prefent prices of pro- 
vifions are for beef, mutton, and pork, from 2d. to 3 d. a 
pound — geefe, 1 s. each — hens, 5 d. — chickens, 1 \ d. — but- 
ter and tallow, from 8 s. to 10 s. a ftone — cheefe, 4 s. a 
ftone — bear and oatmeal, from 10 s. to 12 s. a boll — oats, 5 s. 
a boll — wool is fold at 14 s. a ftone. — Day-labourers in hus- 
bandry receive, men 6 d. with victuals — women 4 d. with 
victuals — without victuals, the former 8 d. — the latter 6 d. — 
Carpenters, mafons, and Haters, are paid from 1 s. to 2 s. a- 
day. 

Churchy School, and Poor. — The church was built in 1739. 
The ftipend is 4 chalders of grain, 500 merks Scots in mo- 
ney, with 60 1. Scots for communion elements. The patron- 
age is with the Crown. The glebe lies at a mile's diftance 
from the manfe, and when let yields only 2I. 10 s. of yearly 
rent ; a fmall part, indeed, contiguous to the manfe, may be 
worth 1 1. more of rent. — The parochial fchool of this parifti 
has a falary of 200 merks Scots, obtained by a decreet of the 
Court of Seflion in November 1773, at the expence of the 
General Afiembly. The fchoolmafter poiTefies alfo an acre 
of ground, for which he teaches two children. In fummer 
and in winter about 50 fcholars attend the fchool ; in fpring 
and harveft when people are commonly obliged to employ 
fuch of their children as are fit for labour, the number falls 
to about 20. Salary and perquifites, if regular payments 
were made by the fcholars, would together make the fchool- 
mafter's falary amount to 24 1. a.year. — The poor receiving 

alms 



of Reaf 577 

alms are about 50. The contributions for their fupport are 
between 5 1. and 6 1. yearly. 

Manners— The people of this parifh are on the whole in- 
duftrious and economical, although, perhaps, rather too much 
additted to the drinking of lpiritous liquors- They are very 
hofpitable. They are in general poor. It muft be confeffed* 
too, that all the attention of the well difpofed can hardly re- 
ftrain the lower clafies from pilfering in cafes of fhip- 
wreck. To what has been faid above of the rate of wages, 
it may here be added, that married labourers living with their 
families, receive 6 bolls of meal for board, and from 2 I to 
3 h of wages in the year, with fhoes. They fometimes have 
befides this a piece of ground for raifing potatoes, with gra- 
fing and winter fodder for a cow. Servants living in their 
matter's houfe receive the fame wages as the others, without 
the allowance for board.— 1 1. with fhoes, is the year's wages 
for a female fervant. Recruiting parties in Thurfo have fre- 
quently picked up young men of this parifh for the army. 
Reay furnifhed the greater part of two companies of Fenci- 
bles during the American war. 

Services exaBed from the Tenants. — There are perfonal fer- 
vices performed by tenants and under tenants with their la- 
bouring cattle, in the parifh of Reay for time immemorial ; 
but are abolifhed in fome parts of the parifh, being convert- 
ed to money rent. On fome eftates and tacks they are li- 
mited ; on others unlimited or difcretionary on the matter's 
part. The unlimited fervices are carried to a great extent ; 
and, it is to be regretted, that a long cuftom, with other cir- 
cumttances, has rendered that thraldom lefs odious to thofe, 
who in other refpects are of benevolent tender feelings, and 
an obliging difpofition. In fuch cafes, though the tenants or 

Vol. VII. 4 D under 



57 3 Statiftkal Account 

under tenants make a fhift to perform the fervices demand- 
ed, they would find it impoffible to pay an equivalent in mo- 
ney were they converted. The limited fervices are not efta- 
blifhed by a general rule, and therefore vary on different 
eftates and tacks. A tenant of a penny-land on one eftate 
performs three days in fpring with his cattle, five days (hear- 
ing and leading with horfes every leading day, and mealing 16 
bolls oats. A tenant of a penny-land on another eftate, is 
bound to perform 24 days in fpring with labouring cattle, 1 2 
days in harveft, and leading every leading day, and mealing 
20 bolls of oats. Cottagers who poflefs little more than one- 
eighth part of a penny-land, perform fervices three days e- 
very week in fpring and harveft, and one in the week during 
fummer and winter. The tenants or under tenants are obli- 
ged to perform thele fervices every day their matter is plea- 
fed to call them, perhaps from 20 to 120 days in the year. 
The nature of thefe fervices is plowing and manuring with 
their own cattle — weeding growing corn — cutting, leading 
with their own cattle, and building corn — mealing corn — 
cutting, curing, and leading hay — carrying victual to a fea- 
port, in ordinary to Thurfo, from 6 to 8 computed miles di- 
ftance, or to any diftiller in the country — cutting, curing, 
and leading peats, which is done by the piece, and running 
expreffes, but not frequently. If a well efteemed mafter 
falls behind in his fpring or harveft work, his tenants lend 
him their help voluntarily, beyond their limited fervices when 
in their power. Services are ftill performed, (though mode- 
rately) where they have been converted many yea/s ago, not- 
withftandino- the converfion money is ftill paid as a part of 
the rent. Hence it appears, that nothing but a prohibitory 
law can abolifh this practice. As the tenants and under te- 
nants are generally in ftraitened circumftances, it would be 
difficult to devife a method of abolifhing fervices, without 

contiderable 



of Reay, 



579 



confiderable facrifices being made by fuperiors. But were 
the tenants by a little relaxation brought to eafier circum- 
ftances, and their own labour under proper management, 
applied to the improvement of their farms, there is little 
doubt but the coniequence would be advantageous to the 
landlords, and ready payments made more effe&amp;ual. 

Public Houfes Little ale is drunk in the parifh excepting 

in private houfes. There are three inns or public houfes 
wherein whilkey is retailed, and travellers are accommoda- 
ted, but not very comfortably for the better fort. The hof- 
pitality of the parifti fupplies the public inftead of elegant 
inns. 

Language. — The Gaelic or Erfe language is chiefly fpoken 
through this parifh. Many indeed now fpeak both Gaelic 
and Englifh. The names of places are moftly of Gaelic de- 
rivation. Some ending in Jler, as Shebfter, Brubfter, &amp;x. 
are fuppofed to be of Danifh origin, Reay, the name of the 
parifh, is thought to be a corruption from Urray, the name 
of a Pickifh hero who inhabited the caftle, to this day called 
Knock Urray.

{Sheriffdom of Orkney and Zetland.— Prejbytery of Zet- 
land.') 

By the Reverend Mr Patrick Barclay.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifh is fituated in the middle of the main land of 
Zetland. It is bounded on the north by the parifh 
of Delting, from which it is feparated by a large inlet of the 
fea, called SiuarbacFs Minn, and which forms many fine bays 
and harbours in Delting and Aithfting. On the fouth, it is 
wafhed by the ocean. It is, in mod places, 9 miles long, 
and 6 miles broad. A very inconfiderable part of it is under 
cultivation, and no exact meafurement has ever been taken 
of it. There are 801 merks land in the parifh; but the 
extent of a merk land is very indefinite. Some farms, which 
are rentalled for 6 merks, are of more extent, and worth more 
rent, than others that are rentalled for 10 or 12 merks. 
Thefe merks are valued by fixpenny, ninepenny, and twelve- 
penny land. Sixpenny land pays to the proprietor 8 merks 
butter, and 12 s. Scotch,/*^ merk. Ninepenny land pays 
12 merks butter, and 1 1. Scotch ; and twelvepenny land pays 
16 merks butter, and 1 1. 4 s. Scotch- [iV. B. The lands are 
reckoned by merks, and -the butter is weighed by merks and 

lifpunds.3 - 



of Aithfting and Sanjling. 581 

I lifnunds.] The merk is equal to i£ Amfterdam pound. 24 
merks equal to a lifpund, or 30 merks Amfterdam. The 
butter rent has never been raifed above this rule in any part 
of this parifh ; but the price has been raifed from 5 s. to 10 s. 
per lifpund j and the money rent has, in fome places, been 
quadrupled. There are alio many ontjetk, i. e. fmall parcels 
of ground lately inclofed from the common, and fet to a te-

Appearance and Climate. — The appearance of the parifh is 
rather hilly, but none of the hilis are of any remarkable 
height when compared with thofe in the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes. The cultivated ground is generally at the foot of the 
hills, and on the lea-fhore, and there is not a houfe in the pa- 
rifh half a mile diftant from the lea. On the weft fide of 
the parifh the hills are generally green on a molly foil, and 
affording little pafture for fheep or horfes in winter. On the 
north the hills are dry and rocky, with fmall long heather, 
and fine fweet grafs. In the middle of the parifh the hills 
are deep mofs, and afford plenty of coarfe grafs called Lub- 
ba, and (hort bufhy heather. The pr.rifh is every where in- 
terfered by long narrow bays called here Voes, or Friths. 
The pafture on the fide of the Voe and in the Nefs, or pe- 
ninlula formed by two Voes, is generally good, and great 
plenty of fea-weed or tang to be iound on the fhores. There 
can be no river in the parifh — fome fmall burns or rivulets, 
which afford excellent trout, and the fea-trout come into the 
burns to fpawn, and are often caught in nets in Auguft and 
September. There are upwards of 40 frefh water lakes in 
the parifh ; many of them might be drained at a fmall ex- 
pence, and would greatly improve the pafture, or might be 
inclofed for meadows, as the bottom is moftly green or mud- 
dy. There are two inhabited ilbnds, containing one family 

eacit,

each, who take care of the proprietor's flieep flocks, and 7 
fmall iflands or holms, in which the proprietor feeds fheep 
and cattle. The fmall part of the parifli which is bounded 
by the ocean, is a very high and rocky fhore, and fome cu- 
rious caves formed by the weftern ocean, much frequented 
by feals, wild pigeons, fea-fowls, &amp;c— There is no wood in 
the parifh but in a gentleman's garden, although there is 
pretty good evidence, and an imperfect tradition, that the 
parifli was once overrun with wood. — The air is moift and 
foggy, but not unhealthy — The heat or cold never difagree- 
able — The moft prevalent diftempers here feem to be com- 
plaints on the liver ; and are faid to be occafioned by the vio- 
lent exertions the men are often forced to make at fea, and 
the fudden tranfitions from heat to cold, to which they are 
frequently expofcd. Cramps and rheumatifms alio very 
common. The epilepfy, to which the women in the north- 
ern pariflies are very liable, has not been feen here thefe 
many years. The people are not fo healthy now as former- 
ly, owing to the great alteration in the mode of living. The 
general ufe of tea, though but lately introduced, has made a 
very rapid progrefs. The pooreft family in the parifli will 
not now difpenfe with it, and will fell their clothes, yea their 
meal, to purchafe it. They ufe a very coarfe kind of black 
tea, drink it very ftrong, and often without milk or fugar : 
The latter hardly ever ufed. The immoderate ufe of fpiritu- 
ous liquors alfo materially hurts the conftitution, as well as 
ruins the circumftances of many. Several of the laft gene- 
ration lived to a great age. One man died, within thefe 1 2 
years, aged 107; and one woman, this year, of 95; but 
there is now only one man above 80 in the whole parifli. 

Rent. — There are 17 heritors in the parifli. Seven of the 
fmalleft refide in it. There has never been any valuation of 

the

the lands. The rent paid to the landlords is 326 lifpund, 
19 merk butter, and 1-713 I. 1 6 s. Scotch. Converting the 
butter at 3 1. Scotch per lifpund, it is in all 2693 1. 16 s. 
Scotch, or 224 1- 9s. 8d. Sterling; but the butter rent is 
now charged by the heritors at 8 s. and fometimes at 10 s. 
per lifpund. After all, this is but a nominal rent ; for each 
tenant receives his poffeffion from the landlord, on condition 
of putting out the fixth (hare of a boat to the long fifhing, 
and delivering the wet fifh to him or his tackfman at 3 s. 6 d. 
Sterling pe r quintal or cwt. and his oil at iod. or is. per 
cann ; fo that the real rent of the parifh depends on the pro- 
fits the landlords make of the fifh and oil, and is only known 
to themfelves *. Great part of the parifh was lately fet to 
a tackfman, who paid above double rent for it ; and, as the 
fi things proved remarkably good during his tack, he made 
confiderable profits. The poultry (one for each merk land) 
is included in the rent, as ftated above. They pay alfo three 
days work from each family, when required ; and, when not 
paid in kendars, converted at 6 d. per day. They are always 
maintained by the landlord ; and their meat very often ex- 
ceeds the value of their work. The parifh alfo pays to Sir 
Thomas Dundas, the fuperior, for fcatt, wattle, and oxpenny, 
1 10| can ns oil, and 30 lifpund, 6 merk butter, and 140 1. 
3 s. Scotch money ; in all, 297 1.6 s. Scotch, or 24 1. 15 s. 
6 d. Sterling. This was evidently the land-tax paid to the 
King of Norway or Denmark before thefe iflands were an- 
nexed to the crown of Scotland, and has been, perhaps very 
unjuftly, continued on the tenants in Zetland, who, as they pay 
cefs or land-tax to Britain befides, amounting generally to 
5 d. or 6 d. per merk, may be faid to pay double cefs every 
year. They pay alfo corn teind, 8 d. or 10 d. per merk 
land ; one half of which to the fuperior, as bilhop's rent, 

and

and one half to the minifter. They pay alfo vicarage tcinda 
for cows, fheep, and boats. The total payments from the 
parifli in a year, exclufive of cefs and day's works, is 3742 1. 
7±d. Scotch, or 311 1. 16 d. pd. Sterling, converting the 
butter as above. 

It is very probable that all the lands in Shetland were al- 
lodial or udal. The proprietor had no right to {how but 
uninterrupted fucceffion. But, as thefe udallers divided their 
lands among all their children, (the fon got two merks and 
the daughter one j hence thefijler part, a common proverb in 
Shetland to this day), the poffeffions Toon became trifling, 
and were fwallowed up by great men, generally ftrangers, 
many of whom acquired eftates in a very thort time. None 
of thefe udallers remain in this parifh, and great part of the 
lands are now feued from the fuperior. The fuperiors for- 
merly had many ways of procuring property in Shetland. 
Patrick Earl of Orkney, in a difpofition of the lands of Sand 
to Jerom Umphray, narrates, that he had evicted 7 merks 
of that land from Powl Nicholfon in Cullfwick, for Jiealing 

afiv'we, and that he had evicted 6 merks from 

in Cullfwick, for ftealing bolts from his Lordfliip's trood, 
probably fome piece of wreck which had been drawn into 
Cullfwick. In that fame difpofition, the Earl grants receipt 
for the money from Jcrom Umphray, at the rate of 17I. 
1 6 s. Scotch per merk land, « being full land's price at the 
« time." In 1789, three merk land in Fogragarth fold for 
100 1. Sterling, and 40 fheep; and one of the merks is only 
feued. 

Agriculture.— -V ery little can be faid for the method of 
cultivation : It is, at bell, flovenly, and often prepofterous. 
The foil is in a few places fandy ; in fome, it is clay ; but, in 
general, it is deep black mofs. Every farm is incloled or 

divided 



of Aithfting and Sanjling. 585 

divided from the common pafture by a turf or ftone dyke ; 
but, in what is called a farm or town, there are perhaps 1 2 
or 14 tenants, whofe lands lie pro indivifo, and often runrig, 
which effectually prevents fmaller inclolures, and is, in many 
other ways, inconvenient for the tenant. In fome farms of 
30 or 40 merk land, there are often 4 heritors. As the pof- 
feflions are by far too farad, the land is too frequently la- 
boured. 

There are 14 ploughs in the partfh, 4 oxen in each, who 
go a-breaft. A large yoke is laid on the neck of the two 
outermoft, and a fmall yoke on the innerrnoft oxen. Thefe 
yokes are joined by a double rope, to the middle of which is 
fixed the draught or chain, which is from 24 to 1 8 feet long, 
from the neck of the oxen to the nofe of the plough. The 
plough is of a very lingular confiruction. A crooked piece 
of wood, bent (naturally) almoft to a right angle, forms the 
beam ; to which is fixed a piece of oak ftave, about 7 feet 
long, which muft be very pliable, and yield to the preflure 
of the driver's hand, when he would deepen his fur. The 
coulter flands almoft even up and down, and is always too 
fhort. A fquare hole is c!ut through the lower end of the 
beam, and the mercal, a piece of oak about 22 inches long, 
introduced, which, at the other end, holds the fock and 
{ky. The furro w is made deep or fhallow, by driving a 
wedge below or above the mercal, on the outfide of the 
beam. There is a ftilt on the top of the plough; and the 
man who holds it, walks on the white land at the fide of ir. 
This flender machine is liable to many accidents. A none 
in the land, or even a ftiff furrow, often breaks it in pieces, 
and the labour is much retarded : It turns the furrow almoft 
quite round about ; and people are employed to cut and 
fmooth it with fpades, before the feed is fown. The outfields 
generally lie ley one year, and are fown next April with 
. Vol. VII. 4 E black

black oats. After the feed is fown, the dung is laid about 
it, and both are very flightly harrowed. By this means, a 
tolerable crop is generally procured, but the foil is never me- 
liorated. Prejudice and obftinacy prevent their adopting 
other methods, which have, on experience, been found to 
anfwer better, fuch as allowing the lands to lie two or three 
years ley, then take two crops, always turning down the 
dung, by which means dry outfield may foon be meliorated, 
and converted into infield. Some outfields or outbreaks can- 
not admit of this, being 5 or 6 feet deep, and only give a 
crop while the furface is rotting. 

Infield is generally laboured to bear or potatoes. The bear 
land is always dunged, and the dung ploughed, or turned 
down. Sometimes a crop of infield oats is taken, but very 
feldom in this parifti. There are fome infield grounds which 
are well known to have produced bear for thefe 40 years, 
without ever lying ley, or being fown with oats. Thefe 
lands get a great deal of dung every year ; and, in rainy 
feafons, the crop is always laid to the ground. The manure 
for infield is cow-dung, kept in the byre until feed-time, and 
frequently mixed with afhes and light mofly earth, which is 
gathered in fummer, and kept in ftorehoufes for that pur- 
pofe. The dung is carried out in winter on the outfields, 
and made up in fmall dunghills, mixed with earth and fea- 
ware. As the farms are generally too fmall for keeping 
ploughs, by far the greateft part of the parifh is digged with 
a curious light fpade, made for that purpofe. The dung is 
carried on people's backs, though fometimes horfes are em- 
ployed to carry it in creels. There are only two carts in the 
parifh. One of them has put out as much in a day as nine 
people would have carried on their backs. No man in this 
parifh will fow oats before the 17th April, by which means 
fa bed feafon is often loft. Haryeft generally begins in 

September^ 



of Aithjling and SanJIing. S%7 

Soptember.-No eftimation can be made of the quantity or 
value of each fpecies of crop, as every man has his own 
water-mill or hand-quearn, and grinds his own crop but, m 
good feafons, the crop in this parifh would always maintain 
the inhabitants, with the help of milk and fifh, and potatoes 
and cabbage. The two latter grow in great abundance. 

/^/.-Men-fervants get from .15 1. to 81. Scotch, for 
three-fourths of the year. In fummer, they are all employed 
in the ling fifhing, and the boys on beaches. The men get 
from 1 21. to 24 1. Scotch; boys from 61. to 10 1. Women- 
fervants get from 12 1. to 8 1. fometimes cheaper, when they 
get their « hands to themfelves /' that is, liberty to fpin and 
knit ftockings, for their own behoof and emolument, at lei- 
fure hours. The yarn is generally fpun at night, when they 
wouid beothervvifeidle; and, when carrying dung, or tra- 
velling on the road, they are always knitting. Their fervice 
to the mafter is often very inconfidcrable ; and they would 
not get meat for their work in any other place. Artificers 
are feldom paid by the day, and are always maintained by 
the employer. A mafon has from 10 d. to 14 d. a day ; his 
fervants 6 d. ; wright, 10 d. ; taylor, ihoemaker, and boat- 
builder, paid by the piece, and generally earn 8 d. or 10 d.

Manufacluns and Pijlymg.-Thc parifli produces a great 
quantity of wool, which fells from 10 d. to 15 d. per lifpund. 
Very little good ufe is made of it in the pariih. A few 
coarfe cloths are manufactured for common ufe } and all the 
ftockings, nightcaps, mitts* &amp;c. ufed in the parifh. The 
remainder is commonly deftroyed in coarfe ftockings, which 
-can hardly bring the original value of the wool. They are 
generally bartered in Lerwick for tea, fnufF, tobacco, linen, 
lawns, cottons, &amp;c. and feldom bring above 2 | d. real value, 
though they are nominally allowed 5 d. ; for neither meal 
nor ready money can be obtained for ftockings. It muft, 
however, be acknowledged, that the manufacturers are much 
to blame for the low price of ftockings, as they are generally 
f)f an extreme bad quality. A confiderable quantity of kelp 
is made in this parifh, perhaps from 40 to 50 tons in a year. 
The fhores are generally let to a farmer, who makes the kelp 
at his own expence, and receives from the landlord 40 s. per 
ton. He employs women or boys at 7 s. 6 d. per month, or 
2 d. a tide. This manufacture is but lately introduced, and 
is of very  T ntiat lervice, as many people earn fomething at 
it, who never had or could have earned a penny in any other 
way. 

The people, in general, have a turn for handicrafts ; but, 
as they have no opportunity to learn, and but very little 
fteadinefs in themfelves, they feldom come to perfection in 
any trade. Every man almoft: tans his own leather, (often 
with the tormentile root), makes his own fhoes, coarfe cloths, 
See. There is no convenient fifliing ftation in this parifh, 
nor any beaches fit for drying the fifh. The fmall part of it 
which has immediate accefs to the ocean, is a bold rocky 
fhore. The ling and cod fifhing is, however, carried on with 
great vigour by the inhabitants, who are not inferior in ikill 
and activity to any of their neighbours. In the month df

Tune, almoft every man in the parifh leaves his home, and 
goes to the proper fifhing (rations in the neighbouring pa- 
riflies of Walls and Northmavine. The expence of this fifh- 
inp, end the mode of carrying it on, will be defcribed by the 
mLfters of thefe parifhes. There are about 36 fix-oared 
bouts for tl:is Timing, belonging to the parifh ; and many 
young men are hired by fifhers in Northmavinc. ^ A few 
ling and cod are caught at the fouth end of the parifh, and 
fei^ ling 66. cod 2 d. Plenty of haddocks and whitings fell 
1 d. per dozen. Pollocks, or young feath, caught in fummer, 
and fell for 1 d per fcore. Sillocks fet in, in great quantities, 
to the bays or voes in winter ; but, as every man is now at 
home, and can fifh for himfeif, thefe are feldom fold. Her- 
rings caught in the bays in autumn, fell for 1 d. per fcore, 
or 3 s. per mett, nearly a barrel of frefh ungutted herrings. 
No tide. ways in this parifh. The only exports fent directly 
by fea are kelp, herrings, butter, ond a very fmall quantity of 
oil. Black cattle, horfes, and ftockings, are generally fold to 
the Lerwick merchants. No town or village. No inns; 
perhaps 30 or 40 gin and tea (hops, to the great ruin of the 
morals, health, and circurnftances of the inhabitants. The 
landlords could eafily prevent this trade ; and it would be 
much for their advantage to do fo, as ieveral of the tenants 
(bend more in thefe (hops than they give to the landlord in 
a year 5 and fome fpend all they are worth, fo the landlord 
get* nothing; yet this trade is carried on by his own tenants, 
(who have no tacks, and might therefore be foon removed.) 

No road in the parilh ; and, in many places, it is not pof- 
ffWe to make them, the hills are fo rugged, and the mofs fo 
deep. Great plenty of fine bays and harbours, which are of 
little conference here, as a fliip has hardly been feen in 
fome of them within the memory of man. On the north, 
the bay of Aith, and voe of Burra Frith, afford very fine

5 9° Stali/lical Account 

anchorage for many miles. The entrance is from St Magnus 
Bay, through Swarback Minn Cloufta Voe, where vcffds 
would be fafe in all weathers, and could lie alongCde of the 
rock, in 20 feet water. Voe of Unrufrith, great quantities 
of kelp made and (hipped in the two laft Snarranefs, 
where herrings are often caught and loaded. Gruten Voe, 
and Ollas Voe, on the weft, very fine large bays, meltered 
from all fea and winds. The entrance is through the fouth 
end of Vaila Sound, a much frequented harbour in the parifti 
of Walls. On the fouth, are Skeldavoe, Selivoe, and Trefta- 
voe, all of them fine harbours, but very little frequented. 
The entrance is from the ocean. As the parifti is every 
where interfeded by long voes, the traveller has often occa- 
fion to crofs ferries. There are, however, no Hated ferry- 
boats j but the people are very ready to afiift and forward 
their neighbours, often for nothing, and at beft for a very 
fmall hire. There is no fliip or velTel belonging to the 
parifh. 

Church and Poor. — The church was built in 1780, and got 
a new roof in 1789. The manfe was built in 1770, and was 
repaired in 1788. The ftipend is let to a tackfman for 60 1. 
Sterling, exclufive of an augmentation of ill. 19s. lately 
obtained. Hugh Sutherland was minifter here in the begin- 
ning of laft century ; was fucceeded by James Strachan, who 
was drowned in 1691, crofting a fmall ferry in the parifti. 
His fucceflbr, Cornelius Barron, was very unjuft^ as is faid, 
depofed by a committee of the General Afiembly, fent here 
in the beginning of this century, to inquire into the ftate of 
the church, and fee if the minifters had conformed to Pref- 
byterianifm. Mr Barron had conformed ; but they fought 
after, and pretended to find other caufes for fetting. him 
afide, It will perhaps hardly be believed nO\v a-days, that 

bodily

bodily infirmity, and affliction from the hand of providence, 

were his greateft crimes. 

The number of poor on the roll are 10, 8 women and 2 
men, all of them aged and infirm. Each of them has a 
particular diftrift in the parifh to which they are confined, 
and every houfeholder keeps them one night for every merle 
land he labours. They get clothes and fhoes from the feffion 
annually, and the expence of their funerals is paid from the 
poor's funds. There are therefore no travelling beggars of 
this parifh. Many poor families alfo require affiftance to 
buy feed corn, or purchafe meal, cattle, &amp;c. The frequent 
misfortunes at the fiffiing, greatly increafe the number of 
widows and orphans, who muft receive occafional fupply. 
The only fund for the fupport of the poor is the Sunday 
colleftions, which amount to about 7 1, per annum, and a 
few fines impofed by the feffion for mifdemeanours. In 
1784 and 1785, the whole money in the feffions hands was 
exhaufted, excepting 10 1. Sterling, which had been lent, and 
could not be recovered at that time. It has been fince re- 
paid •, and the funds now amount to 1 7 1 Sterling. So great 
was the poverty and diftrefs of the people in general at that 
time, that many would have perifhed for want, but for the 
charitable contributions of well difpofed perfons in England 
and Scotland, and a large fupply fent from government.

The 



of Aithjling and Sanftingl 593 

The increafe of the people is owing to the number of out- 
rets, and fplitting of tacks, by which means the number and 
poverty of the people are much increafed. There is one 
farm now pofiefled by 7 tenants, and 3 outfets, which, in 
1742, had only 2 tenants -,— many others, where the number 
of families is tripled. Formerly, the landlords in this parifh 
were little concerned in the ling fifliing. Many perfons now 
alive remember when there was not one fix-oared boat in the 
miniftry ; and the firft mafter of a boat to the Ha-af, or 
ling fifhing, from Sanfting, is ftill alive. Many of the tenants 
had large flocks of fheep and cattle, and found their profit in 
flaying home to look after them, and others went to North- 
mavine fifhing for fees ; and, if they paid their rent to the 
landlord, nothing more was afked. The landlords now find 
it neceflary to profecute the fifhing on their own account ; 
and to increafe the number of feamert, is their great and 
conftant endeavour. With this view, outfets were increafed, 
greatly to the detriment of the. pafture and fheep flocks. 
The rentalled lands were fubdivided, and fet on this exprefs 
provifion, that they fhould fit out a fixth fharc of a boat to 
the ling fifhing; and every encouragement was given to 
young men to marry, and fettle in the country. The reve- 
nues of the parifh are certainly increafed ; but the number 
of women and children, who can do nothing for themfelves 
or the landlord, in much greater proportion. The flock of 
cattle and fheep is perhaps nearly the fame ; but, being divi- 
ded among a much greater number of people, any material 
lofs, fuch as happened in 1784, is much more feverely felt ; 
and the production or profit of that flock cannot go fo far in 
fupplying the neceflities of an increafed number of people. 
The fifhing is not nearly fo plentiful now as before ; but the 
quantity of land under cultivation, has perhaps increafed in 
equal proportion with the people, (i, e. a much greater quan- 

vol. vii. 4 f til y 



594 Statijlical Account 

tity of land is under cultivation now than was 60 or 70 years 
ago). It muff, however, be ftated here, that the number of 
poor on the roll, about 60 years ago, was more than double 
of what it is now. Whether this was owing to impropcr 
admiffion, or if their ncceflities were really greater, cannot 
now be difcovered. One probable conjecture is, that the 
number of fervants muff have been greater then than now j 
and, as they could hardly be fuppofed to fave any thing 
from their trifling fees, they had little other dependant, 
when old, but on the poor's funds. One other obfervation 
js, that the Sunday collections were much greater then than 
they are. now. 

There are 205 families in the parifh, (the average in a fa T 
mily 6 2 ) ; but, in many of thefe families, there are two fets 
of children; the father and his family, and the eldeft fon 
married, and has a family. They are divided, and cliff ed by 
thejr ages, as per the table. No other divifion can be made. 
All the people in the parifh are natives of Shetland, except 
one man from Argyle, and one woman from Aberdeenfhire. 
There are no fechries of any denomination no town or 
village;— no diliinft divifion can be made by their occupa- 
tions or fituatipns in life. There are 3 blackfmiths, 4 ma- 
fons,. naany taylors, weavers, wrights, boat-builders, fhoe- 
makers, &amp;c. ; but none earn their bread by that occupation 
alone: Every man almoft is fifher, farmer, and artificers fo 
that' hardly any man in the parifh, except the lainifter, 
makes his bread by one trade. 

Cattle— The number of horfes cannot be afcertained ; 
(they exceed Soo) ; they are very fmall, but generally hand- 
fome, and of high mettle;— are employed in the parifh in 
carrying peats and turf, and in riding to church. A great 
number are fold annually to the farmers in Dunroffhefs, to 

Orkneymen, 



of Althjt 'mg and Sanjling. $95 

Orkneymen, and to the merchants in Lerwick, who fend 
them to Leith, London, Hull, Holland, &amp;c They fetch 
from n% to 36 1. Scotch, i.e. from 1 1. to 3 1. Sterling. 

The number of (beep cannot be properly afcertaineel, as 
they go at freedom on the hills ; and 'fame of them are fo 
wild, as only to be caught by dogs ; and the owners are very 
careful to conceal their number, to cheat the teind-mafter. 
Perhaps 9000 may be near the truth. 

There are 850 milching cows, befides oxen and young 
cattle, and a great number of fwine, who go loofe in the 
pafture in fummer ; and not being ringed, do a great deal of 
mifchief ; and, in winter, they turn up and deftroy the corn 
land and meadows. No mines or mineral fprings of any 
confequence. 

Difadvantages.—tht want of manufactures is a great lofs, 
as the people, efpecially women and children, are idle for at 
leaft half of the year. — The woollen manufacture moft natu- 
rally prefents itfelf, in the firft place. The tenants have no 
tacks, but fit from year to year, at the will of their landlord. 
By this means they are difcouraged from improving their 
farm ; becaufe, when they grow old, or unable to go to fea, 
they may be turned out, and are very often overbid by 
young ftout men. The immoderate confumpt of tea and 
fpirituous liquours is a great ruin to their health and circum- 
ftances. It would be impoflible to carry on the fidiing with- 
out gin •, but the fmall retail fheps in the parifh are a great 
nuifance and ruin. 

The people, in general, have too great a turn for fine 
clothes. A great deal of money is laid out in a year for 
Scotch and Englifh cloths, ftuffs, cottons, lawns, &amp;:c. while 
their own wool is neglected or deftroyed. Perhaps a pre- 
mium offered to the man who had the beft fuit of clothes

fpun in his houfe, and manufactured in the country, if not 
m the parifh ; and to the woman who had the beft plaid, 
gown, and petticoat, of her own fpinning, might prevent 
this, and give the people, in general, a turn for manufacturing 
their own wool. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — The language fpoke is a mix- 
ture of Norwegian, Dutch, and Englifh ; but all the inhabit 
tants now underftand pure Englifh, though they could fpeak 
among themfelves fo as an Englifhman could not underftand 
them. 1 he mines of places are of Norwegian extraction, 
and are generally expreflive of the fituation, or fome pro- 
perty of the place. Examples are needlefs. Many peo- 
ple now living obferve the great change in manners and 
drefs of the inhabitants : They remember when tea was not 
known ; — when there was not a coat in the parifh but what 
had been Ipun and woven in it ; — and only two or three hats 
in the parifh : Tney obferve alfo, that there is not a fixth 
part of the fmall fifh to be caught along the fhores now as 
when they were boys. Boats were then feldom ufed but for 
ling and cod ; they got plenty of fillocks and pillocks from 
the rocks. — The fmall-pox have not been general in this 
;Ii within the memory of man until 1 79 1. Whole fami- 
lies of people, from 60 years and downwards, were feized 
with this difeafe. The people were at firft much afraid of 
them, and ufed every mean to avoid the infettion. It foon, 
however, fpread through the parifh ; and, of about 30 who 
caught it in the natural way, full two thirds died. They 
were at laft perfuaded to fubmit to inoculation. 327 were 
inoculated by a phyfician, of which 5 died ; one of them a 
woman paft 60 ; another a very lickly boy. About 100 
were inoculated by common men, who pretended to no fkill, 
$nd gave no medicines. Five of thefc died ; and the greateft

part of the reft, had the good fortune to fall under the phy- 
ficians care, and all of them learned his cool regimen. (A 
young gentlemen in the neighbourhood inoculated above 200 
there, and did not lofe one). There are ftill about 250 in this 
parifh who would not fubmit to inoculation, and had the 
good luck to efcape the infection. The fmall-pox fpread 
over about half the parifh in 1740 J and it appears, from a 
regifter of deaths at that time, that there died 78. About 40 
years ago, they were in a fmall corner of the parifh, efpeci- 
ally about Cullfwick ; there are at lead a third more inhabi- 
tants there now, than were then, and there died 17 in that 
place, t 1 of which were buried, in one week. In 1 791 there 
were 58 inoculated in Cullfwick, and not one died. 

A number of young men from this parifh go to fea. Some- 
times they engage with the Greenland fhips'for the feafon, 
and are landed again in the autumn. Their wages are high ; 
but they learn many bad habits, and feldom put their money to 
good ufe. Many of them bind apprentices to Greenland, and 
other mips, and make fine hardy feamen. During the Ame- 
rican war four men enliiled for foldiers, which is very un- 
common here. The country, in general, agreed with go- 
vernment for a certain number of men during the war, for 
which they got protections to fifhers from being imprefled. 
Of thefe 20 went from this parifh, and only eight returned, 
or are alive.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1008937">MUIRKIRK</name>.

<p>Name, Soil, and Surface. 

HIS parifli was formerly called "the Muirkirk of 
— " Kyle and no perfon who looks on its face, can be 
at any lofs for the origin of its name.—Xo great proportion of 
this parifh is arable, or fit for tillage. As the country is hilly, 
the furface of the greater part of it is heath or hether, inter- 
fperfed with fpots of verdure j both of which, taken together, 
afford good pafture for flieep. Where two thirds of the fur- 
face is hether, and the other grafs, the pafture is reckoned 
by the fheep-farmers preferable to any other. Even where 
the plough is employed, which is the cafe in many parts of 
this parifh, the ground is not well adapted to the improve- 
ments of agriculture. The foil is, in general, mofiy, and the 
alternative commonly light and gravelly. Some few fpots, 
indeed, are to be found where it is deep, and of a pretty 
itrong clay ; but thefe bear no proportion to thofe of a con- 
trary quality. As much of the ground is wet or maiihy, 
draining is a moft neceffary improvement ; indeed fo necef- 
fary, that it rauft be firft in order, before any other can be 
attempted with any pofiibility of fuccefs-. 

Hills, 



of Muirh'irL 599 

Hills, Woods, Rivers, &amp;c— The only remarkable hill, in 
the parifh, ftands at a (mall diftance from the manfe, and is 
called Cairn, or Cairn Tabic. It is of a confiderable height j 
and, in a clear day, affords a profpect both extenfive and di- 
verfified. Two large cairns of ftones are heaped together on 
its foraimt ; and here, tradition fays, was formerly a place of 
worihip. 

There are no natural woods of any extent in this panfh. 
Some few banks indeed, in different parts, and pretty far 
diftant from one another, are covered with trees that fee m to 
grow fpontaneoufly ; buc the general face of the country is 
by no means fo agreeably diversified. It would appear, how,, 
ever, that this was not its original ftate, efpecially from the 
names given to particular farms, fuch as Nether-?FW, Har- 
YSood, &amp;.c. The names ftill remain, and fo do the farms ; 
but the woods are now no where to be feen. They have left 
no veftiges, not a fmgle reprefentative behind them, except 
a few decaying old trees can be called by that name, which 
after all are, in all probability, of a later origin. Long 
trunks and branches of trees, found deep buried in moffes, 
confirm the notion that the woods once covered thefe very 
fpots where now only their names remain. It is much to be 
reeretted, efpecially in fuch a country and climate, that thefe 
woods are now no more, for furely the ground, or rather paf- 
ture, to be gained by deftroying them is by no means an e- 
(juivalent for the lofs of one of the mo ft natural, as well as 
greateft ornaments, of the face of any country. Amopg thefe 
trees that here feem to grow fpontaneoufly, the chief is the 
mountain a!h, or rowan-tree, as it is called in the language of 
the country. It adorns the wildeft fcenes •, and often meets 
the eye unexpectedly by the fide of a barren rock or fequef- 
tercd ftream, feldcm feen, indeed, except by the inhabitants 
of the air, and the flocks that pafture around, or their foli-

tary keeper as he moves along to « call his wanderers home." 
There are no rocks either of fize or fhape fufficient to ftrike 
the eye of the traveller, or deferve notice. There are no re- 
markable rivers that run through the parifh, though a varie- 
ty of lefier ftreams. The principal are, the water of Ayr 
and that of Greenock ; the latter takes it name not from 
its fource, or from the adjacent country, but, in all probabi- 
lity, from a range of farms near its banks ; it joins the wa- 
ter of Ayr at the boundary of the parifh to the weft. The 
laft mentioned rifes in this parifh a few miles eaft wards of the 
manle. It is foon fwelled by a number of lefler ftreams ; and 
taking its courfe by Lorn, and the pifturefque fcenes of Bar- 
fkimming, at laft runs into the fea, at the county town. 
Both of thefe waters abound with trout of a blackifh colour, 
but excellent quality, with fome few eels, but here are fcarce 
any perch. They have fuffered much of late by the ravages 
of poachers with nets, who, at once, pillage the rivers, and 
deftroy the more moderate fport of the angler, who feldom 
fails to pour forth bleffings liberally on them, as he returns 
home with his bafket much lighter than ufual. 

Birds  &amp; c. — The birds are much the fame as in other parts 
of Scotland. It is to be regretted that there are few fong- 
fters of the grove ; and indeed, except the iky-lark, few of 
the fpring, as the melody of the blackbird and thrufti is fel- 
dom heard. The larger curlew or whaup, which hatches 
here in fummer j and returns to the fea fhore in autumn, is 
one of thofe early vifitants that announce the approach of 
fpring, and call to begin the labours of the garden. Like 
the cuckoo *, it has little variety of notes, but it appears much 

earlier j 

* The cuckoo has been celebrated in a little ode, that may ;

earlier ; and its view is the more pleating as it announces 
that the feverity of the winter is paft, and that « the time of 
« the finging of birds' is approaching. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The air is naturally fharp, and fa- 
vourable to health, though often loaded with vapours and 
damps, owing to the moffes and marfhy grounds, fo frequent- 
ly to be me With, arid the lurrounding hills which intercept 
the clouds. It is no wonder that both of thefe taken toge- 
ther fhould form an atmofphere not perfectly dry; As a 
proof of this, a few days will affect, with mouldinefs on its 
iurface, any thing placed on an earthen floor or lower florey. 
A convincing proof that the atmofphere would, in all pro- 
bability, prove unfavourable to the health of the inhabitants, 
were it not for the frequent high winds which difperfe the 
moift vapours, or at leaft change their places, and prevent them 
from ftagnating. Neither this,, nor indeed any other eaufe, 
anting from fituation, affect the inhabitants with thofe'dif- 
tempers Which are commonly produced by a moift air or damp 
fituation. There are here no peculiar difeafes, nor any o- 
ther that do not equally affect other countries, and other fi- 
Vol. VII. 4 G tuations. 

But, the curlew, though one of its earlieft birds, has never been 
io fortunate, and as the writer of this cannot deck him in poe- 
tic plumes, like the other, he begs leave in humble profe to 
relate the following anecdote in his praife. A country gentle- 
man, from the welt of Scotland, and who lived in a parilh very 
limilar to this, both in foil and climate, being occafionaily in 
England for a few weeks, was, one delightful iummer evening, 
afked out to hear the nightingale. His friend informing him, 
at the fame time, that this bird was a native of England, and 
never to be heard in his own country. After he had liltened 
with attention, for fome time, upon being afked if he was not 
much delighted with the nightingale. " it's a' very "-ude," 
replied the other, in the dialect of his own country, " But I 
« wad na' gie the nukeeple of a nuhaup for a the nightingales that 
" ever fang."

luations. Perhaps dally habit gradually forms the conditio 
tion to every climate and every ftate, and prevents the hu- 
man body from receiving injury from thefe circumftances that 
would affect the conftitution of others not born to them. 

State of Property. — Property has been changing its pofief- 
fors for fome time pad:, and is ftill in a fluctuating ftate. For- 
merly the greater part of the whole parifh was divided a- 
mong a number of fmaller heritors. But as a gentleman of 
extenfive fortune has bought the lands of feveral of them, 
the number of proprietors is confiderably diminished of late. 
The number of thefe, who refide, does not exceed 4, whofe 
property is not very extenfive. The non-refiding heritors 
amount to about ro, including the two principal ones ; one 
of whom comes into the parifh only occafionally, and the 
other feldom or never at all. 

The value of property is much increafed in this parifh 
within thefe few years. A flieep farm, for inftance, which, 
a few years ago, was bought for 300 1. within this twelve- 
month gave 1000 guineas ; and this is by no means difpro- 
portioned to the price of other lands lately fold here. What, 
at firft fight at leaft, makes this appear extraordinary is, that 
the rife above mentioned is not, as in fome like cafes, owing 
to the advanced improvements ef agriculture, or cultivation, 
or, indeed, to any material change of the foil in any one re- 
Ipect, but the difcovery, and expectation of farther difco- 
vering, thofe ufeful minerals, which even the moll barren 
fpots cover and contain, and which are fo neceflary for car- 
rying into effcdt the manufactures lately eftablilhed here, has 
ftainpt a fuperlative value on thofe grounds, on whofe fur- 
face the traveller was formerly apt to caft his eye with indif- 
ference, and fometimes with difguft. 



Hu/hatidry, 



of Muirkirk. 603 

Hujbcmdry.— The implements of hufbandry here are the 
common ones, which are too generally known to need either 
enumeration or defcription : The mode of cultivation, is the 
e-afieft and fimpteft the inhabitants can find. Aflies and the 
contents of the dunghill, the manure commonly in ufe. 
Such melioration as may be got by vicinity to the fea fhore, 
is not to be procured here ; even lime, with which the count- 
ry abounds, has been hitherto feldom, and but fparingly, uf- 
ed by the common farmer, who alleges that it calls forth the 
whole ftrength of foil in a fingle year or two, and, of confe- 
quence, impoverishes the ground in proportion for double the. 
number following. But the more fatisfaaory reafon, alleged 
at leaft, is that lime fpread on the ground, is unfavourable 
to (heep pafture, which laft is, indeed, the principal obje6t 
with every farmer and lmalier proprietor: Here, as # on the 
other hand, there feems but little encouragement to the im- 
provements of agriculture, or even of common tillage, in a 
country where, whatever other advantage it may pc-fiefs, it 
muft be acknowledged both the foil and climate forbid the 
luxuriance of growth, or where, fhould the grain outgrow 
the ordinary fize, the too early frofts either check or arreft 
it in its progrefs, and prevent it from ripening, while, on the 
contrary, the lighter and poorer increafe coming earlier to 
maturity, efcape the danger. Though, from the above caufes, 
hufbandry has remained only in its infancy here for a con- 
siderable time paft, yet, from the fluctuating Hate of property, 
and its fometimes falling into the hands of men of fortune, 
who have money to fpare in making experiments, it is to be 
fuppoied that new implements, and new modes will be intro- 
duced, though, after all, it is hard to fay whether good crops 
of grafs, for pafture in fummer and hay for cattle in winter, 
is not the utmoft to which the ground here can be brought ;

and, upon the whole, the beft mode of melioration and im- 
provement. 

SMtim* and Harvejl.-Tht feed-time is mU ch the fame 
here as in other parts of the country, but the harveft is late, 
being feldom general before the end of September, and feme- 
, tUnes not xll[ the beginning of the month following. There 
is hardly any poffibility of haftening it by fowing earlier, as 
the ground, from various caufes, is not fooner in cafe to re- 
ceive or nourifn the feed ; to fow grain therefore of the ear- 
Jieft kind that can be procured, is the only probable method 
of providing againit this material inconvenience. Thole ge- 
nerally railed here are oats, and common or rough bear, in 
contradiftinaion to barley, fometimes rye, leldom pe'afe, 
vvhich^unlefs in favourable feafons, do not ripen. Potatoes 
commonly thrive well, and make a great part of the food 
not only of the poorer fort, but of the generality, in the end 
of autumn and during the whole of winter. In common 
they are drefied with milk, and make both a palatable and 
wholefome meal *.

Real and Valued Rent.— The real rent about 1400I. Ster- 
ling ; and the valued rent 188I. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling. 

Price of Grain and Proixiftons — Meal per boll from 16 s. to

Thefe 

* In this parifh, fevere frofts in the harveft months, heavy 
rains, fnows, and froft again, reduced the corn, while on the 
ground, or in the fheaf, to the (late of bailey during the firtfc 
ftages of malting. The meal Hill retained an unnatural and 
difagreeable fweetifhnefs, and in colour refembled coal or peat- 
afhes. The draw, by the above procefs, was difcoloured, and, 
when dry, feemed deprived of every vegetable juice, appeared 
taflelefs, and void of nourifhment. Phyticians, and fome who 
were no phyficians, declared both grain and draw to be un- 
wholefome, and prognofticated difeafes and death to men and 
cattle. Yet it is remarkable none of thofe direful confequences 
enfued, and the cattle, in particular, never appeared healthier, 
or more (tout for labour than in the fpring immediately follow- 
ing.. The fame all-governing power which permitted the calami- 
ty to take place, feeming to interpofe to prevent or fufpend its 
natural and fo much dreaded confequences. Poffibly, too, the 
nourifhment of the grain was arretted in the llraw, but though 
this will account for the healthinefs of cattle, yet, by no means, 
for that of the fpecies. Much praife is due to the humanity of 
thofe who, this feafon, fo ftrenuoufly and fuccefsfully exerted 
themfelves to fave their fellow men from famine and from hun- 
ger, in thofe parts of the kingdom where the f ruits of the earth 
were entirely blarted or deflroyed, by bringing grain from the 
more fruitful fields of richer countries in happier climes. Much 
alio is to be afcribed to the exertions of thofe who brought fo- 
reign aid to thofe parts of this country, where the calamity 
was (till felt, though not fo feverely. A fpecies of white field 
peafe imported, became very feafonable fupply to this parifh, 
efpecially in the fpring months, and moderated in a great de- 
gree, the threatened calamity. Upon the whole, it may be af- 
firmed that dearnefs of meal, but not abfolute fcarcity, and the 
deftruction of feed grain, were the only material inconvenien- 
cies which this part of the country fuffered from the unfortu- 
nate feafon 1782.

vaft increafe of confumers. This parifh never did raife grain 
fufficient to maintain its inhabitants even in its former ftate, 
now it may be aflerted, that even at a moderate computation, 
its produce of grain, &amp;o is not equal to above one third of 
the demand. 

W ages and Price of Labour Both of thefe too have had 
a very confiderable rife from the above caufe, and the manu- 
faftures lately eftablifhed. Men fervants receive from 8 1. to 
1 2 1. yearly with viduals, women from 3 1. to 4 1. Labourers

victuals; mafons, the fame ; taylors, from iod. to 1 s. with 
visuals } fhoemakers, weavers, &amp;c. charge by the piece, but 
their wages have rifen in the fame proportion. 

Manufactures. — There are two confiderable manufactures 
lately eftablifhed here, that of iron and coal-tar. The latter 
now produces likewife a manufacture of lamp-black. As the 
former is yet in its infancy, an account cannot be given of it 
ib minute, at leaft, and. particular, as if it were in a more 
advanced and mature ftate. Its firft commencement was in 
the year 1787, and the furnace began to blow in July 1789. 
The manufacture is not yet brought to the perfection intend- 
ed, but is gradually advancing, and in a progreffive ftate.

There are, for the encouragement of thofe concerned, the 
moft favourable appearances in the neceffary articles of coal, 
iron-none, and lime. Several attempts have been made for 
difcovering iron ore, but it has not yet been found in any 
large quantity. Appearances however favour farther experi- 
ments. 

Towns and Fil/ages.-^The only village,, or rather c/acbaa, 
as they are commonly called, that deferves the name, lies a-t 
a fmall diftance from the church, by the fide of the high 
road, on a rifing ground called Garan-hiU, which therefore 
gives name to the range of houfes that occupy it. They 
have increafed greatly in number fince the commencement of 
the works, and new houfes and new ftreets have ril'en around 
them. Many new houfes, befides fome of them of a very 
neat ftrudture, have been built at the works themfelves, and 
others are daily appearing that will, in a fhort time, greatly 
exceed in number and elegance thofe of the old village, for- 
merly indeed the only one that the parifh could boaft. 

Roads and Bridges.— The road from Edinburgh to Ayr by 
Carnwath and Douglas-miln runs through this parifh, and, 
excepting a few miles in the parifh itfelf, is in tolerable re- 
pair. Another great road from Glafgow to Dumfries and 
Carlifle is now in great forwardnefs, and will be compleated 
before the end of the prefent year. It will run acrofs the 
parifh fomewhat in a tranfverfe direaion, and interfering 
the other near the great new inn, and then flopping Its courfe 
fouthwards to Sanquhar, will fhorten the communication 
with Dumfries by feveral miles. There are three bridges 
now a-building, on the line of road from Edinburgh to Ayr. 
One on the water of Ayr itfelf ; one on the water of Green- 
ock, before its junction with Ayr ; and, a third, on the water of

Garpel. Thefe bridges have been long much wifhed for by 
the public; and it feems ftrange that they fhould not have 
been built fooner on a line of road fo long and fo much fre- 
quented. 

State of Church, Manfe, C3V._ The parifh kirk was repair- 
ed, and heightened, in the year 1775, when the prefent mi- 
nifter was admitted. Though fufficient then to accomodate 
the whole parifh, it is now, by no means, large enough to 
contain the prefent inhabitants, and thofe numbers that have 
been pouring in from all quarters, in confequence of the 
manufactures. To accomodate with feats, even thofe of 
them who feem earneftly to defire the means of religious in- 
ftruclion, it would be neceffary either to make a confiderable 
addition to the prefent kirk, or to build a new one. — The 
glebe confifts of between 8 and o. acres, almoft: all arable, yet 
unfit for tillage, becaufe unfit to raife fuch crops as fufficient- 
ly repay the labour. For fome years, it has been ufed only as 
pafture, and raifing hay for winter, a mode of treating it 
that feems beft adopted to its nature. In many places, it is 
wet, and, in others, runs into the oppofite extreme, being 
light and gravelly. Draining has been attempted for the 
former, and in many places with fuccefs. Indeed this mode 
never almoft mifTes its aimj for it feldom fails to drain either 
the ground or pocket. — .The original ftipend is 400 1. Scots, 
2 chalders meal, and one of bear, about 70 1. in value at an 
average. An augmentation has been lately decerned, which, 
including communion elements, does not amount to 14 1. 
Sterling. This, it feems, from the want of free teinds, is 
the utmoft that can be granted. 

Poor — The poor are fupported by the weekly collections, 
together with the intereft of their money. The principals

amounting to 130 1. and lent out for the above purpofe. The 
yearly collections formerly were 1 2 1. they are now about 
1 7 1. Thefe funds are managed by the kirk feffion, the 
truftees in the firft inftance, who generally take care that the 
yearly income and difburfements keep pace with one another, 
and that the principal is not encroached upon. None of the 
poor are allowed to ftrollinto other parilhes ; and there is 
feldom an inftance of one begging within the bounds of the 
parifti itfelf, yet the country, in general, and this parilh in 
particular, is much vifited, or rather infefted, by ftrolling 
poor, from other quarters. One caufe of this is the improper 
police of fome larger towns. Nothing is more common than 
to banifh thofe that are convicted of bad practices the " Li- 
" berties of the city," as they are called. This is neither 
more nor lefs, than to putii/h the adjacent country for fins 
committed in the town, to lay it under contribution for the 
convenience of the city, and free the one of nuifances by 
fending them to the other. Becaufe the worthlefs behave ill 
in one part of the kingdom feems no good reafon for fend- 
ing them over the country at large ; and allowing them a 
wider range for their depredations. Baniftiment, befides, 
from one particular diftrict, or, in other words, enlargement^ 
is no punilhment to vagabonds, but the contrary. It is told 
of a foldier, from a neighbouring kingdom, who being con- 
victed of mal-praclices, was to be banilhed Scotland for life. 
When the judge intimated the penalty, " Blefs your honour," 
faid the culprit, " put your fentence foon in execution." 

School and number of Scholars. — There is a parifh fchool 
eftablifhed, with a falary of 7 1. 15 s. about 40 fcholars at- 
tend in winter and 30 in fummer. The branches taught are 
Latin, Englilh, writing, arithmetic, book keening, and oc- 
caficnaily church mufic. The fchool m after ^olkftcs, bolides,

sive of the two laft, may amount to about 30]. per annum. 

Parijb Records.— -For about 20 years part, a regular lift has 
been kept of marriages, births, and deaths ; before that pe- 
riod, the accounts are very imperfect, often broken off, in 
fome places hardly legible, feem to have been irregularly 
taken, or, if regular, are now loft.

The greater number of growing perfons have died of con-

Papulation. — In 1755 the numbers were rated at 745. 
When the prefent minifter was admitted in this parifti, the 
number of examinable perfons was 447. The increafe of 
men, women, and children, connected with the manufac- 
tures, is 532. The whole number of fouls, at prefent, may 
be computed at about iioo. The word computed is u(ed 
becaufe, in a crowd of people, that are perpetually Shifting, 
fome going and fome coming in their room, it is difficult to 
mark the precife number for even a .few weeks; and were 
the numbers now fixed, they would not probably remain the 
fame till the account of them is publifhed. They will, how- 
cvery in all probability, greatly increafe, and that in a few 
years. 

Horfesy Sheep, oV — The number of horfes has increafed 
confiderablv within thei'e few years. The iron works, in 
their feveral imployments, maintain about 30, and thefe, 
together with thofe employed in other parts of the parifli, 

amount

smount in all to about 75. Horfes are at prefent about three 
times the price they gave 40 or 50 years ago.— About 
14,000 fheep are produced and paftured in this parifh. They 
have rifen in value confiderably within thefe few years alfo. 
Though the chief article of trade here, there is only one 
market for them upon the fpot, and that chiefly for lambs, 
about the beginning of Auguft. They are commonly driven, 
for fale to Linton, Lanark, Garnwath, Kilbryd, and fome- 
times Glafgow and Edinburgh. 

Mineral Springs.— There is only one fpring that has yet 
been difcovered that is of a medicinal nature. It is ufeful in 
complaints of the rtomach or bowels. Indeed, from the great 
quantities of iron tione, together with fome ore, it is to be- 
prefumed that feveral chalybeates might be found, or perhaps 
already flow unfeen and undifcovered, efpecially as the water, 
when confined or checked in its progrefs, fetms tinged in the 
fame manner as when it touches iron or fteel. 

Antiquitiesy &amp;c— There are here, fcattered up and down, 
the monuments of fome of thofe covenanters who fell dur- 
ing the calamities of the period in which they lived. Of 
thefe the mod remarkable is the grave-ftone of one John 
Brown, erected at a fheep farm-houfe, called Brieft-hill or 
Prieft-fhiel, near the confines of the parifh of Lefmahagow. 
His monument is placed on the fpot where he fuffered, not. 
far from the threfhold of his door. The infeription is legi- 
ble, and bears that he was fliot through the head by a party 
commanded by Graham of Claverhoufe, while upon his 
knees, and in the aft of prayer. Tradition adds, that Cla- 
verhoufe, or one of his party, lifted up his dead body, and 
carried it to his wife, afking her, " what ftte thought of her 
" hufband ? « Mair, laid ihe, than ever I did ; but the Lord 

will

" will avenge this another day:" Such arc the bleflcd effect 
of enforcmg or attempting to enforce uniformity in religion. 

Size, Manners of the People, tsV.-Nothing very Angular 
diftinguifhcs the people here from thofe of other parifhes of 
the like nature. They are of the ordinary fize in general, 
and of a healthy and robuft conftitution. There turn of 
mind, fo far as it is peculiar, is, in a great degree, formed 
by their fituation and manner of life, and they difcover a 
ftrong attachment to the place of their birth, and former re- 
fidence, or, in their own words, « weary fair for the Muir- 
« kirk," even when they remove to countries more fruitful 
and better cultivated. Their chief amufement in winter is 
curling, or playing ftones on fmooth ice ; they eagerly vie with 
one another who Avail come neareft the mark, and one part 
of the parifh again ft another one defcription of men a- 
gainft another one trade or occupation againft another ;— 
and often one whole parifh againft another,— earneftly con- 
tend for the palm, which is generally all the prize, except 
perhaps the vigors claim from the vanquiflied, the dinner 
and bow) of toddy, which, to do them juftice, both common- 
ly take together with great cordiality, and, generally, with- 
out any grudge at the fortune of the day, or remembrance 
of their late combat with one another, wifely reflecting, no 
doubt* that defeat as well as viclory is the fate of war. Thofe 
accuftomed to this amufement, or that have acquired dexte- 
rity in the game, are extremely fond of it. The amufement 
itfelf is healthful ; it is innocent ; it does no body harm j let 
them enjoy it. There is another cuftom here, lefs noted in- 
deed, but feemingly of equal antiquity, commonly known 
in the language of the country by the name of rocking, that 
is when neighbours vifit one another in pairs, or three or 
£iore in company, during the moon-light of winter or fpring, 

and 



of MuirkirL 6 1 

and fpend the evening alternately in one anothers houfes. 
is here marked becaufe the cuftom feems to have arifen itihe 
fpinning on the rock or dj/lqffvns in uie, winch therefore wa 
carried along with the vifitant to a neighbour's houle. The 
cuftom ftill prevails, though the rock « laid afide ; and when 
one neighbour fays to another, in the words of former 
days, M I am coming over with my wkj' he means no more 
than to tell him that he intends foon to fpend an evening 
with him, 

Difadvantages and Advantages. — The difadvantages may be 
collected, in general, from what has been already mentioned 
as to the nature of the foil and climate. The principal meli- 
orations or improvements ftill requifite are inclofingi but the 
inclofures muft be formed with ftone dykes to render them 
effectual in a fheep country ; alfo draining, and planting 
trees, in order to fhelter the fields from cold, and " clothe 
*« the nakednefs of the land." In all thefe ref^e-T the exer 
tions of Admiral Stewart, who has now a large fliare of pro- 
perty in the parifh, are worthy of notice, particularly in t! 
laft. His large plantations of trees of various kinds that di- 
verfify the fcene, fome in belts, fome in other forms, but all 
extenfive and covering different grounds, formerly of little 
ufe, as they now begin to ftrike the eye of the paffenger as 
he moves along, promife, in a few years, to give a very dif- 
ferent afpeft to the face of the country. Some plantations 
too of the Iron Company begin to rife to view. They are 
difpofed with tafte, on fpots happily chofen, where they will 
foon rife to beauty. Though not fo extenfive as the other, 
yet, for the fhare of property the Company pofTefTes, they 
are very confiderable. 

This parifh poffefTes many advantages that are not always 
the lot even of better climates, and of richer foils. No coun- 
try 



Stati/lical Account 

try abounds more with peat, coal, lime, and good quarries 
of ftone for building. Were any remark to be made upon 
the qualities of thefc ; the coal does not feem to have equal 
ftrength with that found in the deeper foils of the Lothians, 
therefore burns for a fliorter period, but that inconvenience 
is fufficiently compenfatcd by it abounding almoft every 
where along the fides of the water, its cheapnefs to the con- 
fumer, and its acceffiblenefs to all. Perhaps the lime too 
may be liable to the fame remark, and from the fame caufe ; 
but the ftone lies under no fuch exception. It is of a pro- 
per colour, and takes an excellent polifh, being equally a- 
dapted to conveniency or ornament. 

Thefe are the local and natural advantages of this parifh, 
and they are no doubt confiderable. But it boafts, of late, 
other advantages, ftill greater in one refpecl;, becaufe they en- 
hance its natural ones, give them value, and call them forth 
into effecT:, I mean the manufactures lately eftablifhed, and 
which have been already mentioned. The fuccefs of thefe 
is an object truly defirable. Every friend of his country 
and of the public muft, upon all occafions, wifh well to lau- 
dable and ufeful enterprife. We refpecl, nay we praifi, thai- 
man who can improve or enrich the furface of the earth, can 
mow down rich crops from fields formerly barren, or even 
double the grains of corn, upon thofe that bore before. But 
furely an equal fhare of praife is juftly due to that man, who, 
in countries that are ungrateful to the labours of cultivation, 
and either difcourage or forbid its ungainful toil, can drag 
from the fluggifh bofom of the earth, in which they lie con- 
cealed, inactive, and ufelefs, thofe minerals, which under the 
forming hand of art gradually affume every figure and every 
fhape, and ferve at once to accommodate, or adorn life.

{County and Prejbytery of Ayr. —Synod of Glafgow and 

Ayr.) 

By the Reverend Mr Robert Duncan.</head> 

<p>Name and Situation. 

TV TO word in the Englifli language accurately determines 
In the form of that riling ground which is known in 
Scotland by the Celtic term, dun. The pariah of Dundon- 
ald derives its name from an eminence on which ftands an 
antient and royal cattle. In this caftle lived and died Robert 
II. the firft King of the Stewart line. From Irvine harbour, 
which- is within its limit, this parilh extends eight Englifli 
miles along the fea coft, and terminates on the fouth, at the 
place where the Rumbling and Pow-burns meet, and dis- 
charge themfdves into the fea : A place which, on account 
of its quick fands, is very dangerous to travellers*. 

Soil 

* The fea coaft between Ayr and Irvine being flat, and, ex- 
cepting at this place, which is about three miles from Ayr, the 
lands being firm and the profpecl: delightful, a ftrong tempta- 
tion is prelented to pafs from the one town to the other along 
fhore. But, as fome perfons have been burried alive at this fpot, 
it is an important caution not to attempt palling it at high wa- 
ter, and at other times to keep as clofc as poffible to the low 
water mark.

Soil ami Appearance.— The parifli of Dundonald prefents as 
great variety in point of Soil and external appearance as is to 
be met with in any part of the kingdom. The Claven hills 
and Shoualton mofs, which lies immediately under them to 
the north, divide it almoft into two equal parts; upper and 
lower. The former being inland, is, in general, of a fertile 
clay, though fome farms are more inclined to a loamy, and 
two or three to a light texture. This part of the parifli con- 
fifts of gentle eminences, adorned with clumps and belts of 
planting. The lower part, between the hills and the fea, is 
very flat. Some barren fandy hillocks are to be feen in dif- 
ferent places by the fliore. Cutting the bent, which grows 
upon them, no doubt, adds to their barrennefs, and renders 
them a better fport to the winds. However, there is a great 
extent of arable, and efpecially of good pafture, ground near 
the fea, and particularly about the Troone. Half a mile in- 
ward, and along the flcirts of the hills, is a mixed foil of ex- 
cellent quality ; very proper for culture, and which, after re- 
gular tillage, runs immediately into rich grafs. 

The Claven hills confift of various heights, and extend a- 
bout three miles from fouth-eaft to north- weft, and a mile 
and an half from north-eaft to fouth-weft. Many of thefe 
heights are arable, all of them afford pafture, and fome 
cf them have their (helving fides ornamented with oak, alh, 
birch, alder, hazle, &amp;c. None of them are fo elevated as 
to require critical meafurement, or comparifon with many 
hills in the county of Ayr, yet they have long been diftin- 
guifhed by particular names. The two higheft are ftiled the 
Lament and Warley hills. Perhaps the latter, which over- 
tops the reft, is a corruption for warlike ; the lines of two 
encampments being ftill diftincl: upon it. Thefe are ufually 
defigned Roman encampments, though their form appears 
fufficiently to confute that dtfignation. The largeft contains, 
within a circular embarkment of loofe ftones and earth, ten 

acres 



of Dimdonald.* 61 J 

acres of ground ; and there is an inner circle of the fame 
kind, and from the fame center, which inclofes one of thefe 
acres. The other encampment is about two hundred yards 
diftant. No artificial work has ever been raifed upon its 
north-eaft quarter ; the fteepnefs of the declivity being a fuf- 
ficient defence. But, on the fouth and weft, the circular 
embankment is ftrong, and within is a beautiful platform not 
exceeding an acre in extent. Hiftbrjan's feem to agree that 
the Norwegians, who afterwards were defeated at Largs, 
landed near to Ayr ; and it is not improbable that thefe 
heights were immediately occupied, and in this manner for- 
tified, by them. No place could be more proper for their 
purpofe, both on account of the extenfive prolpect, and of 
its great fecurity before the invention of fire arms. A per- 
ion ftanding within either of thefe encampments, is enter-' 
tained with a delightful profpect, to the fouth, of the lands 
lying upon Ayr and Doon rivers ; and the profpect, upon this 
quarter, is terminated by the high hills of Carrick and Gallo- 
way. Turning to the north-eaft, Cunningham and part of Kyle 
exhibit a grand and rich amphitheatre, at leaft 14 miles In 
diameter. In a clear day, the eye is loft among hills ftreach- 
ing far beyond Ben-Lomond. To the weft, the fpe&amp;ator has 
a noble view of the frith of Clyde, of Bute, Cumbraes, 
Cowal, the Paps of Jura, Arran, Plada, Sanda, the point uf 
Cantyre, and different parts of the kingdom of Ireland appear- 
ing between Kintyre and Ailfa. The fingular form of this 
laft ifland, riling like a mighty pyramid from the ocean, is 
beautifully contrafted by the fimilar appearance of Loudon 
hill, riling on the oppofite fide from the land. No wonder 
that the inhabitants of the bleak mountains of Scandinavia 
were captivated with the profpect, and excited to contend 
vigoroufly for the poffeffion of this part of Scotland.

Church, School, and Poor To the minifters ftipend, which 

formerly was 100 bolls 14 pecks of meal, 32 bolls 11 pecks 
of bear, Ayrfhire meafure, and 20 merks Scots ; the Lords 
Commiffioners of teinds have, this year, granted an augmenta- 
tion of 25 1. 3 s. 24. d. Sterling, and 5 I. Sterling to defray the 
cxpence of communion elements. The manfe was rebuilt in 
1784, upon a very neat plan, and was the firft: in this part 
of the country, which had flated offices. The glebe is 4 
acres. No grafs is allowed for horfe or cows. The fchool- 
matters falary is 100 merks Scots. The average of fcholars, 
34. The inhabitants are obliged to keep two private fchools, 
in two corners of the parifh, which are at too great a diffance 

from 



of Dundonald. 619 

from the kirk town, for their young children. The fchool- 
mafter has a dwellinghoufe and fchoolhoufe, but no garden. 

The funds for the poor are, the intereft of 144 1. flock 
in the bank of Ayr, the monies received at private baptifms 
and for mortcloths, and the weekly colle&amp;ions : The average 
of the provifion for the poor for nine years paft, is 36 L. 
Seven perfons, receive, at prefent, a weekly penfion from 1 s. 
to is. 6 d. ; and eleven receive occafional fupply. None 
are allowed to beg. Near to the village of Dundonald, is 
the caftle already mentioned, which gives name to the earl- 
dom in the family of Cochrane. The rifing ground on, 
which the caftle ftands, with 5 roods of land adjoining, is 
all the property in this parifh which now pertains to that 
family. No authentic record can be produced at what time 
this caftle was built, or when it was fpoiled of its roof, and 
rendered defolate. A large pile ftill remains : The walls are 
very thick, and built of whinftone, which is in abundance near 
it. The corners are of a freeftone, fuperior in quality to any 
now found in the parifh. The Stuart arms are engroffed in 
different parts of the building, and the whole has much the 
form of thofe caftles which were raifed in many places of 
Britain during the 12th and 13th centuries. Among the 
hills is ftill difcernable the veftige of another caftle, called 
Kemplaw, and which is faid to have been of high antiquity. 

Oppofite to the village and caftle is a very beautiful bank 
of wood, upwards, in moft places, of 100 feet in height, and 
extending near a mile to the north weft. In a grand curva- 
ture of this bank, and on a gentle eminence, ftands the houfe 
of Auchans, for a long period the relidence of the Wallaces 
of Dundonald. About 1640, this eftate came into the pof- 
feffion of Sir William Cochrane of Lowdon, knight ; who 
was afterwards created Earl of Dundonald. Since the beinn- 
ning of this century, the eftate has been the property of the 

Earl 



620 Statiflical Account 

Earl ofEglintoune, who, with it, acquired the patronage of 
the parifh. At tl\e Auchans, arc the remains of a fmall orch- 
ard whirh was once in high reputation. The pear, known 
in Scotland by the name of Auchans, derived that name 
from this place. The tree came originally from France, was 
planted ,n th,s orchard, grew to a great height, and was, not 
long ago, blown down by a ftorm. Some large trees, parti- 
cubrly planes and aih, may be feen in different parts of the 
panih, Specially at the Auchans. 

Heritors.— The heritors of the parifh are in number 16, 
and, excepting two of them who have only 39 acres, refide 
cither within the bounds of the parifh, or in its vicinity. 
The houfes of Fullerton, Fairlie, Hillhoufe, and Newfkld 
are modern buildings, very commodious and elegant in their 
refpetf ive forms. To Mr Fairlie of Fairlie, the country is 
indebted for a confiderable fhare of its improvement in agri- 
culture. Of this not only his own eftate in this parifh, but 
the numerous eftates belonging to the Earl of Eglintoune, 
in the counties of Ayr, Lanerk, and Renfrew, all under hfe 
management, are a luffzeient demonftration. Perfevering 
with uncommon firmnefs in combating the prejudices of old 
tenants, dividing the lands and making reitrictions fuitab.le 
to the foil and fituation, he has rqndered the farmers, in ge- 
neral, more Wealthy and refpe&amp;able, and the lands much 
more valuable. To Mr M'Kerrel of Hillhoufe, the country 
is under great obligations in another line. Fie was the rirtt 
who introduced the filk manufactory into Paifley, and his 
fons full carry it on to a confiderable extent. Colonel Ful- 
lerton of Fullerton, and Major Crawfurd of Newfield, par- 
ticularly diftinguifhed themfelves in the Eaft Indies.

inofs, which is of an irregular figure, near 4 miles, in cir- 
cumference, is an inexhauftible fund for peat. But there is 
little demand for peat owing to the abundance of coal. At 
Fairlie a feeing coal has been wrought for many years for the 
benefit of the country, and, for fome feafons pad, a good 
blind coal, which is exported at Irvine for the Irilh market. 
On account of this coalwork, a village, named Rumford, has 
of late years ftarted up clofe by Fairlie bridge. It contains at 
prefent 74 inhabitants. At Shoualton a feeing coal is 
wrought both for the ufe of the people in the town and 
neighbourhood of Irvine, and for exportation. The load of 
coals has lately been raifed, and is now fold at the former 
of thefe works at 8 d. and at the later rod. Thefe coai- 
lieries employ many failors and carters in Irvine, and dur- 
ing the fucnmer and winter months, a number of tenants, 
ivho, by thefe means, give conftant work to their horfes. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — A cotton work has lately been 
erected in the village of Dundonald, which employs 30 per- 
fons, old and young. The carding machines are turned by a 
horfe. Excepting 6 weavers, 3 raylors, 4 fhoemakers, 1 
mafons, 4 joiners, and 3 fmiths, the reft of the inhabitants, 
able for work, are employed in agriculture. Land is let 
from 15 to 30 fhillings per acre, according to its quality. 
Moft of the farms are in 3, fome in 4, breaks. Oats and 
bear are the principal articles of culture. There are 3 mills 
upon this fide of Irvine river. One of them for oats ; ano- 
ther for oats and lint ; and the third, lately built upon the 
land of Shoualton, at confiderable expence and with great 
improvements, for wheat, oats, and barley. No lime has 
ever been difcovered in this parifh. The farmers in the 
lower part of it have for many years imported lime-ftone 
::om Ireland. Confidering the greater quantity of calca- 
reous 



62 2 



Siatiftical Account 



reous earth in the Irifh lime, they are at lefs expence for 
this kind of manure than to cart it from the neighbouring 
parifhes of Symington and Riccartouh. They have likewife 
the advantage of the fea- wrack Notwithstanding the hills 
and mofs already mentioned, the parifli pnducps more than 
double the quantity of grain neceflary for i jj own confumpt. 
The attention of the farmers has, of hfte years, been turned 
to the rearing of young cattle, both horfes and cows, and to 
the making of fweet-milk cheefe. Both muft in a (hort 
time be highly beneficial to the country ; much money hav- 
ing long been drained out of it, to England for cheefe, and 
to Ireland for horfes. In fummer £79/, there were in the 
parifti 235 draught horfes, 120 young ditto, 14 bulls, 597 
milch cows, 782 young ditto, bulls and ftots ; 433 black cat- 
tle feeding for market; 1090 fheep, viz. 603 of the frnail 
kind and black faced, 338 of a mixed breed between the 
Englifh and Scotch, white faced j a Turkiftj ram brought 
by Colonel FJlejrton from Conftantinople in 1 790, and 48 
lambs the offspring of this foreigner, and ewes of the mixed 
breed. 

There are 4 licenced public houfes in the parifti ; but the 
inhabitants are, in general, very fober and induftrious. Their 
mode of living is much improved within thefe 20 years. 
Their way of living and their induftry have a mutual in- 
fluence. No cuftoms or amufements are peculiar to them. 
Great weddings are faft going into difufe. Country burials 
are not well regulated. The company are invited at 1 1 
o'clock forenoon, but they are, probably, not all arrived at 2. 
Till of late a pipe and tobacco were provided for every one 
of the company ; but this cuftom is entirely laid afide. An 
antient praftife ftill continues in this parifti and neighbour- 
hood of kindling a large fire, or tawnle as it is ufually termed, 
of wood, upon fome eminence, and making merry around it,

boon the eve of the Wednefday of Marymafs fair in Irvine. 
As moft fair days in this country were formerly popiih holy 
days, and their eves were ufually fpent in religious ceremo- 
nies and in diverfions ; it has been fuppofed, that tawnle* 
were fir ft lighted up by our catholic fathers, though fome 
derive their origin from the druidical times. 

The Troone, which might be made an excellent harbour, 
is the weft point of Dundonald pariih. In its natural condi- 
tion, it affords fafe anchoring ground from every quarter but 
the north-weft. It is an arm of rock running near a mile in- 
to the fea, and bending from fouth to north, broad and 
covered with rich pafture towards the land, and narrowing 
into a barren point, part of which is for a little diftance con- 
cealed even at low water. Within the point at half a cables 
length from the rock, the mariner may truft to have three 
fathoms water at half-flood. The merchants of Glafgow, 
fenfible of the advantages of this natural harbour, near a cen- 
tury ago made offer to the proprietor of feuing the lands ad- 
joining to it. But their offer was rejected, for a reafon, as 
it is reported, which however ridiculous it may now appear, 
would be accounted very cogent in thofe days ; left a rife 
fhould be occafioned in the price of butter and eggs. The 
place, where Port-Glafgow now ftands, was deemed by the 
merchants the next ftation moft eligible for their trade. The 
Lady-Ifle, which lies in the mouth of Ayr Bay, is a pendi- 
cle to this pariih ; and, as it affords fecurity to veffels upon 
this flat and dangerous coaft, the Magiftrates of Glafgow have 
erected two pillars to direct them *. Upon the Troone ftands

an elegant clonal temple, built by the late Fullerton, who 
was a gentleman of claffic tafte. This temple commands an 
extenfive profpeft, and is, Baccho laetltiae clatori, amicis et otio

and is ; much reforted to by the inhabitants of Kilmarnock, 
and of other inland parts. People from Elgin carry on filing 
of falmon attheTroone, and the Black-rock which is near a mile 
to the fouthward. In dry fummers they are moft fuccefsful as 
floods give the falmon an opportunity of afcending the neigh- 
bounng rivers. Salmon, when moft abundant, are fold at

J fouth-weft, one half fouth from Irvine, 2 miles weft from 
Iroone-po.nt, 5 miles north north-weft from Ayr, and 24. 
miles north-ealt by eaft from Ailfa. The above bearing are 
afcertained by the compafs, without allowing any variation. 
—In the mfide of this Ifland, oppofite to the main land, 
there is good anchoring ground ; and, for the direction of 
ihips and veflels, 2 ftone beacons are eretfed on the north- 
' J.f P art tJ«eof, of fuch a height as to be eafily feen at a 
d.ftance — The beft anchor ground is where thefe two beacons 
' are brought under one, where there is 5 fathoms water with- 
« in a cable's length of the lhore, and clean ground, which 
' grows gradually deeper for half a mile to the fouth eaft, till 
there is 14 fathoms water, and then it grows gradually flial- 
lower towards the bar of Ayr — There is a ridge of rocks be- 
tween Lady lfle and the Truce-point, about three quarters 
of a mile eaft from the largeft beacon, which is not broad, 
and runs near fduth and north. On this ridge there are, ac 
low water, 3 and 1 half fathoms, and ve/Tds coming too near 
it are only in hazard of damaging their cables.-— The half 
tide rock lies from 1 eight to 1 quarter of a mile north north, 
eaft from the largeft beacon, and is covered at half floods ; 
and there is a channel betwixt it and the Ifland 4 feet deep ac 
low water, where fmall craft may go through, but large vef- 
fels muft keep on the outfide of it.— The rock called Lap- 
poch, about 100 yards in length, is in a line with Irvine ftee- 
ple, the half tide rock, and Lady lfle ; and lies about 1 mile 
and 1 half fouth fouth-weft from the bar of Irvine ; it is dry 
at low water, and has a broad channel betwixt it and the 
main land, from 7 to 8 fathoms deep — Navigated and fur-

4 d. per pound. There are fome lobfters and crabs among 
the' rocks. Some tons of kelp are made, every third or 
fourth year, from the fea weed which grows upon the rocks. 
Colonel Fullerton has lately built a houfe at the Troone, for 
drying the fea -weed thrown in by the furf, and for making 
kelp from it. But, it is very uncertain, whether a manufac- 
ture of this nature will yield a profit fufficient to recompenfe 
the lofs of manure. The Colonel has two extenfive rabbit 
warrens near the fhore ; both of them very thriving. While 
ihe Me of Man remained a diftinft fovereignty, the Troone 
was found to be a very convenient ftation for vefTels employ- 
ed in contraband trade. The Britifh government gave the 
firft check to fmuggling upon this coaft, by purchafing the 
regal power of that petty ftate. Happily the commutation 
aft has nearly annihilated the hoftile traffic. It muft be ac- 
knowledged, "that leflening fome duties to a certain degree 
would not injure the revenue ; and yet more effeftually cut 
up this bufinefs, than a fleet of cutters, or an army of cuftom 
and excife officers. Uncontrovertible evidence muft convince 
every attentive man, living upon the coaft of Ayrfhire, of 
the great wifdom of the apoftle, in joining thofe two pre- 
cepts in one fentence, Fear God, Honour the King. Smug- 
gling, in its very nature, tends to weaken in the dealer that 
fenfe which he has of lawful authority, to difturb his peace, 
to injure his health, to corrupt his manners. Mull it not be 
regretted, that men of aimable difpofitions fhould be feduced 
by the temptations of this trade. Were profit and lofs up- 
on it clearly calculated, the balance would be much againffc 
the profit fide, putting health and peace and character out 
of the queftion. -
