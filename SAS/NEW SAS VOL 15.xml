PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. ANGUS KENNEDY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — " The town and parish of Dornoch," says the writer of 
the last Statistical Account, " derive their name from the Gaelic 
words Dorn-Eich, which signify a horse's foot or hoof, — there be- 
ing a current tradition to this effect: — About the year 1259, the 
Danes and Norwegians having made a descent on this coast, were 
attacked by William, Thane or Earl of Sutherland, a quarter of 
a mile to the eastward of this town. Here the Danish general was 
slain, and his army beaten, and forced to retire to their ships, 
which were not far distant. The Earl of Sutherland greatly 
signalized himself upon this occasion ; and appears, by his personal 
valour and exertion, to have contributed very much to determine 
the fate of the day. While he singled out the Danish general, 
and gallantly fought his way onward, the Thane, being by some 
accident disarmed, seized the leg of a horse which lay on the ground, 
and with that despatched his adversary. In honour of this exploit, 
and of the weapon with which it was achieved, this place received 
the name of Dorneich, or Dornoch, as it is now called. This tra- 
dition is countenanced by the horse-shoe, which is still retained in 
the arms of the burgh." 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish extends in breadth 9 miles 
from E. to W, along the coast of the Frith of Dornoch ; and in 
length from S. to N. or N. W. about 15 miles. It is bounded 
on the east by the Little Ferry, which separates it from the pa- 
rish of Golspie ; on the north and west by the parishes of Ro- 
gart and Criech ; and on the south by the Dornoch Frith, which 
separates it from the county of Ross. 

The parish may be considered as a sort of peninsula ; the Dor- 
noch Frith, which extends considerably beyond it, bounding it on 
the south, and the estuary of the Little Ferry on the east, which

SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



runs up to the Earthen Mound, rising witli a gradual inclination 
from the sea to a range of hills behind. 

Topographical Appearances. — There are no high grounds in this 
parish which deserve the name of mountain, although the name has 
been given to some of them, as Beintarvie, &amp;c. There is a ridge 
of hills behind Skibo, another behind Rearchar, and a third in 
the vicinity of Torboll. The ground on the side of the parish 
next the sea is generally flat ; in some places almost a dead level, 
with the exception of some sandy hillocks, interspersed here and 
there, some of which are naked, and some half-clad with bent and 
whins, afifording a place of refuge for rabbits. 

There are two valleys, or, more properly speaking, straths, in 
this parish : the one. Strath Cairnaig, formed by the river Cair- 
naig. This valley stretches south from Torboll for the space of 
some miles. The other. Strath Achvaich, is near the source of 
the river Evlix, and is of no great extent. 

There is a considerable stretch of sea-coast in the parish, from the 
extreme point of the Meickle Ferry on the west, down the Dornoch 
Frith, to the mouth of the Little Ferry on the east, — and thence up 
that estuary for some miles. The shore is flat and sandy, with the 
exception of a few small rocks to the east of the town, and on the 
shore of Embo. At the Little Ferry, there is an excellent harbour, 
where vessels may lie ingreat security, after having got over the 
bar which runs across the entrance. Coal ships also drop anchor 
below the town to discharge their cargoes. 

Meteorology i Sc. — The climate may be called mild and healthy, 
considering the northern latitude. Snow seldom remains long on 
the sea-coast ; and for several years there have not been the same 
heavy and long-continued falls of snow and the same intense frosts 
as in former times. 

Among the prognostics of unfavourable weather may be noticed 
the tremendous noise that proceeds from the sand banks called 
Gizzing-Briggs, so called from the peculiar sound they make. 
These banks lie almost in the middle of the channel betwixt the 
northern side of the Frith of Dornoch and the coast of the parish 
of Tarbet, and render the navigation up the Frith extremely dan- 
gerous, especially to strangers, without the assistance of a pilot. 
It is observed, also, that the appearances of the Aurora borealis, 

• As a proof of the mildness of oiiv climato, pheasants have been recentlv intro- 
duced at Skibo : Uiey are doing well, and are likely to increase. Walnuts .also fre- 
quently ripen in the garden at Skibo ; and a very fine Ilex tree grow-ing there is a 
proof of the favoumblc climate.

which are sometimes very vivid, are commonly followed by cold and 
stormy weather. 

The prevailing distempers are rheumatism, consumption, and 
inflammatory fevers. 

Hydrography. — The Frith of Dornoch extends at least twenty 
miles beyond this parish. From the Meickle Ferry to the Little 
Ferry, the water is strongly impregnated with salt,"and is found ex- 
cellent for bathing during the summer months. — In the hilly part 
of the parish, there are a few lakes, in which a variety of trouts 
is found, but generally small, and little sought after. — In this 
parish there are the rivers Carnaig and Evlix. The Carnaig 
takes its rise some . miles south of Torboll, and empties itself 
into the Fleet on the sands of Torboll, up to which the tide 
at one time flowed, till arrested by the Earthen Mound. The 
Evlix takes its rise about the head of Strath Achvaich ; and, after 
running about eight or nine miles, with a considerable population 
on each side of it, and its banks beautifully wooded with natural 
birch and alders, it empties itself into the Dornoch Frith, not far 
from the Meickle Ferry. These rivers are not large ; but during 
winter thaws, or heavy rains in summer, they rise rapidly, overflow 
their banks, and in their progress sometimes do considerable 
damage to corn lands. 

Mineralogy. — Coal was found at Clashmore in this parish ; it 
was submitted to Sir Humphry Davy's inspection, and by him pro- 
nounced to be similar to that of Brora. The seam is said to tra- 
verse Ross-shire, and become visible in Coigach. There is a con- 
siderable freestone quarry in the neighbourhood of this town, from 
which stones for building houses and erecting fences are taken. 
There is another on the estate of Embo ; and several inferior ones, 
fit for fences, have recently been discovered in other parts of the 
parish. 

Zoology.~\n this parish are to be found badgers, foxes, otters, ' 
hares, rabbits, roe-deer, and occasionally red-deer ; also grouse, 
black game, partridges, &amp;c. 

There is nothing in this parish that deserves the name of a 
salmon fishing. Abundance of excellent cockles may be found near 
the town when the tide recedes, and westward to the Meickle Fer- 
ry. They are much sought after in their season, and carried to 
a considerable distance in the interior of the country. 

There are also two muscle-scalps near the Meickle Ferry, the 
property of Mr Dempster of Skibo. The Buckie fish ermen re-

pair thither with their large boats for bait, and pay a certain sum 
to the proprietor for each boat-load. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — Amonaf the eminent men connected with this 
parish may be mentioned Sutherland, Lord Duffus, who had a re- 
sidence in Skelbo, the ruins of which are still visible : also the Gor- 
dons of Embo, now represented by Sir Orford Gordon, who re- 
sides in England. The heads of these families acted a conspi- 
cuous part in the feudal quarrels and wars of their times. 

Connected with this parish also, by purchase of lands and bv re- 
sidence, were George Dempster, Esq. of Dunnichen, and John Ha- 
milton Dempster, Esq. his brother. These gentlemen were of a 
younger branch of the ancient family of Dempster of Muresk, in 
the county of Aberdeen, as may be seen by reference to Douglas' 
Baronage of Scotland :  and their grandfather had acquired, 
shortly after the year 1700, the estate of Dunnichen, in Forfar- 
shire, which is now the property, and gives the designation, of the 
elder branch of his descendants. 

Mr George Dempster purchased the estate of Skibo in the j'ear 
1786, and Mr J. H. Dempster shortly after purchased the estates 
of Pulrossie and Over- Skibo. The estates of Skibo and Over- 
Skibo had been purchased from gentlemen of the name of Gray. 
But the estate of Skibo had also been possessed for a few years 
previous to the last Mr Gray by the Honourable George Mackay 
of Reay, by whom the older portions of its woods were planted, and 
to whose taste and industry that part of the parish is much in- 
debted. 

'Mr George Dempster was for twenty-eight years member of Par- 
liament for the Dundee and St Andrews district of burghs. He 
was most active and assiduous in devising measures himself, and in 
encouraging measures planned by others, which had for their ob- 
ject the improvement of his native country. He took an active and 
leading part in promoting its manufactures, its fisheries, and its agri- 
culture. He was a gentleman of great benevolence and suavity of 
manners. While he and his brother remained in Skibo, they were 
much respected by all ranks; and as landlords, they were kind and 
indulgent to their tenants. Mr Dempster died a. d. 1818, aged 86. 

The noble family of Sutherland have a burying-place within the 
church, where the mortal remains of several of its members are 
laid. Over it a neat monument has been erected to the memory of 
the last Earl and the Countess of Sutherland, the parents of the now 

• r. 531. 



DORNOCH.

Duchess Countess of Sutherland, who both died in the flower of 
youth, the one ten days after the other, at Bath, in the year 1766, 
and were buried in one grave in the church at Holy rood- House. 
His lordship had only attained the age of thirty-two, and her lady- 
ship that of twenty-six. This amiable pair were not less ennobled 
by their shining virtues than by their high rank. Their humane 
dispositions and condescending manners had greatly endeared them 
to all orders of society : and their untimely death was deeply felt 
and universally deplored. 

A melancholy event which occurred in July 1833 added to the 
number of those belonging to the noble family of Sutherland, whose 
mortal remains are deposited in the cathedral of Dornoch. George 
Granville Leveson Gower, first'Duke of Sutherland, died at Dun- 
robin Castle on the 19th day of July 1833. His Grace's remains 
are laid in a place prepared for them in the south aisle of the ca- 
thedral ; over which, it is said, the Duchess Countess of Sutherland 
proposes to raise a statue of his Grace, to be executed by Chantry 
of London. The death of the Duke of Sutherland produced a 
deep and universal feeling of regret among all ranks in this country ; 
for his Grace was highly respected by all as a nobleman of most 
honourable principles, and having the comfort of his numerous te- 
nantry at heart. His funeral was attended by the gentlemen and 
tenantry of thirteen parishes in this county, and by the tenantry 
of four parishes from his Grace's estates in Ross-shire ; and the 
procession strikingly testified to the high estimation in which his 
Grace was held, f 

Land-otuners.— These are, the Duchess Countess of Sutherland; 
George Dempster, Esq. of Skibo ; Major George Gunn Munro 
of Poyntzfield; and ]\rs Gordon of Embo. None of the principal 
land-owners reside in the parish,, except Mr Dempster. 

Parochial Registers: — A register of baptisms has been kept, 
though sometimes not very regularly, since 13th August 1730 ; and 
a register of marriages, since 13th August 1734. These registers 
have been always under the charge of the parochial schoolmaster 
for the time being, who acts also as clerk to the kirk-session, and 
receives a small fee for every act of registration. When the school

+ While preparations were inaking in the cathedral for the Duke of Sutherland's 
luneral, a leaden coflin was discovered in the buiying-placeof the noble family, having 
'"scription that it contained the remains of John, the twentieth 
'.arl ol hntherlimd, who " died .liine 27, 1733," a little more than a century before 
10 Duke's death. IIis Lordship's codin was covered widi another, and laid up with 
an Uuc respect and care in the same burying-placo again.

became vacant, the registration was much neglected. Since the year 
1817, however, both registers have been kept correctly. 

Great inconvenience, and even loss to individuals, having been 
experienced from the want of a register of deaths, to which refe- 
rence could be made, — a register of that description has been kept 
by the minister of the parish since January 1821, which, if con- 
tinued by his successors, may prove useful to succeeding genera- 
tions. 

Antiquities. — The picturesque remains of the old castle of Skel- 
bo, formerly the residence of the family of Sutherland, Lord Duf- 
fus, still remain. This castle was built on an eminence, rising ab- 
ruptly from the sea side, near the Little Ferry. 

The castle of Skibo, once a residence of the Bishops of Caith- 
ness and Sutherland, was demolished in the last century. Within 
its walls the celebrated Marquis of Montrose was confined subse- 
quently to his being taken in Assynt ; and from Skibo he was con- 
veyed to Edinburgh, where he was executed. " 

In memory of the event which gave its name to the burgh, a 
stone pillar was erected on the spot, supporting at the top a cross, 
encompassed by a circle, which went under the name of the 
Earl's cross. The lapse of ages had, however, somewhat defaced 
this monument. But it has been repaired, and is still standing. 
III. — Population. 

By the Government census of 1821, the population of the town 
and parish was found to be 3100. By the census of 1831, it was 
3380 ; and would have been 300 more, had there not been a par- 
tial emigration to British America to that amount from the parish 
during that and the previous year. It is but justice to the landed 
proprietors to add, that this emigration was purely voluntary on 
the part of the emigrants ; that anost of them left the parish in 
comfortable circumstances; and that the situations which they left 
open were soon occupied by others. The population, it may be 
safely asserted, is still on the increase. 

The increase of population may be accounted for by persons of 
various classes coming from the east and south country, and settling 
in the parish,— by a general inclination to marry young : when 
out farm-servants, of whom the number is considerably increased 
by the erection of large farms, get barracks for themselves, they 
marry : when a young man gets a croft of land, he marries : 
when a, fisherman becomes jiossessed of a quarter share of a boat, 
he builds a house, and marries. Second marriages also, of which

there are not a few, contribute to the increase of the population. 
There is one instance of a marriage in which both parties were 
married for the fourth time.

Language, Habits, Sj-c. of the People. — The vernacular language 
is still the Gaelic ; from which also almost all the names of places 
are manifestly derived. In that language, JazYe signifies a town. 
Hence Tor-baile, Kerr-baile, Eiin-baile, Skia-baile, compounded 
of that word and others, signifying respectively mount, rock, fowl, 
wing; and these names indicate the figure, situation, or other cir- 
cumstances of the places to which they are applied. Some places 
in the vicinity of the cathedral have been denominated from the 
offices of those who formerly held them ; as Crofn Espiq, Au- 
chintreasurich, Auchinchanter, signifying the Bishop's, Treasurer's, 
and Chanter's fields. "Jhis language has, however, lost ground 
considerably during the last twenty-five years, owing to the influx 
into the parish, from various parts of the kingdom, of persons who 
speak the English language, but especially to the introduction of 
schools, first Gaelic and then EngHsh, into every district of the parish . 
The predilection for the Gaelic language is, however, still manifest, 
from the well-known facts, that the common people prefer to use 
it in their ordinary intercourse, and that larger congregations at- 
tend public worship during the Gaelic services than during the 
English. Nevertheless, the English is making rapid encroach- 
ments on our ancient language; and it is not improbable that, 
in the course of sixty or seventy years, the latter may be ex- 
tinct. 

The habits of the people in regard to cleanliness have improved 
considerably. Instead of their feal-houses, in which it was scarcely 
possible to maintain cleanliness, they have now generally neat cot- 
tages, built of stone and clay, and harled with lime, having chim- 
nies, mstead of the fire-place being in the middle of the house, as 
formerly,— there being then no outlet for smoke except by the 
door, or a hole in the roof. 

A great improvement has also taken place in their dress, parti- 



8 



SUTHEBLANDSHIRE, 



cularly in that of the young of both sexes. This also they have 
learned from those who came from other parts to reside in the 
parish. 

Potatoes have become the principal article of food here, as, in- 
deed, they are throughout all the Highlands. They serve as the 
chief subsistence of the people during one-half of the year, and 
with some even for two-thirds. Many of the people come from 
a considerable distance for cockles, of which abundance may be 
had in their season on the sands of Dornoch. They go also for 
haddocks to the fishing town of Embo ; and since the herring-fish- 
ing was established at Helmsdale, many go there, purchase and 
cure herrings, and carry them home in casks in their own small 
carts : they thus provide themselves with wholesome food. 

The people here are rather above the middle size. They are 
in general well-made and handsome, and the women, comely. 
On the whole, they are a moral and religious people ; industri- 
ous, peaceable, and respectful to their superiors. With very few 
exceptions they regularly attend public worship ; and their decent 
appearance on Sabbath days indicates their comfortable circum- 
stances. 

Poaching and illicit distillation are now scarcely known among 
them. 

During the last three years there were 4 illegitimate births : 
but in three of the cases the parties were afterwards married. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — During the last fifteen or 
twenty years agricultural improvements have been carried on mth 
wonderful activity, and to a great extent, in this parish, especially 
on the Sutherland estate. On that estate, there are 4000 acres of 
arable land under the plough, besides 2000 acres of waste ground 
improved, and carrying crops. 

Lnprovements. — Among the improvements on waste-land it may 
be mentioned that the fresh-water lake, at a place called Balvraid, 
near the county road, has been thoroughly drained and prepared, 
and is now laid down in crop. The highly improved appearance 
of the spot holds out a prospect of remunerating the expense in a 
few years. It may be observed also, that, by the erection of the 
earthen mound across the estuary of the Little Ferry, from thirty 
to forty acres of valuable carse ground, over which tlie tide for- 
merly used to flow, have been brought under the plough, and are

now carrying heavy crops of wheat, &amp;c. A still greater extent has 
been reclaimed on the Golspie side of the estuary. 

The contents of the principal farms on the Sutherland estate 
may be stated as follows : — Sidera, 196 acres ; Evlix, 154 ; Farms, 
1820, 1821, 1822, 344; AchleyQl; Pitgrudie, 133; Auchurach 
and Auchinchaunter, 84; CouU; 203; Skelbo, 323; East Balvraid, 
192; West Balvraid, 54; Cambusmore, 104; TorboU, 145; 
Pronsienain, 89 ; Pronsienaird, 132; Kinauld, 100; Trentham, 
150, — all imperial acres. The parks are, at an average, from 10 
to 15 acres each. The average rent of old arable land is L. 1, 5s. 
per acre ; — that of improved waste land, 5s. 

Besides the principal farms which have been stated above, there 
are a great many lots, or small holdings, ranking from two to five 
or six acres, which are receiving yearly accessions from waste 
land by the industry of the occupiers ; and though the average 
rent of improved waste land be stated at 5s. per acre, it is a well- 
known fact, that many of these cottars pay only a rent of Is. each, 
some 2s., and so on, in a gradual scale, — an increase of rent not 
being so much the object of the noble proprietors, as the improve- 
ment of the soil, and the comfort of their numerous tenantry; in 
which liberal objects they have succeeded. 

On the estate of Skibo there are 800 acres of arable land : and 
besides a great number of smaller holdings, there are four large 
farms, highly improved, and rented each at about L. 150. On 
this estate also, a good deal has been done in reclaiming waste 
land; but much more in the parish of Criech, where the greater 
part of Mr Dempster's estate lies, and in which he has very ex- 
tensive plantations of firs and hard-wood. 

On the estate of the Duchess Countess of Sutherland in this 
parish, there are plantations to the extent of 2500 acres, consisting 
of Scotch firs and larches, birch, and hard-wood. To these it is 
in contemplation to make considerable additions. There are be- 
sides 300 acres of natural birch and alder. 

On Mr .Dempster's estate there are plantations to the extent 
of 350 acres, a considerable part of which is hard-wood. There 
are some ashes and planes of great size. The rest consists of 
Scotch firs and larches. On the estate of Embo there may be 
from 30 to 40 acres of Scotch fir, but, though old, very stinted in 
growth. 

On the estate of Embo there is only one large farm, consist- 
ing of about 200 acres of arable land, of which from 30 to 40

have been reclaimed from waste land. It is enclosed and subdi- 
vided by stone fences, and in a high state of cultivation. The 
rest of the estate is let to small tenants, and they, of late, have 
adopted a rotation of crops. 

Major Gunn Munro's estate in this parish lies in the vicinity of 
the burgh, and the greater part of it is well-farmed by a gentleman 
residing in the town. The rest of it is also well-farmed by two in- 
dustrious individuals, who now grow wheat, where they formerly cut 
peats. 

The steadings on the large farms throughout the parish are 
generally good and commodious. Attached to several of them 
is a thrashing-machine. These are of various powers, according 
to the size of the farm. Some of them are wrought by water, and 
some by horses. 

The ordinary duration of.leases here is nineteen years. 

Live-Stock. — As to the live-stock in the parish, it is only ne- 
cessary to observe, that the breeds of black cattle and horses, 
particularly the latter, have been greatly improved of late years. 
Cheviot sheep have also been introduced into store farms, and have 
succeeded well. 

Husbandry. — The five-course shift is the rotation of crops 
adopted in the parish, — 1. oats; 2. turnips and potatoes ; 3. barley 
and grass seeds ; 4. hay or pasture ; and, 5. pasture. On account 
of the low price of barley, the wheat husbandry has been recently 
introduced. The produce is sent on consignment to Leith, where 
it is sold at the prices of the time ; but the grower has to submit 
to a heavy deduction for freight, agency, &amp;c. — not less than 4s. 
per quarter. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of farm-servants are various. The 
principal servant has generally L. 8 per annum, six bolls of oat- 
meal, a pint of skimmed milk per diem, or an agreed equivalent 
for it, — some eight, some ten barrels of coals, a certain extent of 
land for potatoes, and a free house. Young men hired by the 
half-year have from L. 2 to L. 2, 10s., with cost and lodgings. 
The wages of female-servants for the half-year are generally from 
L. 1, 10s. to L. 2, with victuals in the house. The wages of able- 
bodied men for day-labour are from Is. to Is. 6d. ; those of the 
women, 6d., except when at harvest work, when they have Is. ; but 
no -victuals in either case. 

The daily operations of various kinds lhat are necessary on 



DORNOCH. 



11 



large farms furnish employment to all in their vicinity who are able 
and willing to work. 

Quarries, -c. — There is a considerable freestone quarry in the 
neighbourhood of this town, from which stones for building houses 
and erecting fences are taken : and there have been several other 
quarries recently opened in other parts of the parish ; but none 
of these are equal to that in the vicinity of Dornoch, except one 
at Embo. 

Fisheries. — There is no regular fishery in the parish. There 
is, indeed, a colony of fishermen at Embo ; but they only fish for 
haddocks, small cods, flounders, &amp;c. which they sell in the fresh 
state. The women carry the fish in creels on their backs to this 
town, and throughout the parish, and sell it as they best can. The 
fishermen also frequently go across with their boats to the shore 
of Tain, where they dispose of their fish to advantage. Of late 
years they have engaged in the herring-fishing, by hiring them- 
selves to fish-curers for the season, — the fish deliverable in the fresh 
state at so much per crane, and the nets being provided by the fish- 
ermen. The curers allow a certain quantity of whisky to each 
boat's crew. To the credit of the fishermen at Embo, it should 
be observed, that, with a few exceptions, they are sober and in- 
dustrious, and some of them pious. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Burgh. — Dornoch is the only market-town in the parish, and 
the only Royal Burgh in the county. It was erected into a royal 
burgh by a charter from Charles I. a. d. 1628. The council consists 
of fifteen members, including the provost, four bailies, a dean of guild, 
and treasurer. 'By the constitution and practice of the burgh, four 
of the councillors are annually changed. This is one of five which 
compose what is called the northern district of burghs. It has no 
landed property, nor any other source of revenue except the cus- 
toms levied at six annual fairs held here, and which are on the de- 
chne. But this may be accounted for by the recent establishment 
of two other fairs,— one in the village of Golspie, and another in 
the parish of Clyne,— and by the great number of retail-shops 
found here and there through the parish and the county. 

The population of the town is little more than 500, but appears 
to be rather on the increase. The Sheriff-substitute and Sheriff- 
clerk, one writer, two messengers-at-arms, reside in the town. We 
havealso apost-officc. The northern royal mail-coach passes through 
the town twice every day. This is an advantage to the burgh, as 



12 



SUTIIERLANJJSHIRE. 



strangers travelling by the coach for business or for pleasure, may 
find good entertainment in a commodious and well-kept inn. 

There are here also five retail-shopkeepers, two saddlers, one 
baker, one butcher, though not in constant employment, three 
blacksmiths, three shoemakers, several house-carpenters, masons, 
tailors, and weavers. 

Within the last twenty years there was a considerable number 
of small uncomfortable feal-houses in the town ; but these gradual- 
ly gave way to neat and comfortable cottages, most of them two 
stories high. The streets are clean, and the approaches to the 
town from every quarter have been much improved. The com- 
munication with the town is open in every direction by excellent 
roads and bridges, which are kept in annual repair. The Maca- 
damizing system is adopted on the county roads. Indeed, the 
whole parish is intersected with roads and bridges ; and with these 
there is another great advantage, — there are no tolls. Not a toll 
is to be seen in the county of Sutherland. Hence, carriages, gigs, 
and carts may be seen on Sabbath days carrying some of the good 
people to church. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands in the middle of the 
town. It consists of three aisles of the old cathedral, — the fourth 
has been long in ruins ; but these venerable ruins point out to the 
admiring beholder what was their ancient grandeur. 

Dornoch was formerly the seat of the Bishop of Caithness. 
The precise time of the erection of the See is not ascertained. 
Andrew, Bishop of Caithness, had his seat here in 1150: and in 
1222, Gilbert Murray was consecrated bishop. The latter is sup- 
posed to have built the cathedral. He died at Scrabster, in Caith- 
ness, where the bishops also had a residence in 1245 ; and was af- 
terwards canonized. A statue of him is still shewn in the church 
of Dornoch, under the name of St Gilbert, but it is not entire. The 
last bishop, Andrew Wood, was translated hither from the Isles 
in the year 1680, and remained till the Revolution in 1688. 

In the year 1570, the cathedral, except the steeple, was burnt 
by the master of Caithness ; but it " hath been of late re-edified 
and repaired by Sir Robert Gordon, tutour of Southerland, which 
work was interprysed and begun by John Erie of Southerland, 
last deceased, a little before his death." At what time the ca- 
thedral received its present roof, which is comparatively modern, 
I cannot ascertain. For a long time after it was occupied as a 
Presbyterian place of worship, the congregation met on ihe 



DORNOCH. 



13 



ground-floor, — which was also occupied as a buryiiig-ground for fa- 
milies of distinction. But this was found to be most inconvenient 
and unwholesome, both for the minister and congregation, the roof 
being stupendously high, and the house very cold in winter. To 
remedy these inconveniences, it was agreed by all concerned, about 
sixty years ago, that the church should be lofted at the height 
of seven feet from the ground. To this upper story, which is the 
present place of worship, the ascent is by stairs from without. 
The last repair which was given to the church was in 1816, when its 
lofty roof was ceiled, and additional accommodation was given by 
the erection of a gallery in the easter aisle ; notwithstanding which, 
there is not yet suflBicient accommodation for an increasing popu- 
lation. Another gallery is still necessary. The number of sit- 
tings in the church cannotbe exactly ascertained; they are probably 
from 1000 to 1100; but it is a well known fact, that the pews are 
generally crowded to inconvenience, and that, in fine weather, some 
have to sit on the tops of the pews for want of room. Arrange- 
ments are, however, in contemplation, which may remedy this in- 
convenience.  

The pews have been divided by the heritors according to their 
valued rents ; and their tenants have free access to them. So far 
as I know, there are no seat-rents exacted. The poor sit on. the 
forms connected with the communion tables, and in the passages. ■ 

The great body of the people are within six miles of the church; 
some at the distance of seven or eight miles, and in one district 
about twelve miles. The people in this last district are within a 
mile of the parish church of Rogart, where they attend public wor- 
ship. They are, however, catechised annually by their own parish 
minister. 

The manse was built about sixty years ago. The last repairs to 
it were given in the year 1825, when some additional accommo- 
dations were given by the heritors. It ought to be recorded here, 
to the honour of the heritors of the parish, that no meeting of pres- 
bytery was rendered necessary during the last eighteen years to 
obtain the accommodations which the clergyman required. 

The glebe is about twelve imperial acres, all arable; but the 
greater part of it is of httle value, the soil being so very sandy and 

 Since writing the above, the Duchess Countess of Sutherland has announced her 
intention of repairing the wester aisle, which lias been so long in ruins, at her own 
expense, and to fit it up as a part of the place for public worship. Also to re- 
pair the other aisles of the cathedral. The work is to be commenced next spriuR. 
I here are to be some free sittings for tlie poor.

light, that durhig the high winds which prevail from March to June, 
it is drifted in every direction like fresh laid snow. 

The stipend was augmented on 6th February 1832, from four- 
teen chalders, and L.8, 6s. 8d., to seventeen chalders, and L. 10 for 
providing the communion elements. The victual is half meal, half 
barley, imperial standard weights and measures. 

There is one catechist in the parish, appointed by the Com- 
mittee on the Royal Bounty, with a salary of L. 7. 

There is no chapel of any description here : no Dissenters from 
the Established church; and only one family of Seceders, who 
almost regularly attend public worship in the parish church. 

The aterage annual amount of parochial collections for religious 
and charitable purposes may be stated at L. 28 or L. 30. 

Education. — There are seven schools in the parish, of which 
three are in the town, — the parochial school, a female school on the 
second patent of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, and another female school without salary, the teacher 
depending on the school-fees. In the landward parish are two 
schools on the General Assembly's scheme, and two on that of the 
Glasgow AuxiHary Gaelic School Society; besideswhich, the people 
in remote small districts hire a young lad to teach their children dur- 
ing the winter quarter ; after which the school breaks up till next 
winter. The Holy Scriptures and the Assembly's Shorter Cate- 
chism are taught in all these schools. Many are taught also to read 
the Bible in Gaelic. Dr Thomson's Enghsh school-books are in- 
troduced into most of them. Arithmetic, book-keeping, English 
grammar, and Latin, are taught. The parochial schoolmaster has 
the maximvlm salary, with a large house and garden. The school- 
fees are of no great value, — not exceeding L. 6. The teachers 
belonging to the Glasgow Society have L. 14 each : those employ- 
ed by the General Assembly's Committee, have each L. 20 of sa- 
lary, besides fees. Suitable dwelling and school-houses are pro- 
vided by the heritors in all these cases. The schoolmistress at 
Dornoch has a salary of L. 8, with a good house and garden. 

It may be observed in general, that the fees in all these schools 
are of very little value ; that, so desirous are the people to give the 
advantages of education to their children that some are sent to 
school at the age of five ; that female education is better attended 
to than formerly ; and that during last winter nearly 500 attended 
schools. 

About 700 persons in the parish are unable to read, above six 



DORNOCH. 



15 



years of age ; and about 250, betwixt the years of six and fif- 
teen. 

Friendly Society. — There is a friendly society in this town of 
some standing; but it does not appear to be in a prosperous state, 
as last year its dissolution was talked of. 

Savings Bank. — A branch of a general savings bank for the 
county was lately set up here. Nothing can yet be said of it but 
that the people shew a desire to vest their savings in it. It is 
under the patronage of the noble family of Sutherland, who give 
every encouragement to the people to vest their money in it, and 
to promote provident habits among the working-classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds, — The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid may be considered on an average at from 120 to 
130. The funds for the poor, which are distributed only once a 
year, consist of collections made in church on Sabbath days, in- 
cluding what is given on marriage occasions, which may amount to 
L. 36 ; the dues for the use of the mortcloths, amounting to about 
L. 3, 10s. ; an annual gratuity of L. 6 from the Duchess Countess 
of Sutherland; and L. 25, the interest of L. 500. The late Duke of 
Sutherland, who did not need to borrow money, very humanely took 
this sum from the kirk-session, and allowed the above liberal inte- 
rest for it. The lowest sum which is given to any of the poor is 
6s., the highest is L. 1, 5s. There is a strong tendency among the 
lower classes to apply for relief to the parish funds. It must be 
added, that the Duchess gives also annual gratuities to several poor 
and aged individuals, — one of which, I know, amounts to L. 4 ; and 
that, besides these stated gratuities, the Noble family always gives 
a liberal supply of victuals to the poor on their estates, in time of 
scarcity. 

Prisons.—The only prison in the county is in this town. It 
was once the bishop's palace, which, from its remains, appears to 
have been a stately edifice. In 1567, George Earl of Caithness 
sent his son John with some of his people, to invest the town and 
Castle of Dornoch, of which the Murrays, a tribe attached to the 
noble family of Sutherland, had possessed themselves. The Mur- 
rays, no longer able to mahitain the ground they had occupied, retired 
to the castle; upon which the master of Caithness burnt the town and 
cathedral; but still the besieged defended themselves in the castle 
for a month. At length, however, they were obliged to capitu- 
late. Whether the castle was dismantled at that time, I have no 
means of ascertaining; but it is well known that it lay in ruins for 



13 SUTHEULANDSHIRK. 

a great length of time, till, in 1814, it was roofed and repaired ; 
it has since been occupied as a court-house, a record-room, and 
a iail. The number of prisoners in the jail durmg the year 183d 
was 20. Of these three were for debt, six for smugghng, one 
for theft, and ten for assaults of various kinds. The prison is, 
upon the whole, comfortable and well-secured. One of the surgeons 
in the parish has a salary for attending any of the prisoners when 

""/nns, 4-c.— In the town there is an excellent principal inn ; and 
also two houses Ucensed to sell whisky. One of these with the inn 
would be quite sufficient. There are two other respectable inns 
in the parish, one at the Meickle Ferry, and another at Clashmore 
There are three licensed houses in the parish, all of which could 
be well dispensed with, as they prove injurious to the morals and 
the means of the people, particularly of the young, among the work- 
ing-classes. It should be stated to the credit of the magistrates 
here, as well as throughout the county, that they have suppressed 
several of these dram-shops. j i u 

Fuel— CoAs imported from Newcastle have been used here by 
the better classes in town and country, for the last twenty years at 
least They are purchased at Dornoch, at from Is. lOd. to 2s. per 
barrel, and carried home in carts. Peats are still used by the com- 
mon people.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. MURDO CAMERON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This large parish extends from the 
parish of Dornoch on the east to the parish of Assynt on the 
west, — a distance of not less than thirty-five miles. Its breadth 
is not, however, proportionate, varying from five to seven or eight 
miles in the eastern part, and narrowing towards the west. It is 
bounded on the north by the parishes of Dornoch and Lairg ; and 
the Frith of Dornoch and its continuation, the river Oykell, forms 
its southern boundary. 

Topographical Appearances. — The greater part of the parish is 
mountainous, or rather hilly, for, excepting at its junction with As- 
synt, there is no very great elevation. 

It contains numerous lakes, including those of Migdale, Gour, 
Laggan, Buie, Laro, &amp;c., — which all abound with small trout ; but 
none of these lakes are of any great extent. They have been exa- 
mined and found to contain no marl. 

Hydrography.— The rivers which find their way to the Frith of 
Dornoch in this parish are the Shinn, the Oykell and the Cassley, 
—the confluence of the two last of which forms the Frith, and is the 
point to which the tide flows. These rivers all contain salmon, 
and are regularly fished. Chalybeate springs are numerous. 

Mineralogy. — A mineralogical survey of part of this parish, 
made in 1789 by R. E. Raspe, a German mineralogist, employ- 
ed by Mr Dempster, reports that it does not contain any minerals 
worthy of notice. Coal, which is found in an adjoining parish, is 
not found here : and it is uncertain whether there be limestone. 

There is at Rosehall a small vein of fine-grained, ponderous, 
sohd, bluish-gray manganese, as perfect and free of iron as is 

SUTHERLAND. B

ever seen. It is not, however, above five inches wide, and would 
not repay labour. 

Soil— There is not in the parish very much variety of soil : 
the usual gravelly and peaty soil of the mountains preponderates 
over every other. There is some good clay soil at Pulrossie, at 
Flode, at Rosehall, and elsewhere on the shores of the Frith. 
At Rosehall is to be found fine natural meadow pasture ; and the 
hills are pastured by sheep and cattle. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners.— The land-owners of this parish, and their valued 

rents, are as follows : 



Scots. 



George Dempster, Esq. of Skibo, - - Ino 1 a 

Her Grace the Duchess of Sutherland, - - ™ » 

Sir Charles Ross, Bart., - - - " IKn n n 

Right Honourable Lady Ashburton, - - Jio o 

Dugald Gilchrist, Esq. of Ospisdale, - - - M}d b » 

L. 2983 19 7 

The last is the only resident heritor ; and the real rent, exclu- 
sive of salmon-fishings, may be about L. 3700 Sterhng per an- 
num. 

Antiquities.— In the 11th or 12th century a contest of the 
inhabitants with the Danes is recorded to have occurred at Drin- 
leah, near Bonar Bridge, whence the invaders were driven back 
with great loss to their ships at Portnacoulter,— now the Meikle 
Ferry. 

The extraordinary number of tumuli or graves on the scene of 
action, while they attest the truth of the tradition, and the great- 
ness of the slaughter, cannot fail to excite the wonder of reflect- 
ing persons at the great numbers who must have been engaged, 
and the consequent density of the population at that remote time. 
Many of these tumuli have been opened, but nothing was found 
except three or four large stones artificially arranged in each. 

On the summit of the Doune or hill of Criech there is a spe- 
cimen of those very puzzling relics of antiquity, the vitrified forts. 
It is considered by persons conversant with these appearances as a 
good specimen, and has been visited and described by Sn- George 
S. Mackenzie, Bart., and by others.

The Gaelic language is spoken in the parish ; but the English 
has now gained so much ground, that it may be said to be spoken 
by the greater number of the inhabitants. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy — Wood. — There is a natural 
oak-wood of great beauty at Ledmore, the divided property of the 
Duchess of Sutherland and Mr Dempster of Skibo, of about 150 
acres. The bark of the portion which belongs to the latter owner 
was sold last year for L. 500, and that of the former was sold 
some years ago for a much larger sum. 

There is also some natural oak and birch at Rosehall, and in 
one or two other places ; but, excepting some large oaks, it is not 
valuable, nor attended to. 

The oldest planted wood in the parish is the hard-wood at Os- 
pisdale, and the fir-wood at Rosehall ; but this last, from being 
grown in a soil too rich, is considered of bad quality. 

A considerable extent, chiefly of fir and larch, was planted thirty 
or forty years ago on the estates of Skibo and Pulrossie ; and the 
present proprietor has already added upwards of 1500 acres, con- 
sisting of larch and fir, chiefly the former, with oak and other 
forest trees in smaller quantity. Mr Houston of Creech, who 
has recently sold his property to the Duke of Sutherland and Mr 
Gilchrist of Ospisdale, have also planted considerably; and, on the 
whole, the extent of growing wood in this parish cannot be less 
than 2500 acres, and on the estate of Skibo it is yearly increasing. 
All sorts of hard-wood sell readily, and at good prices, and the ex- 
port of pit-wood from the fir plantations is considerable. 

It has been found impracticable to ascertain the quantity of 
land cultivated and uncultivated, and the amount of gross pro- 

Rent.—The largest corn farm in the parish yields about L. 300 
per annum, and there are half a dozen others giving betwixt L 50 
and L. 200. 

The rent of sheep grazing is from 2s. to 4s., and of cattle from 
5s. to 10s. according to the size of the cattle and quality of the 
pasture. 

Hmhandrij,— There are no sheep-farms in this parish, except 
one at Auchinduich, occupied by Mr Marshall, the property of the 
Uuchess of Sutherland, and one in Inverchasly, occupied bv Messrs 



20 SUTHERLANDSIIIRE. 

Rose and Murray, the property of Sir Charles Ro.s of Balna- 
gown, Baronet. The breed of sheep in both these farms is chiefly 
Cheviot, and generally fetches the highest price. Improvements 
in these farms'are earned to the highest pitch. The rec annmg 
of waste lands, draining, and irrigation, has been carried on in 
this parish by landlords and tenants, of late years, rapidly and snc- 
cessfuUy The general duration of leases is from seven to mne- 
e n years. The farm-buildings on large farms, as well as mclo- 
suresf are in general complete and comfortable, and the small far- 
xners and cottars follow the example of their superiors 

Q„,;,,._There are in the parish two quarries of whinstone, 

both verv hard to work. , 

FishJies.-The only valuable river fishe is the salmon fish- 
ing of the river Shin, the property of the Duchess o SuUiland, 
who also has in lease all the salmon fishings along the Kyle, be- 
Wing to the estate of Skibo, which are worked and generally 
with success by fishers employed under her Grace. 

NavigatJ-o ships or vessels of any description belong to 
the parish. But several vessels trade to Bonar Bridge, of fiom 
30 to 60 tons burden, importing meal, coals, and hme ; and ex- 
porting fir props, wool, oak-bark, corn, and salmon. 

V Parochial Economy. 

Market-Tocn and ViUaffes.-Theve are no market-towns in the 
mrish and the nearest is Dornoch. _ 
' A vilLe and cotton manufactory were established at Spinning- 
dalt by Mr Dempster of Dunnichen, in the latter part of the last 
cent'uryVbut the destruction of the factory by fire in 1809 has 
hPPn followed by the decay of the village. 

TWntrica/position o/boiw Bridge, situated ate .i. 
trance of the county, and at the unction of the Assynt Keaj, 
cXess, and Ross-shire roads, has pointed it out since the erec- 
tio" of th magnificent iron bridge in 1813, as the site of a fu- 

town. Ml- Dempster is feuing ounA l.ere

n"ul growth which experience has shown to be the most secure 
r n Htion of a town. The great Kyle markets, as they are cal- 
trfo he at. of the cattleof Sutherland and Caithness, are now 
Iti in the monthsof July, Aigust, and Sept- - A ;

very inconvenient place at Portenleik, where they have hitherto 
been held. 

Bonar Bridge is already a place of considerable export and im- 
port, having the advantage of depth of water sufficient for ship- 
ping. 

There is no village at Newton, but it is used as a shipping place 
for the wool, corn, wood, &amp;c. of this parish. 

Means of Communication. Bonar Bridge. — The first and most 
useful among the means of communication in the parish is the 
bridge of Bonar, consisting of one large metal arch and two smal- 
ler stone arches : it opens the communication between Sutherland 
and Ross-shires, as well as to the most distant parts of the coun- 
try, south and north. It was erected by Government and the 
county ; as were also the roads leading from it. 

The first road, from Bonar to Assynt and the west coast, has 
three bridges ; one of two arches over the river Shin ; one of a 
single arch over the river Caslie ; and one of a single arch over the 
river Oykell. This public road runs through the parish from Bo- 
nar to within a few miles of the manse of Assynt, a distance of 
about thirty miles. The second public road from Bonar is by 
Lairg to Tongue, at the north coast. The third public road from 
Bonar recently opened is made through the middle of the pa- 
rish in mosses and hills, towards the Fleet Mound and the east 
coast of Sutherland. It extends within the parish a distance of 
seven miles, and has a bridge of one arch over a small river. The 
fourth public road from Bonar is towards Dornoch and the east 
coast. This road within the parish extends a distance of eight 
miles, and there are two small bridges upon it at Spinningdale and 
Ospisdale. These four roads were made by Government and the 
county. There are, besides, several private roads with bridges 
through the different inhabited straths and glens ; which render 
the communication through the parish both easy and comfortable 
in all seasons of the year. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the 
shore, about nine miles from the east end of the parish, and up- 
wards of thirty miles from the west end. It is convenient for the 
greater part of the population from the river Shin in the west, to 
Ospisdale in the east. The church was built in 1790, has been 
repan-ed at different periods, and is now in a good state. It accom- 
niodates 500 persons. There are no free seats, except the commu- 
nion forms occupied by the poor.

The manse was built in 1780, and has undergone many repairs. 
The o-lebe is about five acres in extent, and would be valued at 
L 7 " The stipend is fourteen chalders of victual, half barley, 
and 'half oatmeal, paid in money betwixt Yule and Candlemas, 
by the fiar prices ; there are also L. 10 of money allowed for com- 
munion elements. , p • i 

There is a mission at Rosehall in the west end of the parish, 
connected with the Royal Bounty. There is also a catechist paid 
by the Royal Bounty the sum of L. 7, 10s. with a small gratuity from 

Thm-etre no Dissenters or Seceders of any description in this 
parish 400 families attend the church, and from these about 700 
persons. Divine service is generally well attended by all ranks. 
The number of communicants attending the parish and mission- 
churches niay average about 90. , j • • i 

The average amount of collections yearly made in the parish 
and mission-churches for religious societies is from L. 9 to 
L 12 

' Education.— There are three schools, viz. the parochial school 
in Criech, taught by Mr Patrick Murray and his son, Mr David 
Murray, student of philosophy. There are also two Assembly 
schools, one at Inverchaslie, and another at Whiteface. Both the 
Assembly schools are well attended and very successful, as may be 
seen by the Reports. The branches taught there are English 
and Gaelic reading and spelling ; writing, arithmetic, and book- 
keeping, and Latin, &amp;c. . x « j i, i 
The salary of the parish schoolmaster is L. 30 ; and the school- 
fees are from Is. to 3s. per quarter, according to the branches of 
education taught, but do not yield above L. 10 a year The pa- 
rochial teacher had hardly any accommodation for upwards ot twen- 
ty years back, being obhged to live in a house that was falhng over

was obliged to quit that ruin and live in a hired house. 1 he heri- 
tors promise to build one, but it is not yet begun.  lie ex- 
pense of education is various,— from 5s. to 14s. per annum. i he 
people in general are very much alive to the benefits of education ; 
so much so, that the families who are at a distance from school club 
together to support a teacher that goes from house to house once a- 
week. Inveran and Linside in the mission are seven miles distant 
from any school, and at present employ a teacher, who has generally

from forty to sixty attending his school at Invershin. Two additional 
schools are required, one at Inveran and neighbourhood, and one 
in Aurdale of Airdines, at each of which there might be an at- 
tendance of from forty to sixty. A very great and visible change 
to the better has taken place in the conduct and morals of the 
people within the last twenty years, during which time not less than 
eighteen teachers were introduced among them in different parts 
of the parish ; all these with stated salaries from diiferent benevo- 
lent societies. There are still about 800 persons in the parish 
above six years of age unable to read, and about 400 in that 
state betwixt the years of six and fifteen. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers at the 
parish church and mission may average about 140, who receive 
annually from the funds collected in church from 3s. to 6s. each. 
The annual collections in the churches may amount to L. 16: and 
there is also the interest of L. 150, a fund in the Commercial 
Bank, Tain. The total amount for annual distribution is about 
L. 20. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sfc. — There is one inn at Bonar, and five or 
six alehouses in different parts of the parish ; but the people sel- 
dom exceed a necessary refreshment.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER MACPHERSON, A.M., MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Name— Tht name of this parish is, in the Gaehc language, 
pronounced Goishbee. Situated-in the maritime parts of the High- 
lands, the parish has, like many other places, in all probabihty, re- 
ceived its name from the ancient northern invaders, who for a time 
were possessors of these parts. The attempts which have been made 
to derive the name from the Gaelic language seem forced and unsatis- 
factory The ancient name of the parish was Culmallie,— denot- 
ing that the church or chapel had been dedicated to some tutelary 

EM and Boundaries.— The form of the parish is an oblong, 
stretching along the coast; its length is about eight iBiles, and 
breadth about six. The parish is bounded on the north by e 
parishes of Rogart and Clyne ; on the east by the latter and the 
Moray Frith; on the south by that frith; and on the west by 
the small inlet, which bears the name of Little Ferry, and the 

stream called Fleet. . 

Topographical Appearances.-The hills near the oast are 
a BlLlidi -tih is about 1300 feet in height above the level of 
;f eaf theS7..-M and the M both much lower; 

and, in the interior, Beinn Horn 1712, and Ben Me, 1464 
feet in height. In the middle of the parish there is a valley ca ed 
he Glen of DunroUn. Through this glen runs a stream called 
Golspie Burn, whose banks, for the space of about a - 
sea, present very beautiful and picturesque scenery. ihe range 
ofhills,consistingoftheSiZ.erioc7.,theH.7Zo/Mormc/,andother 

in thei vicinitv, are rounded at the top, with a southern, seaw rd 
lect The flat arable part of the parish lies chiefly between the 
coast-side hills and the sea, having the rude figure of a triang e, 
Te of whose sides is formed by the base of the hills, another by 



GOLSPIE.

the Little Ferry inlet, and the third by the sea-shore, with a con- 
siderable sinuosity. 

Caves. — In the former Statistical Account, two caves are describ- 
ed, — the one, Uaigh mhic Ghil Anndreis, Gillander's Cave, in the 
eastern part of the parish ; and the other, Uaigh TTiorcuil, Tor- 
quil's Cave, in the hill above Dunrobin. It may be observed, 
that the former is on the face of a white sandstone rock, and seems 
to have been formed by the gradual action of the elements ; that 
the latter is in a loosely stratified red sandstone rock ; and that 
its formation appears to have been coeval with the present structure 
of the rock itself. The eastern half of the coast in this parish is 
mostly rocky, and the western low and sandy. 

Meteorology. — The chmate of this, and of the adjacent parishes 
on the coast, may be considered temperate and mild. Snow seldom 
lies long on the ground; nor can the chmate be called rainy. The 
east winds, indeed, which are not unfrequent, sometimes occasion 
cloudy and damp weather ; and, when they blow hard for a day or 
two, they bring with them much rain ; but this rain is almost uni- 
formly succeeded by a tract of fair mild weather. The south 
winds, which are the least frequent, are rarely accompanied with 
rain ; and it is in occasional showers only that the west and north- 
west winds bring rain. The gales from the north-west are here by, 
far the hardest. Those dense fogs, which so often occur, on the 
east coast of the island, to the southward of us, are here of rare 
occurrence. 

Ailments of the rheumatic kind are perhaps the most prevalent ; 
but not in any remarkable degree ; nor can these be ascribed to 
any peculiarity in the climate. 

Hydrography. — The fresh-water lakes in the parish are Lochs 
Horn, Lundie, Farralarie, and Salachic, none of which exceeds 
half a mile in length, or one-third in breadth. The Fleet, which, 
as already observed, forms part of the western boundary of the 
parish, is the only stream connected with it that can be denomi- 
nated a river. It flows through the valley called Strathjleet. At 
its lower part, it is slow and meandering, and contains trout, and 
sometimes salmon. In the glen of Golspie, there is a cascade, 
which, when there is any quantity of water in the stream, has a 
very fine effect. The surrounding scenery has of late been greatly 
improved ; and the traveller, who rests at the inn, and who takes 
pleasure in such things, will find himself rewarded, in visiting it. 

Geology, — The following geological remarks, relative to this pa-

SUTIIKIlLANDSHlKli. 



rish, are copied IVoin an original manuscript, at Dunrobin Castle, 
written by the late eminent Sir Humphry Davy, President of the 
Royal Society : — " The primary hills, in the neighbourhood of 
Dunrobin, are composed of felspar, quartz, mici, and hornblende, 
forming different arrangements of porphyry, porphyritic granite, 
gneiss, sienite, and mica slate. There are very few veins in the 
rocks. The only veins I have seen are quartz, and in them there 
are no indications of metallic formations. The decomposed rocks 
have left no fragments of quartz, which are usually found in abun- 
dance in metalliferous districts. 

" The highest secondary hills, in this district, extend in a line 
from Loch-Brora to Strathfleet," that is, through the northern 
part of this parish, " and are composed of hard silicious sandstone 
and puddingstone, containing large fragments — some rounded, 
some sharp — of the primary rocks, particularly of the porphyritic 
granite, gneiss, and sienite. 

" The secondary rocks are more interesting. The mechanical 
. deposits in them are evidently derived from the ruins of primary 
rocks ; and most of the fragments are such as may have been de- 
tached from rocks in the neighbourhood. The veeretable remains 
in the sandstone and the shells in the limestone are those common 
to such formations. The cement of the secondary rocks is gene- 
rally silicious; but in one stratum near Golspie, and extending 
along the coast, it is calcareous ; and the decomposition of the 
rocks forms an excellent marl. In this marl there is a blue sub- 
stance, having some of the external characters of phosphate of iron." 

In another manuscript. Sir Humphry writes thus : — " The 
soils of the coast side lands, between the Little Fernj and Helms- 
dale, seem to be formed principally from the decomposition of 
sandstone-rock, which in some parts approaches in its nature to 
shale. The soils in Strathfleet," — the lower parts of which 
partly lie in this parish, — " appear to have been produced by the 
decomposition of transition-sandstone and breccias. 

" The transition rocks of Sutherland are not numerous, and be- 
long, as fai' as I have been able to learn and examine, only to a 
small extent of country. Some of the high hills, in the innncdiatc 
neighbourhood of Dunrobin and Strathfleet, must be regarded as 
lclonging to this jrdcr of rocks. Beiini a Bhrarjidh, rising imme- 
diately above near the castle, is composed of red transition sand- 
stone and breccia. Briim Iloni, \hc Si/rrr Hill, and all the moun- 
tains immediately aljovc Loch-Brora, arc similar in llieir nature :

but their colours are various, — the sandstone being in some cases 
gray, in some white, and in others iron-brown. 

" In general the breccias, in these transition mountains, con- 
tain fragments of granite, porphyry, and micaceous schist, connect- 
ed by silicious cement; but, in a few cases, they contain fragments 
of marble, with a calcareous cement. A very remarkable breccia 
occurs at Golspie, near the inn, and at the east side of the burn, 
and a still purer one near Rhives, in which small blocks of marble 
are inserted. These calcareous breccias, in general, are in a state 
of decomposition, and a sort of marl is formed from the decay. 
These rocks might, with as much propriety, be called secondary as 
transition rocks ; for though in some" parts they abound in crys- 
talline matter, yet in others they are almost entirely composed of 
fragments. I have given them the name of transition by courtesy. 
Rocks of the rare kind are often associated with greywacke and 
crystalline stone ; and they are placed immediately upon the pri- 
mary rocks. I have never seen any greywacke or transition lime- 
stone in Sutherland. 

" The secondary rocks occupy but a small space, and are pro- 
bably incumbent on the red sandstone or breccia described. They 
occur in regular strata ; but their arrangement is very much dis- 
turbed. They appear to have been originally deposited, or formed 
parallel to the horizon ; but in most places this parallehsm has 
been disturbed, either by the subsidence or the elevation of part of 
the strata ; so that there are frequently faults or abruptions of the 
different rocks, which have given to the different parts of the strata 
different inclinations. 

" The true secondary strata of Sutherland," i. e. of the east 
coast, " occupy an extent of six or seven miles, fiUing up a sort of 
basin between the transition hills, in the neighbourhood of Dun- 
robin, and those in the parish of Loth. The upper stratum is 
a sandstone of different degrees of hardness, and composed of sili- 
cious sand, cemented by silicious matter. Below this occurs an 
alummous shale, containing pyritous matter, carbonaceous matter, 
the remains of marine animals,  and of land vegetables. Beneath 
this shale, or rather alternating with it, a stratum occurs, contain- 
ing m some of its parts calcareous matter, and passing into limc-

Stone ; but in general consisting of a silicious sand agglutinated 
by calcareous cement. The coal measures occupy the lowest part 
of this secondary district which has been yet exposed." 

" The hard sandstone is principally composed of pure silicious 
earth. It is not acted upon by acids, and is not liable to be de- 
composed by the action of air and water. The shale contains no 
calcareous matter near its junction with the coal. The limestones 
found in the secondary strata contain no magnesian earth, and are 
adulterated only with aluminous and silicious earths, and oxide of 
iron. They differ very much in purity, in different parts. The 
marble in the calcareous breccia at Rhives, and on the coast, 
leaves only from one-twelfth to one-twentieth of residuum during 
its solution in acids, The sand on the coast, near the quay at Dun- 
robin, contains from one-half to one-third of weight of calcareous 
matter." 

Zoology. — The following birds, of the rarer kinds, have occasion- 
ally been seen in this parish, by the game-keeper. The goshawk, 
[Falco palumbarius. Linn.; UAutour, Buffon. The ash-colour- 
ed shrike, or greater butcher-bird, {Lanius excubitor, Linn.; La 
Pie-Grieche grise, Buffon. The ring-ouzel [Turclus torquatus. 
Linn.; Le Merle a Plastron hlanc, Buffon. The cross-bill or 
Sheld Apple [Loxia Curvirostra, Linn. ; Le Bcccroise, Buffon. The 
snow-bunting or snow-flake [Emheriza nivalis, Linn.; L' Ortolan

Linn.; LeTarin, Buffon. The night-jar, goat-sucker, dor-hawk, 
or fern-owl, {Caprimulgus Eui'opcBus, Linn.; L' Engoulevcnt, Buf- 
fon. 

At a very remote period, deer seem to have been numerous either 
in the hills of this parish, or in its neighbourhood ; for large, and 
evidently very old deposits of their horns have recently been dug up, 
near the site of the old chapel. They now seldom venture to ap- 
proach so near the coast. Galloway black-polled cattle, Highland 
black cattle, and the Cheviot breed of sheep, and some good work- 
horses, are reared with great care and success, in this parish. The 
kinds of fish found here are merely those which are common to 
the other parts of the east coast of Scotland, and which are men- 
tioned in the former Statistical Account. The most useful shell- 
fish, in the parish, is the mussel, generated on a bank in the Little 
Perry inlet. This shell-fish is the bait chiefly used in the haddock 
and other white fisheries ; sometimes, however, the limpet, and a 
worm named hj the fishermen htg, and found in the sand, at ebb

tide, are used as bait. In the vicinity of the mussels, cockles abound. 
Heaps of oyster-shells have occasionally been dug up in certain 
parts of this, and of the neighbouring parish, to the west ; and their 
shells are also found on the sea-shore, about the Little Ferry inlet, 
affording an indication of the existence of this shell-fish in abun- 
dance, in former times. 

11. — Civil History. 

Like other maritime parishes in the Highlands, Golspie appears 
to have, in ancient times, been invaded, and possessed, for a period, 
by foreign northern nations. By far the most prominent and in- 
teresting part of its history relates to the eminent characters that 
have been connected with it. 

Family of Sutherland. — Her Grace the Duchess of Sutherland, 
who, with the other members of her family, often resides in this 
parish, at her seat — Dunrobin, is also Countess of Sutherland, in 
her own right. The thanes of Sutherland first received the title 
of earls from Malcolm Canmore, King of Scotland, a. d. 1031. Her 
Grace Ehzabeth, the present Countess, is the twenty-third repre- 
sentative of this ancient family, and a lineal descendant of Robert 
the Bruce, King of Scotland; the third William Earl of Sutherland 
having been married to the Princess Margaret, daughter of that 
monarch. 

The husband of her Grace is George Granville Leveson 
Gower, Duke of Sutherland, Knight of the Garter. The de- 
scent of his Grace is also very illustrious, as well as very ancient. 
Not to mention many other particulars, he is in the paternal 
line descended from Robert, the youngest son of RoUo, first Duke 
of Normandy, and, in the maternal line, from the Princess Mary, 
second daughter of the seventh Henry, King of England. 

The family consists of two sons and two daughters, — George 
Granville, Marquis of Stafford, Baron Gower of Stittenham, Lord 

 In all probability, the continental warlike nation of the Catti, so largely treated 
of by the Roman liistorians, invaded and took possession of the district of country ex- 
tending from the Pentland Frith to that of Dornoch ; and that, perhaps, soon after 
the disasters brought upon them by the Roman arms. Tlie Celtic name of tlie dis- 
trict, situated between the Ord of Caithness, and the Frith of Dornoch, is Cntt Ihnobh, 
i. e. the side, or district of the Calli, and the inhabitants are in Celtic denominated 
Caltlch. Caithness has in English retained its original name, for it means the pro- 
montory of the Catti; but in Celtic, it is called Gull thaohh, the district of strangers, 
from the people who at a later period settled there. Siilhcrland, the English name of 
this county, evidently owes its origin to its geographical position, in reference to Caith- 
ness. In Celtic, the title of the Earls of Sutherland is Morfhcur clinll. pronounced 
Morr.r chall, and that of the Countess, Buna Mliorfcar cliati, pronounced Binia vorcr 
chiilt ; Buna being the feminine prefix. Both the Celtic titles are expressive of no- 
bility in any ihgirc ; and thus hey still continue apjilicable.

Lieutenant of the county of Sutherland, and heir to the estates and 
titles of the family, married to Lady Harriet Howard, daughter of 
the Earl of Carlisle ; Lord Francis, heir to the property of the late 
Duke of Bridgewater, married to Miss GreviUe, niece of the Duke 
of Portland; Lady Charlotte, married to the Earl of Surrey, son 
and heir of the Duke of Norfolk ; and Lady EUzabeth, married to 
Earl Grosvenor, son and heir of the Marquis of Westmmster; 
all of whom have families, consisting each of sons and daughters. 

As a statesman the Duke of Sutherland is enlightened, libe- 
ral, firm, and independent; possessing the well-merited charac- 
ter of inflexible integrity and of high honour. His Grace, then 
Earl Gower, was ambassador, from this country, at the court of 
France, at the memorable period of the French Revolution, which 
began in 1789. 

Her Grace the Duchess of Sutherland has, by universal con- 
sent, been always regarded as endowed with great talent, accomphsh- 
men'ts, and beauty ; and, in respect to character, is eminent and ex- 
emplary, in the highest degree, and a great ornament to her ex- 
alted rank and station; the natural fruit and reward of which qua- 
lities are richly exhibited, in the good conduct and gi-eat prospe- 
rity and happiness of her family. The noble Marquis follows the 
paternal example,— favouring and promoting, as a statesman, all 
those measures which appear calculated to benefit the empire, and 
to render its institutions pure and permanent. The younger son. 
Lord Francis, has already, in connection with former administra- 
tions, served his country successively as Secretary of State for Ire- 
land, and minister at war, and, in aliterary capacity, is author of some

works, chiefly connected with German hterature, which have at- 
tracted considerable notice. 

The names and biography of the Earls of Sutherland are ho- 
nourably interwoven in the general history of the empire. To 
specify the many honourable actions and exertions of these 
noblemen, in defence and for the liberties of their country, the ne- 
cessary brevity of this account renders impossible. But there 
is one remarkable and interesting circumstance that may not be 
omitted, — which is, that the line of succession down to the present 
representative is direct, and uninterrupted, having the title of Su- 
therland united to it. Twice was there an attempt unavailingly 
made to divert the succession from an heiress; first from the 
Lady Elizabeth, daughter of John, the twelfth earl ; and again, 
from the present representative, who, by the almost simvdtaneous 
and much lamented death of her noble parents, was in early in- 
fancy left an only child. From such critical circumstances did the 
Supreme Arbiter of the Destinies of all deliver the present repre- 
sentative of the house of Sutherland, and in her person the direct 
line of succession, — to become still farther exalted, and to be con- 
nected with the most noble, the most wealthy, and the most an- 
cient families in the empire ; 

" Mersus piofundo pulchrior evenit." 

Family of Kilcalmkill. — In the churchyard of this parish there is 
a chapel, or inclosed place of sepulture, where repose many members 
of the very old family of Kilcalmkill, or, according to a more recent 
designation, of Carrol. This family derives its descent from Adam 
Gordon, Dean of Caithness, the first Earl of Huntly's second son, 
uncle of Adam Gordon, Lord of Aboyne, the second Earl of Hunt- 
ly's son, who married the Countess Elizabeth, daughter of John, 
the fourteenth Earl of Sutherland. The representative of a main 
branch of the Kilcalmhill family is Joseph Gordon, Esq. W. S. 
Edinburgh, who, it is understood, has a right to a baronetage by 
the death of the Rev. Sir Adam Gordon, Baronet, in whom a col- 
lateral branch of the male line has terminated. 

Family of Novar. — Among the eminent persons connected with 
this parish, by birth, must be noticed the late Sir Hector Munro of 
Novar, Sir Hector was born at Clayside, in this parish, in 1727, and, 
when about twenty years of age, entered the army. He went to 
the East Indies, a major in Morris's regiment. At the head of a 
small force, he defeated a large army commanded by a native 
prmcc, at Buxar. He was afterwards promoted to the rank of

major-general, and appointed commander-in-chief at Madras. He 
soon took the French settlement of Pondicherry, and, for this ser- 
vice, was invested with the order of the Bath. At Negapatam, 
also, he behaved with equal gallantry. Having soon afterwards 
returned to England, he was appointed Colonel of the 42d Regi- 
ment of Infantry, and was subsequently promoted to the rank of 
Lieutenant-General, on the North British Staff. Sir Hector's 
father, Hugh Munro, by the death of an elder brother, succeeded 
to the estate of Novar, in Ross-shire, and, on the father's death. 
Sir Hector himself. Sir Hector was twice in India, and in the in- 
terval spent at home he represented in Parliament the Inverness 
district of burghs, and on his finally quitting India was re-elected. 
Sir Hector died in 1 802. He was a brave officer ; in private life 
a good friend ; and a remarkable instance of filial piety, towards 
a venerable and worthy mother, to whose prayers he was wont to 
ascribe his success in life. 

Sir Hector Munro's brother, Alexander, who was for sometime 
Consul General at Madrid, and afterwards a Commissioner of Cus- 
toms, was also knighted. H. A. J. Munro, Esq. the present pro- 
prietor of Novar, an intelligent and accomplished gentleman, is 
the son of Sir Alexander. 

It must be added under this head, that Dr Hugh Macpherson, 
the present Professor of Greek in the University and King's Col- 
lege, Aberdeen, and who has taught that language there, for thirty- 
five years, with great success and approbation, is a native of this 
parish ; and is the son of the late Rev. Martin Macpherson, who 
was minister of the parish. 

Land-owners. — The Duke and Duchess Countess of Sutherland 
are the sole owners of the land in this parish ; and, by the late purchase 
of the Reay country, they have become owners of nearly the whole 
county. Their property has also been further enlarged by the recent 
purchase of several estates in the county of Ross ; so that the whole, 
in conjunction with the Staffordshire and other estates, the Bridge- 
water canal, and other possessions in England, constitutes a proper- 
ty which may with propriety be called immense, yielding a revenue 
more than princely. 

Manuscripts. — It is proper to observe, that there is a manuscript 
at Dunrobin Castle, entitled " the Genealogy of the Earls and 
family of Sutherland." But though this be the title, the work is

extensive, and contains a great many curious and interesting his- 
torical notices, relative to the counties of Sutherland and Caith- 
ness, the highlands and islands, and the country at large. The 
author was Sir Robert Gordon, a younger son of the family of 
Sutherland. The work embraces the space of time between the 
years 1031 and 1630, and there is appended to it a continuation, 
by Gilbert Gordon of Sallach, to the year 1651. It was printed 
in Edinburgh in 1813; and of the MS. there is another manuscript 
copy in the Advocates' Library, in Edinburgh. 

Antiquities. — A portion of the wall of the old church, or chapel, 
of this parish still remains, and forms part of the fence which en- 
closes the burying-ground formerly used. This cemetery contains 
the remains of many of the Earls of Sutherland, as signified by a 
plain stone placed in the old church wall, bearing this epitaph, 
" In hoc cliruto ccsmeterio Sutherlandice plurimorum comitum cineres 
conquiescunt." The church was transferred from Culmalie to Gol- 
spie, A. D. 1619. 

In the former Statistical Account of the parish, there is notice 
taken of the battle fought in 1746, on the north side of the Little 
Ferry, between a party of those who sided with the invading prince 
and the militia of this country; in which battle the Earl of Cror 
marty and other gentlemen were made prisoners. Of the sangui- 
nary nature of this battle there remain clear proofs. Several 
skeletons of those who fell, and who were buried on the scene of 
action, have of late been occasionally discovered. Along with these, 
there have been found a number of small copper coins, and one of 
silver, — all of Mary and James, — together with some copper 
brooches and some glass beads. Of these articles, some are now 
at Dunrobin Castle, and others in the possession of Dr Ross of 
Camusmore. Among the latter, there is a copper ring encircled 
with this inscription, rudely executed ; " Jesus Nazarenus Rex 
JudcEorum." The remains of swords and pistols have also been 
found. 

Near the ruins of the old chapel, there were lately dug up the 
handle of a balance, with some of the weights, both of brass, and 
of neat and curious workmanship, and in very good preservation. 
They are supposed to have belonged to the old chapel. These, 
together with some thick rings of brass, wood, and other materials, 
m diameter from half an inch to one and a-half, found in the same 
vicmity, are now at Dunrobin Castle ; and here also are  wo brass 
rings, three inches in diameter, and a third of an inch thick, found

at the place of Uppat, five feet under ground. Near the site of 
the old chapel, too, there was lately dug up a large undressed stone, 
with a rude device, as of an ancient galley,— a thick crescent. The 
date and the object of it are alike unknown. It now stands a httle 
to the east of the castle. 

The ruins of two Pictish towers, as they are often called, are 
described in the former Statistical Account ; — the one, situated 
at a short distance to the east of Dunrobin Castle, and the other 
to the west, now embosomed in a plantation of fir trees. There 
is another ruin of the same kind near the place of Backies, which 
has not been mentioned, and which, as well as that situated at the 
east, has been greatly demohshed. The ruin in the wood is less dila- 
pidated, and still distinctly bears the characteristics of similar ruins 
in the coast-side Highlands. The general dimensions, — the cen- 
tral circular compartment, — the gallery between this compartment 
and the exterior wall, — are quite visible. The absence of mortar 
in the construction is common to these three ruins, as well as to 
all others of the kind. The two nearest were in sight of each 
other ; the one at Backies looked into the glen ; and they all com- 
manded an extensive prospect of the sea and the land. It is most 
probable, that these, and other similar structures, were built and 
used by the Danes. The remains of a Druidical temple, or cir- 
cle, are to be seen a little above the road which leads from the 
Mound to Morvich, about half way between these places. 

Dunrobin Castle. — About the middle of the parish, and situ- 
ated on the margin of a bank, and considerably elevated above 
the sea, stands Dunrobin Castle, which was first built by Robert 
Earl of Sutherland, a. d. 1275. Its environs are a good deal 
wooded, and the surrounding scenery, which is varied and hilly, is 
very interesting and picturesque. The garden which, as newed 
from the bank or the castle, spreads itself like a map at the foot 
of the bank, is in excellent keeping with the antique character of 
the mansion and the place. 

Parochial Register. — The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ter here is 29th December 1739. The register is at present re- 
gularly and carefully kept. 

Modern Buildings. — Besides the fiu-m-houses and offices, there 
are in the village an inn, a flour and barley-mill, a meal-mill, a 
bank-office, and the manse, all of them good, and built not many 
years ago.

III. — Population. 
Since the former Statistical Account in 1793, there has been a 
decrease of population. This has arisen from a powerful cause, which 
has been, for the last forty years, in full operation in all the High- 
lands of Scotland, — the occupation of the land, in large farms, by 
tenants of skill and capital; — a measure urged on by the changes 
and improvements in the general state of agriculture and commerce, 
at home and abroad. Since the census in 1821, there is an in- 
crease in the population of upwards of a hundred; which has been 
occasioned by the increased comforts of the working-classes, aris- 
ing from employment on the large farms, and in the various works, 
such as buildings and roads, carried on in the county.

Language, Habits, and Character of the People. — Forty years 
ago, the Gaelic was the language generally spoken in the parish. 
But, from better education, and the residence of persons from the 
south country, that language is now fast on the dechne; and among 
the young there is now -Kardly an individual who does not under- 
stand and speak EngUsh. In cleanliness, both- jrsOnal and do- 
mestic, Jhere has of late been a great improvement: and the same 
may, in its full extent, be said of their dress. The ordinary 
food of the peasantry and tradesmen consists of oat and barley- 
meal, variously prepared,— of potatoes, fish, and milk, but rarely 
flesh. Tradesmen and others occasionally use a Mttle wheaten 
bread, and a little butter, cheese, and tea. The people of this 
parish live in comfort and contentment. — However far short they 
may come of the full Christian standard, they may generally, and 
HI the ordinary acceptation of the term,~be, without hesitation.

said to be a moral and a religious people. It must, however, be ad- 
mitted, that, in common with a large proportion of their country- 
men, the religion of many of the native population of the lower 
class is not without serious and inveterate errors. Christian con- 
version, in their view, essentially consists, not in the forsaking of 
wicked ways and unrighteous thoughts, and in returning from these 
to the Lord, but in another sort of change not distinctly connect- 
ed with a moral life. A set of illiterate, fanatical, and disorderly, 
self-appointed teachers of religion have, by their wild and mysti- 
cal rhapsodies, acquired a baneful ascendant over the ignorant 
minds of the lower orders of the people not only in this country, 
but in other parts of the Highlands. In the mouths of these 
teachers, prayer is irreverently perverted into mere discussion, vir- 
tually addressed, not to God, but to the hearers, and frequently 
degenerates into bitter personalities and invectives. By these de- 
luding, and often deluded persons, the metaphorical parts of the 
Holy Scriptures are received and taught in the literal sense, and 
the plainest parts are very often allegorized. Not unfrequently the 
Scriptures are considered as a mere secondary thing, of little avail ; 
and that pastor who studies them closely and critically, and ex- 
pounds them in their true sense, is regarded as if he were deahng 
with occult and unhallowed sciences. 

IV. — Industry. • 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres, impe- 
rial measure, in the parish which are either cultivated or occasion- 
ally in tillage is about 2040. Of unimproved land there is very 
little. There are about 800 acres under wood. Every attention 
seems to be paid to the plantations. 

The trees and plants in this parish are of those kinds which 
are common to other parts of the Highlands. Since the former 
Statistical Account was written, a considerable space of land has 
been planted with forest trees, by which the appearance of the pa- 
rish is greatly improved. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per imperial 
acre in this parish is L. 1, 2s. The average rate of grazing is 
L. 1, 10s. per ox or cow grazed, and 2s. per ewe or full-grown sheep, 
pastured for the year. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of wages is as follows : A plouglnnan, 
for the year, receives L. 10 in money, one stone of meal per week, 
keep for a cow, or a cow between two, six bolls of potatoes, with 
liouse and fuel. A male day labourer gets Is. 6d. in the long day.

and Is. 3cl. in the short; a female 6d. a-day generally; in har- 
vest, Is. House-carpenters 2s., and masons 2s. 6d. a-day. The 
prices of articles of manufacture, and the rate of work, are ; for 
an iron plough, L.4; for a wooden one from L. 2, 10s. to L.3. 
A cart, with hay frame, L. 14 ; a set of cart and plough harness, 
L. 7, 10s.; pair of harrows, L. 2, 10s.; rood of stone and lime- 
work, L. 2, 12s. ; drystone-dike, 4 feet high, with coping, 6d. per 
yard; if 6 feet high, 9d. ; blacksmiths work 4d. to 7d. per lb. 

Live-Stock. — The price of a Dunrobin ox, from two to three 
years old, is generally L. 9; but, during the war, the price was L.14, 
and sometimes higher. Other Highland cattle are considerably 
lower in price. A work-horse from L. 25 to L. 40. The price of beef 
and mutton is 4d. per lb. ; butter, lOd. per lb.; a common house fowl, 
8d. ; eggs, 3d. per dozen ; oatmeal generally L. 1, but this year 17s. 
per boll of eight stone ; potatoes from 8s. to 12s. per boll of twelve 
bushels imperial ; salmon Is. to Is. 6d. per lb. ; grilse 6d. per lb, ; 
a cod 6d. ; haddocks from lOd. to Is. per dozen. 

The Dunrobin breed of cattle, originally from Argyleshire, are 
deservedly accounted excellent, and there is great attention paid 
to the rearing of them. For dairy use, there are some Ayrshire 
cows. On some farms, the breed of Highland black-cattle is 
chiefly reared ; and on the farm of Kirkton, an excellent breed of 
black polled Galloway cattle. At the Highland Society's cattle 
show, held at Inverness in 1831, where stock of all kinds were 
shown, from all the northern counties, including the counties of 
Aberdeen and Perth, — a larger amount of prizes was awarded to 
this parish than to any other. To the Marquis of Staff"ord was 
awarded the prize for the best two oxen of the Highland breed; 
another for the best lot of stirks of the same breed ; and the So- 
ciety's medal for two Highland oxen shown as extra stock. Mr 
Craig of Kirkton obtained a prize for the best cow, another for the 
best heifer, and another for the best ox, all of the Galloway breed, 
—together with the commendation of the judges for a bay colt and 
a chesnut filly, shown as extra stock. This gentleman afterwards 
sold his prize ox for L. 30, to the advantage of the buyer. The 
Galloway breed of cattle are here found to be very hardy, and to 
arrive at a greater weight, upon the same feeding, than the High- 
land breed do. The milk, both of the Galloway and Highland 
cows, is not great in quantity, but is in quality very rich. On the 
large farms, some good work and saddle horses are bred ; and by 
" In 1834, 14.S. per boll.

the cottars, some small ponies. The kind of sheep reared is the 
Cheviot, to the purity and rearing of which much attention is paid ; 
and they accordingly are very superior, and obtain high prices. 

Husbandry. — Farming is carried on in this parish on the most 
approved system. The rotations of cropping are the four, five, 
and six years shifts. Trenching and draining have been done to 
a great extent on every farm in the parish, at an expense of from 
L. 8 to L. 50 per acre.  The duration of leases is nineteen 
years; in one instance, thirty. The farm-buildings and many of 
the fences which are dry-stone dikes are substantial. 

Improvements. — It may be with truth affirmed, that a simple 
account of the improvements in this parish must have the appear- 
ance of exaggeration, and that he only can appreciate them who 
had seen the state of the parish forty or even thirty years ago, and 
compares that state with the present. Every farm, every building, 
every piece of road, presents an instance of the greatest improve- 
ment. The farms of Culmahe and Morvich are possessed by Mr 
Sellar, who, by trenching, draining, and liming, with much labour 
and expense, has converted them into specimens of great agricul- 
tural excellence. The farm of Kirkton, occupied by Mr Craig, 
affords a most creditable example of industry and skill. That of 
Drummuie, held by Mr Macpherson, and that of Golspie Tower, 
held by Mr Duncan, have been greatly improved, and at a great 
expense. The farm of Rhives had been rendered a remarkably 
fine one by its former successive occupants, Mr Young and Mr 
Suther ; and an addition has been made to its arable land, by the 
present possessor, Mr Gunn. The mains of Dunrobin, being old 
and good land, have always been productive ; but they, too, have 
been improved under the new system ; and the same may be said 
of the place of Uppat, which completes the number of large farms 
in the parish. These notices are not irrelevant here ; for it must 
be added, that these farmers have not only the good fortune to 
be placed under most liberal landlords ; but that they deserve the 
liberality they receive. They have acquired a title to the gra- 
titude of the community at large " by making corn and grass to 
grow, where neither grass nor corn ever grew before."

wrought here ; there is also one of white sandstone. Some indi-

expedient to open them. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, cultivated for food for men and the domestic animals, 

L. 5800 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, cabbages, beet, and other plants, cultivated in

Fishings. — The only salmon fishery, in the parish, is on the Fleet 
below the Mound. It commences in June, and is carried on by 
stake nets. The quantity of fish caught there is not large. There 
is no herring fishery station in the parish. It is at Helmsdale, 
Wick, and Portmahomach, that the fishermen of this parish take 
and sell their herrings. The above calculation of the fisheries 
is probably under their real value. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, Villages, Src. — In this parish there is, strictly speak- 
ing, no town, and the nearest market-town is Tain, distant about 
twenty miles ; a ferry intervening. There is, however, a village, 
bearing the name of the parish. Originally, there were only a 
few fishermen's huts of the meanest description on the site of the 
village ; but within the last twenty years it has, with the aid of the 
noble proprietors, become a neat village of considerable extent. 
It contains several retail-shops of various descriptions. There are 
also mechanics of various kinds, and upwards of twenty profes- 
sional fishermen, together with many labourers of both sexes, who 
earn their livehhood by working on the neighbouring farms. 

Means of Communication. — A trading smack plies regularly once 
a-month between the Little Ferry, in this parish, and the port of 
Leith, touching also at Helmsdale and Aberdeen.  There is here, 
too, a regular post-office ; and a daily mail-coach passes through 
the village on its way to and from Thurso. From this post-office, 
there runs twice a-week a Diligence gig, conveying a mail, and 
fitted up to carry two passengers, to Lairg in the interior, distant 
eight miles ; from which place, and on the same day, two other

similar conveyances, and for similar purposes, branch off,— the one 
to Tongue, the other to Assynt. It is only about three years since 
these latter conveyances began to run ; and fifteen, since the mail- 
coach commenced. Both the latter and the former owe their es- 
tablishment, in a great measure, to the liberal and powerful support 
of the noble proprietors of this parish, — rendered effective by the 
ability and activity of their commissioner, James Loch, Esq. M, P. 
The length of mail-coach road, in this parish, is eight miles. Over 
Golspie burn there is a well-built substantial one-arched bridge.  
Earthen Mound. — Connecting this parish with the adjacent one 
of Dornoch, at the head of the Little Ferry inlet, and across the 
Fleet, there is a mound 995 yards in length, 60 yards in breadth 
at the base, and 20 feet at the top, and about 18 feet perpendicular 
in height ; it terminates at the north end in a bridge 34 yards in 
length, with four arches, each 12 feet span, fitted with valve gates. 
The expense of constructing this mound was L. 9600, of which 
sum the Duke of Sutherland defrayed L. 1600, and the public and 
the county the remainder, each a moiety. Along the mound the 
mail-coach now passes ; and thus a passage, formerly uncertain 
and often dangerous, has been rendered safe, certain, and agreeable. 
Besides the public benefit effected by this work, some good land 
is preserved from the overflowing of the sea ; and about 400 acres 
of beach, which may in time become arable, are gradually assum- 
ing a coating partly of herbage, and partly of alder trees. The 
construction of the mound having been by many skilful engineers 
deemed hazardous, and by some impracticable, there was much 
difficulty in getting persons to undertake it, when Earl Gower, now 
Marquis of Stafford, William Young, Esq. of Maryhill near Elgin, 
and Patrick Sellar, Esq. of Westfield, came forward, and became 
responsible for the completion of the work. To Mr Young, who 
was commissioner on the estate of the noble proprietors of this 
county, it is but doing justice to observe, that the mound, which 
was finished in 1816, and is accounted one of the most complete 
structures of the kind in Britain, in a great measure owes its exist-

ence ; and it will remain a lasting monument of his ability and 
exertions. 

LiUle Ferry. — The Little Ferry inlet, or the estuary, as it may 
be regarded, of the Fleet, forms a harbour at the distance of about 
a mile from the bar formed at its mouth. The depth of the water 
over this bar, during spring tides, is, at full tide, about 18 feet, and 
at ebb tide 4 feet ; and, during neap tides, is, at full tide, about 
16, and, at ebb tide, 6 feet. When the Fleet is flooded, the depth 
is, in a small degree, increased. The harbour is about 259 yards 
broad, has about 18 feet water at ebb tide, and affords perfect safe- 
ty, in any weather. Above this narrow part, the sea, at full tide, 
expands over a space of about 1500 imperial acres. The harbour 
of the Little Ferry is frequented by trading vessels, which import 
lime, coal, bone-dust, and merchant goods, for this parish and dis- 
trict, and export grain, wool, whisky, &amp;c. At Dunrobin there is 
a pier for the use of small vessels. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated about the 
middle of the parish, and so near the sea, that the glebe only in- 
tervenes. The situation is convenient for the parishioners ; the 
village, which contains from a third to a half of the population, 
being in its immediate vicinity, and most of the remaining part, 
with the exception of a few families, who are not far from the neigh- 
bouring parish churches, being within less than three miles of it; and 
the extremities of the parish, which are more thinly inhabited, being 
in any direction scarcely more than six miles distant from the church. 
The church was built in 1738. The southern aisle was added in 
1751, and at present the building is in good repair. It is fitted to ac- 
commodate 565 persons. — The manse was built in 1827. — A large 
proportion of the glebe is sand and gravel. Of good glebe land 
there is scarcely the legal measure of four and a-half acres ; and 
it has become greatly deteriorated by being cut up by a neighbour- 
ing stream. Calculating according to the average rent of land in 
this parish, which is L. 1, 2s., its value annually is evidently small. 
There is no grass glebe. — The annual stipend consists of 131 bolls 
of victual, old county measure, and L. 75 in money. There is no 
separate allowance for sacramental expenses. The teinds are 
supposed to be exhausted. There is no public place of worship 
of any kind in the parish, but the parish church. There is no 
catechist. 

The average number of communicants in this parish, which is 70, 
must, when compared with the population, appear strikingly small ; 



42 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

but this is only what is general in Highland parishes. The chief 
cause of it is, that the views generally entertained by thelower classes 
of the nature of the Lord's supper are inveterately superstitious. 
Very many of those, who are not only decent in their lives, but even 
religious, are laid gray-headed in their graves without having once 
engaced in the Christian duty of the Lord's supper. Where the 
population of many parishes, consisting of several thousands, are 
assembled in one parish, it is evident, indeed, that, with other evils, 
there cannot be the due proportion of communicants. On some 
occasions, too, the strange anomaly exists in these parts of many 
of the illiterate laity being permitted to address those large assem- 
blages of people, who but too generally regard their doctrines as the 

dictates of inspiration. 

Education.-The schools in the parish are the parochial one 
and a female school. During the winter months, however, in the 
more distant parts, parents occasionally unite in employing a youth 
to teach very young children. The branches taught m the pa- 
rochial school are Latin, Greek, the elements of geometry, book- 
keeping, arithmetic, writing, English reading, and the catechisms 
of the Established church. The schoolmaster's annual salary is 
L 34 4s. 4d., and the annual average amount of school fees is 
about' L 26. The salary of the teacher of the female school is 
L 8 and is granted by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge in the Highlands. The school is patronized by her 
Grace the Duchess of Sutherland, who gives the teacher a house 
and garden, with other donations, equivalent to L. 6. It is tound 
to be very useful. The branches taught in it are sewing and 
Enghsh reading. From its immediate vicinity to the parochial 
school, other branches are not here required There are few chi - 
dren in the parish who cannot read ; and those few are the chil- 
dren of the fishermen, some of whom, from the erroneous idea 
that to persons of their calling education would be no advantage, 
are indifferent about the instruction of their children. Those 
children, who are taught to read, are also taught to write ; and most 
of the youth can, in some degree, both write and read. Ot the 
elderly people, indeed, there are a number, probably 80, who 
can do neither. The desire on the part of parents to educate their 
children is greatly increasing. The situation of the parish schoo 
lich is irf the immediate neighbourhood o the vi lage, is wd 
lalculated to induce the general attendance of the children. The

facilities of education have considerably improved the moral and 
social condition of the people. 

Poor. In regard to the poor of the parish, it may be observed, 

that though they all receive some aid from church collections, and 
from other funds, there are none of them wholly supported by these. 
The average number on the poors-roll is somewhat more than 
sixty. The average sum which each of them annually receives is 
8s., and occasionally some meal. The average annual collections in 
church are about L. 1 9. There is the interest of money lent in behalf 
of the poor, amounting to about L. 7. And her Grace the Duchess 
of Sutherland, besides many charitable pensions, and many liberal 
donations in money, meal, clothing, and house accommodation, 
annually contributes L. 6 to the parochial fund for the poor. Out 
of this general fund there is a small annual allowance to the ses- 
sion-clerk, precentor, kirk-officer, and treasurer. The average 
amount of church collections for other charitable and religious 
purposes may be L. 15 a-year. 

There is in the parish a house for the accommodation of seve- 
ral poor widows, which was sometime since built at the joint ex- 
pense of the present Ladies Surrey and Grosvenor. 

Literature. — It may be observed, that the gentlemen of this 
and the neighbouring parishes have formed themselves into a read- 
ing club. They purchase new books of merit, which, after being 
circulated among the members, are sold to supply the means of 
purchasing others. 

Fairs, Inns, Fuel. — There is an annual fair held near the vil- 
lage of Golspie, in October, chiefly for the sale of country cattle ; 
but merchants and pedlars also resort to it, with goods suited to 
the wants of the country people. There is another fair of a simi- 
lar nature, but of little importance, in May. In the vicinity of 
the village, there is an inn, lately built, large, commodious, well- 
furnished, and well-kept. It is allowed to be the best country 
inn in the Highlands, and is beautifully and picturesquely situated. 
In the village itself, there are several smaller inns, or alehouses, 
for the use and accommodation of the lower orders ; and hitherto 
these houses do not seem to have had any particularly bad effects 
on the morals of the people. The fuel used in the parish is coal 
and peat. The coal is imported from Newcastle, and generally 
costs 2s. per barrel. The peats are cut and seasoned in the 
mosses, at the distance of some miles from the coast and were 
the expense of cutting, seasoning, and carriage, duly calculated, it 



44 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

would probably be found that the price comes little, if at all, short 
of that of imported coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the time of the last Statistical Account, the greatest 
changes, as already noticed, have taken place in the state of the 
parish. At that period, the injurious system of sub-lettmg prevad- 
ed • and both the knowledge and the practice of farmuig were e- 
ceedingly defective. The place of Dunrobin excepted, there was 
neither draining, trenching, nor fallow, and very little green crop, 
besides potatoes and a little pease. There were few fences, and 
these few bad. The plough, which was rudely constructed, had 
no part of it iron but the coulter, the sock, and the hook, at the 
end of the beam. Four country ffarrans, or Highland pomes, were 
Yoked to the plough abreast : and the driver walked in front of them 
backwards. Therewerefew wheeled vehicles that deserved the name. 
Corn fuel &amp;c were carried in a kind of frame called crubaffs, fast- 
ened 'on horseback, to a wooden saddle, that rested on a straw mat. 
The public road was the only one, and that itself indifferent. The 
dwellings of the subtenants were wooden frames thatched with turf, 
and of these, one end accommodated cattle, horses, and sometimes 
pigs One end also of the turf covering of these huts, saturated as 
it wis with soot, was annually stript off and converted into manure. 
With such dwellings the dress of their tenants corresponded. With 
the exception of the mutch, or cap, and handkerchief of the wo- 
men, and perhaps the men's neckcloths, their clothes consisted of 
coarse tartans, kelt, and blanket stuffs. The state of things is now 
very different. Farming is brought to the highest degree of ex- 
cellence, that industry,,skill, and expense can bring it to Nor is it 
too much to say, that the system of farming, at present followed m 
this parish, does not fall short of the best modes of farming, m any 
part of the kingdom. The farmers have very good houses, with 
Lo pubhc rooms ; and they have their wheeled carnages for per- 
sonal and family use. Sub-letting is abolished. The small te, 
nants, or cottars, live in decent cottages built with stone and 
lime, or clay, with glass windows ; and their fare is correspoud- 
infflv better. Tradesmen and ploughmen, on Sundays, wear 
good long coats of English manufacture, white shirts, hats, and 
fk handkerchiefs; and the females of the same class wear good 
cotton gowns, shawls or scarfs, and many of them straw bonnets. 
There are o all descriptions of road, in the parish, about forty 
mis -0 'vtch about \welve were made by the Parliamentary 



GOLSPIE. 



45 



Commissioners and the county; about eighteen, partly at the 
expense of the proprietors, and partly by an assessment on the te- 
nantry ; and ten miles at the sole expense of the proprietors. In 
no county of Scotland was there ever, in so short a time, the same 
length of road made, as there has been, within the last twenty 
years, in the county of Sutherland. In former times, the inter- 
nal communication was by mere paths or tracks, and many parts 
of it were all but inaccessible. Now, several hundred miles of 
good road intersect the county in every direction ; and there is free 
and easy access to every part of it. These roads were made chiefly at 
the expense of the noble proprietors of this parish, and under the 
able management of James Loch, Esq. M. P. their commissioner. 

In the months of July and August of last year, 1832, that aw- 
ful scourge, the Asiatic cholera, by which so many millions of the 
human race have been destroyed since 1817, visited this parish 
also. Every possible precaution was adopted, and every known 
preventive was used, to ward it off. A Board of Health was 
established, large subscriptions and assessments of money were 
made, all manner of cleanliness was enforced, the poor were fed 
and clothed well, vagrants were kept away; and the result was, 
that, although the fishermen of the village of Golspie brought 
the infection from the fishing station of Helmsdale, and although 
the disease made its appearance in the village, in its most malig- 
nant form, quickly carrying off three individuals, the infection was, 
by the mercy of Divine providence, arrested and destroyed, while 
a very great proportion of the population of other villages, in the 
adjacent county, and separated only by a few miles of sea, perished 
miserably. Too much praise cannot be bestowed on the pro- 
prietors and farmers of this county, for the heavy expense which 
they incurred, and the great exertions which they made, on the peri- 
lous occasion. It most fortunately happened, that the Duke and 
Duchess of Sutherland, with Lord and Lady Stafford and their 
family, were at the time at Dunrobin, and it were great injustice 
not to record here the most humane, liberal, and unwearied atten- 
tion, which they paid to the safety of the population, and especially 
to the health and comfort of the poor.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. JOHN MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Roaird is the name of this parish in the Gaehc lan- 
guage. How it came to be written and pronounced Rogart can 
only be accounted for by the difficulty in pronouncing the name 
to those who did not speak that language. It is evident that Ro- 
gart is a modification of Roaird, Various etymologies have been 
assigned to this word. The most probable is, that it is an abbre- 
viation of two Gaelic words, rhidhe, an inclined plain, and ard, 
high. In the district of the parish called Roaird, which gives the 
name to the whole parish, there is Roaird-bheg and Roaird-mhor ; 
both inclined plains of no great extent, but one, Roaird-bheg of less 
extent than the other, as the name implies. Rhidhe and Rhidhea- 
clian, in the plural, are common in Sutherland, and all of them are 
used as names of inclined plains. To give an idea of the liberty 
used with Gaelic names, when attempted in another language, it 
may be mentioned, that Rhidheachan is found in this county, and 
in the neighbouring county, Ross-shire, to have passed into Rhives. 
In like manner, Roaird has been changed into Rogart. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is of nearly equal length and 
breadth, and forms a square of ten miles. It is bounded on the 
east by parts of the parishes of Dornoch and Golspie ; on the 
south by parts of the parishes of Dornoch and Criech ; on the 
west by the parish of Lairg ,• and on the north by parts of the 
parishes of Clyne and Farr. It comprehends, on the south side, 
the whole of Strathfleet ; on the north side, the upper division of 
Strathbrora, and an interjacent space, consisting of low hills, flat 
moors, meadows, small lakes, and the courses of many burns issu- 
ing from them to form the river Fleet, and to swell the Broni, 
which has its source in a distant mountain. 

Topographical Appearances. — Strathfleet, in the language of the 



ROGART. 



47 



inhabitants, is called Strathfloid ; and the small river passing 
through it is called in that language Flodag the diminutive of Flod, 
a word signifying inundation, to which this stream is subject. This 
strath is ten miles in length, and of irregular width. In some parts it 
is three-fourths of a mile wide ; in other parts it is contracted to with- 
in a few yards of the stream passing through it. Both sides of it rise 
to an elevation of from 500 to 700 feet above the course of the 
Fleet, — in some parts abruptly, but generally in sloping banks, 
which are occasionally cultivated and produce crops. 

The part of Strathbrora which is in this parish bears a resem- 
blance to Strathfleet, — the difference being such as may be ac- 
counted for by the action of a larger body of water, which has in 
some places cut deeper into the rock, forming chasms. In other 
parts, the water meets with less resistance, the valley is widened, 
and lengthened haughs are formed. Being nearer the mountain- 
ous region, the aspect of this strath is of a more rugged character 
than that of Strathfleet. 

The hills between these straths are nearly of equal height, and 
rise to an elevation of from 800 to 900 feet above the level of the 
sea. The meadows, which are found around some of the lakes 
and in those flat parts which are subject to irrigation from burns 
passing through, are not of great extent, and form but a small 
proportion to the extent of the moors. 

Climate. — The climate of the county of Sutherland, from its 
latitude and exposure to the winds of the German and Northern 
Ocean, is sharp and cold. The greater part of Rogart, owing to 
its elevation, and to its having but little shelter from the east wind, 
and being swept by every blast coming from the high mountains of 
Assynt and Strathnaver, is much exposed to the severity of a cold 
atmosphere. Yet snow does not lie long here, and frost is not very 
mtense. Winter, however, leaves us but reluctantly, continuing 
during the greater part of spring; and it often arrives in the last 
month of harvest. At the times alluded to, we have our most dis- 
agreeable weather,— cold easterly winds, bringing sleet or rain. 
The most frequent winds, however, are the north and east, but 
the south-west blows with greatest violence. 

Summer here has a great proportion of dry weather ; as the rains 
which fall among the high mountains in this season do not extend 
to this place. A dry scorching summer is more frequently a 
subject of complaint with us than one too rainy. Nor can it be 



48 



SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



said that we have more rain in winter than there is in other parts 
of this island. 

Notwithstanding the coldness of our climate, however, it is re- 
markably healthy. With the exception of catarrhs in the months 
of March and October, diseases but rarely visit the inhabitants. 

Hydrography. — The lakes in this parish are very numerous, but 
not remarkable for extent. Of Loch Craggie, in its western ex- 
tremity, anglers speak with rapture for the size and quality of its 
trout, and for the excellent sport it affords. In the north-eastern 
extremity of the parish, there are two lakes in which fine trout are 
found. Their name implies that they were once on this account 
held in estimation ; both being called Loch-heannached, Lake of 
Blessing. 

The only rivers are those already mentioned, the Fleet and the 
Brora. Even the larger of these is insignificant in summer and 
harvest ; but both when in flood, discharge a great body of water, 
and often cover almost the whole of the plains in their courses, so as 
to present the appearance of a succession of lakes. The Fleet 
has its origin in a rising ground, forming the boundary between the 
parishes of Rogart and Lairg. After traversing ten miles, from 
west to east, in many windings, fringed with birch and alder bushes, 
it enters an extensive plain, once covered by every tide from the 
Moray Frith, but now encroached upon only by this stream : the 
waters of the sea being completely shut out by the earthen mound, 
at the head of the Little Ferry. In this place, where it is not con- 
fined by the skill and enterprise of the agriculturist, it appears 
almost completely lost among rapidly growing alders, until it 
collects itself into a pool, or forms a considerable lake, before being 
discharged into the sea by the sluices of the mound. The Brora is 
about twice the size of the Fleet, has its origin in the high moun- 
tain Beinclibric, and passes from west to east, traversing ten miles 
of this parish in its course. It then enters the parish of Clyne, 
where it unites with another river called the Blackwater, and pas- 
sing through that parish, it joins the Moray Frith at a village to 
which it has given its name, and affords a harbour for light shipping. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Rogart lies chiefly on gneiss rock, in 
which the only veins seen are of quartz. It is of a large-grained 
kind, with a great proportion of mica. It is used in building the 
houses and cottages of the inhabitants, and is found an excellent 
material for the purpose, being easily wrought.

ROGAHT. 



49 



Over the whole of the parish, rolled blocks of granite are seen iu 
great numbers on the surface ; in some parts, if viewed from a dis - 
tance, the surface appears covered with them. They are found no 
less numerous under ground in hollows, where there has been an 
accumulation of soil to cover them. 

Of the whole surface of Rogart, moss forms the largest propor- 
tion. In some parts it is very deep, found often to a depth of 
twelve feet. In those parts where its depth is less, its fresh ap- 
pearance indicates rapid growth. The soil in the valleys, and 
covering the sides of the hills, is sandy and gravelly. The land 
abounds in springs ; consequently, to be brought into a state of 
culture, it requires to be intersected with frequent drains. 

Plants. — The moors produce heather, deers'-hair and cotton- 
grass, intermixed in proportions said to be highly favourable for 
the feeding of sheep. The hills are covered with heather on the 
tops, but on their sides a mixture of fine grasses is to be found ; 
and, around their bases, red and white clover, and mountain daisy, 
are common. The meadows and straths are covered with the 
meadow grasses prevalent in similar situations, and, where irrigated, 
are very productive. 

Zoology. — Roe-deer may always be seen here, but not in great num- 
bers. The red mountain-deer is occasionally seen crossing the moors 
to or from the mountains north of this, which abound in that species 
of animal. The gray mountain-hare is here common on the higher 
grounds. The brown hare, and of late the rabbit, are found on 
the lower grounds, — the former exceedingly numerous. Moor- 
fowl are still abundant, though less so, it is said, than they have 
been. Black game, which are said to increase as moor-fowl de- 
crease, are become very numerous. 

Goats were once a part of the stock of the inhabitants, but they 
have now nearly disappeared, giving way to more profitable animals. 
There is a species of sheep, of small size, formerly the only kind 
known here, still reared by the occupants of small lots of land, and 
much commended for fineness of fleece and excellence of mutton ; 
but they are likely soon to disappear also, — those who have them 
appreciating the better size of the Cheviot sheep. 

A great variety of trout is found in the lakes. Salmon, grilse, 
and sea trout, are taken in the Brora and Fleet. The trout make 
for the burns falling into, or issuing from, the lakes, in the month 
of October, to deposit their spawn; and their spawning season lasts 

SUTHERLAND. D 



50 



SUTHEIILANDSHIRE. 



generally till the beginning of November, and seldom or never ex- 
tends beyond the middle of that month. Salmon begin to spawn 
fourteen days later, and before the middle of December ; that 
process being finished, they return to the sea. Salmon enter the 
Fleet in the end of May. They are found, and were taken, till a 
recent act of Parliament prohibited, at the mouth of the Brora, as 
early as the end of January ; but they are not seen in the upper 
part of that river, — the part belonging to this parish, — till the 
commencement of summer. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-moners. — The Duke and Duchess of Sutherland are pro- 
prietors of nearly the whole parish of Rogart. The other proprie- 
tors of land in it are, George Dempster, Esq. of Skibo, and Hugh 
Rose Ross, Esq. of GlastuUich and Cromarty, who have each a 
small patch in it unconnected with their principal estates. 

Antiquities. — At a place called Corrie, where there are indica- 
tions of the existence in former times of oak trees, imperfect re- 
mains of a Druidical circle are to be seen. The inhabitants, quite 
unconscious of the sacrilege, finding the stones composing it suit- 
able, carried them away for the purposes of building, so that but 
few of them are now to be seen. 

Tradition accords with the rude but certain monuments of battles, 
in showing that Rogart was in past times the scene of violent con- 
tests, and of much bloodshed. A ridge of hills crossing the eastern 
extremity of the parish from north to south, and extending from 
Strathbrora to Strathfleet, is covered with tumuli, which appear 
to have been thrown over the slain where they fell. One of these 
was opened lately by dikers erecting a fence around the glebe, 
having no idea that they invaded the resting place of a warrior, 
probably of an ancestor. They found in the centre of it a stone 
coffin, containing mouldered bones, and the blade of a dirk, or 
short dagger, which seemed to have been wielded by the hand 
of some leader, being of a more costly description than the com- 
mon dirk, coated with gold, and marked with lines, crossing one 
another at acute angles, and terminating in the point. It is likely 
that this bloody instrument was broken, and covered, in the wound 
it inflicted, and was thus retained in the body of its viclim. 

The Earl of Montrose on his return from Orkney passed un- 
molested through Strathfleet, where he and his followers halted 
for a night at a place called Rhin. The stillness and beauty of 



UOGART. 



51 



that spot forms a striking contrast with the struggle and disaster 
to which the next day's march conducted him. From Rhin he 
marched to Strathoicail, on the heights of which this bravest of 
unfortunate men fought his last battle. 

III. — Population. 
A continued decrease is found in the population of the parish 
of Rogart since the year 1811, — as may be seen by comparing the 
census of that year with the census of 1831, and with these sta- 
tistics. This decrease has been caused by emigration to the pro- 
vinces subject to Britain in North America, — chiefly to Upper 
Canada.

Language.~T\ie Celtic, or Gaelic, language is spoken by almost 
all the inhabitants. There are a few shepherds who do not speak 
this language ; but their families do. A considerable proportion 
of the inhabitants, however, can converse in the Enghsh language; 
and, in a few years it is likely that none may be found who cannot 
do so. Their English, being acquired from books, and occasional 
conversation with educated persons, is marked by no peculiarity, 
except a degree of mountain accent and Celtic idiom ; so that it 
is more easily intelligible to an Englishman than the dialect spoken 
by the Lowland Scotch. 

Character of the People.— K desire for information prevails 
among them, as, indeed, among all the inhabitants of the High- 



52 



SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



land districts ; and the degree of information they possess is 
more than could be expected from the advantages enjoyed by them. 
The young, in general, read Gaelic and English ; and some of thetn 
write and understand arithmetic. Such of those advanced in years 
as have been taught to read, delight much in the Holy Scriptures, 
and in some of. the popular works of the early divines of the church 
of Scotland, — which, having been read and talked of for genera- 
tions, have acquired a sacredness of character. They are all Pres- 
byterians, and firmly attached to the religion and modes of worship 
of their forefathers. They have hitherto been respectful to per- 
sons in stations superior to their own, peaceable and orderly in their 
intercourse with one another, and have seldom or never been charged 
with the commission of crime. Smuggling, happily for their cha- 
racter and circumstances, has been checked. Poaching in game, 
or in the salmon fisheries, is not attempted by them. 

There have been three illegitimate births in the parish during 
the last three years. 

IV. — Industry. 

A great part of the population of this parish is employed as 
day-labourers for more than half the year. The men find employ- 
ment in the making or repairing of roads ; or from the tacksmen in 
parishes along the coast as extra labourers in spring and harvest- 
time ; or, during the season of the herring fishing, in curing fish at 
the fishing stations. The women find employment with the farmers 
in weeding, hoeing, and cutting down crops, and with the fish-curers 
at the proper season. A certain portion of time is, of course, oc- 
cupied in the cultivation of their own lots, and in securing the 
crops which these produce. Some elderly persons of both sexes, 
helped by children not attending schools, are always occupied at 
home in herding cattle. 

Agriculture and Sheep-Farming. — The proportion of land in 
culture and yielding crops is small, and must always be so, while 
naked rock forms a considerable part of the surface of the pa- 
rish. It has, however, for several years back, been increasing ; 
and it is likely, that, in the course of some years, what is now 
occupied by letters, if left in their occupation, may become culti- 
vated where practicable. The quantity of land cultivated, or oc- 
casionally in tillage, does not at present exceed 1200 acres. 

Nearly the half of the parish in value, and more than the half in 
extent, is laid under sheep of the Cheviot breed. It is no less than 



ROGAIIT. 



53 



62,800 acres in extent. Probably 1000 acres might yet be added 
to the cultivated land. 

Husbandry. — The pasture for sheep is good, and the sheep 
reared on it are said to be of the best quality of their kind. Sur- 
face draining, which has been carried on to a great extent, has 
added much to the quantity, and improved the quality, of feeding 
for sheep. In this species of improvement, little remains to be now 
done here by the sheep-farmer. Large farms are let on leases of 
nineteen, and small lots on leases of seven, years. 

Live-Stock. — The number of sheep of all kinds is 6420 ; of 
black cattle, heads of, 1079 ; of horses, 276 ; of pigs, 210. 

Rent. — 

The rent of sheep-lands is - L. 648 0 0 

of corn-farms, - - 281 0 0 

of lands under letters, - 369 0 0 , 

Total rent, - L. 1498 0 0 

Woods. — Timber as yet cannot be mentioned as one of the pro- 
ducts of the parish of Rogart. A small space in Strathfleet, about 
twenty acres, having some native plants of oak, was enclosed, and 
planted with larch and common fir. The appearance of this small 
plantation, which has b&amp;en lately thinned for the first time, affords 
sufiicient encouragement for planting in situations equally favour- 
able ; of which situations the sides of that strath, and several other 
parts in the parish, present many. Small alders are to be seen along 
the streams ; and patches of dwarf birch are common. Both of 
these, when in foliage, enliven the aspect, and relieve the ruder 
features of the scenery ; but otherwise they are of no value. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : — 

Grain of all kinds, whetlier cultivated for food of man or the domestic animals, 3000 
bolls at 15s. per boll, . - . . L. 2250 0 0 

Potatoes, 1 500 bolls at 8s. per boll, ... 600 0 0 

Hay, 10,000 stones at 4d. - . . . 166 13 4 

Land in pasture, rating it at 10s. per cow or full-grown ox, grazed, or

Means of Communication. — A road extends through the whole 
length of the parish along Strathfleet ; and another crosses its

SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



breadth at the eastern end, from Strathfleet to Strathbrora. 
The road in Strathfleet is a continuation of a hne of road from 
Golspie to Tongue ; from which roads branch off in various direc- 
tions. From the cross-road to Strathbrora there is a road branch- 
ing off to Golspie, and forming a more direct and shorter way to 
that village for the inhabitants of the interior of the parish. Along 
these lines of road there are sufficient bridges. 

There is no post-office in this parish. Letters to and from it, 
for which there is a receiving-office at Pitentrail, are carried twice 
a-week by a mail-gig running between Golspie and Tongue. It 
is probable, other improvements continuing to advance, that the 
communication may become more frequent. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church and manse are situated, not 
far from each other, in one of the most elevated parts of the pa- 
rish, commanding an extensive and romantic view, — in which the 
peaks of almost all the high mountains in the county of Sutherland 
form a part. This is a source of enjojTnent which is dearly pur- 
chased, by the exposure to the wind and storm. The manse was 
built in the year 1776, and the church in 1777. The church has 
undergone some repair, and the manse has frequently been re- 
paired ; but, owing to the very exposed situation of the latter, 
it cannot be said to be in a good condition. For the parish, 
the situation of the church is most inconvenient, — being in its ex- 
treme boundary on the east. Consequently, some of the parishion- 
ers travel ten miles in coming to hear sermon ; which, being doubled 
before they return to their homes, is a severe exertion, though it 
be cheerfully made, even in the short days of winter. The dis- 
tance of the parishioners from the manse is also productive of much 
trouble and inconvenience to them. Having few besides their 
minister whom they consult, various and often recurring are the 
occasions which oblige them to travel from their place of resi- 
dence to his. 

The minister's stipend is L. 138, 14s. 2j''gd. Sterling, and 15 
bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 3 lippies, half-meal and half-barley, includ- 
ing the allowance for communion elements ; so that he draws 
L. 3, Is. 5d. from Exchequer, to make his income equal to the 
minimum stipend in the Church of Scotland. The glebe con- 
sists of arable and pasture land. The arable part has lately been 
considerably increased, by trenching small spots capable of im- 
provement : so that it may be about eighteen acres in extent A 



EOGART. 



55 



patch of green pasture, rocks, and spots covered with stintedheather, 
extend its surface to about twenty-five acres. Occupied alone, its 
value is not much, — servants, horses, and farming implements suf- 
ficient for the culture of a small farm being required for it. But if 
held alonar with an extent of land which would enable him to cul- 
tivate it conveniently, the occupant might find the arable part of 
it worth 15s. per acre, and the pasture of corresponding value. 

The church is the only place of worship in the parish. There 
is a catechist supported by an allowance from the inhabitants, to 
which the minister contributes : he labours constantly among them. 
The average number of communicants is 90. 

Education. — There are three schools at present in operation in 
the parish, — the parochial school, a school supported by the General 
Assembly, and a Gaelic school, supported by the Gaelic School 
Society. In the parochial school, English reading, writing, arith- 
metic, book-keeping, mensuration, and land-surveying, are taught. 
In the General Assembly's school, English reading, Gaelic read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and sometimes the rudiments of Latin, 
are taught. In the Gaelic school, the reading of the Gaelic only 
is taught. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4|d. 
The average amount of school fees received by him is L. 16. The 
salary of the General Assembly schoolmaster is L. 20. The ave- 
rage amount of school fees received by him is L. 2, 10s. 

The teacher of the Gaelic school is not allowed to take fees, by 
the regulations of the society. He is not stationary in any place. 
His salary is L. 25. To these teachers the requisite accommo- 
dations are given. Fees are exigible from those who can pay 
them in the General Assembly's school, at the same rate as in 
the parochial ; but the greater part of the scholars are not in cir- 
cumstances to afford them. In the parochial school, the fees per 
quarter are, for English reading, 2s. ; English reading and writ- 
ing, 2s. ; English reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. ; book- 
keeping, 10s. ; mensuration and land-surveying, 10s. Many of 
the inhabitants cannot read or write : Of these, the number of all 
ages above six years, given in the Report to the General Assem- 
bly's Committee in 1832, was 842 ; and the number betwixt six 
and twenty years, 290. 

There is a district of the parish, Barrschol and Craigfjies, con- 
taining a population of about 200, which is four miles distant from 



56 



SUTIIERLANDSIIIRE. 



the parochial school, and has no other school within reach. 
There is another district of the parish, in which some families re- 
side, Braes of Langwel and Aclnnluachrach, at a still greater dis- 
tance from any permanent school, in which the Gaelic Society's 
teacher at present officiates. 

Pool- and Parochial Funds. — On an average of years, the num- 
ber of paupers regularly receiving parochial aid may be stated at 84 ; 
but, in addition to these, there are several who receive occasional 
aid. Persons admitted on the poors' roll are generally advanced 
in age ; and charges for the interment of paupers form a consider- 
able expense on the fund. This fund consists of a yearly donation 
from the Duchess of Sutherland, regularly made, but depending 
on her Grace's good will, interest of L. 200 bequeathed by a be- 
nevolent individual, a native of the parish, and the church col- 
lections, the yearly average amount of which is L. 16. The 
average annual allowance to each pauper for some years back has 
been 4s. 9d. It has been felt degrading to receive parochial re- 
lief ; but there are many applicants for it who are rejected. 

Inns. — There are three houses in the parish, and one on the 
confines of it, licensed to retail spirits. They are found injurious 
to the morals and circumstances of the workinor classes. 

Fuel. — Moss, cut as peats in the months of May and June, 
and abounding of the best quality at no great distance from the 
inhabitants, is the fuel used by all. It is procured at considerable 
expense of time and labour; but the very poorest never fail to 
supply themselves with a stock sufficient for the year's consump- 
tion. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In the parochial school, writing and accounts have been so 
well taught for several years back,_ that many young men have set 
out from the parish, and found employment, some as clerks in 
mercantile towns, and some on plantation estates in the West In- 
dies. In general, these are reported to be persevering and indus- 
trious ; and small remittances frequently made to poor relatives, 
afford a pleasing proof that they are prosperous. Were the means 
of acquiring education given more fully, there is reason to con- 
clude that, in every respect, an improvement in the condition of 
the inhabitants must follow'. 

Roads and bridges justly claim particular mention in the im- 
provements which have taken place here, since the time of the last

Statistical Account. They have changed the mode, as well as im- 
proved the facility, of every species of carriage. Sledges, which may 
soon become one of the objects interesting to the antiquary, were 
formerly the best means of carriage which those in better circum- 
stances could use in farming, and for other purposes. Now, almost 
everv poor man who cultivates a croft of land, has his wheeled cart. 

The greatest change has taken place in the habits of the people 
since the last Account. They are now very industrious in general, 
and surpassed by none around them as willing, skilful, and active 
labourers in all those kinds of work which the extensive and varied 
improvements carried on in the county have supplied to its po- 
pulation. 

The traveller interested in the comfort of the working-classes 
must regard the cottages in this parish as pleasing objects ; and 
their number, seen, as they often are, in picturesque situations, must 
strike every observer, as giving life and interest to the scene pre- 
sented to his view. In no part of the North Highlands, are there 
so many well built neat-looking cottages as in the county of Suther- 
land. Whoever sees them, must form a favourable idea of the 
industry of the inhabitants, and of- the encouragement afforded 
them by the proprietor of the soil.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. DUNCAN M'GILLIVRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, — This parish seems to take its name from 
the Gaehc word " Loeg," signifying a " footpath." This defini- 
tion agrees well with its situation, as the road from the northern 
to the southern parts of the county, which till recently was only 
a footpath, passes through Lairg. Its length may be stated at 
thirty miles from E. to W., and its greatest breadth is about four- 
teen miles. Its extent in square miles, inclusive of the lake, is 
about 240 miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — It is an inland parish, distant 
from the sea about twenty miles; it is bounded on the north by the 
parish of Farr ; on the west by Assynt and Eddrachillis ; on the 
south by Criech ; and on the east by Rogart. There are hills of 
various elevations in most parts of the parish, and on its northern 
boundary stands Ben Clybric, the highest mountain in Suther- 
land. 

From the elevation of the parish above the level of the sea, 
which, though not minutely ascertained, is very considerable, the 
air is always pure, and in winter exceedingly cold. But though a 
good deal of rain and snow fall during the year, the climate can- 
not be called rainy : it is at all events a healthy one, and there are 
no distempers peculiar to the district. 

Hydrography. — There are about twenty lakes in the parish, of 
various extent and depth ; but the principal one is Lochshin, which 
runs very nearly from one end of the parish to the other. It is 
about twenty-four miles long; its mean breadth is at least one mile, 
and its depth in some places thirty fathoms. — There are five rivers 
in the parish, some of them very rapid. Four of these fall into 
Lochshin, and the fifth discharges its waters into the sea. 

Geology. — The geology of the parish has never been surveyed, 
but the principal rocks are coarse granite and trap. There is al- 
so at the side of the lake a large bed of limestone. 



LAIRG.

The most common alluvial deposit is peat, between which and 
the rock, gravel is generally found. In some places, however, the 
soil is loamy and fertile. Immense quantities of fir are found im- 
bedded in the moss in all parts of the parish, — a proof that at one 
time the ground was covered with wood. At present, however, 
there is none except some birch which grows along the lake. 
11, — Civil History. 

This parish does not appear in remote times to have produced 
any men of great eminence. In the absence of such, a few indi- 
viduals may therefore be mentioned, connected with, or natives of, 
the parish during the last century, and whose names are not un- 
worthy of a place in this record. 

The first we shall notice, is the Rev. John Mackay, a man of 
superior birth and education, who in 1714 was translated to Lairg 
from his native parish of Durness on the west coast. Mr Mackay 
found this parish in a rude uncivilized state, owing, among other 
causes, to the lingering remains of popish superstition and igno- 
rance, and to' the want of a resident ministry for several years be- 
fore. The Earls of Sutherland, the hereditary sheriffs of the 
county, strenuously endeavoured to remedy this evil, but found it 
difficult to procure faithful ministers of the Gospel, able to admi- 
nister spiritual instruction to the people in their native language. In 
Mr John Mackay the Earl of Sutherland found a man peculiarly fit- 
ted for such a charge, — as, with a profound knowledge of theology, 
acquired at the Universities of Utrecht and Edinburgh, and an 
enlightened zeal for the propagation of the gospel, he had a robust 
bodily frame, and corresponding vigour of mind. The parish af- 
forded ample scope for the exercise of his talents, — disorderly 
habits and immorality prevailing to a great degree, and drunken 
quarrels, even to the eff"usion of blood, being of frequent occur- 
rence in the churchyard on the Lord's day, after divine service, as 
appears from a fragment of the session records still extant. To 
repress such enormities, the Earl invested his new presentee with 
a salutary, though not strictly legal power, to use force and inflict 
corporal punishment when he judged it necessary. Armed with 
this authority, Mr John Mackay proceeded vigorously to the work 
of reformation among his people ; in which he was further assisted 
by a certain air of moral elevation in his bearing, which overawed 
persons of the most profligate character. He sometimes had re- 
course to very strong measures : but at length, by the blessing of 
God on his spiritual labours, he had the satisfaction to see pure 
religion in a flourishing state among his people. He died in 1 75.3, 



60 



SUTIIERLANDSIIIRE. 



and was succeeded by his son, the Rev. Thomas Mackay, wlio 
laboured fifty years in the parish with great success. The names 
of both father and son are still remembered with affectionate reve- 
rence. Mr T. Mackay left three sons, of whom the two youngest, 
Hugh and Wilham, distinguished themselves in their respective 
professions. 

Hugh Mackay entered the service of the East India Company 
in 1784, and served in the Madras Native Cavalry during all the 
wars in which the Madras army was engaged. He held an im- 
portant and lucrative staff appointment, that of agent for draught 
and carriage cattle to the army under General Wellesley, now 
the Duke of Wellington, whose favour and confidence he en- 
joyed to a large degree. His staff situation exempted him from 
regimental duty; yet such was his high military spirit, that, rather 
than remain idle in the rear, when his brother officers were engaged, 
he solicited permission to join his regiment in the battle of Assaye, 
and obtained from the General a reluctant assent. He was killed at 
the muzzle of the enemy's guns, in that desperate charge of the 
cavalry which decided the fete of the day ; and on the spot where 
he fell, the officers of his regiment have erected a monument to 
his memory. Besides many acts of beneficence at home and 
abroad, he bequeathed at his death L. 500 to the kirk-session of 
this parish, for the use of the poor. 

William, third son of the Rev. Thomas Mackay, was educated 
at the school of this parish, and went to sea at the age of sixteen. 
He made several voyages to the East and West Indies, during the 
intervals between which, he studied the theory of navigation and 
practical astronomy under able teachers in London, and became 
such a proficient in both, as to be esteemed one of the most skil- 
ful navigators in the Indian seas. In 1795, being second officer 
of the ship Juno of Calcutta, he was sent to the coast of Pegu for 
a cargo of teak-wood, and in his return was wrecked on the coast 
of Arracan. The ship sprang a leak, and filled so fast with water, 
in spite of the exertions of her crew, that, but for the nature of her 
cargo, she must inevitably have gone to the bottom. She conti- 
nued, however, to sink till her hull was under water, and then settled 
down, leaving her masts to stand erect. To lighten her burthen 
the main mast was cut away, and the unfortunnte crew, seventy-two 
in number, scrambled up the rigging of the two remaining masts to 
escape immediate destruction. In this situation, witiiout food or 
water, but what the rain from Heaven supplied, fourteen individuals, 
including the captain's wife and lier maid, lived twenty-three days.

Of the rest, some died from hunger, others from thirst, and a few in 
strong convulsions or in raving madness  The wreck having at length 
takei°the ground, fourteen were saved by the merciful interposition 
of Providence in their behalf. The principal survivor was William 
Mackay, and he published a narrative of the sufferings and escape of 
himself and his companions,— which, from the extraordinary nature 
of the facts, and the graphical fehcity of his narration, bids fair to 
transmit his name to posterity.  

Immediately after this wonderful preservation, William Mackay 
returned to sea, and after various adventures, was in 1801 dispatched 
by the Bengal government in command of a brig, to the Red Sea 
with stores and provisions for General Baird's army, destined to 
co-operate with that of Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt. On this 
voyage, he had another marvellous escape from shipwreck, and" 
was instrumental, by superior seamanship, under God, in saving 
the lives of many others, as may be seen in the appendix to a late 
edition of the Narrative of the Juno. He died at Calcutta in 1804, 
from an affection of the hver, contracted during the twenty-three 
dreadful days he passed on the wreck, f In the churchyard of this 
parish there is a square monument with a separate tablet for each, 
commemorating, by an appropriate inscription, the characters of 
the Rev. John Mackay, his son, and two grandsons. Concern- 
ing the last, it is said, " their bodies lie in the opposite quarter 
of the globe, but their monument is erected where their memory 
is dearest, near the remains of their pious fathers, and amidst many 
living, whose gratitude will attest, that fraternal affection has not 
overcharged this record of their virtues.'' 

• It js a circumstance worthy of remark, that from this narrative Lord Byi-on 
has borrowed some of the finest incidents and most touching images in the de- 
scription of a shipwreck, in liis poem of Don Juan. Concerning these passages the 
biographer of the noble poet observes • " It will be felt, I think, by every reader, 
that this is one of the instances in which poetry must be content to yield the palm to 
prose. There is a pathos in the last sentences of the seaman's recital "ree Narrative 
of the Shipwreck of the Juno, page 26, which the artifices of metre and rhyme were 
sure to disturb, and v/hich, indeed, no vei ses, however beautiful, could half so natu- 
rally and powerfully express." It deserves to be recorded, to the honour of our Scot- 
tish parochial schools, that this narrative was written by a young man who had gone 
to sea ten years before, without any more educalion than he received at the school of 
his native parish. 

f A tribute of remembrance, similar to that which his brother's memory received 
from his regiment, has been paid to llie memory of William by his friends, who have, 
in tile churchyard of Calcutta, recorded his worth, suirerings, and death. 

I It may not be irrelevant to subjoin a list of sons or grandsons of the clergy, who, 
at the time above referred to, were on General WeMesley's stall, and all of whom had 
been recommended to him solely by their own merits, viz. 

\st, Captain Hugh Mackay, agent for draught and carriage cattle to the army, 
killed at Assaye, 2:Jd September ISO.".

Land-owners.— The land-owners in the parish are the Duchess 
of Sutherland ; Munro of Poyntzfield ; and Rose of Achany. 

Parochial Register.— There is a parochial register regularly 
kept, but the earliest entry is dated only in 1768. 

Antiquities.— There is at a place called " Cnoek a chath" the 
Hill of the Fight a number of tumuli, said to be the graves of those 
who fell in a skirmish between the Sutherlands and the Mackays. 
There "are also found in various parts of the parish strong circular 
buildings called cairns. What the design of these was, cannot now 
be ascertained. When the people are questioned on this subject, 
the only answer is,—" They were built by the Fingalians." It is a 
curious circumstance, that one of these buildings is always visible 
from the site of another. 

Ill, — Population. 
The present population of the parish is about 1100. "Viat 
the ancient state of the population was, cannot now be discovered : 
but about thirty years ago, it was far greater than at present. A 
system commenced in this country about the year 1807, which has 
been followed out extensively. As the interior of the country con- 
sisted principally of moor grounds covered with heath, the pro- 
prietors were convinced that these grounds could be more profit- 
ably laid out in sheep-walks, than as formerly in the rearing of 
black, cattle. With this view, the interior was let to sheep-farmers, 
and the tenantry were removed either to the coast, or to those 
parts of the country more susceptible of cultivation. Lairg being 
an inland parish, this circumstance accounts for the great de- 
crease in its population. From Mr Rose's property, the tenants 
were all removed some years before he purchased it; and although 
the Duchess of Sutherland and Munro of Poyntzfield have still a 
considerable number of tenants, yet they are far less numerous 
than formerly. 

As to the measure of comfort enjoyed by the people, the chief 
want is pasture for their cattle during the summer months. The 
Duchess of Sutherland's tenantry have their land on very mo- 
derate terms; and though their pasture is at present confined, 
this defect we believe is to be immediately remedied. The 
other tenants in the parish are certainly less comfortable,— they

not only want pasture, but their rents far exceed the value of the 
land ; and the appearance of their houses tells but too plainly the 
condition of their inhabitants. The population of the parish is

ment : —

Language, Character, §-c. of the People— Vae language gene- 
rally spoken is the Gaehc ; and, although all the young people 
now speak English, the Gaelic can hardly be said to have lost 
ground, and the people, from being taught to read it, speak it more 
correctly than they did some years ago. 

The inhabitants of the parish are an interesting people ; — they 
are cleanly in their habits, and neat in their dress ; they combine 
intelligence with modesty, and due respect for their superiors ; they 
are sober, moral, and industrious ; and they show a becoming re- 
gard for the ordinances of religion. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — From the description already 
given of the parish, as consisting principally of moor ground, it 
will be seen that very little can be said under the head of agricul- 
ture. There is no great corn farm in the parish ; and, with the 
exception of the lots occupied by the tenants, which all lie within 
two and a-half miles of the church, the whole of it has been turn- 
ed into sheep-walks. The breed of sheep on these farms is the 
Cheviot, and that, too, we believe, of a superior kind, — as much 
attention has been paid to its improvement in all parts of the county. 
The average rent of grazing on the sheep farms does not exceed 
2s. a-head ; but what number of sheep there are on these farms, the 
writer has no means of discovering. The letters on the Duchess 
of Sutherland's property raise, in favourable seasons, as much corn 
as supplies their families during the year ; and of late, a very de- 
cided improvement has been manifested in the mode of cultivating 
their land. 

V, — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There is no market-town in the pa- 
rish, nor any nearer than Dornoch, which is distant from Lairg 



64 ' SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

about twenty miles. This want, however, is little felt, the people 
havino- everv advantage as regards the means of communication 
with other parts of the country. The roads of which there are 
about forty miles in the parish are excellent. There is a post- 
office, at which a post-gig carrying passengers ari-ives twice a-week ; 
and an idea of the means of communication enjoyed may be had 
from the fact, that the London papers are received at Lairg on the 
morning of the fifth day from the day of publication. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\ie parochial church, though distant about 
twenty miles from the western extremity of the parish, is exceed- 
ingly well situated for the convenience of the people, as, with few 
exceptions they all reside in its neighbourhood. Itwasbudt in 1794, 
and is always kept in a good state of repair. It accommodates 
about 500 people, and no seat-rents are exacted.— The manse 
was built in 1795, and was last repaired about eight years ago. 
—The glebe contains ten acres of arable land, and may be 
valued at L. 8 a-year. At one period, there was a considerable 
extent of hill pasture connected with the glebe; this, however, 
has been lost by reason of a circumstance of common occurrence 
in the Highlands,-the clergy neglected, till it was too late, to 
have their glebes regularly designed.-The stipend amounts to 
L 184, 14s., including L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 1 he 
parish church is always well attended : and it is worthy of remark, 
lhat there is no dissenting place of worship in the whole coun y 
of Sutherland,-afact which cannot be affirmed of any other county 

in Britain. , , . , • i 

Education.-T\.e parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
Till lately, there was an Assembly school on Major Munro s 
property, but, owing in a great measure to the thinness of the po- 
pulaS it has been discontinued. This is the only part of the 
pa ish where a school is required at present. In the parochial 
school one of the best in the country, all the common branches 
ofed icrt on are taught. The following table of fees appomted 
by tt resbytery, will give an- idea of the expense of education

annum, makes his yearly income only L. 42, 14s. Ad. 

Poor. — The poor of the parish are comparatively well provided 
for. The yearly collections are indeed small, not exceeding L. 12; 
but the Duchess of Sutherland makes a yearly allowance to the 
poor of all the parishes in which she has property : and the poor of 
Lairg have, besides, an annuity of L. 25, being the interest of 
L. 150 left to them by Captain H. Mackay, above-mentioned. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

On the difference between the present state of the parish, and 
its state at the time of the last Statistical Account, it is unneces- 
sary to enlarge. The change produced on the condition of the 
people by the introduction of sheep-farming has been already no- 
ticed,— a change which, though for the time it subjected the 
people to very serious inconvenience, is now showing its salutary 
effects in the increased industry of the population. In proof of 
this, we need only refer to the improvements so rapidly going on 
in those parts of the parish possessed by the tenantry. 

It may here be observed, that nothing would tend more to ex- 
tend these improvements, than giving the people increased facili- 
ties for obtaining lime. To accomplish this object, the people 
should be assisted in working the lime quarries found in this pa- 
rish ; nor can we doubt, from the enlightened management of the 
country, that this assistance will soon be afforded. We may far- 
ther recommend, as a grand means for enlarging the minds and im- 
proving the morals of the people, the establishment of a parish li- 
brary. The inhabitants, and especially the young, have a taste for 
reading, and would eagerly avail themselves of such an institution. 
For the awakening of this taste, they have been principally indebted 
to their present parochial teacher ; an individual who has laboured 
for years not merely to communicate the dry husks of mechanical 
learning, but to enlighten the mind, and thus improve the character.

THE REV. DAVID MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
" ame -The parish appears to have been called Farr tor more 
thanToO years. The name is probably derived from the Gaehc 
W Fair , a watch or centinel ; for, about half a "orth o 
The parish church is the ruin of a circular tower, or to, the 
near sT the sea-coast of a chain of these ancient buadmgs,x- 
ending for more than twenty-four miles -J " 
far from this Dunn, is the promontory called Fan Head, tiom 
w ich, b clear weather, there is a distinct view ll. 
northern ocean, which lies betwixt Orkney and Cape Wratii. 
From this promontory, a centinel or watch could easily discover 
.s"lt;r adiing L coast, and, during the period o invasions 
rom Denmark and Orkney, could speedily communicate the ne- 
cessary inlhgence to the inhabitants of the interior, by meansof 
he chain of tLers, and such signals as -e lieii m use This, 
however, is only a conjecture as to the name of the P' 
ed on the geo-aphicll relation of the place now called Farr to 
Strathnave, wherl the principal chain of 
which strath, in ancient times, was the most populous 
interesting part of the parish. 

Fxtent and Boundaries.— T\\e parish is about loriy  
■f rn/f7om B-iligil in the north-east to Muadale ui the south- 
miles long, ''""'l „,iles in breadth, the nar- 
west ; and vanes f.om Strathnaver It is bounded 

and Lairg ; and on the west, by the parish of Tongue.

the south-west extremity, and not far from the Parliamentary 
road from Bonar Bridge to Tongue. Its height is 3200 feet 
above the level of the sea. Its form is conical, especially towards 
the summit, which is called " Meall'a'neuion," that is, the summit 
of the Bird, probably from its being the chief residence of ptar- 
migan in the parish. Towards the sea-coast, to the north-east, 
on each side of Strathnaver, there are several hills, of various 
dimensions; but they are all far below the elevation of Chli- 
brig, and have nothing in their form or relative position deserving 
of notice. Near the coast, the low hills exhibit a greater quan- 
tity of bare rock, and are in general more precipitous. 

The greatest quantity and extent of low flat land is in Strath- 
naver and Strathrathy in the interior; and in Armidale and Mains 
of Strathy on the sea-coast. Thefe are several farms along the 
shore, in all of which there is a considerable extent of arable land ; 
but the surface is uneven. 

Straths. — The largest valleys are Strathnaver and Strathrathy. 
Strathnaver, a place from which the Noble family of Sutherland 
have one of their titles, is a beautiful valley, extending from the 
sea-coast, in a south-west direction, — a distance of about twenty- 
eight miles, including the ground along the river, the loch, and 
the Water of Mudale, beyond Lochnaver. Considering the ex- 
tent of this strath, the beauty and variety of the scenery, which 
almost invariably attract the notice of the traveller of taste, and 
the richness of the pasture it everywhere produces, this valley is 
undoubtedly the finest and most interesting Highland strath in the 
■ whole county of Sutherland. Strathrathy stretches directly south 
from the sea-coast, a distance of twelve miles ; it is about ten miles 
north-east of Strathnaver. Between these, along the sea-coast, 
are situated the valleys of Clachan, where the parish church and 
manse are built, Swordly, Kirtomy, and Armidale ; but these are 
quite diminutive compared to those already described. 

Caves, Sfc. — There are several caves, natural arches, and fissures, 
along the sea-coast, and a few caverns in the interior. The most 
interesting of the caves are in the Aird of Kirtomy, Strathy, and 
Strathy-point. The finest natural arch is near Farr. It is de- 
scribed in Pennant's Tour, and referred to in the former Statistical 
Account of this parish. The largest cavern in the interior is in 
Cam a'Mhadi, in Bein Chlibrig, noted in tlie traditional history 
of the parish as the retreat of a robber named Chisholm from In- 



gg SUTHERLANDSIimE. 

verness-shire, who, more than a hundred years ago, had taken 
sheUer there, and for some time supported himsell by the deer ol 
Bein Chhbrig, and the flocks of the neighbouring tenants. Any 
farther description of the caves and caverns in this parish is con- 
sidered unnecessary in this work. 

Bays ii-c— There are about thirteen miles of sea-coast, trom 
Naver Bay in the west to Bahgil Burn in the east. With the ex- 
ception of Kirtomy and Armidale, and a few more creeks where 
boats can land in moderate weather, the coast is either bold and dan- 
gerous to mariners, being composed of perpendicular - PJ 
rocks, from20 to200feet high, against which the waves of the No th 
ern Ocean break withawfulfury;orthereareshallowsands,onwhich 

leaw surges are almost invariably rolhng. The bays are Naver 
Farl Kirfomv, Armidale, and Strathy. The principal headlands

From this Head, the Lights of Cape Wrath and Dunnet Head

points in its vicinity. And there is an excellent road on the north 
side of the loch, from which the tourist can see the whole with ease 
and advantage. 

The principal rivers in the parish are the Naver, the Borgie, and 
the Strathy. The Naver issues from the loch already described, 
near Achness, at which place it receives a large stream running 
from Loch Coir-na-fearn. From Achness it runs north-east, a 
distance of eighteen miles, until it enters the ocean at the farm 
of Airdniskech. Besides its supply from Loch Naver and Loch 
Coir-na-fearn, it receives a number of considerable streams in its 
course through the strath, so that, when flooded in winter, it is 
the largest river in the county. The Naver is not rapid in its 
course, the declivity of the strath being very gradual. The 
Strathy flows from the loch of that name, and from the adja- 
cent hills and marshes ; and is, when flooded, a large stream. 
The Borgie runs from Loch Loyal in the parish of Tongue ; and 
is, in some parts of its course, the boundary line between this pa- 
rish and Tongue. But its salmon-fishings have been for a long 
time the property of the Noble family of Sutherland. It enters the 
Northern Ocean within a mile of the Naver, at a place in the pa- 
rish of Tongue called Torrisdale. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks and stones in this parish, 
of which immense quantities are to be seen in every direction, 
especially along the coast, appear to be chiefly coarse granite, gneiss, 
and sandstone. In Kirtomy on the sea-coast, there is an exten- 
sive deposit of old red sandstone, mixed with conglomerate. At 
Strathy, there is a large quarry of white sandstone, which takes 
dressing by the chissel ; and near it, a considerable extent of lime- 
stone, from which excellent lime is manufactured for the supply of 
the parishioners. 

The most of the rocks and precipices along the shore exhibit a 
great variety of veins and fissures which cut across the strata, and 
greatly derange and alter them. But in many places on the coast 
and in the interior, the strata are distinctly and regularly arranged : 
and in such cases the inclination and dip are not many deo-rees 
from perpendicular. The most striking and marked exception is 
at Strathy, in the free and limestone quarries, where the strata are 
iiorizontal. 

The soil along the coast, especially near the bays, is light and 
sandy ; on the banks of the Naver and Stratliy it i s composed of 
sand, gravel, and moss ; and in the interior, at tlic base of the 



70 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

hills, and near the different lochs, except Loch Naver, the soil is 
a deep moss. 

Zoolony.—lt is reported traditionally, that bears and wolves at 
one period existed in this parish. But this must have been when 
those extensive forests of fir grew in this country, the remains of 
which are still found deeply imbedded inmoss, and are raised by 
the parishioners for roofing their houses, and other domestic pur- 
poses The only species of animals which existed in comparatively 
modern times in the parish, but which have now disappeared, are 
goats. About forty years ago, they were numerous, and serviceable 
to the inhabitants ; but, by the introduction of the sheep-farming 
system, they have been entirely exterminated. , , . , . 

The sheep-farmers rear the Cheviot or white-faced kmd of 
sheep. The letters have a breed of small Highland cattle ; a few 
ponies of a similar description ; and sheep of the black-faced kmd. 

On Bein Chlibrig, and the adjacent higher hills, there are con- 
siderable flocks of red deer. Hares and rabbits are found in the 
parish. Ptarmigan, black-cock, grouse, partridge, plover, and snipe, 
are numerous in the hills, moors, and inland glens. A great num- 
ber of aquatic fowl frequent the sea-coast and fresh-water lakes; 
and the woods of Strathnaver are throngly tenanted by various 
classes of birds. The cuckoo, lapwing, and swallow pay their an- 
nual visits ; and, so far as- they escape the vigilance of game- 
keepers and vermin-destroyers-foxes, otters, wild cats, eagles, 
hawks, ravens, and carrion-crows, are to be found. 

In he largi rivers and lakes, there is abundance of salmoii ; and 
in the lesser lochs and streams, trout are found m considerable 
quakes. There is a rich supply of cod, ling, -J 
ring, in their season, on the sea-coast. Turbot and ™ackeiel la e

Botany-T\.e herbage of this parish is of a mixed character,

and shore ground : and, on the whole, tlie parish affcn-ds an inte-

birch. The alder tree grows to a considerable size on the banks 
of the Naver and Loch Coir-na-fearn ; but the birch is the most 
abundant, and, on the banks of Loch Naver, the most flourishing- 
wood in the parish. 

II. — Civil History. 

The only printed accounts of the ancient state of the parish, so 
far as known to the writer of this article, are to be found in Sir 
Robert Gordon's History of the Earldom of Sutherland, and in 
Mr Robert Mackay's History of the House and Clan of Mackay, 
published in 1829. Any manuscript documents tending to throw 
light on the ancient state of the parish, which might have been in 
the possession of heritors, or wadsetters, formerly occupying lands 
within its bounds, are supposed to be now in the archives of the 
Duke of Sutherland, the proprietor of the whole parish. The 
most accurate geographical description of the boundaries and lo- 
calities of the parish is to be found in a map of the county, lately 
published by Mr Burnet, from a particular survey taken by order 
of the late Duke of Sutherland. 

Parochial Registers. — The only parochial registers extant are a 
book in which the minutes of the kirk-session are kept ; and ano- 
ther, in which births and marriages are recorded. The earliest 
entry in the first is in the year 1754; and in the second, in the 
year 1800. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of the parish consist of the re- 
mains of several circular towers or dunns, built of large undrest 
stones without mortar ; a number of barrows or tumuli ; a few erect 
stones in the form of obelisks ; and the ruins of a castle built with 
mortar. The remains of the circular towers are in Strathnaver. The 
principal field of tumuli is about half a mile east from the parish 
church, close by the public road to Thurso. The finest erect stone 
is in the churchyard of Farr ; and the ruin of the castle is on a small 
peninsula about a mile and a half north of the parish church. The 
traditions connected with the more ancient relics are imperfect. It 
is reported, that the circular towers were built and occupied by an 
ancient race called, in Gaelic, Cruinnich, from either of two Gaelic 
words, cruinn, round or circular; or cruinnachadh, a gathering. 
The tumuli indicate fields of battle, on which foreigners, especially 
Danes, and the native inhabitants, had bloody conflicts ; and the 
erect stones are said to point out the places where chieftains have 
been interred. This is very probable, from the circumstance of 
these stones being seen not far from the fields of tumuli ; as is the 



72 SUTHERLANDSllIRE. 

case at Dalharrold in Stratbnaver, and in the church-yard of Farr. 
The stone in the latter place has been evidently brought there 
either from a foreign country, or from some other part of this kmg- 
dom. It is very hard, but differs entirely in its appearance and 
qudity from any of the rocks in this neighbourhood. It is about 
twelve feet long, more than five feet being above ground, and as 
many under it. There is a regular figure carved on the west 
front of it, evidently hieroglyphic— The ancient castle is sup- 
posed to have been the residence of the Mackays of Farr pre- 
vious to their being created barons, and obtainmg the title of Lord 
Reay. It is not known by whom it was built.  

III. — Population. 
From the remains of antiquity mentioned under the former head, 
it is evident there must have been a considerable population, either 
occasionally resorting to this parish, or permanently residing with- 
in it at a very remote period of the history of Scotland. About 
400 years ago, the Mackays began to make themselves conspicu-

ous in this district as a clan. Fan- and Strathnaver appear to 
have been the principal residence of the Mackays during the 
fifteenth, sixteenth, and part of the seventeeth centuries, and 
that clan is still the most numerous in the parish. After the 
Earls of Sutherland formed a marriage aUiance with the Gordons, 
some of that clan came to reside in Strathnaver,— so that at one 
period, perhaps a hundred years ago, there were few in the parish 
but Mackays and Gordons. They are still the most numerous 



names. 



In ancient times, the inhabitants were no doubt in a very barba- 
rous state, living mostly by plunder, and robbed of their property 
in return. During the universal reign of Popery in Scotland, that 
system of behef found its way to this parish, and was most probably 
professed by all the inhabitants. The principles of the Reforma- 
tion were, at an early period after their introduction into Scotland, 
embraced by the Earls of Sutherland, and the first Lord Reay, 
and disseminated among the people of this parish. In consequence 
of this happy change in religious principles and views, civilization 
and o-ood order advanced, and the parishioners gradually became 
a religious and moral population. 

The census of 1831, compared with the return in 1790, shows 
a decrease of 400 in the population. This was owing to the in- 
troduction of the sheep-farming system. By its adoption, the 
farmers and tenants who occupied the straths and glens in the 
interior were, in 1818 and 1819, all removed from these posses- 
sions. Allotments of land were marked out on the sea-coast for 
such as were thus removed. In these' the greater number of the 
removing tenants settled ; but several families quitted the parish 
altogether, and thus diminished the population. 

The tenants, or letters, on the sea-coast, live on their respective 
farms or townships. In these townships, there are from eight to for- 
ty-five houses, according to the quantity of land ; and the houses 
stand at a considerable distance from each other, not in the man- 
ner of a regularly formed village.

the year 1800, it is impossible to classify the ages of persons above 
thirty years. It is certain, however, there are a number of healthy, 
active people in the parish from fifty to sixty, many from sixty 
to eighty ; and a few vigorous and stout from eighty to ninety.

ber of insane in the parish, 1 ; fatuous, a female, 1 ; blind, a male 
and a female, 2; deaf, a male, 1 ; dumb, a male, 1. 

Language, Character, Sfc. of the People. — The Gaehc language 
is spoken in common conversation, and it is in that language that 
the people receive rehgious instruction with most advantage. Their 
language has been rather improved of late by means of Gaelic 
schools. The English, however, is gaining ground considerably, 
especially among the younger part of the population. The 
people are more cleanly in their habits than they were forty 
years ag'o. They dress neatly on public occasions, and in the 
cloths and cottons of south country manufacture, make a more 
showy appearance than their ancestors in the more homely but 
more substantial garbs wrought at home. Their ordinary food 
consists of the produce of their lots, viz. oat and barley meal, milk, 
potatoes, and cabbages, — with fish, especially herring. Very little 
butcher meat is used by the natives ; but a considerable quantity 
of tea and sugar is consumed in the parish. 

The people are social among themselves ; kind and hospitable to 
strangers, according to their circumstances ; acute and intelligent, 
according to their advantages ; moral in their general habits ; re- 
gular in attending on religious ordinances ; and many among them 
decidedly pious. Smugghng is entirely abandoned by them, and 
poaching is almost unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Ecojiomi/.— Excerpt about 600 acres on 
the sea coast, which are kept in cultivation by the letters, the whole 
of the land of this parish, formerly in tillage, is, with the adjacent 
mountains, hills, and glens, laid out in extensive sheep walks. 
From the great extent of the parish, and the nature of its sur- 
face, it is impossible to give its measurement in acres with any de- 
gree of accuracy. The different plots of trees in the parish cover 
about 800 acres ; and of late years, considerable attention has been 
given to the woods in Strathnaver, by pruning and thinning. 

Bent of Land— The average rent of the land occupied by the 
letters is 16s. per acre, including their privilege of hill-common 



FARH. 



75 



and peat-moss. The rent paid by the sheep-farmers is mode- 
rate. 

Rate of Wages— T\iQ allowance to day labourers is from Is. 6d. 
to Is. 9d. per day often hours; to masons 15s.; to carpenters from 
9s. to 12s. per week. The letters use the Highland delving spade 
in labouring their land. To this they are forced, partly by being 
unable to rear horses for the plough, and partly by the very un- 
even surface of their lots. The greater part of the land in their 
possession is susceptible of considerable improvement by trench- 
ing, draining, removing heaps of stones, inclosing their lots, and 
turning them with the plough. 

Husbandry.— T\\e sheep farms are in the possession of gentle- 
men, who are sufficiently attentive to every kind of improvement of 
which pastoral districts are susceptible,— by draining, embanking, 
and burning heath. The leases of the sheep farmers are given 
for nineteen years : but the lotters on the coast are tenants at will, 
which is evidently a bar to the improvement of their lots. 

Fishings. — The principal fishings are those of salmon and her- 
ring. Of late years, the rivers have been fished by the heritor, and 
the salmon sold at a certain rate per pound raw, to a Company who 
have a curing estabhshment in the parish. In consequence of 
this plan, the present rent of the salmon fishings of Naver, Borgie, 
and Strathy cannot be ascertained. The fishings are kept up by 
proper guards in close time on the rivers to prevent poaching; and 
by having a sufficient supply of fishing and curing materials during 
the fishing season. 

Produce. — As very little of the raw produce is brought to mar- 
ket within the parish, it is not easy to state its amount. The fol- 
lowing account is submitted, however, — giving an average of the 
last three years.

season, ships from the south ports of Scotland, from England and 
Ireland, come to the coast to land cargoes of salt and barrels, and 
to carry the cured fish to market. There are no ships belonging 
to the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication, Sj-c— The nearest market-town is 
Thurso, thirty-two miles from this place. There is a post-of- 
fice here connected with that of Thurso ; and a mail diligence, 
drawn by two horses, and carrying four passengers, which runs 
three days in the week from Thurso to Tongue, and alternately 
back; and there is a weekly carrier from Tongue to Thurso. 
There are no turnpike roads in the parish; but a considerable 
extent of the Parliamentary road from Bonar Bridge to Tongue 
passes through the heights, and about sixteen miles of the ge- 
neral line from Tongue to Thurso run near the sea-coast. On 
the roads in this parish there are two bridges of three arches each, 
twelve of one arch, and a chain-boat on the river Naver. There 
are no regular harbours. The safest landing-places for boats are 
Kirtomy and Armidale. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is conveniently situat- 
ed for the population who are now attached to it, since the erec- 
tion of the Government church. It stands close to the sea-coast, 
and is about thirty miles from some parts of the interior. But 
these remote parts are occupied only by a few shepherds in the 
employment of the sheep-farmers. The parish-church was built 
in 1774, is a commodious and substantial building, and is kept in 
good repair. It is seated for about 750. The communion table 
is, on ordinary Sabbaths, free to the poor, and accommodates 
about 64. 

There is a Government church and manse at Strathy, ten miles 
east from the parish church. This church was built in 1826, and 
its present minister was appointed to it in 1828. It accommodates 
about 350 sitters. Thus, in a parish, the population of which is 
about 2100, we have church accommodation for 1160 persons. 

The manse was built in 1818, is a commodious house, and kept 
in sufficient repair. There are about six acres of arable land, some 
meadow-pasture, and a considerable extent of hill ground, with a 
right to peats,-legally designed as a glebe. The value of these 
may be estimated at L. 25 per annum. The stipend is L. 106, 
14s. Sterling, including L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling for communion cle-

ments. The teinds are exhausted. There is a catechist appointed 
by the kirk-session, and paid by the people. 

There is no Dissenting chapel in the parish ; and, with the ex- 
ception of one shepherd from the borders, who is of the Anti- 
burgher persuasion, and a shepherd's wife from Lochaber, who is 
a Roman Catholic, there is not a Dissenter of any description in 
the parish. Divine service is generally well attended, on ordinary 
and communion Sabbaths, in the parish and Government church ; 
and the people, old and young, are punctual in attending family 
and village examinations, are in general well acquainted with the 
Shorter Catechism of our church, and have regularly the worship 
of God in their families. The average number of communicants 
may be stated at 130. 

There is no society for rehgious purposes established in the pa- 
rish ; but, for the last nineteen years, collections have been made, 
almost annually in our congregations, for missionary and educa- 
tional objects in Scotland, and the average amount of these is about 
L 5, 10s. Sterling. 

Education. — There are at present four schools in the parish, viz. 
the parochial school; one supported by the Committee of the Ge- 
neral Assembly; one by the Glasgow Auxiliary Gaelic School So- 
ciety ; and one on the Second Patent of the Society for Propagat- 
ing Christian Knowledge in the Highland and islands of Scotland. 
The parochial schoolmaster is qualified to teach Latin, Greek, 
mathematics, and the ordinary branches of English literature ; and 
the teacher of the General Assembly's Committee is required to 
teach Latin, mathematics, English, and Gaehc. The branches 
generally taught, are English reading and grammar, writing and- 
arithmetic, and Gaehc reading. 

The parochial teacher has the maximum salary; L. 3 Sterling, 
in lieu of a garden ; L. 1 13s. 4d. of session-clerk dues ; 4s. for 
proclaiming banns, and registering each marriage ; 6d. for record- 
ing each baptism ; and a house of three apartments. His rate of 
school-fees is, for beginners, 6s. per annum ; for reading and 
writing, 8s. ; for arithmetic, 12s.; and for higher branches, 20s. per 
annum. The teacher employed by the Committee of the Gene- 
ral Assembly has a salary of L. 25 ; three apartments ; a croft 
of land, and a garden from the heritor ; and fuel provided by the 
inhabitants of the district. He is allowed to exact fees, according 
to the rate demanded in the parochial school ; only in cases of in- 
digence certified by the minister and elders, a certain modification, 



78 



SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



or an exemption altogether, is permitted. The teacher employ- 
ed by the Glasgow Society has L. 12 of a salary, and two apart- 
ments. He is furnished with fuel by the inhabitants, and is allow- 
ed to exact fees on the same principle with the teacher under the 
General Assembly's Committee. The teacher on the scheme 
of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge has L. 4 of 
salary, a house and croft of land, with fees. 

Last winter, about 240 individuals, from the age of five years to 
twenty, attended the different schools in the parish. But owing to the 
general poverty of the parishioners, and to the circumstance, that they 
are under the necessity of having their children, when they arrive at 
the age of ten or twelve years, employed, especially in the summer 
and harvest months, either in working about their own dwellings, 
or earning something for their support, in the service of others,— 
education is very imperfectly acquired by a majority of the young. 
Of those, however, from ten to thirty years of age, the greater 
number do read either Enghsh or Gaelic; many read both, and 
a considerable number write, and can keep accounts. Even at 
the oldest age at which the people arrive, a considerable num- 
ber are found who read the Scriptures fluently, and with benefit. 
But it is among the aged that the greater number are met with 
who can neither read nor write. In 1832, it was computed that 
870 persons of all ages above six were unable to read ; and 300 
betwixt six and twenty. 

The people value the benefits of education, and would most 
willingly give their children greater advantages, did their circum- 
stances allow it. A permanent school at Armidale, with those 
already established, would supply the inhabitants of the sea-coast 
with the means of education. It is impossible to place a school m 
the interior, so as to accommodate its scattered and widely sepa- 
rated inhabitants, consisting of a few families of shepherds. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank was established this year for 
the benefit of the whole county;— of which the Duke of Sutherland 
is patron and treasurer; James Loch, Esq. M. P. president; and 
the three resident factors of the Duke of Sutherland in this shire, 
vice-presidents. There are trustees appointed in this parish, who 
meet every fortnight to receive deposits and give out money as oc- 
casion requires. The head bank is at Golspie, near Dunrobin, 
the seat of the Duke of Sutherland. All deposits are sent from 
this parish to it; for which the contributors have the receipt of the 
patron and treasurer, and are allowed four per cent, intereston sums 



FARR. 



79 



not exceeding L. 20. Little can be said yet of the advantages of 
this bank, as the first deposit was made in this parish only on the 
15th day of February last ; but considerable benefit is anticipated 
from it today-labourers, fishermen, and farm-servants, in the course 
of a few years. The Duke of Sutherland is deeply interested in 
its prosperity. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 76; and the average sum allowed them 
is from 13s. to 3s. per annum, according to their circumstances, 
as certified by the elders of their respective districts. The an- 
nual average amount of contributions for their support, during the 
last five years, has been about L. 27 Sterling, arising from church 
collections, amounting to L. 20 per annum, and from donations by 
heritors, amounting to L. 8 on an average of the last five years. 
No other method of procuring funds for the poor has been resorted 
to, and in general they seem content with the existing system. The 
Marchioness of Stafford, now Duchess Countess of Sutherland, for 
more than twenty years gave, and continues to give, an annual do- 
nation of L. 6 to the poor of this parish. Occasional donations 
have been given, besides, by members of the Noble family when 
visiting this parish, and when important changes by marriages and 
births took place among them ; and by such means, a small fund 
is at interest for the benefit of the poor. 

Market. — There is a market held at Bettyhill, near this place, 
on the first Wednesday of November, N. S. for general traffic. 

Inns. — There are three licensed inns, so situated as to be con- 
venient to the parishioners and the public at large. Tippling- 
houses are entirely suppressed, and their extinction has a good ef- 
fect on the morals of the people in general. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

When the former Account was written, a considerable number of 
tacksmen, natives of the parish, occupied extensive farms in diffe- 
rent parts of it; and with them, a dense population of subtenants 
resided in the interior straths and glens. Now, however, all the 
lands, both hill and dale, which they possessed, are held in lease 
by a few sheep-farmers, all non-resident gentlemen, — some of them 
living in Caithness, some on the south coast of this county, and 
some in England ; and the straths, in which hundreds of families 
lived comfortably, are now tenanted by about twenty-four families 
of herds. In place of the scores of Highland cattle, horses, sheep, 
and goats, which formerly were brought to market, or used for do- 



80 



SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



mestic purposes, now thousands of fleeces of Cheviot wool, wedders, 
and ewes, are annually exported. . The people who had been re- 
moved from the interior in 1818 and 1819, when these great changes 
took place, are thickly settled along the sea-coast of the parish, 
—in some instances about thirty letters occupying the land for- 
merly in the possession of twelve, and some of them placed on 
ground which had been formerly uncultivated. 

This alteration in the locahty of the parishioners has been fol- 
lowed by a corresponding change in the general system of their 
occupation. Instead of tending flocks, and following other avoca- 
tions connected with the habits of an inland population, they are 
now partly employed in cultivating their small pendicles of land; 
but more vigorously engaged, especially the young, in preparing 
the necessary fishing implements, and prosecuting the fishmg m 
its season. The females, in place of manufacturing tartans, and 
other woollen cloths, for their husbands, brothers, and other rela- 
tives, now use the spinning wheel in preparing hemp for herring- 
nets ; and the labour of the country weaver is considerably set 
aside by the knitting of the nets. The Garb of Auld Gaul is en- 
tirely superseded by the fisherman's habilments; and our population, 
who in early life traversed the hills, moors, and crags of the inte- 
rior, now cautiously steer their boats on the waves of the Northern 
' Ocean, and actively carry on the various labours connected with 
the fish-curing stations. 

The changes referred to in the locaUty and in the employments 
of the inhabitants have had their influence on the state of society in 
the parish. Although there are greater facilities of communication 
than formerly with different parts of the kingdom, the manners of 
the resident population are not thereby improved. It is a well 
authenticated fact in this country, that the herring fishmg is not 
conducive to the improvement of the morals of those engaged in 
it The leaseholders of our large sheep-farms are, as was already 
mentioned, all non-resident gentlemen. But the former tacksmen 
resided on their own farms, most of them having respectable and 
numerous families. By their education and status in society, as 
iustices of peace, and officers in the army, their example, m their 
general intercourse with the people, had an influence m giving a 
respectable tone to society, which is now almost gone. There is 
not now a resident justice of the peace in the parish, whereas there 
was formerly a most respectable bench of such civil magistrates ; and 
the permanent population being composed of letters, day-labourers.

fishermen, and herds, the people, in general, are much more ple- 
bian, than when the former Account was written. On the other 
hand, the improvements by roads, bridges, more commodious inns, 
neater cottages, and more regular and sure means' of communica- 
tion, form a most interesting and pleasant variety since the date of 
that Account. An increase in the number of those who read the 
Scriptures in English and Gaelic, and a more extensive circula- 
tion of the sacred volume among the families of the parishioners, 
are also among the important changes which have since taken place. 
The openness of the winters, the absence of those heavy and long- 
continued storms of snow, which in former times were so destruc- 
tive to every description of stock, and the general mildness and 
fruitfulness of the seasons, ought not to be omitted under this 
head. Since the harvest of 1816, there has not been an extensive 
failure in the ordinary crop of the parish. 

There is much room for improvement on the sea-coast, by a 
better system of husbandry among the lotters, by rendering the 
landing-places for boats more commodious and secure, and by an 
increase of branch roads to some of the townships. It is much 
to be regretted that the inhabitants have not more permanent 
and regular employment during the winter and spring months ; for 
by the want of such employment, a great portion of their time 
is wasted in idleness and dissipation ; whereas, they would most 
willingly avail themselves of any additional opportunities of labour.

PRESBYTERY OF TONGUE, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. WILLIAM FINDLATER, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The name Durness, or, as it is pronounced by the na- 
tives, Duirinish, is evidently of Gaelic origin.  By some it has 
been derived from Dorrain, i. e. storms or tempest, and nisoxness 
a promontory. Others derive the word from Dubli, black; raon, 
■ field ; and ness or nis, a promontory,— ZM5/i-/ii-iis. But as the 
word ness or nis is seldom, if ever, used to signify a point or pro- 
montory in Gaelic, it may with greater probability be derived from 
Burin, the principal township in the parish, and innis, a green 
patch or grazing,— literally an oasis in a desert. Hence the word 
mneness, a green knoll near the Deer Forest in this parish, is de- 
rived from sithin, venison, and innis, a grazing. 

Formerly the parish of Durness comprehended the whole of the 
district known by Lord Beay's Country, or, as it is called in Gaelic, 
Duthaich MJiic Aoi, L e. The Land of the Mackays, extending 
from the river of Borgie near Strathnaver, to the Kyle of Assynt, 
and comprehending a space of about 800 square iniles  Since 
1724 it has been divided into three parishes, az. Edderachillis, 
Durness, and Tongue: with the parish of Farr, it was disjoined 
from the presbytery of Caithness, and by Act of Assembly at- 
tached to the presbytery of Tongue. , , o 

Boundaries.-li is bounded on the N. by the Northern Ocean; 
on the E. by the parish of Tongue; on the S. and S. \ . by Ed- 
derachillis; and on the W. by the Atlantic Ocean. Its greatest 
length from east to west is twenty-five miles, and its average 
breadth about twelve miles,_there being thus, including friths and 

lakes, about 300 square miles.

is mountainous; and its surface is naturally divided into three parts, 
viz. 1st, the Parf district, or that which lies betwixt the Atlantic and 
the Kyle of Durness. 2c/, Durness, properly so called, including 
all between the Kyle of Durness and Loch Eriboll. Sd, West- 
moin, which extends from Loch Eriboll to the middle of the mo- 
rass below Loch Hope, commonly called the Moin. 

Mountain Ranges. — In the Parf division, comprehending a sur- 
face of from 60 to 80 square miles, there are several mountain- 
ranges from 1500 to near 2500 feet in height, from Screbhisbheinn 
on the north, to Fairemheall on the south. Fairbheinn has a 
conical shape, and appears isolated from these and the other ranges 
of Creigriabhach and Bendearg, which have a S. W. direction, 
gradually diminishing to the Western Ocean. 

In the second division, the mountains are, Ceannabinn, Meall- 
meadhonoch, Ben Spionnadh,  and Cranstackie, which take a 
S. W. direction, and the mountains of Foinnebheinn and Meallhorn, 
which take a S. E. direction. This division contains an area of 
about 80 square miles. 

The third, or Westmoin division, having a surface of about 100 
square miles, contains several ranges of high and precipitous hills 
on the east side of Loch Eriboll, and clustered in various shapes 
and directions betwixt Strathmore and Strathbeg. In this division 
also is the lofty Ben Hope, 3150 feet above the level of the sea; 
it extends in a S. W. and S. direction along the narrow vale of 
Strathmore. The view of Ben Hope from the west has been al- 
ways admired by travellers, as perhaps the finest of its kind in the 
kingdom. The best view is at the inn of Cassildubh, near the 
upper end of Loch Hope. As there is no table-land, it rises with- 
in a few feet from the level of the sea, in abrupt and towering mag- 
nificence. The mind is filled with awe at the grandeur and sub- 
limity of the scene, and the eye is overcome with beholding the 
mountain as a whole, — except when occasionally relieved by viewing 
the trees of varied hue that diversify the scene, and adorn its base 
and its dark-blue terraces. Here is often seen' the eagle soaring 
aloft ; and amidst its deep ravines, the red-deer and roe, pasturing 
in security, as if defying the stratagems of the hunter. Nor is the 
view from its summit less interesting. On a clear day, may be seen 
Lewis to the west, and the Orkney Islands to the north-east, as 
well as the principal mountains of Sutherland and Caithness, while 

• 25CG feet above the level of the sea by Mr Burnet's mcnsiirement.

the numerous lakes through the counti7 appear hke specks, and 
its friths when the view is not obstructed by adjacent hills like 
rivers. 

Valleys.— In the Parf district, though there are several deep 
ravines, there are no valleys of any note. It consists chiefly of 
marshy loans and deep morasses several miles in extent, and inter- 
sected by the mountain-streams. A few green and fertile spots 
may be seen on its eastern shores. With the exception of the 
light-keepers at Cape Wrath, there are only four families, shep- 
herds, who reside in this extensive district. In the second district, 
Strath Dinard runs up the Kyle of Durness, and by the water of 
Dinard, to the south base of Fairemheall, and then takes a south- 
east direction along the side of Foinnebhinn, extending a distance of 
about fourteen miles. At the upper end of Loch Eriboll is Strath- 
beg,— a narrow but fertile vale of about two miles in length, and 
scarcely half a mile in breadth. The only other valley deser\dng 
notice is Strathmore, commencing at the north base of Ben Hope, 
and extending about six miles along the river. It is now inhabit- 
ed by one family ; whereas, formerly, it was. inhabited by upwards of 
twenty, by no means affluent, but virtuous and contented. To the 
south, betwixt the mountains of Strathmore and Strathbeg, are 
Glengollie and Corinessie, both celebrated by the muse of Rob 
Donn, as the favourite haunts of the deer and the hunter. These 
contain almost the only remains of birch trees in the parish, which 
at one time diversified and beautified its straths and glens. It may 
be remarked, that, with the exception of those last mentioned, the 
straths are but a very few feet elevated above the level of the sea, 
and give an Alpine grandeur to the contiguous mountains. 

Caves —Srno, Sfc.— In a country so extensive and mountainous, 
and abounding in limestone, we may naturally expect to find caves, 
deep ravines, and fissures. Of these, Smo  is the most remark- 
able It is about two miles east of the church, and may be ap- 
proached either by sea or by a pathway from the road. Directly 
above the cave, a beautiful waterfall arrests the eye. Descending 
from the road, about 100 yards to the shore, and crossing the 
water, after walking twenty yards, the traveller is suddenly ar- 
rested by the grandeur and magnificence of the cave,— whether 
he views the singular and massive construction of its Gothic- 
like and transverse arches, or its immense height and width; 

. In « Danieirs Coast Views," a front view of this cave may be seen. 



DURNESS. 



85 



for, in some places, it is about 100 feet wide, and as many in 
heifht. Here, also, the noise of the waterfall steals on the ear ; 
and when the voice is raised, an echo is distinctly heard. Near 
the entrance, its stratified rocks have several tufts of ivy mantling 
over them, which add to the interest of the scene. The dark 
perforation on the right hand of the arch has of late years been 
explored ; it was believed by several of the natives, upon tradi- 
tionary information, to be the abode of fairies, and the spirits of 
the dark   

There are also several extensive caves at Tresgill, at the east side of 
the entrance of Loch Eriboll. Sir Walter Scott visited these in 
1814, and they excited his admiration equally with that of Smo. 
They are approached only by sea. The grandest of these has a wa- 
terfall overitsraouth. Thedeep andunknown extentof the fissureof 
Polaghloup, half a mile west of the church, has been frequently ad- 
mired. The immense stocks or detached Gothic-like pillars at Ker- 
wic bay near Cape Wrath, and at the Whiten Head, have been 
also much admired. Several other caves, fissures, and cascades, 
in the interior of the country, if found in parishes of less extent, 
would be deemed deserving of more detailed description. 

Coast. — That part of the coast which is bounded by the Atlan- 
tic and the Northern Ocean is bold and lofty. On both sides of 
Cape Wrath, of theFarout Head, and Whiten Head, the rocks are 
magnificent, towering in most places from 200 to 700 feet of per- 
pendicular height. At Kervaic bay, the shore is low and sandy. 
At the bay of Balnakiel, there are several hills of sand, which fre- 
quently shift their places and forms, though generally covered with 
bent. Along the friths of Keoldale and Eriboll, the shores are 
generally precipitous and rugged, with intervening bays of sand or 
shingle. 

Islands. — These are, 1. GrtrueZZaw, within 4 miles of Cape Wrath 
to the east, and 1 mile from the shore ; it is about 60 feet high, 
100 yards long, and about the same breadth; here thousands of 

• The following is a. sliort account of this cavern, as given by a young gentleman, 
one of a party who entered it in August 1833. " After providing ourselves with a 
small boat and lights, and raising them over the arch, we found ourselves in a lake 
about thirty yards long, and nearly as broad ; we now lighted our candles, and ap- 
proached an arch in the rock, under which we could just pass by lying flat on the 
boat. This opened to another lake of equal length, but gradually diminisliing in 
breadth. Having at the upper end left the boat, we walked over the rock about 
thirty paces in the same direction. The height of the roof is various, from twenty 
to sixty feet, and its sides and bases arc almost covered with stalactites and stalag- 
mites, formed from the dropping roof of the cave, which is entirely composed ot limu- 
stonc. The temperature of a well at the upper end we found to be 48° Fahr."

different species of sea-fowl are reared. 2. Hoan, 1 mile long, and | 
mile broad; it lies near the entrance of Loch Eriboll; is green and 
fertile, and supports four famiHes. 3. Choaric, in Loch Eriboll, about 
the same dimensions, and equally fertile. In both of the two latter 
islands, there are places of sepulture, which have been discontinued 
as such for upwards of a century. Tradition reports, that they 
were used for sepultur to prevent the depredation of wolves, which 
at one period infested the country. 

Meteorology.— Caxe Wrath is the only place in the parish where 
observations have been recorded.  After the autumnal equinox, 
and about two hours after sunset, the polar lights frequently ap- 
pear most splendid, and occasionally extend from the north or 
north-west like a belt over the whole horizon. On the 3d Sep- 
tember 1833, the horizon, from three to four p. M., presented a pe- 
culiar appearance, and that during sunshine,— as if tinged, though 
faintly, by the polar lights, rushing with great rapidity. For some 
days after, the weather was dry and squally. When the Orkney 
Islands or the neighbouring mountains are clearly seen, either a 
storm, or the continuation of bad weather, is the certain conse- 
quence. When the sound of the breakers on the shore is heard 
distinctly, it indicates frost. The appearance of the swan is a 
. precursor of snow. 

In a country so contiguous to the ocean, and so mountainous, it 
is to be expected that high winds and frequent showers should pre- 
vail ; but, from these very causes, snow does not last so long as in 
more southern latitudes. Though the climate, in general, be moist 
and variable, yet the atmosphere is purified by high and frequent 
winds; and the inhabitants are in general healthy. Fevers, small- 
pox, &amp;c. are seldom, if ever, spread by infection. In sprmg, how- 
ever, colds, inflammatory sore throats, and rheumatism, are not in- 
frequent. In summer and autumn, cases of dyspepsia and bowel- 
complaiats among the lower orders are of common occurrence. 
These are supposed to arise from a sudden change of their diet, 
which in the summer consists of oatmeal, milk, &amp;c. and after- 
wards, of potatoes. 

Hydrography.— friths that intersect the parish are, \st, the 
Kyle of Durness, which is about six miles long, and averages nearly 
one mile in breadth. Near its entrance on the west side of the

bay of Balnakiel, are bars and shallows, which frequently shift 
their position with north winds. This frith is little visited by ves- 
sels, either for shelter or commerce. At ebb, it appears a large 
field of sand, which is gradually accumulating from the debris of 
the Dinard and tributary streams. On its banks, may be frequently 
seen considerable numbers of seals {Phoca vitulince, and diffe- 
rent species of shell-fish. 2d, Loch Eriholl, which is about ten 
miles long, with a south-west direction, and varying from one to four 
miles in breadth. Its waters are of a depth varying from fifteen to 
sixty fathoms; and no perceptible current is felt, while its saltness 
does not materially differ from that of the ocean. Camisendunbay, 
near the ferry, is one of the best anchorages in the kingdom, and is 
pretty often resorted to by vessels unable to double Cape Wrath, 
or attempt the Pentland Frith. The ti'des off Cape Wrath, Farout, 
and Whiten Head are very strong — running about ten miles an hour. 

Springs. As might be anticipated in such a mountainous 

country, and where such quantities of rain fall, the springs are in- 
numerable. There are several chalybeates ; and those which give 
a reddish colouring to the gravelly banks are reckoned salubrious by 
the natives. 

Lakes are also abundant, varying from a few hundred yards to 
six miles in extent. Of these. Loch Hope is the largest, being six 
miles long, by one half mile broad. Its mean depth does not exceed six 
fathoms. Its upper end is gradually filling up by the alluvial deposits 
of Strathmore water ; and its banks occasionally diversified by a few 
tufts of birch. Loch Borley and Loch Craspul, near the manse, 
are beautiful lakes ; both of which are supplied by subterraneous 
streams through the limestone rocks in the neighbourhood. The 
former is one mile long, and has a small green isle 200 yards long. 
It abounds in char, which spawn in October, and are seldom or 
ever caught by the fly. Loch Craspul is half a mile long, and abounds 
with excellent trout, which do not spawn till January. There are se- 
veral other lakes around the above and in the interior, — all abound- 
ing in trout, which appear reddish, dark, or silvery, according to the 
clearness of the water. Among these, the largest are Dinard, the 
source of the river Kescaig, and Ishour in the Parf or western 
division. Marl has been found at Loch Borley, but has not been 
applied to any extent for the purpose of manure. 

Rivers. — The only rivers deserving notice are the Hope and the 
Dinard. The former is merely a continuation of the Strathmore 
Water, which has its source from Glengollie and the contiguous

mountains, and empties itself about three miles from the mouth of 
Loch EriboU, — running a distance of fifteen miles. The latter has 
. its rise from Loch Dinard, and empties itself at the head of the Kyle 
of Durness, — running a distance of ten miles. Both these rivers are 
very rapid, especially when swelled by their tributary streams. In 
both, the cruives are shut in March ; but very few salmon are found 
till summer, owing, it is supposed, to the coldness of the snow 
water descending from the higher mountain streams. Salmon are, 
also in small quantities, found to ascend the Sandwood water from 
the Atlantic, Dal water from Balnakiel Bay, and Strathbeff water, 
at the head of Loch Eriboll. All these are tolerably good ang- 
ling rivers, especially for trout, during the months of May and 
June. During heavy rains, the mountain streams present to the 
eye some fine cascades, the most noted of which are at Altnacailish 
in Strathmore, and at Benspionnadh on the north-west side. 

Geology. There are few parishes in Scotland that furnish such 

a rich field to the speculations of the geologist— both from its ex- 
tent and the variety of its formations. These have been examined 
by Professor Jameson, Professor Sedgwick, and Dr M'Culloch. 
Following the geographical divisions of the parish we find the high 
and precipitous rocks on either side of Cape Wrath, chiefly sand- 
stone and gneiss, with numerous veins of granite and felspar. The 
central mountain of Fasbheinn is gneiss ; but all the other moun- 
tains are chiefly of the red sandstone formation, and puddingstone, 

the strata of which are horizontal. At Handa Island, and Store 

in Assynt, the same formation of sandstone appears. 

In the second or Durness division, the mountains are all com- 
posed of quartz, gneiss, and mica-slate, with occasional veins of por- 
phyry and granite. The dip of the strata is chiefly north-east. 
The higher mountains present their steeper and bolder fronts to 
the west and north-west,-~with the exception only of the Farout 
Head, composed of dark gray slate. The greater part of the 
low lands of Durness from the Kyle to Smo, consists of an im- 
mense triangular bed of primitive limestone, of about fifteen square 
miles, and of unknown depth. It is of different colours— gray, blue, 
and pale white. These often alternate with each other, and are 
of various depths, often horizontal, but generally inclining to the 
north and east. The fissures almost always cut the strata at right 
anoles, and frequently consist of thin veins of carbonate of hme, 
pue, white, and crystallized. This bed at its southern angle dis- 
appears under the Foinnebhinn and Meall Horn Mounlams, and 



DURNESS.

is seen minutely in the adjoining parish of Edderachilhs at Loch- 
more and Glencul, and to an extent of several miles in the parish 
of Assynt, where it appears under the same general character and 
of the same formation. 

In the third or Westmoin district, a section of this bed also ap- 
pears, to the extent of about five miles in length by half a mile in 
average breadth. It is separated from Durness by Loch EriboU, 
the quartz mountain range of Ceannabinn, and Benspionadh. The 
mountains of Hope and Strathmore are quartz and gray slate, 
either horizontally stratified, or with a small inclination to the east 
and north. The limestone caves present fine specimens of stalac- 
tites and stalagmites, and some of the lakes in the Hmestone for- 
mation abound in marl. Immense circular blocks of granite are 
frequently resting upon the limestone rocks :  and pieces of por- 
phyry have been discovered near Rispond, which are easily cut into 
seals. 

Soil. — Over the limestone, the soil is chiefly clay, of various 
depth, and yielding rich pasturage. The alluvial deposits carried 
down by the mountain streams make the straths equally fertile. 
But with these exceptions, the whole soil of the parish is a con- 
tinuous surface of peat moss, varying from a few inches to twelve 
feet in depth, — below which there are deep strata of clay or gravel. 

Zoology. — The high mountains in the interior, commonly called 
the " Forest" — a leafless one  abound in red-deer {Cej-vus ele- 
phas. The roe {Cervus capreolus is" occasionally seen at Ben 
Hope. Foxes {Canis vulpes, notwithstanding the high premiums 
given, are numerous and difficult to extirpate. Badgers  Ursus 
meles are almost extinct. Wild cats {Felis catusferus are pret- 
ty numerous. Otters [Mustela lutra are found in the rivers. 
Hares common {Lepus timidus, and alpine {L. variabilis, are 
seen, the latter more numerous ; also rabbits {L. cuniculus; pole- 
cats, ferrets, and weasels {Mustelce, Moles [Talpa Europea are 
rare, and only found in one district of the parish, on the eastern 
bank of Loch Hope. Rats {M. rattus are of late immigration. 

Birds. — Among the land fowls, the following are the principal : 
Hawks {Palco of different kinds. Owls, both gray and brown, 
with ears resembhng horns. The Royal {fidvus, and fishing {ha- 
licBtus, eagle. A colony of rooks {C.fru/ilrf/us may be seen in 
September for a few weeks, and almost all the small birds common

""Votany—The vegetation of this parish is materially affected 
by its latitude, the vicinity of the sea, its position towards the wes- 
tern shore, its diversity of surface, and its soil. On the northern 
confines of Britain, the ordinary law by which the geographical 
distribution of plants in regard of latitude is regulated, brings to 
very moderate elevations plants which, in the southern parts of the 
Grampians, are found only on the ridges, and which are not pro- 
duced at all in the south of Scotland, for want of a sufficient ele- 
vation to give the Alpine climate. In the parish of Durness, how- 
ever, the descent of Alpine vegetation is greatly increased by its

the University of Edinburgh.

western position. Several plants whicli, to the eastward in the same 
latitude, grow upon the sides of the mountains, grow here on the 
beach. 

On the top of the cliff overhanging the sea at Cape Wrath, we 
haveSalix herbacea and Silene acaulis; and near Keoldale we have 
ThaKctrum alpinum, close to the high water mark. Even a very 
few miles off, these plants have disappeared from the shore, and 
are met with only on the mountains, at a height increasing as we 
proceed eastward. On the other hand, the neighbourhood of the 
sea secures that mild temperature during winter, which enables less 
hardy plants to thrive ; or otherwise fits the fields of Durness for 
the growth of species' which require a maritime climate. This is 
true with respect to many plants which appear in the pastures. 
The Primula Scotica abounds here, and in many places near the 
north shore of Scotland, but it has not been observed anywhere 
upon the mountains either to the eastward or southward. 

The soil in the parish is various ; but perhaps the only kind 
which, apart from the degree of moisture, seems to exert a sen- 
sible influence in modifying the natural productions, is that form- 
ed over limestone, which -abounds in the immediate vicinity of 
the manse, and crops out in many places. It is no doubt on 
account of this that Dryas octopetala is so profuse in Durness, 
To the eastward and in the south, it is met with on the moun- 
tains, and on various rocks, but here it seems confined to the lime- 
stone, and is most abundant at the level of the sea. Equally cir- 
cumscribed, and on the same rock, is Epipactis latifolia, and per- 
haps Draba incana extends no farther. Centaurea scabiosa is abun- 
dant in the fields around, and very seldom with white flowers. All 
these, except the last, are hkewise found on limestone inAssynt, but 
rarelv, if at all, in the intervening district, where limestone does 
not exist. A great part of the flat land towards Cape Wrath is 
bog, wholly diff"erent from the close fine turf which forms the sur- 
face near the manse. It produces in abundance the ordinary coarse 
herbage which is found to cover wet ground throughout the coun- 
try, as the various common species of Juncus, Carex and Eriopho- 
rjim, while on the neighbouring drier banks we have Nardus stric- 
ta, and the other grasses which generally grow along with it. These 
form very productive sheep pasture, and support a very excellent 
stock. In the bogs, there is abundance of Pinguicida Lusitanica, 
and of Drosera Arifjlica. Upon the shores of Sandwood and of 



92 



SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



Durness, we have a profusion of Gentiana amarella and Tlialictrum 
minus. Elymus arenarius and Juncus Balticus are met with in both 
places, the latter particularly abundant to the north of the house 
of Keoldale. 

The mountain tops are generally dry and stony, and nothing has 
hitherto been observed upon them but such Alpine plants as are 
found on many other mountain ranges in Scotland, except Luzula 
arcuata. Azalea procumhens and Arbutus alpina abound chiefly on 
the low shoulders. Luzula arcuata has been found only in three 
stations in Britain, the summit of the mountains at the source of 
the Dee, Ben More in Assynt, and Foinnbheinn in this parish ; 
and along with it, on the two last mountains, Ajmrgia alpina. 
On Foinnbheinn there is great abundance of Arahis petrcEa. It is 
among the mountains in this and the adjoining parishes, forming 
the north-west of Scotland, that botanists expect to discover several 
of the plants common to the north of Europe and America, but 
which have not yet been added to the British Flora. 

With the exception of a few acres of Birch copse on the banks of 
Loch Hope, and a few birch, poplar, and holly trees in the clefts of 
rocks and glens, the parish maybe said to be quite destitute of wood. 
In low and sheltered situations, however, the mosses retam the roots 
of fir, birch, willow, &amp;c. and decayed trunks of from thirty to fifty 
feet in length are occasionally dug from the mosses. In sheltered 
situations, and where the soil is open and dry, there is little doubt 
but forest and fruit trees might grow, from the few specunens tried 
at Eriboll Culinary vegetables thrive well. Notwithstanding the 
great quantities of rain in harvest, the crops are ripe, and secured 
at least three weeks earlier than in the neighbouring county ol 
Caithness,-which may be occasioned by the difference of soil, as 
well as the shelter, and the radiation of heat from the adjacent 
rocks and vallies. With the exception of six acres of winter sown 
wheat, tried for the first time at Balnakiel, the whole of the crops 
were cut and secured before the 23d September 1833. 

II. — Civil History. 
It cannot be expected, that the annals of a parish so remote and 
so thinly inhabited, should at any time have excited much pub- 
lic interest. Some accounts of the local conflicts of the clans Mac- 
kav Gordon, and Sutherland, may be seen in Sir Robert Gordon s 
His'torv of the Sutherland family, and Mackay's Historyof the 
Ma kays -A correct survey was taken of the coast in 1827 by or-

der of the Commissioners for the Northern Lights : and a map of the 
parish on a large scale, by Mr Burnet, land-surveyor, is preparing 
for publication, under the patronage of the Duke of Sutherland, 
who is now sole proprietor. 

Eminent Men. — Among the most eminent characters who were 
natives of this parish are the following : — Ist, General Mackay, 
who distinguished himself in the civil wars in the reign of King 
Charles II. His father, who was a branch of the Reay family, 
resided for some time in Borley, but afterwards had his prin- 
cipal residence at Scowrie, in Edderachillis. 2cZ, Robeft Donn 
or Calder, or, as he is sometimes called, Mackay, the celebrat- 
ed Reay country bard, was also a native of the parish. His 
lyrics, satires, and songs, are inuch admired and sung by the na- 
tives, and have rendered our mountains and glens classic ground. 
A volume of these was published in 1829 by Dr Mackay of Dunoon ; 
to which is prefixed a memoir of his life. 

Parochial Register. — The earliest date of the parochial register 
is 4th November 1764. It does not contain any register of deaths. 

Antiquities. — Among these, the first that claim attention are 
the circular Duns, which appear to have been very numerous 
in the Highlands. The ruins of ten of these Duns are to be 
seen in this parish. They appear to have been the residences 
of some native chieftain ; they are often built in low and fer- 
tile spots, and, in some places, they are surrounded by seve- 
ral circles of from 12 to 20 feet diameter, which in all pro- 
bability have been the foundations of the circular booths of the 
chieftain's dependents. The form of these Duns is the simplest 
mode of structure that would occur to a rude people. There 
is a tradition among the natives, that they were built to defend the 
inmates from the incursions of the wolves. The only remains 
from which we can judge of the form and structure of these Duns 
are — a segment of one in Strathmore, about sixteen feet high, near 
the south base of Ben Hope. It is called " DUn Dornigill" i. e. 
Dornadilla's Tower. The tradition is, that it was built by the 
Scottish king of that name, and used as a hunting residence. The 
outer circumference is about fifty paces in extent, and consists of 
two concentric walls, connected by large flags, which served the pur- 
pose of strengthening each other, and forming a pathway to the top. 
The triangular stone which forms the lintel is still seen in the 
building. The slaty stones of which it is built, bear no marks, of

having been shaped by tools, the acute angle being always upper- 
most.  

There are also some subterraneous buildings, called " Leahidh 
fholaich," i. e. hiding-places : one of these, lately discovered at the 
west side of Loch EriboU Ferry, is about 40 feet long, 6 feet 
high, and about 6 feet wide, built of dry stone, and covered over 
by flags ; the descent is by regular steps, and the entrance is co- 
vered by a flag. It is still in good preservation.— There are seve- 
ral large stones placed on end, either in a circular or elliptical form, 
which appear to have been places of sepulture ; but no traces of 
writing have been seen on any of these.— Tumuli, and heaps of 
stones, called " cairns," are of frequent occurrence. In one of 
these, called " Cnoc na cnamham," i. e. the hill of bones, near 
Keoldale, a small brass elliptical cockade was found two years ago, 
and a small polished bone, supposed to be used for fastening the 
military plaid. The tradition is, that it contains the remains of 
those who fell in battle. — Heads of arrows are occasionally found 
in the mosses ; they are from two to three inches long, formed of 
a brown, red, or whitish flint-like stone, f 

Buildings. — There is a pretty large mansion-house at Balnakiel, 
where some of the Lords of Reay occasionally resided. It was 
built about ninety years ago. Another building of importance is 
the Light-house at Cape Wrath, the tower of which is fifty feet 
high. The building is altogether 350 feet above the level of the 
sea.  It was built in 1827 of granite found at the Cape. Previ- 
ous to its erection, seldom a winter passed without one or more 
wrecks; but these are now of rare occurrence. At Rispond 
there is a good dwelling-house, and a pretty extensive range of 
houses and sheds for the salmon-boiling and herring-fishing. There 
is also a pier for sloops of ordinary size to load their cargoes.— The 
houses of the tacksmen merit no particular notice. Those of the 
small tenants and cottars are all built of turf or dry stone, plaster- 
ed on the inside with clay, with the exception of two or three m 
some hamlets whose western gable has a vent and chmmey-stalk.

III. — Population. 
By a census taken in 1724, the population did not exceed 1000 
souls. In 1790 the population was 1182. In the Durness, or 
second district of the parish, there has been an increase of nearly 50 
per cent, since 1815 ; but in the third or eastern district, Eriboll, 
the population has diminished since 1815 from 517 to 220. The 
decrease has been owing to the whole district having been con- 
verted into two extensive sheep-farms. The increase in the Dur- 
ness, or second division, has been owing to the establishment of 
the herring fishery, and the subdivision of lots in the different ham- 
lets. In 1815 from thirty to forty families emigrated to America.

Clans. — The principal clans in the parish are, those of M'Kay, 
Sutherland, Campbell, Morrison, and Gunn ; the two former ge- 
nerally distinguished by fair hair and blue eyes, — the Campbells and 
Gunns, by dark eyes and dark complexion. 

Character, 8fc. of the People. — The natives are generally live- 
ly in their dispositions, social in their habits, and when engag- 
ed in labour, either at sea or on land, endure a good deal of fatigue. 
There are few artisans among them : and, having little or nothing- 
to do in the winter months, many of them are in the habit of vi- 
siting and spending the evenings in each other's houses in the dif- 
ferent hamlets, hearing the news of the country, repeating the 
songs of their native bard, or listening to the legendary tales of 
some venerable Senachie. 



9G SUTIIEIILANDSHIRE. 

With the exception of eight families from the south of Scotland, 
all the natives speak Gaelic. Though a considerable proportion 
of the young can speak English, yet very few are able to follow out 
or understand an English sermon. Indeed, even those who speak 
and understand the English well, always prefer the Gaehc ser- 
vices. Whether this predilection arises from early associations, 
the influence of habit, or the greater ease, familiarity, and simpli- 
city in the style of the speakers, they think themselves more edi- 
fied by discourses in that tongue. It cannot be said, however, that 
the Gaelic language is spoken with such emphasis and purity in 
this country as in some parts of the western Highlands; and, though 
it has been a good deal corrupted by the younger people who now 
speak English, it has not lost much ground. 

The principle amusements are— playing at the ball and shinty on 
the fine sands of Balnakiel. The whole population turns out on 
old Christmas and new-year's day, and even old men of seventy are 
to be seen mingling in the crowd, remaining till night puts an end to 
the contest. Indeed, the inhabitants of this parish have always been 
noted for the enthusiasm with which they engaged in these sports. 
To keep up the tone of action, they retire in the evenmg, and 
minole in the dance to the music of the bagpipe, regardless of the 
bruises and scars of the contest. Of this sport, Dr M'Leod of 
Campsie has given a very humorous and graphical description in 
his " Teaclidaire Gaidhleaeh." Hallow-e'en eve is also a festive 
day in the calendar, but is not kept with such enthusiasm as for- 
merly Superstitious observances, behef in witches, and other en- 
chantments, are gradually wearing away,-though even a grave el- 
der may occasionally be met with, who will quote scripture, and re- 
late many traditionary stories, as evidences of his faith. 

As to the habits of the people,-it cannot be said that they are 
remarkable for cleanliness : the huts they occupy,-the smoke 
arising from the fire in the centre of the house, and forming a ca- 
nopy over them,-and the cattle entering by the same door with 
the inmates,-are not favourable to personal cleanliness. The 
change oi dress within the last twenty or thirty years has been very 
marked, both with males and females. Instead of the tartan or kelt 
coat and trowsers, spun and dyed at home, when each family had 
their own wool, hardly any thing is to be seen on the young but the 
fustian jacket and trowsers, or the lighter tartan of the sliops, and 
here ai d there the blue and fancy cloths of Leeds. The blue

mantle and the well-spun bUie gown of the fair sex is superseded 
by the prints and Merinos of modern times. The head is in many 
cases adorned or covered by a gauze or muslin cap, and now and 
then by a straw-bonnet. Umbrellas are more numerous than great- 
coats or mantles. It is questionable whether, with these changes, 
the morals or comforts of the people have been improved. 

It could not be expected that a people who had led chiefly a pas- 
toral life were to be soon reconciled to the change which placed them 
in crowded hamlets upon the shore. The manufacture of kelp, 
herrino--fi5hing, road-making, and other occasional sources of in- 
dustry during the summer and harvest, have, however, called out 
the latent industry of the young ; but, as there has been, of late 
years, no encouragement to enter the army, and as they have no 
opportunities of learning trades at home, they are tempted to mar- 
ry too young ; they then reside for some years with their parents, 
and divide the lot of two or three acres, chiefly reclaimed from moor, 
at the very time it promised to support the family with bread and 
potatoes. Thus, the wants of a new and rising family are to be pro- 
vided for, and poverty and a high rate of population are kept up. 

The habits of dram-drinking, acquired by both sexes in their an- 
nual migrations to Caithness, and in the course of their mixing to- 
gether in crowded lodgings there, have tended to deteriorate the mo- 
rals of the people considerably. Their attendance on religious ordi- 
nances, however, is pretty regular ; and in most cases, the evening 
and morning devotions of the family are offered up. On the Sabbath 
evenings, the Shorter Catechism is taught ; or they congregate to- 
gether in some commodious house in the township, to repeat the 
Shorter Catechism and read the Scriptures. These meetings are 
always commenced and concluded by prayer and praise, and often 
tend to spread a moral and religious influence over the hamlet. 
Smuggling, foreign and domestic, is now totally suppressed.

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — :The whole of this parish, 
with the exception of about one -twentieth part, has been converted 
into four extensive sheep-walks, yielding on an average L. 500 
each of rent. From the irregular surface, and small patches in 
cultivation, it is impossible, without measurement;, to ascertain the 
exact number of acres. The following is an approximation : —

Total, 498 

Along the shores, straths, and glens under sheep, a considerable 
proportion of the land is arable,— perhaps about 300 acres. Of 
good pasture capable of being brought into cultivation by spade 
husbandry, there are 1000 acres at least. The amount might be 
made equal to what is already in cultivation by the tenants and cot- 
tars, and capable of supporting three times the present popula- 
tion,— even though the whole of the mountain pasture and some of 
the straths and shores should be left under sheep. 

Rent of Land.— average rent of arable land per acre is from 
20s. to 30s,; but to all arable land there is attached a right of pas- 
ture on a common hill. The estimated value of grazing for sheep 
or wedders is about 2s. 6d. each on the great sheep-farms. Cows 
are pastured on rich meadows at L.3 per annum. Including stock 
farms, kelp, and salmon fishery, the rental of the parish is about 
L.2550. 

Wages.— Dac labourers receive Is. 6d. per day; artisans, from 2s. 
to 3s.; farm-servants L. 6 per annum, 7 bolls meal, and 20 barrels 
potatoes, and one cow's grass; farm or domestic female servants, 
L. 3 per annum and board. . 

Breeds of Live-Stock.~The only breed of sheep is the Cheviot 
or white-faced, with the exception of about 300 cross or black- 
faced, kept by small tenants and cottars on the common grazing. 
To the improvement of the former very great attention is paid— 
both wool and carcase fetching average prices at market. 1 he 
principal breed of black-cattle is the Highland, reared by small te- 
nants. The few milch cows on the sheep-walks are chiefly Ayr- 
shire. With the exception of six pair of Clydesda e horses 
kept for husbandry by the sheep-farmers, all the rest of the horses 
are small Highland ponies. 

Husbandry.-Seyeval acres of waste or marshy land have been 
drained at Balnakiel, but arc laid out in pasture. Ibe olrt 
mode of reclaiming waste land was by making lazi/ beds, i e. by 
peeling one part of the ground and laying it over another of equal 
space Trenching was never used, but a better and more econo-

mical system is now employed. The runrig system is wearing out, 
and every township is in the course of being lotted out in regu- 
lar divisions, and cottages are building on each lot. Though the 
expense and labour of building these be great to the small tenants, 
especially in a country where masons and carpenters must be 
brought from other places, yet they submit to the charge, though 
no leases are given, and have every confidence, that, under the li- 
beral and enlightened management of the family of Sutherland, 
they will be furnished with new sources of industry. 

The sheep-farmers have leases of nineteen years ; and all of 
them have lately made considerable improvements in diking and 

surface draining. 

Fisheries.— Herring —The principal fisheries are the herring, 
salmon, and lobster. The early herring fishing commences in J une. 
At this season, the fish are so rich that it is difficult to cure them, and 
they are sent off weekly to market. The late fishing commences 
about the middle of July and continues till September. It was 
only of late that the out sea fishing commenced on this coast. 
And even yet, it hardly remunerates those engaged in it. A 
smaller but superior species of herring is found occasionally in 
• Loch EriboU ; but it is chiefly used for home consumption. Ten 
boats are employed at Rispond : they are each manned by four men 
and a boy, and cost each L. 36. 

Lobster Fishing. — The lobster fishing commences in May 
and is carried on with little intermission till August. Six boats 
of fourteen feet keel were employed last season, each boat having 
two men, and being furnished with twenty or more nets inclosed 
in circular iron cylindrical hoops or rings of two and a-half feet 
diameter ; a piece of herring or gray fish being tied in the centre 
of the mesh for bait. The nets are cast into, the sea within a few 
yards of the shore by one of the men, while the other rows for- 
ward ; and they are raised in about an hour after. This is conti- 
nued from sunset to sunrise. When a lobster is caught, the large 
claws are fastened together by a strong packing thread, — otherwise, 
by the muscular strength of their claws, they would soon destroy 
each other. When thus secured, they are conveyed in the morn- 
ing to the perforated floating chest, until they are called for week- 
ly by the welled smacks. 

Cod and Ling Fishing. — Cod and ling, though abundant on the 
coast, have not been much fished by the natives. 

Salmon Fishing. — The only rivers in which salmon are caught

are the Hope and Dinard ; on both of these there are cruives and 
coble fishino-. The fishina' commences in the end of March and 
ceases in August. The spawning months are October and Novem- 
ber. The following table shows the weight of salmon and grilse 
caught during the last two years.

Several of the larger burns or streams have salmon but, from 
their distance and the difficulty of access, fishing in these would 
not remunerate the expense.

N. B. — It must be observed, that meal is imported to the pa- 
rish to the average amount of 300 bolls annually. 

Kclj} vianufacture. — The only manufacture worthy of notice is 
the kelp. It commences in June, and in favourable seasons is fi- 
nished early in July. It is cut every alternate year, spread out on 
the shores, and when nearly dried is put up in heaps and burnt in 

 It is the universal belief of the oldest and most experienced fishermen acquainted 
with different waters, that salmon never deposit tlieir spawn except in rivers ; lliat 
they universally .and instinctively frequent the rivers on which they were spawned ; 
that, liowcver numerous the fish in traversing the shores, and when cntermg the es- 
tuary or frith, each turns to that direction where the river in which it was sji.iwned 
empties itself. Where a stranger can hardly discern any difference, a practised eye 
will single out tlie fish of different rivers from each other, and view thcni almost as 
varieties of tlie same species. It is true, that large shoals of s.alnion belongnig to 
different rivers, on their return from the ocean, often congregate at estuaries, and are 
caught in the net; but the stranger fish, on tasting the water, and entering fiurly 
into the channel of the river, soon returns, not finding the velocity, temperature, co- 
lour, or taste of the water congenial to its habits. I

ing, broken up to heaps, and covered with turf till it is shipped. 

Navigation. — There are three small sloops at Rispond, of the 
respective tonnage of 25, 37, and 51. These are managed by ten 
men, and are principally employed in the coasting trade. One of 
them goes occasionally to Hamburgh with early herrings. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — Thurso is the nearest market-town, 
65 miles distant. There are no villages, the population all resid- 
ing in hamlets along the shores, containing from 4 or 5 to 20 fami- 
lies. The means of communication have been much improved dur- 
ing the last three years, by the liberality of the late Duke of Suther- 
land. Formerly, the post-office was at Bonar Bridge, a distance of 
62 miles, to which there was a runner sent once a-week at the 
sole expense of a few subscribers. There is now a post-office 
twice a-week to Tongue. The days of dispatch are Monday and 
Thursday ; of arrival, Tuesday and Friday, — to suit the Golspie 
mail, which crosses the interior to Tongue every Monday and 
Thursday. There is a weekly runner to Scowrie. There is also 
a monthly carrier to Tain ; but almost all imports and exports are 
by sea. 

The roads are, Is, a road from the Kyle of Durness to Cape 
Wrath, executed by the Light-house Commissioners in 1828, 11 
miles in length ; 2d, from Eriboll by Strathmore, till its junction 
with the Tongue road to the south, 19 miles ; Qd, the main line 
leading from west to east, — 34 miles round by Loch Ei'iboll, or, 
by crossing the ferry, 24 miles. With the exception of 12 miles, 
commenced ten years ago by statute-labour, these roads were com- 
pleted by the late Duke of Sutherland, and have completely open- 
ed up the country to new sources of industry, and the gratification 
of the traveller, and the speculations of the capitalist. There is 
an excellent bridge over the Dinard, and a chain-boat over the 
Hope. 

The harbours are, Loch Eriboll, Rispond, and Port Our, at 
the termination of the Cape Wrath road, and Smo ; the last only 
for boats. At Rispond, there is a basin and pier, and rings fasten- 
ed to the rocks in the bay ; but this is not reckoned very safe in 
north-east gales and spring tides. Loch Eriboll, in the baj', 
where there is a church, is reckoned a very safe anchorage. A slip 
for boats has been also made at Clashcarnach, three miles east of

the cape, where the hght-house yacht lands the oil and necessa- 
ries for the light-house ; but is seldom attempted in stormy, wea- 
ther with northerly winds. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated within half a mile 
of the manse, at Balnakiel Bay. About three-fourths of the po- 
pulation, or all within six miles, attend. Its distance from the ex- 
tremity to the south-east is 26 miles, and from the western extre- 
mity 12 miles. It was built in 1619, and the aisle added in 1692; 
it has no galleries, and contains 300 sittings, which are all free. It 
stands much in need of repair and enlargement. The practice of 
burying within the walls has been discontinued for nearly a cen- 
tury. The manse was rebuilt in 1830, and is commodious. The 
glebe, including its hill grazings and pertinents, may be worth L. 30 
per annum. The stipend is L. 150, and is on the list of small liv- 
ings augmented by act of Parhament in 1812. 

In the Eriboll district, there is sermon preached every alternate 
Sabbath ; it is connected with the Milness district of the parish of 
Tongue, twelve miles distant. The missionary here is supported 
solely by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, on a sa- 
lary "of L. 50. There are no Dissenters or Roman Catholics. The 
sacrament is dispensed once a-year, in summer. The number of 
communicants is 70 ; but, on such occasions, tokens to the amount 
of 150 are distributed to communicants who attend from neigh- 
bouring parishes. Collections in aid of religious and charitable 
institutions are occasionally made,— the average annual amount of 
which may be L. 3. 

The schools in the parish are, parochial, 1 ; Assembly, 1 ; sub- 
scription, 2 ; in which the ordinary elementary branches are taught. 
The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the minimum, or L.24: 
of the General Assembly's L. 20. The school-fees in either of these 
do not exceed L. 4 per annum. The former has not the legal ac- 
commodations ; those of the latter are new and sufficient The 
subscription schools are chiefly taught during the winter. In some 
remote hamlets and families, boys are hired during the winter 
months to teach, at the rate of 20s. per month, and board. A con- 
siderable number of cottars and poor tenants, who have access to 
the parochial school, have not of late years been much alive to the 
benefits of education,— which may arise from their poverty, or want 
of confidence in the ability and diligence of a teacher so indiffe- 
rently remunerated. 

The number of persons betwixt 6 and 15 who cannot read or 



DURNESS.

write is 90; of those upwards of 15, is 216. It must be borne 
in mind, however, that the majority of those not inchided in this 
calculation cannot write. It is to be hoped that the district where 
the Assembly school is situated will, ere long, derive considerable 
benefit from the school, both in a moral and intellectual point of 
view. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor receiving pa- 
rochial aid is 45,— in sums of from 3s. to 8s. or 10s. each. The 
annual amount of contributions for their relief does not exceed 
L. 20, viz. church weekly contributions, L. 12, with the interest of 
a legacy, L. 2, and alms, L. 6. It must be noticed, however, 
that in this, as well as in other Highland parishes, where the cir- 
culating medium is very scarce, the poor are regularly furnish- 
ed with meal, fleeces, clothes, &amp;c. in value at least equal to the 
sums of money annually divided by the kirk-session. It is to be 
regretted that, of late, the poor do not consider it degrading to be 
on the roll of the session funds. There are no assessments for 
the poor, or charitable institutions ; yet, when extraordinary calls 
are made, the inhabitants have always manifested a commendable 
liberality. 

Jnns. — There are three inns, or rather houses licensed to retail 
whisky. But hitherto, travellers have been in most cases obliged 
to draw on the hospitality of the inhabitants. Comfortable inns 
and stabling are, however, now in progress. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most important change since the last Statistical Ac- 
count has been the introduction of sheep-farming, which commen- 
ced about thirty years ago, and has been extended since. Though 
in some respects this may have augmented the revenue of the pro- 
prietor, and added to the commercial wealth of the nation, yet it 
is very questionable, if it has added, in the meantime, to the in- 
tellectual, moral, or religious superiority of the inhabitants. 

. The division of the parish into such extensive farms has also 
suppressed almost entirely the middle classes of society, who paid 
rents of from L. 10 to L. 50, and has thereby tended to extinguish, 
in a great degree, the intelligence 'and laudable emulation of the 
lower classes. The former generally felt a desire of giving every 
advantage of education to their children at school, and their ex- 
ample diffused an emulation among the latter. The great sheep- 
farmers who are resident employ teachers in their families ; the 
schools are attended by the poorer classes, who are all on the same

level, — and that, for the most part, during the winter only. Lads 
when they can handle an oar remove to Caithness, and after two 
or three years training there, getting the share of a boat on credit, 
they have arrived at the summit of their ambition, and marry. 
From the extinction of the middling classes of 'society, the writer 
hereof, in common with several of his brethren, has to regret the 
difficulty of finding men suitable for being ordained elders. It can- 
not be expected, however worthy the individuals may be who may be 
nominated to this office, that while poor and in some cases illite- 
rate, they can be so influential in checking immorality, stimulating 
to intellectual and religious attainments, and suppressing supersti- 
tious and enthusiastic feeling. 

While such improvements have been made on the physical as- 
pect of the parish, by the liberality of the late Duke, and which 
there is every confidence will be continued, in making the harbours 
and creeks more accessible and available, it is hoped that the te- 
nants will gradually acquire the knowledge of artisanship, as well 
as of fishing, and thus add to the productive capabihties of the 
country, and their own individual comfort.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. CHARLES GORDON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The word Assynt, or Assint, is supposed to be a Gae- 
lic compound, " as agus innte," signifying out and in, evidently 
referring to, and descriptive of, the general outline of the parish. 
Indeed, a glance at the map of Assynt makes it extremely pro- 
bable that this derivation is correct. Other derivations have been 
given, connected with legendary traditions; but the above seems 
the preferable one. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish contains 97,000 acres of 
surface. Its extreme length, viz. from Cromalt to the point of 
Store, is about 36 miles. Its greatest breadth from Inverkirkig to 
Ardvar, about 18 miles. In breadth, however, it varies much. 
The parish is situated in the north-west part of the county of 
Sutherland, and is thus bounded : on the north, it is divided from 
the parish of EdderachlUis, in the Reay country, by an arm of the 
sea of considerable breadth, called the Kyle, which runs betwixt 
both parishes from west to east; on the east and south, by Kin- 
cardine, Creich, Lairg, and Lochbroom ; and on the west, by the 
Atlantic. 

Topographical Appearances. — Few districts in Scotland are more 
mountainous. The general aspect of the parish is rugged. Many 
of the mountains are of considerable altitude. The most remark- 
able of these are, Benmore, Cuniack, Suilvhen, or Sugar-loaf, 
Cannisb, &amp;c. 

The first mentioned, Benmore, or Conval, is supposed to be 
the loftiest mountain in the county — about 3230 feet above the 
level of the sea. It is seen in various directions from a conside- 
rable distance. Ptarmigan are easily got here, especially during 
snow storms. 

Cuniack has a most romantic and peculiar shape and appear- 
sutheuland. h

the district, and its proximity to the sea, it will readily be conclud- 
ed, that we have much rainy weather — so much is this the case, 
that the harvesting of our crop, is an operation extremely precarious. 
We frequently experience severe storms of thunder and lightning, 
and two years ago, a young man was instantaneously deprived of 
life by the electric fluid. At the same time some cattle also were 
struck dead. Instances of this kind are fortunately rare. The 
climate, though severe, is upon the whole salubrious, and the 
inhabitants healthy. Consumption, however, is not unfrequent, 
and is generally induced by exposure, during the long harvest 
nights, at the herring-fishing. The prevailing wind is westerly, 
and invariably accompanied by torrents of rain. With easterly 
winds we generally have dry weather, but these are piercing and 
intensely cold. 

Hydrography, — Every hill and valley, particularly in the heights 
of the parish, is abundantly supplied with springs of water, some 
of which are very large. There is one at Achumore, ten or twelve 
feet in circumference. There are several beautiful lakes, some of 
which deserve to be particularly noticed. 

Loch Assynt. — Its extreme length is 6| miles ; its greatest breadth 
about a mile. It is a fresh water lake, and its banks in most places 
covered with brushwood. The scenery altogether is most delight- 
ful, and cannot fail to attract the notice of the intelligent tourist. 
It abounds in trout of various kinds, and as there is no restriction 
as to angling, or setting nets, the few inhabitants in the neighbour- 
hood are able, in the proper season, to supply themselves, with an 
agreeable and wholesome addition to their daily fare. 

Loch Assynt possesses considerable attraction for the angler. 
About two years ago, it was visited by Sir William Jardine, the 
naturalist, and others, who minutely inspected the different kinds of 
trout found here and in other lochs in the neighbourhood, the re- 
sult of whose researches must no doubt prove interesting and use- 
ful. Before there was a road from the height of the parish to the. 
shores, there were several boats kept on the loch for the purposes 
of carriage. At the east end of the loch stands the church. 
Next in size to Loch Assynt is Cam- Loch, i.e. the crooked loch, 
in the Elphine, or highest district of the parish. It is a beautiful 
lake, very irregular in shape, as its name implies. Trout are found 
here in abundance, as well as in Loch Assynt. Cam- Loch is in 
a most sequestered spot.

II. — Civil History. 

There are no printed or manuscript accounts of Assynt extant, 
so far as the narrator knows. Various traditions, however, speak of 
individuals, noted in their day, living in or connected with the 
parish. Among these we may mention Neil Macleod, who resided 
at Ardvrack Castle now a ruin, built on the banks of Loch 
Assynt, on a peninsula, situated within two miles of the eastern 
extremity of the loch. 

It is said that the unfortunate Marquis of Montrose, who figur- 
ed so conspicuously as a Royalist in the civil war in the reign of 
Charles I., after being defeated by General Strachan at Invercar- 
ron, fled towards Assynt, and was betrayed by Macleod, in whom 
he had reposed confidence. 

There are correct plans and maps of Assynt in the possession 
of the noble proprietrix, and a recent map of the county, both mi- 
nute and accurate, has been published. 

The Duchess- Countess of Sutherland is sole proprietrix of the 
parish. It has been in the possession of her Grace's family since 
the early part of the eighteenth century, when it was purchased 
by the then Earl of Sutherland, grandfather of the present Countess. 
In the former Statistical Account, published in 1794, is the 
following narrative : — " State of property, c. — The property of 
this parish has, perhaps, undergone as few changes as any. Tra- 
dition, and even documents declare, that it was a forest of the an- 
cient Thanes of Sutherland. One of these prime Thanes gave it 
in vassalage to one Mac-Kry-Cul, who in ancient times held the 
coast of Coigach, that part of it presently 1793 called the vil- 
lage of Ullapool. The noble Thane thus made Assynt over, as 
Mac-Kry-Cul had recovered a great quantity of cattle carried off 
from the county of Sutherland by foreign invaders, Scandinavians, 
who burnt the great fir forests in this and the neighbouring coast. 

" Mac-Kry-Cul's family, by the fate of war in those days of old, 
being reduced to one heir-female, she was given in marriage to a 
younger son of Macleod, Laird of Lewis, the Thane of Suther- 
land consenting thereto, and also making this parish over to the 
new married couple with its superiority. The result of this mar- 
riage was fourteen successive lairds of the name of Macleod.

-In 1660, or about that time, this parish and its superiority be- 
came the property of the Earl of Seaforth, who -e ;t over o

vice, and lie having married an heiress, was enabled thereby to 
purchase the estate of Geanies in Ross-shire. He was succeeded 
by his eldest son Hugh, and Hugh by his son Donald Macleod of 
Geanies, the late venerable Sheriff-depute of Ross and Cromarty, 
who filled that office with credit to himself and advantage to his 
country nearly sixty years; having departed this life in January 
1834, in the 89th year of his age. His eldest son predeceased 
his father, leaving a son, still a minor, the present representative 
of the family.  

Parochial Register.— There is no register of date previous to 
1798. Since that period, births and marriages have been recorded 
with tolerable regularity, but there is no register of deaths. 

Antiquities.— \. Ardvrack Castle, supposed to be built about 
the year 1581 or 1591 by the Macleods, who originally came from 
Lewis. It has for a considerable period been in ruins, but appears 
to have been strongly built and fortified. 

2. Calda House, a more modern building, erected by the Macken- 
zies, who succeeded the Macleods as Lairds of Assynt. This 
building was destroyed by fire, some say designedly, about 100 
years ago. Nothing remained but the bare walls. 

3. There is a very \krge dun or heap at ClachtoU, the remains 
' of a Druidical temple, with a double line of stone wall on the 

landward side ; towards the sea it is sufficiently protected by that 
element, and a rocky shore. It used to be called " Tighe tal- 
mhidh na Druinich," i. e. the earthly house of the Druids. 

4. Close to the parish church there is an enclosed burying- 
ground, in which are interred several of the Macleods of Assynt. 

This building is evidently part of what was once a place of wor- 
ship. The following tradition connected with it explains the cause 
of its being built : 

One Angus Macleod, supposed to be the great-grandson of the 
first Laird of Assynt of that name, had a quarrel with some neigh- 
bouring family. Out of revenge, he set fire to their chapel or 
place of worship. The consequence of this sacrilegious act was, 
his being excommunicated by the Pope. The displeasure of the 
Roman Pontiff was a serious matter in those days. Angus sub- 
mitted, and asked forgiveness at Rome. This was granted, but ly 
way of penance, he was enjoined to erect three places of worsliij, 



 When thc estate was sold, as mentioned above, some snnall compensation Cor I lie 
losses of the family was granted hy the Crown to the then proprietor, lUijfU Mncleod 
Esfj. of Geanies. 



112 SUTHERLAND. 

the remains of one of which we are now describing. A second ■ 
was built at Inver, and the third at Store. 

5. On the Stronchrubie farm, and near the high road, there 
may be seen an extraordinary mass of stone and Hme, having the 
appearance of having been in former times a part of some very 
large and thick building, such as an old castle. The lime seems 
as if infused into the mass. As there is not the least vestige ot 
any such building in the neighbourhood, it is difficult to account 
for it, unless we suppose it to have assumed its present form m 
consequence of some volcanic eruption. 

There are no modern buildings of any note in the parish, though 
there are several tolerably good dwelling-houses. 

III. — Population, 

By census 1831, the population was 3161-1503 males, and 1658 females. 
In 1760 the population was ISUU 
1801 . 2419 

1821 . 2803 

So that, upon the whole, the population has been on the increase. 
Of the present population about 1400 are attached to the churcli 
and parish of Store. 

Yearly average of births for the last seven years, . 88 

marriages, • • 

Number of families, . i ' fi 

Average number of individuals m each family, •  

Families chiefly employed in agriculture, •

There are no nobility or people of independent fortune resident 

in the parish. " . , . .  

Language.-The Gaelic language is still universal in Assynt, 
and the only . medium of religious instruction. The linglisli an- 
guage, however, is making slow but sure progress. The youth ot 
the parish are ambitious of acquiring it, being sensible that the 
want of it proves a great bar to their advancement m life. It is 
likely, nevertheless, that Assynt is ' one of the very last districts 
in which the Gaelic language shall cease to be the language o 
the people. It is remarkable that the Gaelic School Society will 
probably prove the means, at a remote period, of the expulsion of 
[he Gaelic language from the Highlands. The teachers em- 
ployed by that useful society, to whom we owe much,- taught the 
loune to read the Scriptures in their native tongue. This im- 
planted a desire to acquire knowledge on other subjects, which 
induced them to have recourse to the English language as the 
medium of communication.

Character of the People. — The character of the people may be 
said to be good. They are kind, civil, and extremely hospitable ; 
patient of labour, and capable of enduring much bodily fatigue. 
In general they prefer making immense exertions at times, to more 
moderate but constant labour. They live sparingly. Their chief 
articles of food are herrings and potatoes. Some attention has, of 
late, been paid to cleanliness and neatness about their dwellings, 
but very much remains to be done. Upon the whole, they may 
be said to be contented with their situations. They are naturally 
shrewd and intelligent, and regular in their attendance on public 
worship. Poaching and smuggling, particularly the latter, were 
carried on to an alarming extent, and proved extremely prejudi- 
cial to the morals of the people. Now, the narrator is happy to be 
able to say, that, througb the judicious and determined exertions 
of the Noble proprietor, aided by the gentlemen who have the 
management, such irregularities are almost unknown amongst us. 

IV. — Industry. 
From situation and climate, the greater part of Assynt, particu- 
larly the interior, is peculiarly adapted for pasturage. According- 
ly a large portion of it is laid out in sheep-walks, viz. Ledbeg, 
Filin, &amp;c. at a rent of L. 540 ; Achumore, L. 338 ; Ardvar, 
L. 220 ; Stronchrubie, L. 205 ; and Ledmore, L. 80. 

It will thus be seen that sheep-farming is carried on to a con- 
siderable extent. It is also prosecuted systematically. 

The great bulk, however, of the population dwell along the 
shores, where they have the benefit of fishing. They occupy lots 
of land at rents ranging from L. 2 to L. 5. The land is not high 
rented, but the occupants, in general, are in straitened circum- 
stances. This arises from the over-crowded state of the popula- 
tion. On the lot of land which, according to the rental book, is 
assigned to only one family, two are frequently found residing. 
This is the true cause of our poverty, and, unless emigration on a 
large scale takes place, matters must soon come to a painful crisis. 
At the same time, from want of climate, a great part of Assynt is 
unfit for cultivation. 

Rents. — Of old, the valued rent of the parish was L. 1000 Scots. 
In the year 1794, it was L. 1000 Sterling. In the year 1812, 
when there was a general setting of the farms through the parish, 
it was about L. 5000 ; now it is reduced to something less than 
L. 3000. 

iuarries. — From Ledbeg to Achumore the soil is limestone. 



114 SUTHERLAND. 

About tbii'ty years ago, an attempt was made to quarry marble 
both at Ledbeg, and in the immediate vicinity of the churcli. 
The marble was found susceptible of a very fine polish, and an 
enterprising individual, a native of Newcastle, commenced quarry- 
ing. Roads were formed, or rather tracts for the heavy waggons, 
from Ledbeg to Unapool, a distance of sixteen miles. This was 
an undertaking of considerable difficulty, and after a large quanti- 
ty was shipped, it was found attended with such expense, that it 
was impossible to compete with quarries, in more eligible situations, 
and the project was dropped. 

Salmon Fisheries.— Theve are no fisheries in the parish deserv- 
ing the name, except that on the water of Kirkag, and that which 
leads from Loch Assynt to Lochinver. These are let at a mode- 

' Navigation.— Theve are very few vessels belonging to Assynt. 
Mr Macdonald, Lochinver, has one or tWo. Several vessels, how- 
ever, are yearly employed on our coasts in the herring trade, and 
a few in exporting the produce of the parish, which consists chiefly 
of wool. 

There are no associations in the parish for the encouragement or 
improvement of industry ; but the Noble proprietors supply this de- 
ficiency in a great measure, by rewarding the industrious, and thus 
inciting to additional exertions. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets.— Theve is no market-town within the parish ; neither 
have any markets been established. It is intended to establish a 
cattle market at Inshnadamph. This would prove very advan- 
tageous to the people, and save them the expense and troub e ot 
driving their cattle to a greater distance. The Kyle tryst, he d u. 
the vicinity of Bonar Bridge, forty miles beyond Inshnadamph, is 
the nearest cattle-market at present. 

Lochinver is the only place deserving the name of a village In 
it are some good houses, shops, and several tradesmen In the 
immediate vicinity is a manufactory, for the preserving of butcher- 
meat, fish, and vegetables, which affords our sailors, and others, 
the luxury of fresh meat, whilst they are hundreds of leagues out 
at sea. It is carried on under the auspices of Mr Macdonald, an 
. extensive and enterprising sheep-farmer. Regular employment .s 
thus given to a number of tradesmen and labourers.

office There is another in the immediate neighbourhood of the 
church The mails arrive regularly twice a-week. This is one of 
the greatest improvements imaginable. A letter or newspaper 
from London we have the fifth day. In connection with the post- 
office, I am naturally led to notice our excellent roads. Nothing 
has so much contributed to the external improvement of the coun- 
try as these, by which this interesting district, till lately inaccessible 
and comparatively unknown, has been opened up to the pubhc; and 
thus, advantages"secured to the inhabitants, which our ancestors 
would have deemed impossible. This improvement is attributable, 
in a great measure, to the Noble proprietors, and, were there no 
other benefit conferred on it, Assynt, on this account, owes a last- 
ing debt of aratitude to the late excellent Duke of Sutherland. 
The length of road constructed from Aultnacaelgach to Store, in- 
cludincr branches to Unapool and Inverkirkig, exceeds forty miles. 
To thfs may be added several miles of bye roads for the exclusive 
benefit of the tenantry. There is a small convenient harbour at 
Lochinver, where a pier has been erected. There are some other 
harbours, or rather creeks, at Nedd, Oldney, and Ardvar, all ly- 
incT on the north side of the point of Store, which afford shelter and 

anchorage. , i- i j u  

Savings' Bank.— There was a savings' bank established about 
four years ago, and it is now in full operation. It has already 
proved very beneficial. It is under the patronage of the Suther- 
land family, who encourage industry by giving a higher rate of in- 
terest than the banks do, for all sums not exceeding L.20 Sterling. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated within nine 
miles of the southern boundary of the parish— a situation extreme- 
ly inconvenient for the people. The great bulk of the population 
dwell at distances from the church, varying from twelve to eighteen 
miles. The intervening population is very small. The church was 
built upwards of sixty years ago, but was re-slated and seated about 
twenty-five years ago. It is seated for 260 or 280 sitters. It is 
small, but comfortable. There are two other regular preaching 
stations, where the minister has to officiate, viz. Lochinver, distant 
fourteen miles, to which there is a good road leading; and Kyle- 
side, nearly the same distance, but without any road at all. In 
the former district there is preaching once in the three weeks ge- 
nerally, or once a month at farthest ; in the other, once in the six 
or seven weeks. At Lochinver there is a pretty good house built 
by subscription, In which the late Duke, and the Duchess-Coun- 



116 



SUTHERLAND. 



tess of Sutherland largely contributed. It is only partially seated 
as yet. It is also used as a General Assembly school-house dur- 
ing the week. In the Kyle side public worship has to be perform- 
ed in the open air, however inclement the weather. Strong appli- 
cations for additional accommodation in both districts have been 
made to the Religious Instruction Commissioners, but hitherto 
without success. There is a Government or Parliamentary church 
at Store, built in 1829, To this is attached a population of 1403, 
leaving upwards of 1700 scattered over a vast extent of inaccessible 
surface, as has already been described. 

In order to carry on pastoral superintendence properly, a minis- 
ter is required at Lochinver, and another at Kyleside. There are 
no missionaries in the parish. Public worship is well attended by 
the people. The average number of communicants is 80, — a num- 
ber certainly small when compared with the population. The 
communion is regularly administered once a-year. 

The stipend amounts to L. 158, 6s. 8d., including the allowance 
for communion elements. The glebe is pretty extensive. It is 
chiefly adapted for grazing, and," at the rate at which lands in the 
neighbourhood are let, might fetch a rent of L.20 or L.25 Ster- 
ling per annum. The manse was built about fifteen years ago, but, 
from frequent storms, and its exposed situation, it very often re- 
quires repairs. The minister of the Parliamentary church at Store 
has an annual stipend of L. 120, paid by the Exchequer, and a 
glebe worth L. 7 a-year. 

There are no dissenting places of worship, and not above half 
a dozen Dissenters in the whole parish. 

There is a catechist who receives L,8 annually from the so- 
ciety in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and, with 
the exception of this pittance, he is remunerated solely by the 
people. There is no such thing as letting of church seats known 
amongst us. The average annual amount of church collections 
is L. 7, 18s. 

Education, — The schools in the parish are 7 in number, viz. the 
parochial school, three from the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, one from the Edinburgh Gaelic School Society, one 
from the Glasgow Gaelic School Society, and one from the General 
Assembly's Education Committee. Besides these, in various remote 
districts the people club together to provide a teacher for their 
children, during the winter and spring months. None of these 
schools are endowed except the parochial one. In it the teacher's 

4 



ASSYNT. 



117 



salary is L.25; the General Assembly's teacher, L.25 ; the Society 
for Propagating Christian Knowledge give L. 15 to their teachers ; 
and the Glasgow Society, L. 12. . All these teachers are entitled 
to demand fees, which privilege is not of much advantage to them, 
as far as money is concerned. Many of the people, however, 
make some remuneration, by supplying the teacher with provisions 
and fuel. The Edinburgh Gaelic School Society allow their teach- 
ers a salary of L.-25, without the liberty of exacting fees. These 
schools are pretty well attended from the beginning of November 
till the end of March. The branches taught are, reading in Gae- 
lic and English, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. ; a very few are learning 
Latin. There is much need that the system of education amongst 
us should be improved, and the qualification of teachers raised. 
At the same time, we would acknowledge the obligations under 
which we lie to the charitable and religious associations above 
named. The Bible is read daily in all our schools, and attention 
paid to the religious instruction of the pupils. 

A reading club has been instituted, and promises well. 

There is no jail. 

Poor. — The number of poor annually relieved, exclusive of the 
Stoer district, 73. Amount annually expended in their relief, 
L. 13, 15s. Amount for that purpose arising from church collec- 
tions, L. 7, 12s. Amount from other sources, L. 6, 3s. The poor 
are divided into three classes, and get respectively 4s., 2s. 6d., and 
2s. each. 

Alehouses. — There is a competent number of public houses li- 
censed, and all others are strictly prohibited the selling of ardent 
spirits. In this respect a decided change for the better has taken 
place. 

Fuel — Peats" are universally used, and much difficulty is expe- 
rienced in seasoning them, arising from the excessive rains with 
which we are often deluged. 

Since writing the foregoing Account, Her Grace the Duchess- 
Countess of Sutherland has been removed from this world ; and 
her titles and estates have devolved upon Her Grace's eldest son, 
the present Duke, who has become twenty-second Earl of Suther- 
land. 

To the late Duchess, the parish of Assynt owed much. She 
uniformly manifested a warm interest in the welfare of its inhabi- 
tants ; and it is evident they evinced a hereditary and respectful 



118 SUTHEULA.ND. 



attachment to her Grace, who, during the singularly long period 
of seventy-three years, retained possession of the most ancient title 
in Europe. We look forward with confidence to the present No- 
ble proprietor for a continuation of that kindness, which, for nges, 
characterized the Sutherland family.

PRESBYTERY OF TONGUE, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. GEORGE TULLOCH, MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Extent —The parish of Edderachillis is situated on the north-west 
coast of the county of Sutherland, along the shores of the Atlantic, 
being a portion of the Reay country, commonly called " Duthaich- 
mhic-Aoid/i." Its extreme length, from north to south, is 25 
miles, by an average breadth from west to east towards the inte- 
rior of 7 miles, making 175 square miles, equal to 112,000 acres 
or thereby. In this is included the district of Keanlochbervie, 
some time ago disunited from the parish of Edderachillis, and erect- 
ed into a separate parish quoad sacra, under act of Parliament 5 

Geo. IV. cap. 90. 

Edderachillis was part of the barony of Skelbo. It was disponed 
bv Hugo Freskyn de Moravia, ancestor of the Duke of Sutherland 
n86-1203, to his brother, Bishop Gilbert Moray, who in 1235 
disponed it to his brother Richard Moray of Culbyn. About 1440 
an heiress, Egidia Moray, carried it into the family of Kinnaird of 
Kinnaird In 1515, Andrew Kinnaird disponed it to John Mac- 
kay of Edderachillis, son of Mackay of Strathnaver, the superiority 
remaining with the Earls of Sutherland. The purchase of 1829 
restored it to the Sutherland family. 

_The name is Celtic, the orthography and pronimciation 
beine Eadar-da-chaolas, literally signifying between two friths or 
inlet of the sea, which can be readily reconciled to its geographical

position, Kylesku separating it from Assynt on the south-west, 
and the Kyle of Laxford, in the ancient division, on the north- 
east, although in modern times it extends to Gualin Hill. 

Boundaries.— It is bounded on the south, by Kylesku, Loch 
Glencoul, parish of Assynt, and some of Creich ; on the west, by 
the Atlantic ocean; on the south, by the parish of Durness; and 
on the east, partly by Durness also, and partly by the parish of 
Lairg. 

Figure, General Appearance, and Natural Divisions. — Its figure 
is irregular, intersected with arms of the sea, and from the top of 
one of the mountains, presenting a checquered appearance of lakes, 
trlens, rivers, and ravines. ■■- To view it from sea, at the distance of 
some miles from the coast, it is allowed to be particularly like Nor- 
way, affording an unbounded field for contemplation to the admirers 
of nature, in consequence of its sublime scenery and striking Alpme 
character. 

" Stranger  if e'er thine ardent steps have traced 

The northern realms of ancient Caledon, 

Where the proud queen of wilderness hath placed, 

By lake and cataract, her lonely throne ; 

Sublime but sad delight thy soul hath known. 

Gazing on pathless glen and mountain high, 

Listing where from the cliffs the torrent thrown. 

Mingle their echoes \vith the eagle's cry, 

And with the sounding lake, and with the roaming sky, 

"Tis known amid the pathless wastes of Reay." 
The parish is naturally divided by arms of the sea into the three 
following divisions, 1. Scourie division, situated between Loch 
Glendhu and Loch Laxford. 2, " Ceathramh-garbli," between 
Loch Laxford and Loch Inchard ; and 3. Ashare. The name 
of the first of those divisions cannot be traced to any particular 
origin, whilst that of the other' two may be ascribed to the natural 
appearance of the localities, — " Ceathramli-garhh,'" in Gaelic signi- 
fying a rough section of a country ; a term applicable in reality to 
this division ; and Ashare, or " Fas-thire," with the " F" silent, 
signifying arable land, or land capable of producing corn. 

Mountains. — The mountains demanding particular notice are 
those of Beinne-Leothaid, Beinne-Stac, Beinne-Stroim, Arkle, 
and the south-west range of the Reay forest to the summit of 
Toinne-Bheinne, Meal Horn, Sabhal-mhoir and Mille-Rinidh, 
with part of Beinne-Shith. The shape of Beinne-Stac is conical, 
Arkle rather level in the top, with a glassy or stalactical appear-

ance, especially after rain ; each of which, as well as the forest 
range, are close to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. 

Lakes. — The most remarkable lakes are Loch-moir and Loch- 
Stac ; but many others of considerable size might be mentioned. 

Rivers. — Laxford and Inchard are the largest, with innumerable 
rivulets, all discharging themselves into the Atlantic. 

Islands. — A cluster of islands, of about twenty, lies between 
Edderachillis and Assynt, and to the north of Scourie Bay, the 
island of Handa ; no less celebrated from its rising perpendicularly 
on the north-west side to a height of 600 feet or thereby ; than for 
the myriads of sea-fowl which migrate to its precipitous cliffs in the 
summer season to bring forth .their young. The tourist would be 
as much gratified by a visit to this island as to Staffa, the charac- 
ter of its rocks being more singular and striking. The basaltic 
columns of Staffa are to be met with in more than in one part, but 
those- of Handa are peculiar to it only, lying as they do horizontal- 
ly, and presenting an appearance as if all were built by the hand of 
man. 

Natural Harbours. — The whole line of coast is much favoured 
in respect to harbours. They are sufficient to afford safe anchorage 
to the whole naval and mercantile shipping of Great Britain. 
Those of most note are lochs Laxford, Inchard, Badcall, Calva, 
Glendhu, and Sound of Handa. 

General Description. — Owing to the mountainous character of 
the country, the natural capabilities are chiefly confined to the 
rearing of sheep: the greater .part is so appropriated. The sea 
coast is to be viewed of similar importance as regards the fisheries. 
The quantity of corn is limited, and, in consequence of the rug- 
gedness and unevenness of the surface, it is raised by the force of 
manual labour, with scarcely any aid from the plough. 

But what nature has denied in one way for the support of man 
is bestowed in another, by the unlimited quantities of fish which 
surround the coast, particularly the herrings : they formerly fre- 
quented it in great shoals in autumn, and still not unfrequently in 
summer. The pasture is of a healthy and sound quality. Such por- 
tions of the land as are under tillage are not of a bad quality, and 
yield fair returns. The rivers produce salmon, and the lakes are 
all well stocked with trout, — both of excellent quality. 

Meteorology. — The weather is changeable, and the prevailing 
winds are south and west. The temperature cannot be reckoned 
cold, but the atmosphere, owing to the vapours from the Atlantic,

and the high hills attracting the clouds, is humid, and productive of 
rheumatic and scrofulous affections, the latter often proving fatal- 
Heavy falls of snow occur, but are of short duration along the 
coast, although the higher grounds partially retain their coats till 
June. There are instances of great longevity and retention of phy- 
sical faculties. Small-pox made its appearance last season, but its 
progress, under Divine will, was soon arrested by the immediate 
and general application of cow-pox, attended to by a surgeon 
appointed for the purpose, at the expense of the Duke of Su- 
therland. Solar and lunar rainbows are not unfrequent ; and a 
most striking view is that of the sun setting in summer, casting its 
rays in crimson hue across the bosom of the ocean. The aurora 
borealis or Northern Lights occasionally shew themselves, are 
extremely vivid, and, according to vulgar acceptation, " arrayed 
against each other in the order of a line of battle." Although 
we are not strangers to the terror of the thunder storm, seldom 
or ever any accidents are heard of ; flashes of lightning are pe- 
riodically common about the commencement of each quarter. A 
rare, if not an unprecedented, phenomenon in this latitude, occurred 
in winter 1838, by an avalanche destroying no less than a herd of 
twelve deer ; and such was the force of that terrific body, that it not 
only killed the animals on the spot, but when the forester found 
them, their bones were crushed to pieces. The fury of sea storms 
is often the cause of great alarm and damage, particularly in 
winter, and to the observer on shore is magnificently grand when 
they are from the north-west; the noise of the billows of the At- 
lantic heaving against the rocks is tremendous, and only equalled 
by the height to which they are raised, known in some instances to 
be no less than about 600 feet against the precipitous rocks of 
Handa. Shipwrecks, however, are not so common as they were, 
owing to a lighthouse having been erected on Cape Wrath. 

Hydrography. — The most direct approach from the south to 
this parish is through a part of Assynt to Kylesku, at which there 
is a ferry between Edderachillis and Assynt, of 380 yards broad. 
The tide of this narrow inlet is extremely rapid, readily accounted 
for by the great expanse of sea on both sides ; from it two exten- 
sive lochs branch into the interior. Loch Glendhu on the left, and 
Loch Glencul on the right hand, — the former upwards of three 
miles long, by one and a-half broad, and the latter nearly five long, 
by one broad, — both of great depth, and no less celebrated for the 
quantity and quality of their herrings than for their singular wild-

ness and romantic scenery, the hills rising on every side to a great 
height, and interspersed with formidable cliffs. The great arm 
of the sea forming this inlet on the west, juts in from the ocean a 
distance of ten miles, and is commonly but erroneously called in 
the charts " Loch Assynt." To instance the importance of Loch 
Glendhu for herrings, so recently as the autumn of 1829, it was 
estimated that the value of herrings caught in it was L.30,000 ; and 
it has been known that 100 herring busses have resorted to it at a 
time. The other harbom-s and sea lochs, already noticed, are pro- 
ductive of herrings and other varieties of fish, including shell-fish. 

To advert to the fresh water lakes, Loch-Moir and Loch-Stac 
are the two most conspicuous ; not only from their inlanc. position, 
and as giving rise to the river Laxford, but as they form the con- 
fines of the great Reay Forest on the south-west. The former is 
five miles long by one broad ; the latter three long and two broad. 
Their water, rising from the bowels of the mountains, which are 
principally gneiss, quartz, and felspar, is particularly limpid and 
free of impurities. 

Good wholesome water is to be had. in all parts, principally from 
perennial springs. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The characters and varieties that 
arise under those heads are neither numerous nor very important, 
as far as they have been yet discovered ; and did we enter on par- 
ticulars, too much space would necessarily be occupied. As a 
whole, Edderachillis is of the primitive and transition classes, and 
the ranges of mountains already mentioned, with little exception, 
consist of gneiss, various hornblende rocks, granite in veins, and 
quartz rock. Limestone is met with on the sides of Lochs Glen- 
dhu, Glencul, and Loch-Moir. Hornblende slates are to be found 
round Scourie and at Kylestrome. Handa island is composed 
chiefly of red sandstone, the quality of which cannot be excelled 
for every description of architectural work. 

Soil. — The soil along the coast and in the valleys, principal- 
ly recumbent on gneiss, is of various descriptions. The great- 
er part of the arable is a mixture of gravel and moss, fertiliz- 
ed by the application of sea-weed for manure, which imparts 
to the land a considerable portion of organic matter, and its 
alkaline properties neutralize the acid which the moss con- 
tains. The district of Ashare is better soil than the rest, being 
dark loam intermixed with sand, and the features of that section 
of the parish convey a belief that it has been earlier inhabited and 



EDDERACHILLIS. 



123 



cultivated than the rest. The arable land of the island of Handa 
is of a similar quality. 

ZooloffT/.— The domestic animals need not be enumerated under 
this head, as reference will be made to them in another part of 
this account. The wild animals common to the rest of the High- 
lands are to be met with. The first to be noticed is the red-deer 
f Cervus elapMis , and not inapplicably named the monarch of 
the forest. In this country, where so much is done for preserv- 
ing and propagating his species, we are called upon to pay more 
than ordinary attention in delineating what has been done. The 
Reay forest, or Diru-moir, has had always a place amongst the 
principal forests in Scotland ; a character in this respect it main- 
tained for many generations, till within the last quarter of a cen- 
tury, when it gradually declined, owing to the introduction of 
sheep. Upon the expiry of the leases of such part of the forest as 
had been thus allotted for sheep, — the Duke of Sutherland has re- 
stored the whole to what it originally was, excluding sheep, and 
placing the range in charge of foresters solely for the preservation 
of deer. Tliis not only amply provides for the animal most cha- 
racteristic of the country, and most conducive to the sportsman''s 
adventures, but also relieves the whole neighbouring sheep-walks 
of the greater part of the deer that roamed over them, the main- 
tenance of which was a considerable burden. The extent of terri- 
tory so exclusively laid off for deer cannot be less than 60,000 
acres, whereof the half is in this parish, and the rest in Durness, 
inhabited by some thousands of deer, and inferior as a forest to 
none in Scotland. Sir Robert Gordon, in his History of the Earl- 
dom of Sutherland, written in the year 1630, gives the following 
account of the forest, viz. — " The lialfe of the Diri-more, which 
lyes toward the north and north-west, doth appertein of late to 
Macky, by the Erie of Southerland, his gift and disposition. In 
the Diri-more, ther is a hill called Arkill ; all the deir that ar bred 
therein, or hant within the bounds of that hill, have forked taills, 
thrie incles long, whereby they are easailie known and decerned 
from all other deir." • The description thus given of the deer hav- 
ing forked tails is still applicable. 

It may be added, that the Laxford affords anjrlinff for salmon 
and trout, not to be surpassed by any river in the north. 

The quadrupeds and birds are thus described in Sir Robert 
Gordon's work of 1630, and have since undergone very little 
change, viz, " All these forrests and schases are verie profitable for 



124 SUTlIIiRLAND. 

feiding of bestiall, and delectable for hunting. They are full of 
reid-deir and roes, wonlffs, foxes, wyld catts, brocks skuyrells, 
Avhittrets, weasels, otters, martrixes, hares, and futnarts. In these 
forrests, and in all this province, ther is great store of partridges, 
pluivers, capercalegs, blackwaks, murefowls, heth-hens swanes, 
bewters, turtle-doves, herons, dowes, steares or stirhngs, lair-ig.gh 
or knag, which is a foull lyke unto a paroket or parret, which 
maks place for her nest with her beck in the oak trie, duke, dra.g, 
widgeon, teale, wild-gouse, ringouse, routs, whaips, shot-wha.ps, 
woodcock, larkes, sparrows, snyps, blackburds or osills meiveis, 
thrushes, and all other kinds of wild-foule and birds which are o 
be had in any pairt of this kingdome." From the above list, only 
the wolf and capercailzies need to be excluded, in order to make 
it nearly applicable to the present time. , .1 

Birds.-These are, three species of the eagle, the royal, black 
mountain, and osprey or fish-eagle,-hawks, various kinds - 
owls, cuckoos, black-cocks, ptarmigans, moorfowls, partridges, 
golden and gray plovers, woodcocks, snipes, starlings, sparrows, 
Lushes, wagtails, swallows, kingfishers, rock, -ood, and 
sea-pigeons, mavis, and landrails. Swans, wild-geese, ducks, dif- 
ferent kinds, the great northern divers, scarts, solan-geese cranes 
gulls, and many other sea-fowls and birds of passage, frequent 
Handa in the summer months. , , . v j 

Fishes.-These are, salmon, trout, char, herring, ling, cod, scate, 
turbot, flounder, haddock, halibut, mackerel, tusk, lythe coalfish 
dogfisi, whiting, eel, silver-eyed fish, sunfish, and g-- 
cou'ntry where the coast swarms with fish, some may have aped 
notice, and others, perhaps, have not been discovered ; r - kit]y 
as December 1 838, the writer transmitted to the Ij-b- College 
Museum, two verv rare specimens recently found at Scourie. Fro 
fessor Jameson gjve them a place in the Museum being presented 
1; the lamented Duchess-Countess of Sutherlan - escribes 
them thus : « Two specimens of fishes ; the smaller of the two is 
y L, and is new to the Fauna of Scotland ; it is the Poor 
Sof auJhors ; the other, or larger specimen, is the rnmaadatcd 

cZcea.-The cetaca frequenting the coast are, the whale and 
the porp se : and the seal may be included. A very remarkable 
t as to size, measuring in length 8 feet 2 mches, w 

by Captain Granville Gower Loch, R.N. in 1837, in the sea 
tween Assynt &amp;nd Edderachilhs. 



EDDERACHILLIS.

Neither the whale nor the sunfish are captured on this coast ; 
the former seldom in any part of Scotland. The latter used to 
be taken in considerable numbers on the coasts of the islands of 
Harris and Barra, through the dexterity of the natives harpoon- 
ing them at sea. The liver alone yields oil to the amount of 360 
gallons at an average. 

Crustacea and Shell-fish are to be had in great varieties and of 
superior quality, consisting of lobsters, crabs, oysters, mussels, 
cockles, welks, and limpets, also pearls in the rivers. The lob- 
sters are brought in large quantities to London, and allowed to be 
the best exposed in Billingsgate. 

Beasts and Birds of Prey and Vermin. — On this subject it 
may be remarked, that wolves were at one time numerous, and, to 
avoid their ravages in raising bodies from the graves, the popula- 
tion had recourse to the Island of Handa as their place of inter- 
ment. This is the tradition of the country, and it is beheved to 
be well founded. The destructiveness of the fox amongst the 
sheep is now most to be complained of. The otter amongst the 
salmon, and the common rat and mouse, could all be well dispen- 
sed with. No country produces finer specimens of the black 
mountain eagle, so hostile to lambs; ravens and crows also com- 
mit depredations. 

Reptiles. — These are, the adder {Anguis Eryx, lizard, toad, 
and frog. The first is injurious. The following instance is worthy 
of notice : Some years ago, Donald Morrison, tenant, Ashare, 
was stung ; and the effects gave rise to apprehensions of imme- 
diate death. When in the greatest agony, the captain of a strange 
vessel landed on the coast, who prescribed the following singular 
cure : a young chicken to be split or cut up alive, and instantly 
applied to the stung part. After the same treatment had been re- 
peated by cutting up alive and applying nine chickens without in- 
termission, the patient was relieved ; each chicken which was ap- 
plied indicating by its swelling that it had absorbed poison. The 
individual who underwent this treatment recovered, is still alive, 
and enjoys perfect health. 

Botany. — The field for the botanist is rather limited. Profes- 
sor Graham remarks, that the Luzula arcuata has been found only 
in three stations in Britain, the summit of the mountains at the 
source of the Dee, Benraore in Assynt, and Fionnbhein, ranging 
into this parish. 

There are nppearances of the whole country having been at 



•126 SUTHERLAND. 

some period covered with wood, in the remains of trees, principally 
fir, which are found in the mosses. The natural wood now stand- 
in o- is limited to about 600 acres, almost birch, along the banks of 
Loch-Moir, Loch-Stac, and at Badna bay. Wood has not been 
planted, with the exception of a very small portion round the fac- 
tor', house at Scourie, and has given way owing to its proximity 
to the ocean. There can be no doubt, that all kinds indigenous 
to the British Isles would grow in the interior, if they were on a 
large scale, and properly attended to. Apple, also pear trees, 
and small fruit bushes, as also culinary vegetables, thrive well in 
the garden at Scourie. 

II. — Civil History. 
Nothino- is known of EdderachiUis as a parish, earher than 
1726 thedate of its erection -except that, before that time, it 
formed part of the parish of Durness, and was disjoined on an ap- 
plication to the General Assembly by the heritor. Lord Reay, and 
Mr John Mackay, minister of Durness, and endowed by a fund 
arising from the teinds, and a general subscription over Scotland. 
The district, however, occupies rather a conspicuous place in the 
annals of the Mackay's country. A branch of the Mackays at so 
earlY a period as 1550, took possession of the territory of Eddera- 
chiUis bv displacing the Macleods, and planted themselves at 
Scourie, under the title of " Mackays of Scourie." The unjusti- 
fiable means to which they had recourse to procure this settle- 
ment, is defined in the last Statistical Account by the Rev. Mr 
Falconer A repetition of it here is unnecessary. 

 Amongst the descendants of the Mackays of Scoune, were men 
eminent for piety and chivalry. The history of one of them in 
"ticular claims attention, whose character -en ts admira on 
for its many virtues. This was Lieutenant- General Hugh Mac 
kaV f Scourie, the famous Commander-in-Chief o the time o 
Kfng William and Mary. He was born in 1640 ; the account of 
his Ufe, published by hi« descendant, Mr John Mackay of Rock- 
fi d i tell worthv of a perusal. ' He fought against Dundee at 
ti e battle of Killicrankie ; and although the fortunes of that day 
p oved adverse, he showed great military skill in his retreat, and 
fully regained any character it might have been supposed he had 
lo by his great success in Ireland, particularly at the battle of 
reinon', where he displayed much military  
Manv other great exploits could be mentioned. He was to have 
btn'rewarded by a peerage, under the title of Earl of Scourie ; 



EDDERACHILLIS.

but this was prevented by the alleged intrigue of liis rival, Mac- 
kenzie of Coigach or Cromarty. This great man's career termi- 
nated in 1692; he fell shortly after the siege of Namur, where he 
commanded the British division of the grand army. 

Parochial Register. — There are no traces of a parochial record 
having been kept prior to 1819. From that period, births and 
marriages have been carefully recorded. 

Antiquities. — Little can be stated on this head. At Kylestrome 
there are the remains of a Danish fort tolerably entire : and at 
Scourie there are still visible the remains of a similar building, as 
well as of tumuli. At Badnabay, also, there is the appearance of 
a Druidical circle of stones. 

Land-owners. — The Duke of Sutherland is sole proprietor of 
the parish, — into whose possession, with the rest of the Reay coun- 
try, it came in 1829 : it was then almost in a state of nature, with- 
out a foot of road orother improvements, — the most commendable 
thing about it being the excellent deportment of its natives as to 
religion, and in respect of moral and social order. 

Bonds, Sfc. — The aspect of the country has been since changed 
by the construction of roads, erection of inns, and farm-houses. 
These improvements extended over the whole county of Sutherland. 
In the aggregate, no less than 480 miles of roads have been made, 
greatly by the means, and wholly through the instrumentality, of 
his Grace. The portion of these roads confined to this parish is 
32 miles in extent; and three inns have been erected in it solely 
at the Duke's expense. 

Means of Communication. — It appears from the former Statisti- 
cal Account, that there was no regular post communication with 
the south, — a circumstance which caused great complaint in these 
days ; and the only way of receiving letters was by a few of the pa- 
rishioners contributing to send a runner once a-fortnight to Tongue, 
to which place there was a communication from the south' round 
by Caithness, — the difference between the direct line and this route 
being at least 150 miles. Instead of this, there is now a post- 
office at Scourie, having intercourse, by means of a mail-gig twice 
a-week, with Golspie, where there is a daily post to all parts of 
the kingdom. The internal communication was equally defective, 
— the intercourse being carried on by boating, and on un shod 
ponies, which scrambled over the precipices with wonderful safety 
and agility. Few accidents arose from either. The last was the 
case of Captain William Scobie of Ardvar, who was drowned in

the sound of Handa, exceedingly lamented on account of his many 
excellent qualities. 

Buildings In a country like this, almost entirely pastoral, 

many extensive buildings are not required. It is a marked fea- 
ture in its character, since the succession of the Duke of Suther- 
land, that new farm-houses and inns have displaced the old,— in- 
troducing a new era in this district, and illustrating the liberality 
iand ability of the new landlord. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1792, according to the last Statistical Ac- 
count, was 1024; and the last census makes it 1965, giving the 
striking increase of 941, notwithstanding that many families emi- 
grated. 

Character of the People, -c— The population is domiciled along, 
the coast in townships or hamlets, each family possessing a cer- 
tain portion of land. Their houses are of a better description than 
the ordinary run of Highland houses, and amongst them are a few 
slated cottages. The people are moral, hospitable, and very mind- 
ful of their poor. They are particularly honest ; and hardly ever 
a case of theft occurs, even when the wants of the population are 
great. For example ; a ship laden with corn was stranded at 
Loch Laxford in 18-33; and though the vessel and cargo, in the 
confusion of the shipwreck, was laid open to pillage, — to the cre- 
dit of the people be it told, nothing was stolen ; a self-denial 
scarcely to be met with anywhere, under similar circumstances. 
Gaelic is the vernacular tongue, and generally spoken : the great- 
er number of the young speak English also ; and the few south 
country shepherds amongst them speak English only. 

Illegitimate births seldom occur,— there having been only four 
within the last three years. 

The names most, prevalent, are Morrison, Mackay, Macleod, 
and Mackenzie. The men are athletic ; and such of them as 
were in the army made first-rate soldiers. Their features are 
marked, and, although not particularly well favoured, indicate a 
bold and resolute character. The women are comely. The co- 
lour'of the hair is generally light, and the complexion rather fair. 

In the article of dress, they are not extravagant. On Sundays 
and holidays, they are neatly and cleanly attired. The elderly 
people dress in cloth of their own manufacture. Such as repair to 
the south and Caithness herring-fishing, adopt, to a considerable 
extent, the lowland dress and habits.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Fishing.— The productive employments of the 
people consist in tilling the ground and fishing, with the various 
operations attendant on both. In a country where there is not an 
immediate market for the sale of fish, and for affording the neces- 
saries of life, the combination of these employments is found to 
answer well. The operation of laying down the crop commences 
about the middle of March, and finishes in May. Harvest begins 
in August, and ends in October. The crops raised are, potatoes, 
bear or bigg, and oats. In the absence of the plough, the imple- 
ment used in laying down the crop is the common garden spade and 
Cas-chrom. A description of the latter having been so repeated- 
ly given in other accounts of Highland parishes, it need not be 
presented here. Since the construction of the roads, many of the 
tenants have carts, which are in all about forty : these were un- 
known before the Duke acquired the estate. 

Soon after the sowing is completed, the most enterprising com- 
mence the early herring fishing; and such as have large boats, in the 
latter end of July, on the Caithness coast, whence they return in the 
beginning of September. Theiroccupation in winter is promiscuous, 
— thrashing corn, attending to their cattle, making, repairing, and 
trimming herring nets for the ensuing season — the females spin- 
ning and knitting. The rate charged for spinning hemp is 6d. 
per pound, but in the neighbouring district of Assynt, 3d. ; and 
it not unusually happens that a reckoning is kept amongst the 
members of the family, between sisters and brothers, of the quan- 
tity spun for herring nets, and closed by payment. This exact- 
ness cannot be too highly extolled, as it inculcates economy and 
value for money, so very desirable to be observed by all classes in 
the Highlands. Lobster-fishing is also carried on by a London 
company, who employ a number of the natives in procuring the 
lobsters, which they carry off alive in well-smacks to the Thames. 
This fishing commences in April, and ends in October. 

The last to be noticed is the salmon-fishery, commencing in 
March and closing in August. 

Kelp. — The manufacturing of kelp in former years gave employ- 
ment to a number of the people. Advancement in the science of 
chemistry disclosed substitutes for kelp, which have entirely thrown 
It out of the market, — a result not to be regretted, as the sea 
weed from which it was made is the manure that Nature has set 
apart for the land. Although kelp yielded a certain revenue to 



130 SUTHERLAND. 

a landlord, its manufacture retarded agricultural improvements, 
and thereby curtailed the quantity of produce which the land would 
otherwise yield for the maintenance and comfort of the popula- 
tion. 

Produce. In order to bring all under one view, a table is here 

presented, showing the number of men employed, the amount of 
stock and capital invested, and annual returns ; with a comparison 
betwixt the particulars of this and the last Statistical report of the 
parish. 

Lwe-Stoch.—The breed of sheep on the large farms is a pure 
Cheviot, to which great attention is paid. The sheep in the 
hands of small tenants is a cross between the native breed of 
small black-faced sheep and the Cheviot, and of late years has 
been much improved. The breed of black-cattle, comparatively 
speaking, is not very good, and much might be done towards its 
improvement. 

Before the hills were taken up for sheep stocks, the. country 
was deservedly famed for the breed of Highland ponies or garrons, 
extremely hardy, and some of them living to the age of thirty. The 
present Orkney breed is in a great degree descended from them, 
having at one time been sold hence in considerable droves. 

Manufactories.— establishment of this kind exists, and there 
is rather a scarcity of artisans and mechanics. 

Rent of La7id.— The average rent of arable land per acre can- 
not be exactly specified, as each lot or portion has a share of 
pasture land attached to it, held in common by the tenants of the 
respective townships. The following may convey an idea of the 
extent and nature of these holdings. The rents payable by each 
small tenant are from L. 2 to L. 5. To illustrate we will advert 
to a L. 3 rent, which is a very common one. In a favourable sea- 
son, the crop produced, together with milk and fish sujorts a 
family of four for eight months. Three small Highland cows, 
eight sheep, and one horse, form the stocking. 

These holdings, with their supply of fuel, however limited they 
may appear,-in a country where fish is abundant, enable the tru- 
cal occupants to live moderately well. , , . 

 ffanes—The wages of carpenters, smiths, masons, and tailors 
are about 2s. 6d. per day. Farm-servants, besides board, receive 
L y yearly ; maids, L. 3, 10s. Mr Falconer states the wages in 
1792 to have been, for a farm-servant, L.2, and for a maid-ser- 
vant, 17s. 8d. yearly— besides perquisites.

It is to be regretted that the cod and ling fisheries are not more 
prosecuted ; the natives are excellent herring fishers, but too lax 
as to the other : indeed, as yet, little or nothing has been done, 
in applying skill or capital towards the advancement of this im- 
portant branch of industry. 

The island of Handa is tenanted by twelve families. Besides 
fishing, they have recourse to other employment of a very ha- 
zardous character, by resorting to the daring enterprise ofgomga- 
fowling among the precipitous rocks round the island, from whence 
they brino-, at the imminent risk of their lives, a vast quantity of 
sea fowls°and eggs, to be used by them for food, and the feathers 
to be disposed of to their mainland neighbours. In this perilous 
avocation, some have fallen over the rocks, and been mstantly kill- 
ed. It is curious enough, that they have established nothing less 
than Royalty amongst them, in the person of the eldest widow on 
the island, who is designed Queen; and her prerogative is recog- 
nized not only by the islanders, but by visitors from the mainland. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
• Ecclesiastical State.-The whole population is of the Church 
of Scotland, and there are no Dissenting or Seceding families m 
the parish. There are two churches ; one at Badcall, and another at 
Keanlochbervie, both commodious, and in excellent repair. 

The stipend is the minimum, L. 150, whereof L.103, 6s. 8d is 
paid by the Exchequer, and the balance, L.46, 13s. 4d., by the he- 
ritor. The extent of the glebe is about 320 acres, and its yearly 
value L.30, or thereby. The manses and offices at Badcall and 
Keanlochbervie respectively are recent erections, the former built 
by the heritor in 1835, and the latter by Government in 18428. 

Education.-i:\e schools are the parochial school at Scoune, 
and a school at Ashare, from the Society for Propagating Christ- 
ian Knowledge. There is no regular Sabbath schoo kept. The 
attendance at both schools is considerable. It is believed tha a 
parochial school in connection with Keanlochbervie church will be 
«oon established. In some of the remote hamlets, there is private 
iuition in winter. The yearly amount of the parochial schoolmas- 
ter's salary is L. 35, 17s. 9d. : the school fees and other emolu- 
ments are trifling. A reading club has been recently established 

at Scourie. •  . rpi „ 

Savings 5a«/..-There is one Savings bank at Scoune. The 
whoe amount invested is L. 443, 9s. 6d., and the operations are 
very limited.

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 40, and the allotment to each 
yearly is from 3s. to \bs. The average amount of annual contri- 
butions for the poor is about L.20, whereof there is from church 
collections L. 14, and from the heritor L,6. No legal assessment 
has been imposed. 

jpuel. — This article, so very necessary for the existence and 
comfort of man, nature has provided in great abundance. Tracts 
of moss are open to all, and at no other expense than that of cut- 
ting the turf, and drying it by exposure to the action of the at- 
mosphere.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. JAMES CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Sfc. — The name Kildonan was spelt Keldurunach, in a 
charter by Gilbert Murray, who was Bishop of Caithness between 
the years 1222 and 1245 ; and in the seventeenth century, it was 
written Kildonnand, This name was originally confined to, as it 
still is the distinctive name of, the township where the church and 
manse were, at a very remote period, erected, and where they still 
stand J and upon the division of the country into parishes the 
name of the ancient church was used as that of the extensive tract 
of the county of Sutherland, now forming the parish of Kildonan, 
Many of the early monks and other ecclesiastics, who were scatter- 
ed throughout Scotland after Dioclesian's persecution, appear to 
have penetrated into Sutherland, and hence, those places in which 
their cells and residences were fixed, have been distinguished by 
the prefix of Kil from Cella,- a cell or chapel, which is found in 

• Drawn up by George Sutherland Taylor, Esq. Golspie. 

t Almost ail the words now used in the Gaelic language connected with religious 
establishments, have been borrowed from the old monkish Latin used by the first 
Christian missionaries in the Highlands, to denote new offices arid tei ms not previous, 
ly known. Thus the Gaelic of church is Eaglais, from the Latin Ecclcsia ; the 
Gaelic of Bishop is Eathuig, from Episcopus ; the Gaelic of abbot is Abh, from 



134 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

many of the names of places in Sutherland, as well as in other 
parts of Scotland. Thus Kildonan is derived from Kil, a cell, and 
Durun or Donan, the proper name of its original inhabitant, whose 
memory has been handed down by tradition, with great veneration, 
and who is distinguished as Saint Donan. The leading valley, 
and most important part of the parish, is, however, as frequently 
called Strath Helmsdale, {disregarding the tautology of Strath and 
Dale, as it is called the Strath of Kildonan ; but in Gaelic it is 
alone known by the name of Stra' High, while the river is called 
Aven-Iliffh,—a.nA the village of Helmsdale, at the mouth of the 
river, Bun-Iligh—i\\e root or lower end of the High. All this 
strengthens the belief that the river Helmsdale is the " Ilius flu- 
men," or river Hie of Ptolemy, who places that river on the present 
east coast of Sutherland, and close to « Veruhiim promontorium;' 
which is unquestionably the Ord of Caithness. The name Ihe is 
therefore older than that of Helmsdale, which must have been in- 
troduced, long subsequent to the time of Agricola, by the north- 
men, whose inroads and adventures on the coasts of Sutherland 
and Caithness, daring the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, 
are so often narrated in the northern Sagas, and historically ar- 
ranged by Torfseus. Kildonan, again, is believed to have origi- 
nated after the settlement of Christian missionaries in the north of 
Scotland, and is, therefore, in all probability, of more recent origin 
than the name Helmsdale. . 

Extent, Boundaries, and Topographical Appearances.~T\m pa- 
rish is altogether inland. It may be said to be divided by a great 
leading strath, into which other less important straths or mountain 
passes°open; and, accordingly, the former account of the parish 
states, that « it resembles the form of a tree, stretching out at the 
top or height of the parish into branches." This is so far appb- 
cable, that the great and leading strath of Kildonan or Helmsdale, 
below the church, being in the centre of the narrowest and lowest 
corner of the parish, may be compared to the trunk of the tree, 
and the smaller straths or glens, called Tilny, Free, and Achnahow, 
opening into it at obtuse angles on the west side, and those of buis- 
eiU and Kinbrace on the east side, may not inaptly be considered 
as the side-branches. Kildonan is bounded on the east by part of 
the county of Caithness, having the picturesque and towering 

Cella, a chapel or cellar.

peaks of the Morven Hills, not far distant from the boundary in 
that direction. The north boundary of the parish of Loth, run- 
ning from the top of the ridge terminating in the Ord of Caithness, 
to the westward, and along the elevated summits of Ben-vallich, 
and the high range of hills to Craigaboddich, intervenes between 
Kildonan as its southern line of march, and the German Ocean, to 
which the nearest point of the parish is distant about two miles. On 
the west, the line of mountain tops from Craigaboddich, along the 
centre of the high table-land at the head of Skinsdale, to the great 
mountain Ben-Ormin, and thence to Cromolt, near the head of 
Strathnaver, separate Kildonan from the parishes of Clyne and 
Farr ; and on the north, an irregular march crossing the great 
Ballach between the valleys of Strathnaver and Kildonan, and 
thence going over the top of Ben Griam-beg, and the highest part 
of Knockfin, to the county of Caithness, divides the parish from 
part of Farr, and the southern part of the parish of Reay. The 
extreme length of the parish, either from Cromolt or the Balloch 
near Ben Griam, to the top of the Ord of Caithness, is fully 24 
miles, in a direct line. The breadth varies considerably, being 
towards the south end of the parish from 5 to 10 miles, and to- 
wards the north end from 12 to 17 miles, in straight lines. The 
northern division of the parish is all elevated ground, and exposed 
to the unbroken sweep of every blast and storm that rage amidst 
the highest mountains of Sutherland and Caithness. The general 
aspect of this part of the parish is characterized by several high 
and massy mountains; some elevated table-land, of considerable ex- 
tent, thickly covered with heather and alpine plants ; and several 
lakes, of which four are of a large size ; but their shores and the 
country immediately surrounding them being in general tame, 
the expanse of their waters cannot be said to afford those enchant- 
ing and remarkable views for which other lakes in the Highlands, 
encircled by a wild variety of precipitous crags, towering pinnacles, 
and verdant glades, are so justly celebrated. The southern part 
of the parish may be said to consist of two .parallel ranges of 
mountains, between which lies the very beautiful valley of Helms- 
dale or Kildonan. This valley, which extends throughout the 
whole length of the parish, varies in breadth from one and-a-half 
to three miles, between the bases of the steep sides of the strath. 
The river Helmsdale, a large and very handsome stream, which 
may be classed among the second rate rivers of Scotland, occupies 
the centre of the valley, and rolls down, with many graceful

curves in its course, amidst holms and haughs of the brightest 
verdure, and occasionally through birch- covered plats that partially 
conceal some of the bends and reaches of the stream, until it enters 
the German Ocean, at the thriving fishing village of Helmsdale, 
which is situate in the adjoining parish of Loth. The highest 
mountains are at the boundaries of the adjoining parishes, and 
Ben Griam-more, one of these mountains, is nearly 2000 feet high. 
All the other lofty hills are deeply indented by headlong torrents, 
which often transversely cut the highest ranges of the hills almost 
down to their bases, and thus form many wild chasms, and great 
and abrupt inequalities of the surface. A great proportion, how- 
ever, of the uplands is superior and safe pasture ground, with occa- 
sional large tracts of moss ; and the soil of the haughs, along the 
lower parts of the river Helmsdale, is formed of deposits of mossy 
earth, mixed with particles of decomposed conglomerate rock and 
sand. 

ikfefeoroZo/.— Notwithstanding the inland situation and moun- 
tainous character of this parish, the climate in the valley of Kil- 
donan does not vary much from that of the coast-lying parishes ot 
Sutherland ; but the extremes of cold and heat are perhaps greater 
than along the sea coast. In winter, the high parts of Kildonan 
are often visited with snow, when rain alone falls in the less inland 
districts ; and when there is a general and great fall of snow, it is 
heavier, and lies longer in the interior than on the coast. I he 
winterltorms are also of greater violence on the exposed high 
grounds, and are there generally most tempestuous and severe. 
Frost appears early in autumn, even in the sheltered strati, and 
frequently, at that period of the year, the dawn of day, which is 
accompanied by, and discloses a slight hoar frost, formed duung 
the night-time, is followed by a brilliant meridian sun, which is op- 
pressive by its heat. The east wind is the coldest, and wi h t 
L heaviest falls of rain occur. Of late y--'/ J  
or - the merry dancers," as the meteor is called here has been 
unusually frequent, chiefly from the month of July to January 
It is often seen moving in upright lummous lines from wes o 
east which, when they attain their greatest brilliancy, suddenly 
become dim, and, as if formed of revolving columns, with alter- 
na e bright Ld dark sides, these shining lines again suddenly ap- 
; r witi an irregular glimmer, which increases in 
ness until it becomes a light of great splendour. - This alternate 
Jading and reappearing of these coruscations continues until what

appear to be the revolving coliimns, disappear in the eastern ho- 
rizon, under the earth's shade. 

This parish is particularly healthy, and there are no distem- 
pers which can be said to be prevalent among the inhabitants. 
Rheumatic pains sometimes affect aged people ; but these pro- 
bably arise from sudden changes from heat to cold, and from 
inattention to the due regulation of their clothing in the win- 
ter season. Fevers have been of late years unknown ; and in 
183"2, when malignant cholera raged at Helmsdale, at the foot 
of the strath, and within nine miles of the church of Kildonan, 
no case of that mysterious and fatal disease occurred in the pa- 
rish. Consumption, ague, and cutaneous eruptions are all un- 
known. Apothecaries' drugs are almost never called for; and the 
inhabitants generally, having a sufficiency of substantial food, com- 
fortable dwelling-houses, and being of temperate and active habits, 
enjoy uninterrupted health, and a buoyancy of spirits which gives 
promise of long life. " . ■ 

Hydrography . — The river Helmsdale or Hie is the leading 
stream in the parish, through which it runs a course of upwards of 
twenty miles. It receives its waters from some lakes in the upper 
parts of the parish, and from many mountain-streams and torrents 
which swell its stream in all parts of its course. After leaving 
this parish, the river has a run of more than two miles in the pa- 
rish of Loth, until it enters the sea at Helmsdale, where its mouth 
forms the harbour of that village. The upper district of Kildonan 
is remarkable for the number and size of its lakes. Locli-na-cuen 
is one of the largest of them, and is ornamented with two or three 
small islands, and several winding bays. It has char and other 
varieties of trout, but is considered rather an indifferent angling 
lake. Loch-leam-na-clavan lies between the two mountains, Ben 
Griam-more and Ben Griam-beg, and has trout of different va- 
rieties, of the largest size of any lake in the district. There are . 
also a great many char in its waters, but they are of a small size. 
This is an excellent angling lake, particularly with a south wind. 
Loch Badanloch and Lochinruar are also large lakes, and abound 
in trout and char. Loch-ari-cUny, Loch-ascaig, Locliun-gunuh, 
Loch-allan-fearn, Loch-cor-na-maugh, Loch-na-moin, Loch-na- 
clar, Loch Trudemcaig, Loch Cuillie, and Loch Leiven, are all 
likewise in the upper parts of the parish, and all abound with 
trout, and many of them with char; but it is somewhat remarka- 
ble that pike have never been found in any of these lakes, nor, in- 
deed, in any of the numerous waters in the county of Sutherland.

Mineral springs rise in many parts of the parish ; but it is believ- 
ed that they are all chalybeate. There is one of superior quah y 
at Achnamoin ; another near the manse ; one at Caen ; and one 

at the foot of Ben Uary. • u i, Wn

parish, but he is by no means a stationary animal, and wanders 
over wide tracts of country, from one stream to another. The 
polecat, the weasel, the mountain hare, and the mole are like- 
wise met with. Sheep of the Cheviot kind, which equal in 
the quality and weight of the fleece, and the value of the 
carcass, the Cheviot stocks from which they were originally ob- 
tained, occupy the whole pasture grounds of the parish ; and the 
shepherd's dog must not be omitted, for without this faithful and 
tractable animal, it would be impossible to conduct sheep-farming in 
the successful manner now done. The first of these dogs were 
obtained from the borders; but there is now a cross between them 
and the country coUey dog, which is more valuable than the pure 
breed, and excels the southern dog ia sagacity and hardiness. 
Birds of prey are numerous. The common eagle {Faico albicil- 
la, the raven {Corvus corax, the hooded-crow Corvus comix, 
and some species of the hawk abound. The hills of Kildonan 
have ever been celebrated as among the best grouse ranges in the 
north. The strath is well stocked with black-cock, and the tops 
of the highest mountains with ptarmigan. The river Helmsdale 
has a valuable salmon-fishery, which is fished under the direct con- 
trol of the lf\ndlord, in a manner the best calculated, in all respects, 
to protect the spawning fish and the smolts, and which it is expect- 
ed will elicit, beyond doubt, the success of the liberal system had 
recourse to, over the former close and severe mode of fishing. 
The lakes, already referred to, abound in trout and char; and 
lamprey eels are said to ascend the river Helmsdale about the 
month of June, The fresh water muscle {Mytilus anatinus is 
also found in the bed of the river Helmsdale. 

Botany.— The diversity of soil, and the different degrees of al- 
titude and shelter which this parish afi'ords, cover its surface with 
a great variety of plants ; but these are all, with few exceptions, 
common to similar localities throughout the Highlands. The 
haughs and low parts of the strath are verdant with succulent 
herbs and the finer varieties of grasses ; and here the birch, the 
mountam ash, the hazel, aspen, and white willow, ornament the 
banks of the river, and some of the sloping sides of the hills. The 
mosses have their peculiar plants, of which the cotton grass {Erio- 
phorum is the most conspicuous and most valuable. The exten- 
sive mountain sides are chiefly covered with heather and ling ; and 
the few rare plants which have been observed are among the Al- 
lme tribe on the highest hills, of which Arbutus alpina, and the 
cloudberry, fRubus cliamcBmorus,  are the most abundant. A

great part of the parish was at a remote period covered with forests 
of stately pines, which have all perished without any contemporary 
account existing of the cause or manner of their destruction. Con- 
sequently, conflicting causes have been assigned lor the total ab- 
sence of the native fir in this part of the Highlands ; but the ge- 
nerallv received belief is, that the old trees died from natural decay 
when at maturity, their trunks being still dug out of the bogs in 
great numbers; and that from the decomposition of their leaves 
tnd branches originated the growth of moss, Avhich has now com- 
pletely altered the surface soil, and rendered it unfit for the growth 
of the pine tribe. 

n.— Civil Histohy. 
Some of the events and localities mentioned in the northern 
Sagas and in the Orcades of Torfeeus are supposed, from an at- 
tentive examination of the narratives, to apply to this parish. 
There exists ample evidence, that after the final departure of the 
northern invaders, the whole of this parish was part of the ancient 
earldom of Sutherland ; and consequently, the annals of that po- 
tent family embrace the subsequent historical events in the parish 
several of which are described in Sir Robert Gordon s History of 
the Earls of Sutherland. The charter-room of Dunrobm Castle, 
-which is believed to have the most complete series of title-deeds 
and other invaluable muniments, from the thirteenth century to the 
present time, of any private charter-chest in Scotland,-contams 
written evidences, the most authentic, of the general correctness 
of that remarkable local history, in regard to the state of po - 
session of the lands in the parish at different periods, and simd. i 
fts. In the sixteenth century, the chiefs and a great body of the 
clan Gun settled in this parish, which, since then, until a late pe- 
od, has been their chief place of residence ; and, as no connec ed 
account of them has ever been written, the following origw - 
tice of the clan Gun, prepared with great care from the only a 
hentic sources relating to them that now exist is here give 
as condensed a form'as the matter would admit of,-in oide. to 
suit the prescribed limits of this parish report. 

ne Clan G«..-The clan Gun have at all times been consi- 
dered throughout the North Highlands as descended from the 
Norwee an Kings of Man ; and Lochlin, the Gaelic name for an-

-to the Chronicle of Man, published with Camden's Britannia in 
1586, Godred or Godfred, surnamed Crovan, and son of Harold 
the Black, of the royal family of Norway, was the first King of 
Man, and his sovereignty appears to have extended over a large 
portion, if not the whole, of the Western Isles. His reign is sup- 
posed to have commenced about the year 1077. The fifth King 
of Man, from Godfred the first King, and descended from him, 
was Okve, who, succeeding his father when very young, was de- 
prived of his kingdom by a natural brother named Reginald, and 
had the Island of Lewis assigned to him. After severe and pro- 
tracted struggles, Olave succeeded in recovering his kingdom, 
and died King of Man in Peel Castle, 18th June T237. He 
had been thrice married, and by his third wife, Christina, daughter 
of Farquhar Earl of Ross, King Olave had three sons: 1. Guin 
or Gun, the ancestor of the clan Gun ; 2. Leoid, Loyd, or Leod, 
from whom are descended the Macleods ; and 3. Leaundris, 
from whom were the clan Landers, or Gillanders of Ross-shire,' — 
but many of this last clan afterwards assumed the name of Ross. 
At this period, the Earls of Ross were very powerful in the north 
of Scotland ; and, besides being masters of the present district of 
Ross, they held extensive tracts of country in several parts of the 
west coast, and along the Caithness shores. The three grand- 
children above-named, of Farquhar Earl of Ross, appear to have 
been provided for by that petent earl about the middle of the 
thirteenth century ; — Guin or Gun having Jjeen settled in Caith- 
ness, where the Earl's authority at that period was considerable. 
Leod obtained Glenelg from him, and by marriage with the 
daughter of a Danish knight, Macraild Armine, also obtained 
Miginish, Bracadale, Durinish, Dunvegan, Lindell, Vaterness, 
and part of Troterness, in the Isle of Sky; while Leander settled 
in the midst of his grandfather's territories in Ross. 

The particular lands in Caithness which were originally acquired 
by the clan Gun cannot, at this distant period of time, be satis- 
factorily traced ; but the earliest castle or stronghold of their 
chief in that quarter, was the Castle of Halbury, at Easter Clythe, 
or as it is often called Crowner Gun's Castle, which, like almost 
all the other old castles in Caithness, was situate on a precipitous 
and nearly detached rock, overhanging the sea, and, except at 
one side, surrounded by it. 

The clan Gun continued to extend and occupy their possessions 
HI Caithness, until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when, 
in consequence of their deadly feuds with the Keiths of Caithness,

who had obtained a settlement in that county, by the marriage 
of one of the Keiths with Marion Cheyne, a Caithness heiress, 
in the fourteenth centm-y and other neighbouring clans, the Guns 
found it necessary to establish their chief, and a strong detachment 
of the clan, in the adjoining county of Sutherland, where they 
obtained the protection of the Earls of Sutherland, and from them 
got possession of several lands in the parish of Kildonan and else- 
where. The history of the clan during these early centuries, as 
collected from tradition, and partly borne out by detached narra- 
tives in Sir Robert Gordon's history, is replete with incidents, 
which, in the present age, have more of the character of wdd ro- 
mance than of reality, and exhibits, in many startling details, the 
ferocity and implacable fury which distinguished the feuds of the 
clans in the remote Highlands, even down to near the close of 
the seventeenth century. This report does not admit of length- 
ened narratives of these ancient feuds ; but one instance may be 
given of the desperate manner in which they were conducted, by 
very briefly narrating the best traditional account that has been 
obtained of the following bloody and treacherous rencounter be- 
tween the Keifhs and the Guns. The meeting of the parties, 
and the slaughter of the Guns, are, by Sir Robert Gordon, stated 
to have taken place in St Tyrs Chapel,— an old religious edifice 
on the sea coast of Caithness, and on the walls of which he says 
the blood of the slain might be seen in his time ;— but the tradi- 
tion of the Highlands says that this perfidious affair occurred la 
the interior of the country, and in the open air, in Strathmore of 

Caithness. . i /-.i 

Towards the end of the fifteenth century, the chief of the Clan- 
Gun was George Gun, who lived in feudal dignity in his then im- 
pregnable castle of Halbury ; but he was better known as the 
Crowner Gun, or, as he was called by the Highlanders,—" N'm 
Braistach-more," from a great broach which he wore as the badge 
or cognizance of his office of crowner. He had a deadly feud 
with the chief of the 'Keiths, and having met in St Tyre's chapel 
for thepurpose of effecting a reconciliation, but without success, they 
there solemnly agreed to decide their quarrel, if they could not do 
so amicably on a future day, by equal combat between twelve sons

or relatives of each cbieftaiii. This compact was concluded by 
mutual vows, accompanied with religious rites within the chapel, 
that the meeting would take place in a solitary part of the country, 
where no interruption could occur, and the escort of each leader 
was fixed at twelve armed horsemen. The crowner had been twice 
married, and had a numerous family of sons ; but some of them 
resided in Sutherland, and it was also agreed that he should form 
his. party there, and proceed into Caithness with them by the 
Strathmore route, while the Keiths would move, on the appomt- 
ed day, towards the confines of Sutherland, and in the same di- 
rection ; so that the two parties would meet in a retired dis- 
trict, remote from any chance of being disturbed. The chiefs, 
each followed by twelve horses and their riders, came within sight 
of each other on the appointed route, and soon thereafter met at 
a burn called Alt-na-gawn, below the glut of Strathmore. The 
crowner and the leader of the Keiths approached each other in full 
armour ; but it was soon discovered by the Guns, that there were 
two riders on every horse in the party of the Keiths, and consequent- 
ly the latter party had twenty-four men opposed to the twelve fol- 
lowers of the crowner. This vile stratagem instantly revealed to 
the Guns that their destruction, by unfair means, was determined 
upon. They scorned, notwithstanding the great odds against them, 
to retreat before their enemies the Keiths ; and both parties dis- 
mounting, the huge double-handed sword, and other formidable 
weapons of the period used in close combat, were furiously and 
destructively wielded, amidst horrid imprecations, and remorseless 
vows of each clan's never-dying vengeance, which raised to mad- 
ness the rage of the combatants. 

The Guns fought most desperately, but could not withstand 
the great odds that opposed them ; and after a long continu- 
ed struggle, the survivors on both sides were so much exhaust- 
ed, that the combat was mutually dropt, — the Keiths being 
so far the victors as to leave the field with their banner display- 
ed, and to be able to carry with them their slain companions; 
while in the ranks of the Guns, the crowner and seven of his party 
were killed, and the remaining five were all severely wounded. 
The Keiths proceeded to Dilred Castle, in Strathmore, then oc- 
cupied by Sutherland of Dilred, where they were hospitably en- 
tertained. The five surviving Guns, who were all sons of the 
crowner, also retired, but tarried at another stream, since then call- 
ed Alt-Torquil, after Torquil Gun, one of the survivors, who there 
dressed the wounds of his brothers. Towards evening, Henry- 



144 SUTIIKIILANDSHIRE. 

hes, the youngest of the surviving brothers of the Guns, proposed 
thatthey should follow the Keiths, and endeavour to obtain revenge, 
even by stratagem such as the Keiths had recourse to; but his 
brothers considered such a step as leading to their certain destruc- 
tion. Henry, however, could not be restrained from his purpose, 
and swore that he never would rest until he should kill a Keith 
and recover possession of his father's sword, helmet, shir of mail 
and broach of office, which the Keiths had taken off the dead 
body of the crowner. Two of the brothers were so severely 
wounded that they could not move to any great distance, but the 
other two accompanied Henry, who arrived at Dilred Castle soon 
after nightfall. On approaching the castle, its wooden windows 
or shutters were found open, and around a large fire in the low- 
est apartment, the survivors of the Keiths were quaffing bumpers 
of ale, and Henry, -ho went close to one of the windows, heard 
them narrate, with boisterous delight, the losses sustained by the 
Guns The chief of the Keiths, not apprehensive of any danger, 
accidentally approached the window where Henry stood, and the 
latter then bent his bow, and in another instant his arrow pierced 
the chieftain's heart; Henry at the same time boldly accompany- 
inP- the deadly flight of his arrow with the exclamation afterwards 
us'ed t North Highlands as a proverb of ; The Gun's com- 
pliments to Keith."  The old chief dropped down dead ; a panic 
Lized the oth.r Keiths; and the three Guns having darted for- 
ward to the door of the castle, slew some of the first persons who 
ventured out by it C but finding that they could not retain tlveir po- 
sition Ion., Henry and his two brothers retired silently unde co- 
of the°darkneJs of the night, and hurried back to the ass.tance 
of the other brothers, who had been unable to accomiany them 

The crowner, t thus killed by the Keith, was, according to Sir 
Robert Gordon " a great commander in Catteynes in his tyme, 
fnd w s ne of the greatest men in that countrey ; because when 
he flourished there was no Earle ofl" Catteynes ; tl-t- dom being

ler, the second son of William, Earl of Orkney, by his second 
wife : which William, Earl of Catteynes, wes slain at Flowden."  
The Earldom of Caithness, at the period here referred to, may be 
said to have been, in one respect, in the King's hands '; for although, 
after the termination of the Norwegian line of Earls of Orkney 
and Caithness in 1331, the Earl of Strathern was also Earl of ' 
Caithness for a short time ; the succeeding Earls of the Sinclair 
family claimed the Caithness title, while they also held the Earl- 
dom of Orkney under the kings of Denmark, and their allegiance 
to a foreign power divested them of their privileges as Earls of 
Caithness under the Crown of Scotland. This state of matters, no 
doubt, occasioned the establishment of a crownership in Caithness, 
which office was vfested in the person of the chief of the Guns, who 
was afterwards killed by the Keiths. 

Five of the crowner's sons survived him. The eldest, James, 
from whom the patronymic of MacKeamish, the son of Jamesj 
is derived, which distinguished his son and all the subsequent 
chiefs of the clan, succeeded his father, and resided in Sutherland, 
as all his successors have done, their principal dwelling-house hav- 
ing been at Killernan, in the parish of Kildonan, until it was de- 
stroyed accidentally by fire, about the year 1690. From one of 
the sons of the crewner, named William, are descended the Wil- 
sons of Caithness, and from Henry, the Hendersons. Another 
son, Robert, who was killed with his father, left issue, and from 
them were the Gun Robsons, who afterwards appear In the annals 
of Caithness, and from the issue of another son, John, also killed 
by the Keiths, were the Guns M'Eans of Caithness. 

It was in the time of this crowner Gun that Hugh Macdonald 
of Sleat, third son of Alexander Earl of Ross, married a lady of 
the clan Gun, who is supposed to have been the crowner's daugh- 
ter. By this lady, Macdonald of Sleatf " had a son, Donald, 
called Gallach, from being fostered J by his mother's relations in 

 Sir Robert Gordon's History, page 92. 

■j" Gregory's Western Highlands and Isles, page 60. 

J The JihiUr'iiig of the children of great families in remote but comparatively se- 
cure iarts of the interior of the Highlands, was a very common practice in the north 
of Scotland, down to the beginning of the last century ; and the alliance or aliection- 
ate tie thus formed  ften proved to be sironger than that flowing from blood-relation- 
ship. Sir 11. Gordon refers to this result in another ease of fostering among the elan 
Gunn. He says, " In the moneth of Ueceniber, 1022 yeirs, SSir John Sinclair of 
Greinland and Hatter, the ICarle of Catteynes, his brother, died in Catteynes. He 
wiis a great fivourer of the Clan-Gun, with whom he had been fostered and bred in 
his infancie, which is accompted the strictest poynt of amilie and friendship among

Caithness, who afterwards became the heir of the family, and from 
whom the present Lord Macdonald is descended." 

James Gun was succeeded as chieftain by his son William, 
with whom originated the patronymic of Macheamisli, i. e. the son 
of James. William, the first Mackeamish, signalized himself in 
several conflicts in the north, and his fame as a successful and 
brave leader of his clan, has been celebrated in some Gaelic verses 
and songs still existing. Alexander Gun of Killernan was the se- 
cond, and his son William Gun, the third Mackeamish. John 
Gun of Killernan and Navidale was the fourth, and Alexander 
Gun, also of the same designation, was the fifth Mackeamish. 
This last chief had two sons, Donald and George, and was suc- 
ceeded bv his eldest son Donald, who was the sixth Mackeamish. 
Alexander Gun, the son of Donald, was the seventh, and Alex- 
ander's son, William Gun, the eighth Mackeamish ; but this last 
chief, who was an officer in the army, being killed in action m 
India, without leaving issue, and the other male descendants ot 
Donald, the sixth Mackeamish, being extinct, the chieftainship de- 
volved on the now deceased Hector Gunn, the great-grandson of 
George, the second son of Alexander, the fifth Mackeamish, to 
whom he was served as nearest male heir on 31st May 1803 ; 
and George Gunn, Esq., Rhives, in Sutherland, the only son of 
the said Hector Gunn, is now the chief of the clan Gunn, and the 

tenth Mackeamish.

many barrows or tumuli scattered over the parish ; and in one not 
for from the manse, which was opened by workmen in search of gra- 
vel, a coffin formed of plain flags was discovered, in which were 
mouldering human bones. One of these tumuli, in the shape of a 
well-proportioned cone, and called Knock' nreachy, is situate close 
to the manse, and also an upright stone called Clack- na-heudh. 
III. — Population. 

In the year 1801, . 1440 
1811, . 1574 
1821, . 565 
1831, . 257 

The decrease is accounted for by the change that occurred in the 
rural economy of the parish, by the substitution of Cheviot sheep 
for Highland cattle, between the years 181 1 and 1821. The sys- 
tem of small holdings and subletting, previously common in the 
parish, was thereby altered ; and no part of the parish being adapt- 
ed for new settlements, the bulk of the population was settled in 
the coast-side parishes ; and, in particular, they resorted to the 
village of Helmsdale and its neighbourhood, which is within two 
miles of the southern boundary of the parish, forming part of the 
same district of country, and where the increase of the population 
far exceeds the decrease in the interior. 

IV. — Industry. 
Almost the whole of the parish is occupied as sheep farms. 
The number of sheep grazed, all of the Cheviot breed, is esti- 
mated at 18,000 head, and they are divided among six tenants of 
separate farms. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Helmsdale is the nearest town, distant two miles from the south 
boundary of the parish, and nine miles from the manse and church. 
There is a good road leading from Helmsdale, along the whole 
extent of the strath, to Bighouse and Melvich, on the north coast ;. 
and another road from within one mile of the manse, running: 
southward across the Crask ; a stormy and elevated hill dividing- 
the strath from the head of Glen Loth, until it joins the parlia- 
mentary road on the east coast of the county at Loth-beg. 

has not yet seen ; anil he is inclined to think, that a complete inspection of the whole- 
of them, and accurate details of each tower, so far as their ruinous condition will ad- 
mit of, including not only their size, and interior arrangements, and their situation 
ui regard to marked localities, and tlieir vicinity in some cases to each other ; but also 
every deviation from any part of their peculiar, and generally uniform construction, 
would, in some degree, remove the obscurity that at present attends the contempla- 
tion of these interesting relics of the oldest stone buildings in our native land, and 
which, when complete, must have exhibited, in singular combinalion, the ingenuity 
of design, and laborious industry of a people somewhat advanced in the ai ts ofcivili- 
Siition, with the rudeness of workmanship peculiar to savage life.

Ecclesiastical State.— By Bishop Gilbert Murray's charier, ii- 
ter 1-222 and 1245, reconstituting the chapter of the bishopric of 
Caithness, which included the whole county of Sutherland, the 
chapter consisted of nine canons, of whom five were dignitaries. 
The Abbot of Scone was appointed one of the abbots, and had the 
church of " Keldurunach" assigned to him, under the provision, 
that when absent, he would have another to minister for him. 
The Abbots of Scone continued in charge of this church until the 
Reformation ; and the foundation of " Tea'n Abb," or the Ab- 
bott's House is still seen to the west of the manse, while the fi- 
gure of a human head, rudely carved in stone, and called the Jb- 
bofs Head, is preserved in the garden wall of the manse. The 
patronage of the parish has, since the Reformation, been vested 
in the Sutherland family. The extent of the glebe is between 13 
and 14 acres, and the minister has besides the grazing of 60 sheep. 
The former stipend of 40 bolls of victual is now converted, and 
paid bv the heritor with the former money stipend of L. 30, 10s. 
Id. ; and there is also an addition of L. 70 from Exchequer. The 
manse is in good repair, and the church is suitable for the congre- 
gation ; the whole inhabitants of the parish being of the church of 
Scotland. 

Education.— The parish school is situate near the manse, but, 
owing to the great extent of the parish, many fVimilies are prevent- 
ed from sending their children to it. Several private teachers, 
however, are employed, and exclusively paid by the inhabitants ; 
and the parental duty of providing for the education of youth ap- 
pears, in this parish, to acquire strength in proportion to the diffi- 
culties to be overcome in exercising it. The amount of the pa- 
rochial schoolmaster's salary is the minimum. 

Poor.— The few indigent persons in this parish are treated with 
kindness by their more independent and fortunate neighbours ; 
and the easy access they all have to fuel, and the non-exactment 
of rent for their small houses, make the moderate allowances from 
.the poor funds which they receive of far more value to them, than 
the same sums would be in more densely inhabited parishes. 
These funds are derived from Sunday collections, and an annual 
donation from the Sutherland family. The average number of 
poor of all classes for the years 1835, 1836, and 1837, is 42; 
average amount of church collections during these years, L.9 ; 
averaa-e amount of mortifications, &amp;c. during these years, L.4.

PRESBYTEUY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. GEORGE MACKAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The etymology of the name of this parish is not cor- 
rectly known ; and though there are various conjectures on this 
point, not one of them seems in any degree satisfactory. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The figure of the parish is irregular ; 
in length it extends from the east coast of the county into the in- 
terior to the summit of Ben Ormin, a distance of about 24 miles 
from south-east to north-west; its breadth on the coast side is 
4 miles, and varies from 6 to 8 miles inland. It is bounded on 
the south-west by the parish of Golspie ; on the west by Rogart ; 
on the north by Kildonan ; on the north-east by Loth, and on the 
south-east by the German ocean. 

Topographical Appearances. — The interior is in many parts 
very picturesque, being distinguished from the more tame scenery 
along the coast, by a variety of mountains, glens, and lakes, and 
adorned by natural and planted woods. The prospect is much ad- 
mired, when entering the glen at Killean. The Carrol Rock, an 
abrupt precipice overhanging Loch Brora, — Ben Clibrig, Ben Or- 
min, and Ben Horn, at once break on the view, which, with the 
reflection in the lake of the rock of Carrol, and the sloping sides 
of the hills covered with plantations and natural woods, present a 
singular and magnificent panorama. 

About nine miles from th coast. Strath Brora divides into two 
valleys of a still more upland character, at a place called Ascoile. 
The one to the left is skirted with many clumps and a few exten- 
sive ranges of natural wood ; and the other valley, or rather glen, 
to the north is wild and deep. At this point also, the parish assumes 
a more sterile and Highland aspect, being of a bleak and heathy 
character, with extensive ranges of moors and moss, intersected by 

Drawn up by George Guiin, Esq.. of Uliivcs. 



160 SUTHERLANDSHIUl';. 

numerous small rivulets; and still more inland, several lofty hills, 
forming part of the high and stormy centre range of Sutherland 
mountains, mark the boundaries of the parish to the west and 
north. Greatly different from this elevated district, the low grounds 
of the parish along the sea-coast contain well-cultivated farms, sur- 
rounded by several townships occupied by small tenants, and com- 
posed of neat stone cottages,— these farms connected together by 
excellent and well kept roads, which intersect the cultivated parts 
of the parish in all directions. The elevation of two of the highest 
mountains above the level of the sea, as ascertained by measure- 
ment, is as follows, -Ben Ormin 2306 feet; Ben Horn 1712 feet. 

The only cave deserving notice is a small one of peculiar con- 
struction above the Bridge of Brora ; it seems to have been form- 
ed by the action of the water on a soft portion of the rock, before 
the river became imbedded in its present low level. 

The coast is low and sandy, and has a breadth of sand hills ex- 
tending about a quarter of a mile from the shore, and covered with 
bent, and where not broken, with rich pasture. This sandy belt 
is succeeded by the arable land occupied by the lotters or small 
tenants, and the fine farms of Inver Brora and Clynehsli ; and be- 
hind them are the hills of the interior division. 

Temperature.- k\oxQ the sea coast, the weather is the same as 
in the neighbouring parishes, with the exception, perhaps, of the 
parish of Golspie, which is better sheltered by plantations, and not 
so exposed to storms from the mountains in the centre of the 
county as the low grounds of this parish are, when the wind b ows 
down the opening of Strath Brora. The north-west gales blow 
with great force down this strath, the high hills on each side form- 
ing a natural funnel, and the blasts spread along the low grounds, 
oLu causing much injury to the crop, The soil being o a 
light, sharp, gravelly quality, occasional long droughts materia ly 
affect vegetation ; but it revives rapidly on being refreshed by the 
copious showers, which seldom fail to come in time to save ,t 

The climate may be considered on the whole excellent, of which 
the healthy appearance and the longevity of the people furnish the 
best demonstration. The prevailing winds are east or north-east 
west or south-west. The east wind is sometimes damp, cold, and 
nenetrating, and the west wind excessively violent. 

Mw.p.-Loch Brora is the principal sheet of water in 
the mrisii. It is about four miles long, and varies from a quarter 
to half-a-mile in breadth, being contracted at two points, and has 



CLYNE.

the appearance of three lakes when seen from a short distance. 
Extensive fir plantations on each side, with the bold precipitous 
Carrol rock, and the mansion-house and offices of Kilcalmkill, form 
a beautiful and interesting scene in fine weather. 

There is a small island near the lower end of Loch Brora, of 
which Sir Robert Gordon says, in his History of the Earldom of 
Sutherland, that " the Erie of Southerland hes a delectable ha- 
bitation, and pleasant for hunting of red-deer and roes in the 
woods on both sides of the loch. This island is distant thrie or four 
myles from the burgh of Broray." 

Among the smaller lakes, Loch Tubernach, north of Clyne 
church, and the source of the Clyne Milton Burn, was, at one 
time, famous for large trout of superior flavour ; but they have fallen 
off in quality, of late years. 

The river Brora has its source in the forest of Ben Clibrig, and, 
passing through a part of Rogart, it enters this parish about two 
miles above Sciberscross, and joins the Black Water a mile below 
that place. This latter river rises in Ben Ormin, and runs through 
a long extent of deep moors, which give a dark tinge to the water, 
and from which it no doubt derives its name. It receives several 
tributaries in its course, and runs down a deep rocky channel for 
about five miles before its junction with the Brora, when the 
united streams flow through rich meadows for half-a-mile, and 
fall into Loch Brora. 

There is a cascade on the Black Water, near Balnakyle, very- 
magnificent when the river is in flood ; and another still more strik- 
ing and romantic at Kilcalmkill, which is visited by most tourists ; 
also a cascade well worthy of notice on a small burn near the 
manse of Clyne, where the water falls into a deep ravine over a 
rock sixty feet high. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Sir Humphry Davy, when he visit- 
ed this county in 1812, left a manuscript at Dunrobin Castle, de- 
scribing the mineral productions of part of Sutherland, wherein he 
stated, with reference to this parish, " that the secondary rocks 
occupy but a small space, and are probably incumbent on the red 
sandstone or breccia ; that they occur in regular strata, but their 
arrangement is very much disturbed. They appear to have been 
originally deposited or formed parallel to the horizon ; but in most 
places, this parallelism has been disturbed either by the subsidence 
or elevation of parts of the strata, so that there are frequent faults 
or abruptions of the different rocks, which have given to the diffe- 
rent parts of the strata different inclinations. 



152 SUTHEItLANDSHIUE. 

« The true secondary strata of Sutherland occupy an extent of 
six or seven miles, filling, up a sort of basin between the transition 
hills in the neighbourhood of Dunrobin, and those in' the parish 
of Loth. The upper stratum is a sandstone of different degrees 
of hardness, and composed of silicious sand, cemented by silicious 
matter. Below this, occurs an aluminous shale, containing pyn- 
to'us matter, carbonaceous matter, the remains of marine animals, 
and of land vegetables. Beneath this shale, or rather alternatmg 
with it, a stratum occurs, containing, in some of its parts, calcare- 
ous matter, and passing into limestone; but in general coiis.stmg 
of a silicious sand, agglutinated by calcareous cement The coal 
measures occupy the lowest part of this secondary district which 
has been explored." 

Coal had been worked near the mouth of the Biver Brora so 
far back as 1573, in the time of Lady Jane Gordon, Countess of 
Sutherland, and at various subsequent periods; but that work 
was abandoned many years ago. The late Duke of Sutherland, 
with the munificence which characterized all his improvements, 
expended L. 16,000 in sinking a new pit, and for the necessary 
•buildings, on the north side of the river half a mile above the 
bridge, where a seam was found from 3 feet 2 inches to 3 feet 8 
inchesthick, atadepth of 250 feet frpm the surface. The coal was 
conveyed to the harbour on a railway 800 yards in length. Four 
large salt-pans were also erected, which cost L.3327, and the salt 
produced proved of very superior quality. .... 

Limestone is found in small detached portions in various places 
on the banks of the River Brora, from the harbour upwards It 
contains no magnesian earth, and is adulterated only with alumi- 
nous and silicious earths, and oxide of iron. A P-'" «f 
was examined bv Sir Humphry Davy, from a rock about 00 
vaL above the Weir: 20 grains contained 17.3 grams of carbo- 

"'Zooll-The animals of this parish are common to most other

land earth was frequently taken to other countries, under the im- 
pression of its efficacy in driving them from any place where the 
earth might be deposited. But a vessel being wrecked near Kin- 
tradwell about thirty years ago, dispelled the delusion, and intro- 
duced the Muscovy rat, which has since multipliecl, and spread in 
every direction. The red-deer have become very numerous since 
the plantations on the banks of Loch Brora have grown up to af- 
ford them cover and shelter. Some of these noble animals attain 
a great size, and are often seen congregated in herds. Lord 
Francis Egerton killed one of the stags at this place in 1838, 
which weighed upwards of eighteen stones Dutch weight; and it is 
believed that some of them are now much larger. The foxes and 
other animals of prey were at one time very destructive to stock ; 
but the farmers entered into an association and hired fox-hunters, 
by whose exertions they were nearly extirpated ; at least they were 
so much thinned, as not again to become very formidable. 

One hundred and fifty different kinds of birds frequent the pa~ 
rish, the most remarkable of which are, the white-tailed eagle, ring 
tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, buzzard, hawk, wild swan, wild 
goose, blackcock, grouse, ptarmigan. 

The fishes in Loch Brora are, salmon, grilse salmon trout, 
char, common trout. The salmon begin to ascend the river in 
condition to spawn about the middle of August; the grilse a fort- 
night later. They begin to spawn about the 1st of October, and 
descend as kelts or spent fish in February. The smelts go down 
in March, continuing to do so till the end of May. The grilses 
commence their ascent in May, varying it from the beginning till 
the end of the month, according as the season may be early or late. 

The fishes caught on the shores are, cod, ling, haddock, skate, 
turbot, halibut, flounder, whiting, mackerel, mullets, millers, gur- 
nards. The shell-fish are, lobsters, partons or crabs. 

IL — Civil Histouy. 

Sir Robert Gordon's Genealogical History of the Earldom of 
Sutherland, of which there is an old manuscript copy in the libra- 
ry at Dunrobin Castle, contains many notices of this parish, but 
chiefly descriptive of the ancient feuds and combats which used to 
distract the country at that period, and is too voluminous to be in- 
serted here.   

The chief historical event of importance which has taken place 
since the publication of the former report, is the change in the oc- 
cupation of the parish, by the removal of the small tenants from the

Go dons of Carrol, a highly respectable faidy connected with 
the Gordon branch of the Earls of Sutherland, was P-ha-j y

fortified with a ditch of circumvallation, every way inaccessible, but 
by a narrow neck of land between it and a neighbouring hill ; it 
contains about eight acres of land, and could be easily defended 
against any number of assailants." An ancient cemetery at Kil- 
calmkill, marks where the heroes of those days rest. The grave of 
the chief, in which large human bones were found, is yet distin- 
guished by four stones and a cover. Various tumuli lie scattered 
over the interior, marking their battle-grounds, and where the slain 
were buried ; but their names and their deeds have passed into 
oblivion. 

The next object of antiquity is an artificial island in Loch Bro- 
ra, already alluded to, and which has been correctly described as 
below, in a note to the former Report. 

1 1 1. — POPULATI ON. 

The population of the parish has varied little since the year 
1792, owing to the change which has taken place in the system 
of farming, the glens and interior being converted into sheep-walks ; 
the inhabitants being removed to the sea coast, and some of them 
having emigrated to North America, The coal-works com- 
menced in 1812, and caused a considerable increase of the popu- 
lation, which appeared by the census taken in 1821 ; and as they 
ceased to be worked in 1 828, the number decreased previous to 
the next census in 1831. 

By the census taken in 1792, the population was 1660 

1801, . . 1643 

1811, . . 1639 

1821, . . 1874 

1831, . . 1711 

1840, . . 1756 



  " The figure of the island is an oblong square, consisting of Iwo inferior squares of 
70 feet diameter. It was divided into two parts ; one-half appropriated for lodgings 
in tirne of war; the other half laid out for the advantage of a garden. Thi walls 
are still pretty high, and ascend perpendicularly from the surface of the water, without 
a vestige of the island behind them, and are only accessible by two stairs which front 
the scflith and e.ist ; so that with plenty of stores and the fishing of the loch, 
abounding with silmon, trout, and eel, the place was rendered impregnable when 
properly defended. Among many reports of the good purposes of this island, there is 
one traditionary story repeated with pleasure by the inhabitants to this day. They tell 
that, on a certain occasion, the neighbourhood was suddenly invaded by a numerous 
army of Caithness men, which they were not prepared to resist. Upon this occasion 
they fled to the island for an asylum, where they were secure from the assaults of the 
enemy. Upon this, the invaders were so enraged, that they attempted darning up 
the narrow mouth of the loch, at which the river breaks out, and had made such pro- 
gress in the work, that the islanders were obliged to take to their boats in the night 
tunc, to accomplish their escape ; but, being pursued, they would have all perished, 
had it not been for the seasonable assistance of the clan Gun, who had marched from 
Strathulie upon hearing of the danger of their countrymen. Tlie Caithness-men, in 
consequence of this assistance, met with a total defeat; and the part of the river or 
locli, at which they had been employed, retains to this day the name of Daman or 
Davan, which signifies a dam."

The language usually spoken among the labourmg classes ,s 
Gaelic ; but, owing to the more general mtercourse witlj the south 
country and the increase of education, it has certainly lost ground 
since th e date of the former report, and, as most of the young peo- 
ple now attend school and receive at least the rudiments 0 educa- 
tion, it bids fair to be altogether unknown at no very distant pe-

the interior and occupied a greater extent of land, they enjoy in 
general an abundant and varied supply at all seasons of the year. 
There is no family without some land, and few but keep one or 
more cows and a pig. Their lots of land supply potatoes, some 
meal, and other necessaries. The more industrious secure a store 
of herrings and other fish ; purchase some sheep or a cow, and kill 
a pig for winter food. Therefore, it may confidently be said, that, 
on the whole, they enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts and 
advantages of society ; and their cheerful industrious habits are the 
best criterion of their being contented with their situation and cir- 
cumstances. 

They have acquired, in common with the people of the country, 
a taste for evangelical preaching, and cherish a warm attachment 
towards the Established Church. No Dissenting preacher has 
attempted to gain a footing in the parish ; and it would be in vain, 
so long as the present able and zealous minister continues to pos- 
sess the confidence and affections of his people. There is neither 
a professed Dissenter nor Roman Catholic in the parish ; and, 
what may seem extraordinary, there is not one of the latter per- 
suasion among the natives of the county, in a population of 26,000 
souls. Though the country people are but little educated, they 
-will soon discover an error in doctrine, and can quote scripture in 
support of their arguments with surprising readiness and accuracy. 
They are not fanatical nor given to prejudice, if directed by a 
clergyman whom they respect ; and a mutual esteem and attach-  
ment is soon established betwixt the pastor and his flock, such as 
is described in the early and purer days of our church. 

The poor here are more numerous in proportion to the popula- 
tion than in the adjoining parishes of Loth and Golspie, and 
the inhabitants generally are not in such good circumstances as in 
these parishes, which isthus accounted for: — when the tenantswere 
removed from the interior of the country to the coast-side, the poor 
belonging to this and other parts of the estate, and those who were 
unable or unwilling to occupy and improve lots of land, settled in 
the vicinity of the coal-pits, where they were insured abundance of 
fuel, without pay or trouble ; and living among men in the regular 
receipt of high wages, they were sure to obtain a share of these earn- 
mgs ; but when the works ceased, they enjoyed no such advan- 
tages, and, being thrown on their own resources, ihey soon became 
a burden on the community. On the other hand, the people of 
Loth are enriehed by the herring-fishing, and the high price paid

for their labour in the rapidly rising village of Helmsdale. Gol- 
spie is a community of tradesmen, labourers, and fishers, kept in 
constant employment by the establishments of Dunrobin, and ot 
the neighbouring extensive arable farms. 

IV. — Industry. 
AnricuUure.-Th\ parish contains 65,000 square acres, of 
which a very small portion indeed is under cultivation ; the rest 
being generally high and irreclaimable hill-pasture. It is not easy 
■to state with accuracy the extent of land in tillage but it cannot 
be under 1400 acres imperial measure, three-fourths of vv-hich has 
been trenched from the barren waste by the settlers from the hill 
and what was formerly under the plough greatly improved. There 
being 385 families, and as these occupy from one to four acres, 
v.e Ly safely fix the extent possessed by the cottars on an ave- 
rage at nearly two acres each, making in round --f ''''; 
elusive of the following principal farms :-Clynehsh, 235 Inver- 
B ora, 210; East Brora, 75; Kilcalmkill, 0 ; C lynekirkton and 
Gleb , 40 ; Cly nemilton, 33 ; Achrimsdale Park, 7--tota 1400. 
The six fams here enumerated have comfortable dwe hng-houses 
and complete offices, sufficient for every purpose. They are en- 
closed and subdivided with neat and substantial stone fences tho- 
ulhly drained, and cultivated, strictly according to the most ap- 
pToved system of modern husbandry, producmg luxuriant crops of 
Trley, olts, and turnips. No wheat is theoil 
considered suited for it. The average rent of the old arab e laml 
is about L. 1, 5s. per acre, and the tenant becomes bound to im- 
prove a Icrners of fields, and such portions of the adjoining moor-

about 300 horses, 250 cows, 300 other cattle, and 300 pigs. 
Goats were at one time numerous, but they have now quite disap 
peared. 

When the small tenants were removed from the interior, lots 
were marked off for each of them, containing in every instance 
from a quarter to an acre of old land, and to this was added about 
two acres of moor- ground, which they were to improve. Not only 
has this condition been implemented in most cases, but the ad- 
joining lands have been trenched, and now produce rich crops of 
corn and potatoes. There was scarcely a cart or a plough among 
the small tenants in the parish forty years ago. It can now boast 
of 258 carts and 240 ploughs, all made by native tradesmen, on 
the most approved principles. At that date, there was scarcely a 
regularly bred tradesman in the parish. They now abound ; and 
there may be reckoned five stone masons, nine house-carpenters, 
twelve dike-builders, three blacksmiths, nine tailors, twelve shoe- 
makers, three cartwrights, besides journeymen and apprentices. 

There are several clumps of natural wood on the banks of Loch 
Brora, consisting of common and weeping birch, bird-cherry, 
alders, a variety of poplars, some old detached oak trees, and 
about 150 acres of thriving fir plantations at Kilcalmhill ; and on 
the opposite side of the loch, which contributes greatly to the 
beauty of that magnificent lake, — also 50 acres of fir-plantation at 
Clynelish ; but owing to the bad quality of the soil, and its expo- 
sure to the sea-blast, it has not kept pace with the other woods in 
the parish. The plantations are thinned regularly, sufficiently en- 
closed, and care is taken to prevent trespass by cattle, or other in- 
jury to them. 

Quarries.— Thera are two freestone quarries, which have been 
extensively worked of late years for domestic purposes, and for ex- 
portation ; one below Spouty, near the sea, of a soft, friable, sandy 
quality, not much used, except for the small country cottages, 
the other at Branbury hill, near Clynelish, a remarkably com- 
pact, hard, siliciuus freestone, beautifully white, and highly valued 
for its durability. It contains many very perfect petrifactions of 
trees, fishes, and various forms of shells, which are much prized by 
the scientific travellers who visit the country. 

Fisheries. — The river Brora is famous for the number and qua- 
lity of its salmon, and when in proper condition, is one of the best 
angling streams in the north. It is fished for behoof of the pro- 
prietors, and the produce sold to a company at a stipulated rate 



UiO SUTHERLANDSHIUE. 



per pound. The rent maybe stated at L. 300 a year.- Some 
boats have been engaged at Brora in the herring-fishing, and with 
tolerable success. There are three boats' crews of regular fishers, 
who keep the neighbourhood abundantly supplied,— often selling a - 
large cod for •2d., a skate from 4d. to 6d., and sometimes from 20 
to 40 haddocks for 6d. But the other inhabitants have not taken 
to the sea, as was expected, and they are more inclined to occupy 
their time in cultivating their lands,— excepting during the her- 
ing- fishing season, when they are all engaged in it, at Brora or 
Helmsdale. 

Kelp was formerly manufactured on the shores; but this has 
been discontinued since the fall in the value of that article at mar- 
ket, and the tenants are allowed the free use of the sea-ware as 
manure for their land. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town, c-c— Dornoch is the nearest market-town, being 
distant about thirteen miles from the confines of the parish; but 
half-yearly markets are held in Golspie, only four miles distant, 
in June and October. Brora is the only village, and contains 280 
inhabitants. 

Means of Communication.— Ylhen the former report was pub- 
lished, there was not a mile of road fit for a carriage, and Brora 
could boast of the only bridge in the county. It has probably long 
enjoyed this advantage, and its name may have been derived from 
the Danish word Brora, a bridge, or from brugh, a borough. 
Now, the country is intersected in every direction with the finest 
roads in the kingdom, there being in this parish alone about thn-ty 
miles of road, and fifteen bridges of the most perfect construction, 
and always kept in the best order. No toll- dues are exacted m 
this county,— which is justly prized as a great advantage over our 
neighbours. Brora being a sub-post-office, a neat receivmg-house 
was built by subscription from the inhabitants, and the Mail- Coach, 
drawn by two horses, passes and repasses daily. A pier was con- 
structed at the harbour, at the sole expense of the late Duke of 
Sutherland, when the coal and salt works were in operation, and 
which affords secure shelter to coasting vessels. 

Ecclesiastical State.— 'She parish church, which is the only 
place of public worship, is conveniently situated in the centre ot 
the population, the whole inhabitants, with the exception oi the 
dwellings of shepherds, being within less than three miles of it. It 
was built about the year 1770 : and enlarged and thoroughly repair- 
ed thirteen years ago. It may contain from 800 to 1000 indivuiu- 



CLYNE. 



161 



als. The sittings are free, as is the case all over the Duke of Suth- 
erland's property, in this county and in Ross-shire. The manse, 
which was built about the same time with the church, has also re- 
ceived an addition, and it is now a handsome and commodious re- 
sidence. The glebe contains 12 acres of rich soil. The hill 
rights belonging to it were lately exchanged for an equivalent of 
arable land, which is admitted to be far more convenient and ad- 
vantageous for the minister. The stipend is 93 quarters barley, 
and L. 23 in money, including the allowance for communion ele- 
ments. The average number of communicants is 65. 

A catechist is paid by voluntary contributions from the people. 
He perambulates the parish frequently, visiting every family, and 
is a most useful and important assistant to the minister. 

Collections are made periodically for the Inverness Infirmary, 
the four Assembly schemes, and other public charities, amounting 
in all to from L. 12 to L. 20. 

Education. — There are two regular schools, exclusive of private 
teachers, — the parish school, and one in the Doll, which is support- 
ed by the Glasgow Auxiliary Gaelic School Society. The ordinary 
branches of education are taught. From the number and position 
of the population, the minister considers two additional schools ne- 
cessary, — one at Brora, and the other at Badinellan. The pa- 
rochial teacher has the maximum salary, and L. 2 Sterling in com- 
pensation for a garden. The fees are very moderate and not well 
paid, seldom exceeding L. 12. His accommodation is comfortable, 
and on a sufficiently liberal scale. Most of the rising generation 
attend school for some period of the year, and are so far in the way 
of receiving the benefits arising from a moral and religious educa- 
tion. There is also a female school at Brora, endowed by th&amp; 
Duke of Sutherland, where girls are taught to sew, make their own 
dresses, and other needle-work. 

Library. — A circulating library was established, some years ago, 
among the families on the coast side, which is stillin active operation, 
and by means of which they have access to the newest publications 
for payment of a few shillings annually. 

Charitable Institutions. — There are no public charitable institu- 
tions in this parish, nor have the poor the benefit of any charitable 
bequests ; consequently, they are dependent for their subsistence 
on the generosity of the landlord — the liberality of their neigli- 
bours who arc in better circumstances, and the pittance afforded 
them from the proceeds of the parochial contributions. 



162 sutherlanDshiue. 

The annual collections at the church amount to L.20 and up- 
wards J and, besides a regular donation of L.6 from the Noble pro- 
prietor, there are extra collections, when the parishioners of all 
ranks contribute liberally. 

The paupers on the roll are about 120, and the average allow- 
ance to each may be stated at 5s. In seasons of scarcity, the poor 
go about in the parish, and seldom leave it ; but it is absolute ne- 
cessity that compels them to go beyond their own threshold, for 
relief from others. 

A Savings Bank was established for the whole county about six 
years ago, and a branch of it is in each parish. Considerable sums 
were deposited, and the institution has already been of incalculable 
advantage to the community, affording, during the late pressmg 
seasons, a relief from the savings of more prosperous times. 

Markets. — A market is held at Brora in the month of October, 
which is attended by the people of this and the neighbouring pa- 
rishes. Shopkeepers come from a distance, and erect tents to dis- 
play their commodities, and they usually meet with a ready sale. 
A great many cattle and horses change owners, it being the last 
market of the season. The five inns in the village used to be 
crowded on this occasion, besides a great many tents in the mar- 
ket for the retail of whisky ; but the Total Abstinence Societies, 
which have been formed of late, have had a miraculous effect in 
improving the tastes and habits of the people in this respect. 
There is not a third part of the spirits used now which were used for- 
merly, and the innkeepers complain loudly that their calling is gone. 

Puel.—The ordinary fuel is peat procured from mosses in the 
close neighbourhood, and the fishers collect coke from the shore 
under flood-mark. Coal is imported, costing from 16s. to 18s. 
per ton, and its use among the wealthier class is much on the in- 
crease. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There is no district of country in Scotland where such an entire 
change has taken place in the habits, character, and pursuits of the 
inhabitants, as in this and the other parts of the county forming 
the estate of Sutherland. Tliey were quite a rural, a moral, and a 
happy population, inhabiting beauiilully romantic and sequestered 
clens in the interior— far removed from the bustle of the world. 
Strangers to its allurements and luxuries, they passed their lives, 
veneration following generation, in the same locahties, but without 
Ambition to better their circumstances, or a desire to improve

their possessions. All passed happily and without cave, so long as 
the seasons proved propitious, and that the produce of their stock 
was sufficient to pay the landlord and to afford the means of sub- 
sistence on their simple fare ; but when the winter storms length- 
ened into spring, and the mill-dew and the early frosts destroyed 
the hopes of the harvest, then indeed came the period of distress ; 
and it is not too much to say that they suffered the very extreme 
of want, which often produced contagious fevers and other mortal 
diseases. This was submitted to, how6ver, in silence and with pious 
resignation : no tumults nor risings against the constituted autho- 
rities, who they well knew could not ward off the general calamity. 
Thus situated, helpless and without resources, their only course 
was an appeal to the compassion of their natural protector, the 
landlord, and this was never done in vain. He required often to 
import meal equal in value to the rent of two or more years, and 
generally leaving a large balance never to be recovered. This state 
of things could not continue, while the rest of the world were mov- 
ing ahead, and making rapid advances in improvement; conse- 
quently, the great and deeply important measure was resolved on 
to remove the population to the coast-side, where they would be 
placed near the sea — become fishermen or artificers, and thus be 
able to benefit by the many and inexhaustible resources which 
Providence has placed within their reach. At this time, there were 
but few bred tradesmen in the country. When a man found it ne- 
cessary to renew his rude dwelling, he called the neighbours to 
bis assistance, and it was only the work of a few days to complete 
it. Every man was his own carpenter, for few implements were re- 
quired, and he had little to do with them. One blacksmith served 
a district. The shoemaker and the tailor migrated from house to 
house, receiving their victuals and a small pittance of wages in 
return for their labour. There was scarcely a cart or a plough in 
the country, excepting on the larger farms. No man thought of 
increasing or improving his tillage or pasture lands by trenching 
or draining. But let any one with an impartial and unprejudiced 
eye examine the present condition of the inhabitants. Their well- 
built and neatly kept cottages and enclosed gardens far exceed 
what many tacksmen in former days paying from L. 50 to L. 100 
possessed. Every individual in the family has some resource in a 
trade or other manual labour — all is a stirring scene of industry 
and positive comfort. The father and the sons cultivate the lot, if 
not tradesmen; while the females are engaged with household 
work, or preparing nets for the next herring season.

Persons who are ignorant of the character of the Highlanders, 
and many who have never seen the country, have ventured to de- 
scribe them as indolent, idle, and unprofitable members of the 
community. A more gross fallacy has never been uttered. They 
are a quiet, sober, brave, and a moral race ; attached and confid- 
ing while kindly and honestly dealt by ; but reserved, stern, and 
unlaending as their mountain rocks, wherever they suspect injustice, 
or lose faith in the acts and professions of their superiors. The , 
extensive and perfect improvements on the estate of Sutherland 
bear evidence of their activity, industry, and confidence in their 
landlord, when their energies are properly directed. Those who 
reside in the country can testify, that it is a rare occurrence to 
meet with an individual the worse of liquor, except occasionally at 
markets. The naval and military annals of the nation record their 
bravery, where they have distinguished themselves in many a des- 
perate onset. The faithful labours of our clergy have been bless- 
ed by Providence in rendering them pious and moral ; and then- 
character may be summed up in these few words,— that they fear 
God and honour the Queen.

PRESBYTERY OF TONGUE, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AXD 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. HUGH MACKAY MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I _ToPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Tae.— This district, previous to its erection into a separate 
parish in 1724, and while it constituted but a portion of the ori- 
ginal parish of Durness, was called Kintail,-a term signifying 
the head of the sea,  Ceann an t'sdilj. The name was derived 
from the arm of the sea, which, for many miles, stretches inland 
into the parish from the Northern Ocean. The modern name 
Tonnue, which at first was written Tung, is in all probability 
derived from a narrow neck of land jutting out transversely for a 
considerable distance into the Kyle near the House of Toiigue, 
which bears a resemblance to a protruded tongue. J he Gaelic

as well as the English name of that organ justifies this deriva- 
tion. 

Boundaries, Extent— It would seem by the record of erection, 
that the boundaries of this parish extended from Torrisdale, in the 
east, to the water of Polla, in the west; from the Whiten -head, in 
the north, to the great deer forest, in the south. By use and wont, 
however, these boundaries are greatly contracted on the west, in 
which direction the parish is considered now only to.extend to the 
top of the Moin or the Ben Hope mountain range. The parish 
of Farr is contiguous on the east and south-east, and the parish 
of Durness on the west and south-west. On the north, it is bound- 
ed by the Northern Ocean. Its figure is irregular, somewhat re- 
sembling, as is mentioned in the former account, a spherical tri- 
angle. The extreme length from north to south is 20 miles ; ave- 
rage 15. The extreme breadth from east to west is 12 miles; 
average 8. As nearly as can be computed, its superficial extent 
is 140 square miles. 

Topoffraphicid Appearances. — The general aspect of the parish 
is mountainous. In topographical character, however, it is divid- 
ed into two districts, distinct from each other. The first embraces 
all that is peculiarly alpine, and is the principal part of the parish 
as to extent, population, culture, and beauty. It lies towards the 
west, and consists of the great valley of Tongue, formed by the 
arm of the sea already mentioned, with the streams which flow 
from the interior into the head of it. On either side of the bay, 
two mountain- ranges, rising abruptly and boldly from the ocean, 
stretch along its whole length, and continue taking nearly a paral- 
lel direction, till interrupted by a third range, stretching from east 
to west, which consists of the mountain of Ben Laoghal and its 
arms. The whole constitutes a semicircular chain of hills, appa- 
rently continuous, and gives to the valley the form of a spacious 
amphitheatre. The western range, commencing with Ben Hutig, 
which is 1345 feet high, is for some miles of nearly an uniform 
height, and somewhat monotonous, till it reaches its southern ex- 
tremity, when it suddenly terminates in the huge mountain of Ben 
Hoc, 306 1 feet high. The eastern range is a series of rounded 
'hills, not very lofty, rising above the bay sometimes abruptly, but 
in general receding so gently, as to afford scope for considerable 
cultivation on their sides. The Ben Laoghal range is tlie most 
picturesque. This noble hill, the queen of Ilighl.ind mountains, 
occupies the central point of the whole semicircular ciiain ; there-

fore, from its position as well as from its romantic outlines, it is 
the most prominent and striking object in the whole scenery. At 
the southern extremity of a low extensive valley, it starts up ma- 
jestically to the height of 2508 feet, presenting towards its base an 
expanded breast of two miles in breadth, and cleft at its lop into 
four massy towering and splintered peaks, standing boldly aloof from 
each other. These gradually diminish in height, one after the 
other. The highest stands proudly forward to occupy the fore- 
ground ; the rest recede a little, as if each were unwilling to protrude 
itself, from a conscious inferiority to its predecessor. As a graceful 
finish to its outlines, it stretches forth an arm on either side, as if to 
embrace condescendingly the other mountain ranges, which may 
well acknowledge it as chief, and which may readily be fancied as 
doing it homage. On a summer morning, or after a sweet summer 
shower, when°the transparent mist is reposing on its bosom, or 
coiling among its peaks, the appearance of this hill is very beauti- 
ful, and often singularly fantastic. Within this great chain, there 
are various objects which constitute marked features in the see- - 
nery of the district. Amongst these, the Kyle occupies a promi- 
nent place, so studded with islands at its mouth, that, from some 
points of view, its connection with the ocean seems wholly inter- 
cepted. Towards its centre, the point of Tongue and a small is- 
land adjacent thereto, tend farther to charm and relieve the eye, 
by breaking in upon the continuous sheet of water. Another in- 
teresting and conspicuous object is the promontory of Castle \ar- 
rich. It consists of a small hill range, running south and north, 
rising gradually from the low ground at the foot of Ben Laoglial, 
and terminating at its northern extremity in a bold rock ot consi- 
derable altitude, which is washed at its base by the water ot the 
Kyle, and has its conical summit surmounted by a fine old rum, 
which imparts a pleasing effect. Altogether, the sceT,ery of this 
part of the parish is much and universally admired. 1 b e hand ot 
man has undoubtedly done somewhat to embellish it ; but httle 
very little, to what might be eff-ected. Even MaccuUoch, with a 
his antipathy to the north, has admitted, that, were the Mom, on 
west side of the Bay, to some extent planted, this place would not  
be exceeded in beauty by many parts of the Highlands 

The second or eastern division of the parish is rathe tame and 
,nononou . In the interior, this is partially relieved by lochs of 
Tr 0 1 r-, which are scattered with profusion in every direction 
dX gro nd, moreover, is of a softly undulating character , .he

rocks being clothed with an almost unbroken surface of verdure 
and of beaUi. Towards the sea-coast, the country becomes crag- 
ay and fretted-like, uninteresting in its general aspect, and appa- 
rently barren. Yet in the midst of this district, when more closely 
examined, there will be found numerous little glens, bearing a rich 
soil and a large population. 

The coast is in general high and rocky, and round the promon- 
tory of the Whiten-head exceedingly bold and picturesque. The 
rocks are frequently intersected by creeks, and formed into 
caves and arches. The caves of Freasgail, which are described 
in the former Account of this parish, have been noticed in the 
Account of the parish of Durness, in consequence of the mo- 
dern ideas regarding the boundaries of the two parishes. The 
islands are Eilean na naoimh, saint's \s\and—Eika7i na roan, 
seal island, and the rabbit islands. Eilean na naoimh, situated 
close by the eastern coast of the parish, " had formerly a chapel 
and burial-place on it, the traces of which are still to be seen. 
On the south side of the island, the sea, after passing for several 
•vards through a narrow channel, spouts up into the air, some- 
times to the height of thirty feet, through a hole in the rock, which, 
in shape and size, is like the moon at full, and a few seconds af- 
terwards, there is a discharge of water from the east side of the 
island, with a noise resembling the explosion of cannon." Eilean 
na roan is of considerable size, and has the appearance of two 
islands, particularly at high water. Part of it is scooped out into 
the form of a basin, in which the soil is very fertile, and cultivat- 
ed by a few small tenants. Its rocks are high and precipitous, 
and to the north side abound with deep narrow fissures, through 
which the wind rushes with great violence. As this wind, besides 
being sharp and piercing, is impregnated with saline matter, from 
its blowing across the ocean, or perhaps from carrying along with 
it the spray which dashes from olf the rocks beneath, the natives 
take advantage thereof for economical purposes. In these fissures, 
they season their fish without using salt. On this north side also 
there is a spacious and elegant-looking arch, about 150 feet span, 
and 70 feet broad. About the middle of the island, there is a large 
circular hole, which has fallen in many years ago, and is supposed to 
communicate with the sea by a subterranean cavern.'" The Rabbit 
Islands, three in number, are farther within the mouth ol' the Bay

than the former, and so in some measure removed from the raging of 
the ocean. The rocks are not very high. The soil is sandy, though 
covered with verdure. The present name of these islands sufficient- 
ly indicates who are their principal inhabitants. The ancient name 
was Eilean na Gaeil, the island of strangers, from the Danes hav- 
ing been said to have landed upon it. The principal bays are 
those of Torrisdale and Tongue ; the former is open and tem- 
pestuous, aflfording little or no shelter for vessels ; the latter is the 
Kyle, or arm of the sea, already noticed. Its length is about ten 
miles, the average breadth about a-mile and a-hal£ Its depth is 
nowhere great, and, from the shifting nature of its sand banks, na - 
vigation is difficult and often perilous. There is, however, good 
anchorage for ships of any burden at the Rabbit Islands, where they 
may ride with safety in storms from most directions. A fine road- 
stead is also to be found in its neighbourhood at Talmine, a pret- 
ty bay that branches off the west side of the Kyle. It has a smooth 
beach, and a fine bottom,— is much sheltered from the most tem- 
pestuous winds,— and commands a ready exit to the ocean. At 
present, it is one of the principal fishing stations on the coast. 
By the erection of quays, and by connecting the mainland with a. 
small island lying close by on the north .side, it might be made 
one of the most commodious harbours in the north. Almost op- 
posite to Talmine, on the east side of the Kyle, there is the creek 
of Sculomy, which at present shelters a few fishing-boats, but which 
an inconsiderable expense might render a safe station for many 

more. . , „ , . 

Mefeoroo77/.— Considering the latitude of this parish, its tem- 
perature is mild, and the climate is very salubrious, though the 
state of the atmosphere is in general extremely changeable. The 
heat is not so great in summer, nor the cold so intense m winter, 
as these seem to be in some of the southern parts of Scotland 
Placed in a central position between the west and east coasts of 
■ the island, it is not visited by those frequent deluges of ram which 
are peculiar to the former, nor so exposed to those piercing bhght- 
incv winds which prevail in the latter. The prevailing wmils are 
the south-west and north-west. The severest stoms are from 
the south-west,-the most frequent from the north-west. Ihe 
prevalent distempers, as connected with the climate, are rheumatism 
Cl inflammatory complaints; but more common than e.ther are 
disorders of the stomach among the poorer people, ansmg from a 
d et often too scanty, and sometimes unwholesome. Lummous

meteors are frequent. The circle round the moon and the aurora 
borealis are sometimes brilliant in winter. When the latter is fiery 
and lurid, it is an invariable sign of stormy weather. The former 
generally prognosticates the same, so also does the fragment of a 
rainbow when seen in the north, called " Boar's head." 

Hydrography. — The parish abounds with springs, which are ge- 
nerally perennial, but sometimes intermittent. Chalybeate springs 
are quite common. Sulphureous ones are found in several places, 
chiefly around Ben Laoghal, and there are some which seem to 
be a compound of both. None of these have been properly ana- 
lyzed, but some of the sulphureous seem of such strength, that, 
were they more accessible, they might be found medicinally of 
considerable service. Lochs are so numerous, that from a single 
eminence, which does not command a view of the whole parish, I 
have counted more than 100. The most deserving of notice are 
the following : — Loch Maedie, in the southern extremity of the 
parish, which may be about six miles in circumference. Its ap- 
pearance is striking, from its margin being singularly indented 
by numerous little bays and projecting points of land, and from 
its bosom being studded with islands, on which grow trees of con- 
siderable size. Loch Diru lies at the foot of the Dim rock, 
which is a part of the west arm of Ben Laoghal. The loch is two 
miles long, and the rock, which is nearly the same length, towers 
majestically above it to the height of 200 feet, — its brow adorned 
at pleasing intervals with solitary trees of birch and mountain-ash. 
This loch is one of the unobserved beauties of the parish, lying in 
a secluded spot, and inaccessible to any but the pedestrian. On 
the east and south-east sides of Ben Laoghal, there is a chain of 
lochs of considerable extent, called Lochs Cullisaid, Laoghal, 
Craggy, and Slam, which communicate with each other by nar- 
row fords or small rivulets. Loch Laoghal is the largest of the 
four, and, indeed, the largest in the parish, — being five miles long 
and upwards of a mile broad. There are two islands upon it, 
where wild-fowl nestle in great numbers. The verdure in its neigh- 
bourhood is rich, A few trees fringe its margin on the west side, 
and on the opposite there rises a hill of considerable height, green 
to the top, with a thriving birch- wood at its base. Loch Crag- 
gy IS interesting, by commanding a fine profile view of Ben 
Laoghal, Were this chain connected by a road with Lochs 
Maedie and Diru, sweeping round the whole of Ben Laoghal, it 
would lorm a ride which, as regards loch and mountain scenery,

the Kyle from Coldbacky to Ciioc- Craggy, consists of conglome- 
rate capping the gneiss, and resting horizontally on its fractured 
beds. The junction in this case is quite visible in some exposed 
rocks at Coldbacky. Red sandstone has also been discovered at 
one point in this mountain-range, near Dalcharn. The whole 
mountain of Ben Laoghal is sienite, " which consists of a light 
flesh-red felspar, grey quartz, and black or dark-green hornblende, 
with minute and sparingly disseminated crystals of brown sphene. 
In several places the quartz almost disappears, — the rock then be- 
coming a binary compound of felspar and hornblende. The struc- 
ture of this sienite on the small scale is small granular, while on 
the large it is disposed in a most distinctly tabular manner. In- 
deed, few localities can be pointed out in Scotland where this 
beautiful rock arrangement is more characteristically developed. 
From various parts of its summit the entire structure may be traced 
with the utmost precision, and the several tabular concretions fol- 
lowed, with little variation, throughout its whole extent. The la- 
teral planes of the tabular concretions are in general nearly paral- 
lel, and exhibit an almost pohshed surface. This mountain might, 
if other circumstances rendered it expedient, be wrought exten- 
sively for building materials. Such would be attended with but 
little difficulty as far as the raising of the stone is concerned, while 
the tabular form is so regular, that, for many purposes, very little 
dressing would be requisite." Black manganese ore has been 
found on the top of Ben Laoghal. Bog-iron ore is very common. 
Granite boulders are frequent about Tongue village. Whence 
they have come, is a problem not easy to solve. The prin- 
cipal alluvium is peat, which covers a great proportion of the pa- 
rish : a quantity of fir-wood is found imbedded in it. The soil, 
which is, or has been, under cultivation, is in some places a black 
rich loam ; in others a sandy loam ; but, perhaps, the most com- 
mon is a soil compounded of gravel and peat, with an admixture 
either of clay or sand. 

Zoology. — The zoology of the parish is such as is common to 
the whole of this north coast, on which the various species of 
quadrupeds, birds, and fishes are numerous. Game qf almost 
every description is to be found in the parish, but not in such 
abundance as formerly, owing, it is supposed, to the extensive 
moor-burnings upon the sheep farms. Fishing upon lakes and

rivers has also fallen off; to account for which, many opinions have 
been entertained, which at best are mere conjectures. The fresh- 
water fishes generally used at table are, salmon, grilse, trout, and 
char. Those got on the coast are chiefly herring, cod, ling, had- 
dock, whiting, skate, and flounder. In September, quantities of 
coal-fish are caught close to the rocks. Turbot and tusk are oc- 
casionally found. The upper part of the Kyle abounds with shell- 
fish, which a.e easily gathered, as the sea ebbs a considerable dis- 
tance. Mussels and spout-fish of excellent quality are to be had; 
but cockles are the most abundant of all. These are of various 
sizes and colours. All of them, however, are rich and delicious 
when in season, which is from April to September. They are 
highly relished by strangers, who are loud in their praises ; and 
they are an invaluable blessing to those within reach of them, 
who, during the summer months, use them daily as an article ot 

food. ,  . 

Botany.-i:\ie flora of this parish is not known to contain any 
plants peculiar to itself, or such as are very rare in other places. 
Perhaps the following are among those most deserving of notice. 
Some of them, though rare in this parish, are common in other 
parts of this country.

frequent in rocky burn and cascades. Quercus robur oak is to 
be seen in a few places ; but, from its being exposed to be trodden 
down by cattle, it only attains tbe size of a trifling shrub. It may 
be mentioned, that Ulex Europaus whin and Cytisus Scoparius 
broom grow freely in several places ; but both were probably in- 
troduced about sixty years ago. The natural wood, which, for a 
long time, was neglected and destroyed, and in consequence fast 
dwindling away, has of late years been well kept and thinned. 
The only plantations of any extent in the parish are those around 
the House of Tongue. There are specimens to be seen here of 
beech, elm, ash, and lime, which, for size and beauty, may vie with 
any in the north. The greater part of these plantations are of re- 
cent date, composed of a mixture of hard-wood, fir, and plane- 
tree, for all of which the soil seems well adapted. Larch and 
spruce fir thrive much better than the Scotch. Altogether the 
plantations are in a most flourishing condition, and prove beyond a 
doubt the advantages that would accrue to such a country as this 
from their greater extension. Besides beautifying the scenery, they 
would ameliorate the climate, and become a fruitful source of re- 
venue. The ordinary fruit-trees thrive well when they obtain the 
support and shelter of a good wall. 

II. — Civil History. 

Distinguished Families. — This parish is the birth-place, and was 
the residence of the most of the noble family of Reay. Some of 
these signalized themselves for prowess and skill in the military 
operations of their own times : among whom may be mentioned 
Donald first Lord Reay, who so distinguished himself in the wars 
of Gustavus Adolphus. Tradition ascribes to him most singular 
superhuman powers of body. There were other members of this 
family who, though not distinguished as public characters, devoted 
their influence to the welfare of their people, by whom their me- 
mories were cherished for several generations, for intelligence, 
patriotism, and exemplary piety. A full account of them will be 
found in Mackay's History of the House and Clan of Mackay. 

Ministers. — Though erected in 1724, this parish was not sup- 
plied with a minister till 1726, when Mr George Mackay was ap- 
pointed, who only lived two years. His successor was Mr Walter 
Ross, a man of fine preaching talents, but whose reserved man- 
ners and secluded habits were not calculated to gain upon the 
rough, frank Highlander. He occupied the parish till 1763, when 
he resigned. After his resignation Mr John Mackay was ap-

pointed, who, being of a weak and sickly constitution, was unable 
to labour efficiently in the parish, and only lived in the charge for 
six years. In 1769, he was succeeded by Mr William Mackenzie. 
As his incumbency forms an era in the history of this parish, his 
name deserves special notice in such an account as this. A native of 
Ross-shire, soon after his license, he came to officiate as missionary 
in the neighbouring parish of Farr; and though possessing highly 
popular talents, a liberal education, and prospects of advancement 
elsewhere th rough influential friends, yet, having formed a strong 
attachment to his -adopted country, he accepted a call to this pa- 
rish when vacant by the death of Mr Mackay. He found it in a 
deplorable state of religious ignorance. Scarce could one be found 
to repeat the Shorter Catechism. There was only one elder with- 
in the bounds, and it was impossible to fix on others, bearing the 
necessary religious character, who could be ordained to this office 
so as to constitute a session. The sanctity of the Lord's day was 
grossly violated by persons forming bargains, going and coming to 
the house of God. A general apathy to the means of grace was 
manifest ; and several gross practices, the relics of a barbarous 
age, were common at funerals and festivals. 

With these evils to contend against, he entered on his charge 
with zeal and energy, and an untiring devoted ness to the interests 
of his flock. But, for three years, he seemed to labour in vain, and 
the feeling of his heart was, " Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech." 
At last, the time to visit this portion of Zion was come. One day 
he took occasion from the pulpit to remonstrate plainly and faith- 
fully with the people, for their several sins ; declared his own ar- 
dent hopes of being instrumental in reforming them, when he en- 
tered the parish ; the bitterness of his feelings in his disappoml- 
ment hitherto, and his prayer to God, that were this to contmue 
He would remove him from amongst them. Overpowered by his 
feelings, he could proceed no longer. For the first time, the con- 
greo-ation were seen bathed in tears, and overwhelmed with a feel- 
i'ng°of shame, and from that day there was the most marked change ; 
a truly fruitful revival was the consequence. The people showed 
all docility in receiving the instructions of their pastor ; the house 
of God was thronged by persons from the most distant corners of 
the parish ; respect and attention were shown to the ordinances 
and duties of religion ; barbarous usages were gradually laid aside : 
•md under his affectionate, glowing, and faithful ministry, there 
sprang up a race of intelligent Christians, so that he was soon en-

abled to form a throng session of elders, who, considering their 
station in society, were ornaments in the church. Liliewise under 
his fostering care, several young men were reared for the minis- 
try, all of whom, with scarce an exception, he had the pleasure of 
seeing the instruments of extensive usefulness. 

This honoured servant of the Lord laboured for sixty-five years 
among a devotedly attached people, being able to preach and ad- 
minister the sacraments to the very last. He died in 1834, at the 
advanced age of ninety-six. His people commonly spoke of him 
as " the great minister," and testified their esteem and affection 
by erecting a handsome monument to his memory. 

Parochial Register.— There was no register kept, previous to 
the year 1775. From that period till 1797 there was a record of 
births and marriages regularly made up ; but the person who was ses- 
sion-clerk at that time became deranged, which was never suspect- 
ed till it was incontestibly proved, by his being found one morning 
busily employed in the churchyard distributing papers on the grave- 
stones, with the sanguine hope of raising an army from the dead. 
On examination, these papers were discovered to be the parish 
register, so torn as to be completely useless. From 1797 mar- 
riages and births were registered, but not in a permanent form, 
and many of the loose sheets have been lost through the careless- 
ness of clerks. However, since 1816, a correct register has been 
regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — The most striking ruin is Castle Varrich, stand- 
ing on the promontory already mentioned, bearing the same name. 
It is a square building, which originally consisted of two stories, 
the first arched with stone, the second covered with wood. Its 
dimensions inside are not great ; the walls are thick, and still of a 
considerable height. Tradition is silent as to its history, on which 
subject its name has given rise to various conjectures; but most 
probably the name is merely derived from a Gaelic word signifying 
the castle on the eminence. The remains of several circular towers 
are to be seen, extending from the coast to the interior, which, from 
the circumstance of one being always in sight of another, are sup- 
posed to have been erected for the purpose of conveying telegra- 
phic information when an enemy threatened to invade the country. — 
Several subterranean caves have been found in the parish, long and 
narrow in their construction, with a small entrance. From various 
circumstances they appear to be artificial, and were probably occu- 



170 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 

pied by the natives, in warlike times, as places of retreat. The 
only tumuli' to be seen, are at a place called Druim na Coup, where, 
as has been noticed in the former account, a battle was fought be- 
tween the Mackays and the Siitherlands. Upon the same ground, 
or nearly so, a party of French were seized in 1746, going south 
with gold to aid the rebels. The French vessel in which they 
were conveyed, being pursued off this coast, ran for safety into 
the Bay of Tongue, and the party, carrying their valuable treasure, 
landed at Melness, where for a night they were protected by a 
gentleman of kindred sentiments. Next day, his son went to con- 
duct them by the safest route through the country, but, as soon 
as their character and object were known, they were pursued 
by a band of natives from several neighbouring places. When 
the French came to Druim na Coup, finding that these were in 
chase of them, and hearing the beating of a drum resounding from 
the cliffs of Ben Laoghal, indicating the approach of soldiers from 
the south, they at once surrendered. Much of the gold was lost, 
being probably thrown into a deep loch in the neighbourhood, but 
a considerable quantity was appropriated by those who led 6n the 
pursuit. A few gold coins have since been found at a conside- 
rable distance from Druim na Coup. 

III. — Population. 

In 17.55, the population by return to Dr Webster was 1093 
1791, • ... 1439 

1831, by Government census, • 2030 

mS.  . . • • 2080 

Of these 956 were males: 1124 were females. In 1791 it is 
stated that the births were 47, and marriages 17. Since 1831, 
births have averaged 44, and marriages 11. It thus appears that, 
in a population of 1439, there were more births and marriages, es- 
pecially the latter, than there are now in a population of 2080. 
The probable solution of this strange fact is,, that the population, 
having increased till it has become a burden on the land at pre- 
sent cultivated, the subdividing of crofts having been prohibited, 
and the ordinary sources of industry by sea and land having, for 
some time, either proved unproductive or being shut up, the young 
of both sexes felt that they could not marry without running the 
hazard of being soon exposed to hardships and want. When mar- 
riages decrease, births of course share the same fate. 

The Duke of Sutherland, the only nobleman connected with 
the parish as proprietor, has a residence in it— the House of 
Tongue, which he occasionally occupies for a few days in autumn, 



TONQUIC. 



177 



when visiting bis extensive domains in the north. Part of it is in- 
habited by his Grace's factor. There are three substantial resi- 
dent sheep-farmers ; a medical practitioner, whom the proprietor 
encourages by srivinga free house and L. 60 annually ; and a fish- 
ery officer. The peasantry reside in hamlets, and when a road 
passes through, the houses are arranged in a straight line on the 
one side, each standing on the croft of land attached to it. 244 
pay rent. There are about 116 families, besides, who are mere 
cottars, having no land, in the majority of cases without any trade, 
and depending for their sustenance on a little day labour and on 
the kindness of-their neighbours, who often give them patches of 
their own small crofts for raising a few potatoes. There are 4 
carpenters, 10 masons, 8 tailors, 9 shoemakers, 3 smiths, and 1 
watchmaker. There are 6 fatuous, none insane, 2 dumb, and 
none who were blind from birth. 

Language. — The language of the peasantry is Gaelic; in it 
they invariably converse with one another, but, owing to the influx 
of persons from the south, the influence of schools, and the fre- 
quency with which they go south in quest of labour, English is 
generally understood by the young, and spoken by many of them 
with considerable accuracy. 

Character of the People. — The young of both sexes are ambi- 
tious to dress well, so as to make a respectable appearance on 
Sabbaths and holidays. This is a laudable feeling, though it 
sometimes leads to extravagance, by inducing them to expend their 
hard-won earnings in sacrificing comfort to occasional show. 
When dressed in their best attire they are allowed to be a fine-look- 
ing peasantry. At the late Duke of Sutherland's funeral, when 
numbers from the whole county were invited to attend, and direct- 
ed to line the road, arranged according to their respective parishes, 
as the procession passed by, the men from Tongue attracted ge- 
neral notice for their superior dress and appearance. It might 
hence be expected that their comforts were also superior; but no. 
They are, indeed, not worse off than their neighbours in this re- 
spect. The general standard is, however, wretchedly low. No 
doubt a few of them are comfortable, but the generality seldom 
can rise above the commonest necessaries of life ; and it is painful 
to think of how some eke out a subsistence. The consequence is, 
that poverty is gradually manifesting its baneful effects upon the 
intellects and morals of naturally a fine and generous people. 
The taste for music, dancing, and public games, is much on the 



178 SUTIIEULANDSHIIIK. 

decline, and few or no traces are to be seen of the poetic talent 
and sprightly wit for which their ancestors, in common with most 
Highlanders, were distinguished. The imaginative powers are 
crushed under the continued pressure of a poverty that impels 
the mental energies in the low direction of what shall we eat and 
what shall we drink ; and the habits of reflection and deep-thmkmg 
are exchanged for a sharp-sightedness in looking after their little 
secular interests. It is impossible that circumstances which have 
thus operated on their intellectual character, should not also affect 
their morals and religious feelings. They have done so, though 
„ot so greatly as might be expected; and it is saying much to 
their credit, that there is so little amount of crime, and so much 
security for person and property. There were never but two from 
this parish tried at a justiciary court, one not a native, and the 
other only for a breach of trust. The people are kind and peace- 
able, patient under adversity, submissive to laws, and respectful to 
authorities. They possess a good deal of rehgious knowledge, 
and much veneration for religious ordinances and usages. It is 
rare now to find one who cannot repeat the Shorter Catechism, 
and the writer knows not that such a thing exists among the na- 
tive peasantry as a family without the daily worship of God. Many 
among them are decided Christians. The generality, it is to be 
feared, rest satisfied, however, with acquiring vague ideas, and en- 
gaging in empty forms; while it is matter of painful experience 
that the downward earthly tendency of their thoughts, induced so 
much by poverty, has a fearful effect in deadening their mmds to 
religious impressions. It is manifest, also, that mtercourse with 
the ungodly when south, and at the herring-fishing in Caithness, 
together with the desecration of the Lord's day by travellers from 
other places, a sin till lately happily unknown, are very injurious 
to their morals and religious sentiments. Laziness is no longer 
characteristic of the people. They are alive to the advant ge of 
industry. In proof of which many of them annually go south be- 
cause so little encouragement is given them at home Poaching 
is unknown, and smuggling has been eff-ectually put down through 
the exertions of the proprietor. 

IV. — Industry.

.bout 1000. It may safely be said, that three times this nm«.

tiiral wood. The extent of the latter is not easily ascertained, 
from the irregular manner in which it is disposed. . 

Eent. — The real rental of the parish is L, 2-282, 13s. lid., of 
which lotters pay L. 757, lis. 3d. ; and large farmers L. 1525, 
2s. 8d. The average rent of arable land per acre is L. 1. 

Wages. — Tradesmen are allowed 2s. a-day, and day-labourers 
Is. 6d. in summer, and Is. in winter. 

The raw produce which is offered for sale is trifling. Those 
who do sell, are regulated by market-prices. Very superior 
Cheviot sheep are reared upon the large farms, which are highly 
esteemed, and fetch high prices in the southern markets. The 
small tenants rear the black-faced breed, or more generally 
a cross between it and the Cheviot. From want of full feeding, 
their pasture being limited and generally overstocked, both their 
sheep and their cattle are stinted in their growth. A real High- 
land pony can now seldom be seen. The system of farming upon 
the crofts is decidedly bad. The tenants, besides endeavouring 
to keep more cattle than they can properly feed, employ a rota- 
tion of potatoes, bear, and oats, by which the land, thus constant- 
ly cropped, is so exhausted, that in many places the force of 
manure cannot now make it yield an adequate return. Besides, 
it is seldom properly drained or fenced, so that in winter it is 
commonly very wet, and injured by the poaching of cattle. As a 
proof of the deteriorating effects of this system of husbandry, it 
may be mentioned, that while the land cultivated by the large 
farmers will yield on an average seven returns in grain crops, the 
small tenants seldom obtain above four returns of bear, and as to 
oats, they do not calculate upon more than double the seed. The 
potato crop is that alone which gives a really remunerating 
return. The large farmers have leases of nineteen years' duration. 
Small tenants have only one year's tenure of their land, which is 
certainly a discouragement to them in improving their lots. 

Qiiarries. — The only quarries that have been wrought are on 
the Melness, or west side of the Bay of Tongue, a flag quarry 
at Portvasgo, and a slate quarry at Talmine. Both are of the 
mica-slate formation. They have been wrought to a considerable 
extent, and have been found very useful for several country pur- 
poses. The expense of quarrying, however, is too great to make 
this a profitable trade, or to admit of much export, and according- 
ly it has of late been almost discontinued. 

Fisheries. — There is a salmon-fishing u]on the water of Borgie, 



iSO SUTHKRLANDSHIUE, 

where on an average 2000 fish are caught yearly. The herring- 
fishery is that which has been carried on most extensively in the 
parish. At one time it promised to be profitable ; of late, how- 
ever, it has turned out a ruinous speculation, as the annexed ac- 
counts will show.

Manvfactures.—Yvom twenty to thirty tons of kelp were annually 
manufactured in this parish until 1832; but since then, as its place 
has been supplied by cheaper substitutes, the price has suffered 
such a depression as to render it no object for employing labour- 
ers. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There is no market-town in the pa- 
rish ; the nearest is Thurso, in the county of Caithness, distant 
forty-five miles. There is a post-office in the village of Tongue, 
and mails run three times a-week to Thurso, and twice a-week to 
Golspie. There is also a post to Durness, whose days of arnvmg 
and starting correspond to those of the Golspie mail. The vehi- 
cle from Golspie carries three passengers; that from Thurso car- 
ries four inside and four outside. A lighter vehicle, however, runs on 
this latter line during winter, which only accommodates five passen- 
gers. The length of roads in the parish is 39| miles. Of these, 11 
are Parliamentary, 14| county trust roads, and 14 private tenantry 
roads. They are kept in excellent repair. The bay of 1 ongue 
is crossed by a ferry 1262 yards broad. In 1830-31, slip quays 
were built, and proper boats procured. This ferry, which is a 
o-reat annoyance to travellers, might be shortened to a fourth of its 
present breadth, by constructing a mound between the point of 
Toncrue, and the island adjacent thereto. As the water here is 
not °erv deep, nor the current strong, and as profusion of mate-

rials lie ready at band, it is believed by many tliat such an iinder- 
taking- would not be very expensive. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is so situated as to be nearly 
equidistant from the several extremities of the parish. There are, 
however, two populous districts on either side of it, so remote, 
that few of the people can attend public worship. The Skerray 
district to the east, which contains a population of 630, is from 
seven to eleven miles distant from the church. The Melness dis- 
trict to the west, with a population of 690, is from four to eight miles 
distant, separated, moreover, by the arm of the sea, the crossing of 
which is always expensive and often impracticable. Each of these 
stand much in need of the labours of a resident minister. Mel- 
ness forms the chief part of a mission connected with part of the 
parish of Durness. The missionary is supported by the Society 
for Propagating Christian Knowledge ; and a church and manse 
were built by the late Duchess- Countess of Sutherland. 

The parish church was built in 1680,— was nearly rebuilt in 
1731, and repaired 1778. A few years ago, new doors were put 
in, and some of the pews a little improved. It is seated for 520, 
being just sufficient accommodation for the proportion of the peo- 
ple who can conveniently attend. There are no seat rents. The 
pews were originally purchased by the parishioners, and continue 
the property of their descendants while they remain in the parish. 
In winter, when the people are all at home, the church is well fill- 
ed, and the people are diligent in attending the catechetical mi- 
nistrations of their pastor. There is one catechist chosen by the 
people, and supported chiefly by a small sa.lary from the Society for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge. The number of elders are 
eleven, and of male heads of families in communion with the 
church 45. Collections are annually made for the General As- 
sembly's five schemes, and occasionally for other objects. There 
are no Dissenters, Seceders, Episcopalians, or Roman Catholics 
in the parish. 

The manse was built in 1787, and has never got a thorough 
repair ; a new substantial house is, however, to be commenced ear- 
ly this season, having been already contracted for. The stipend is 
L. 150, with an allowance for communion elements. When the 
present incumbent entered on the charge, the glebe was of little 
"value ; the hill-grazing was a share of an undivided common, and 
the little arable land was rig about with adjoining tenants. An 
excambion being obtained, and quantity given for quality, improve- 



182 SUTHERLANDSHIRE. 



ments have since been carried on at great expense, and now the 
glebe might probably fetch a rent of L.50 per annum. 

Education. — At present there are three schools in the parish ; 
the parochial, and two supported by the Educational Committee 
of the General Assembly. One of the Assembly's schools is at 
Skerray, the other at Melness. Last year there were three schools 
besides,— two supported by private subscription, which, for seve- 
ral causes, have since been suppressed, — the third was a Gaelic 
school, granted by the Gaelic School Society, which has been 
discontinued by the managers, though only two years in operation, 
and particularly useful. When the schools were examined last 
spring, there were nearly 400 children in attendance. The 
schools at present in existence are efficiently conducted. The com- 
mon branches of education are taught in them all. The paro- 
chial teacher is qualified to teach mathematics, Latin, Greek, 
and French, but there are very few now who prosecute these stu- 
dies. His accommodation as to school-room, dwelling-house, and 
garden, is excellent. His salary is the maximum, but fees are ill 
paid. The people in general are more alive now to the benefits 
of education than they have been, though still there is vast room 
for improvement. Irregularity in attendance, and want of proper 
school-books, from inability to buy them, 'are serious drawbacks 
to the proficiency of the scholars. There is one part of the Mel- 
ness side where an additional school is decidedly required. It is 
removed at a considerable distance from the place where the As- 
sembly school is situated, and is separated by a large rivulet, 
which, from want of a bridge, is, for the most part, impassable in 
winter. Were a school got for this locality, upwards of forty chil- 
dren might attend it. 

Literature.— To years ago, a subscription library and a read- 
ing club were set on foot, through the strenuous and praiseworthy 
exertions of Mr Horsburgh, the local factor. The members of the 
library exceed 100. These, however, do not all belong to this pa- 
rish. Every member on admission pays 5s., and 2s. 6d. of yearly 
contribution. The number of volumes already amount to 435, 
consisting of a choice selection of books in theology, history, 
poetry, travels, memoirs, &amp;c. Many of them are donations re- 
ceived by Mr Horsburgh from his acquaintances in the south, and 
sent by others who have taken an interest in this promising inst,- 
ution The gentlemen of the club purchase new standard works, 
a i, instead of exposing them to sale at the year's end, they gra- 



TONGUE. 



183 



tiiitously transfer them to the library, and thus, while the country 
people generally are benefited by .them, the members of the club, 
who are all likewise members of the library, have still access to 
them. This plan since its adoption has been warmly commended. 
The noble family of Sutherland are so satisfied of its value that 
they resolve to patronize it. The Duke and Duchess, their Com- 
missioner, and the Member of Parliament for the county, have se- 
verally requested to be admitted members of both library and club, 
and each propose making a handsome donation to the former. 
The donation of the Duchess, consisting of 32 volumes, has been 
already received. 

Savings Banks. — There is a branch in this parish of the Su- 
therland Savings Bank, established in 1834, by the advice and 
under the direction of Mr Loch, M. P., Commissioner to the Duke 
of Sutherland. It extends over the whole county, and is divided 
into three general branches, which again are subdivided according 
to the parishes. The deposits and drawings in this parish since its 
commencement, are as follows:

The number of depositors at present is 35, composed chiefly 
of tradesmen, servants, and junior members of families. Four per 
cent, interest is given for sums under L.20. When the amount 
exceeds this sum, only 2 per cent, is allowed. 

Poor.— The average number of paupers for the last six years 
is 70. The funds for their relief are distributed yearly, and, as 
these are variable, the sum allotted to each cannot be permanent. 
The distributions to the different paupers range generally from 2s. 
to 10s., according to their peculiar circumstances. Church col- 
lections and an annual donation of L.6 from the Duke of Suther- 
land, which, united, amount on an average to L. 24, constitute 
the sole fund for their relief, at the disposal of the session. From 
this sum there are to be deducted small salaries for the kirk-officcr 
and session-clerk, and disbursements for assisting in the burial of 
those who die quite destitute. It is thus evident that the poor 
are mainly indebted for their support, not to the session funds, but 



184 SUTHERLANDSIIIUE. 

to the every-day charities and kind offices of relatives and neigh- 
bours. Yet, trifling as the sum given by the session is, the de- 
mands on them are increasing, and it is not considered now nearly 
so degrading to receive their aid as it was a few years ago. _ 

Besides those upon the poor's roll, there are a few who receive 
permanent charity in meal or otherwise, to the annual value o 
L 14 Is 3d., granted originally by the late Duchess-Countess ot 
Sutherland, and continued by his Grace the present Duke of 
Sutherland. Her Grace's kindness to aged widows and to re- 
spectable persons in reduced circumstances, was very considerate, 
and a most commendable trait in her character. It deserves to be 
noticed that, in 1837, a season of great scarcity in the Highlands, 
she gave meal to the poor of the parish to the value of about 
L 60, and supplied the small tenants with a great quantity at the 
purchase price,_the arrears of which have lately been remitted, 
amounting to about L. 200. The object of putting this meal to 
the accounts of the tenants was, not so much the expectation o 
ever realizing the money, as the desire that they should not feel 
themselves therein treated as paupers. 

Inns —There are only two houses licensed to sell spirits. One 
of these is a neat comfortable inn in the village of Tongue, which 
was considered a large house when built twenty years ago, though 
now it is frequently found deficient in the necessary accommoda- 

'°jteZ-Peat is the fuel commonly used by all classes. From 
its long continued and rapidly increasing consumption, the labour 
and expense of procuring it is now very great; and the more com- 
fortable inhabitants seem resolved to purchase coal m fu uie, as- 
sured that it will be found less expensive. Free access to pea 
however, is a mighty privilege to the common people, as it costs 
them nothing but their personal labour. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Many changes have taken place in the parish, since the former 
Account was drawn up. The first and most important is the - 
troduction of sheep-farming. The character oi this change wil 
be variously estimated, as persons are disposed to look at one or 
other of its effects. That it has rendered this country more valu- 
able to proprietors cannot be questioned,-for certain it is, that in 

IhP way could a great part of it be laid out to such advan- 
though may firly be questioned whetlr, by extending it 
loTfIr, tliey have not injured themselves. If, however, we are to

estimate this system by its bearing- on the former occnpiers of the 
soil, and by the circumstances into which it has brought their chil- 
dren, no friend of humanity can regard it but with the most pain- 
ful feelings. When introduced here, several hundreds, many of 
them of a grade quite superior to mere peasants, were driven from 
their beloved homes, where they and their fathers enjoyed peace 
and plenty. Some wandered to Caithness, others sought an asy- 
lum in the woods of America, but most, clinging with a passion to 
their native soil, located themselves by permission in hamlets near 
the shore. In these places the land, already occupied by a fewj 
but now divided among many, was totally inadequate to the main- 
tenance of all, and fishing became their necessary resource. And 
thus, on a tempestuous coast, with no harbours but such as na- 
ture provided, and in a country inaccessible, from want of roads, 
to enterprising curers, were these people often necessitated to 
plunge into debt for providing fishing materials, and to en- 
counter dangers, immensely increased by their unavoidable igno- 
rance of navigation, in order to obtain subsistence and defray their 
rents. The consequences were such as might be expected. Po- 
verty soon overtook them, tending to keep alive their lacerated 
feelings, and rents, which became gradually extravagant, accumu- 
lated into a mass of arrears. 

While such was the condition of the people, the proprietor, un- 
d9r whose management these changes were effected, found him- 
self under the necessity of selling the inheritance of his fathers, 
and the late Duke of Sutherland became sole proprietor of the 
parish.  This truly patriotic nobleman, fully alive to the evils which 
beset his new people, and the wants of this country, reduced the 
rents of the small tenants 30 per cent., and commenced a series 
of improvements, by opening up the country with excellent roads, 
at an enormous expense, and inducing public vehicles to run in se- 
veral directions ; by which, at once work was afforded for the people, 
and a stimulus given for a time to the herring-fishing. Like- 
wise, with the laudable object of rendering the tenantry more com- 
fortable, they were enjoined about the same time to build new 
houses, all being upon the same plan ; and, encouraged by the 
prospect of work, they soon set about this undertaking, though the 
houses were upon a scale far too expensive for their slender means.

In tlie meantime, li.e lamented death of the proprietor put a .top 
to improvemenLs, and many of the people were, by the huildincrof 
these very houses, more deeply than before plunged into debt. 
From this cause, from the failure of the fishing, and from a series 
of adverse seasons, arrears again accumulated to a great amount. 

Upon the accession of the present Duke of Sutherland, his at- 
tention was arrested by this evil ; and, persuaded that, to reclaim 
these arrears, was impossible, without ruining his people, he deter- 
mined to cancel the whole. In this parish, the arrears for rent 
alone amounted to L. 1582. This deed of princely generosity has 
not failed to make a suitable impression upon a people strongly 
susceptible of gratitude, and deserves to have a prominent pirce 
assigned it in any public account of the parish. After such con- 
duct, every one must feel that his Grace has the interest of his 
people deeply at heart. That their interest, however, may be 
really secured, it is absolutely necessary to open up for them sources 
of industry, to encourage such as are desirous to improve, and to 
introduce a different system of agriculture from the present amona 
the small tenants. ° 

Some of the large farms are susceptible of being extensively 
and profitably cidtivated ; but the farmers, from the amount of 
capital they have already at stake, and from the shortness of their 
leases, in which there are no extensive improving conditions, are 
prevented from cultivating as they might, and as some feel in- 
clined ; and the people are deprived of much work which they 
might otherwise have. And certainly it would be more satisfac- 
tory to see our labourers thus employed at home, than going o 
the south, where their morals are endangered : where their°ex- 
penses eat up a great proportion of their earnings ; and where, 
very frequently, they are disabled for a length of time by diseases 
caught in the wretched lodging-houses, to which they must have 
recourse, and whence they often carry infection to their native 
cou ntry. 

As to the agriculture of the small tenants, wretched as it is at 
present, it is capable of great improvement. The foundation of 
the evils now attending both it and them, is not the amount of 
rent, Iut the smaliness of the crofts. J'his it is which debars a 
proper rotation, and which causes rents to be ill paid. And 
though, by the concurrence of favourable circumstances, and a 
powerful stimulus to the feelings, calling forth micommon exer- 
tion on the part of the tenants, the routs may lie defraved once

or twice, this cannot be expected to continue. For it must be 
evident, that when a people, depending mainly on the land for 
their sustenance, cannot be supported thereby more than seven or 
eight months, which is the case in most seasons with the tenantry 
of this parish, they must expend whatever little money may be 
collected in different ways, in providing the staff of life during the 
remainder of the year. Were, however, the crofts of the tenants 
enlarged to twice their present size, and fenced in, so as to admit 
of a proper rotation, then they would be adequate to their main- 
tenance ; and the sale of cattle, decently fed, would enable them 
with ease to pay a full rent; whilst the produce of any day labour 
would, as it certainly should, be at their own disposal. Now, 
there is scarcely a hamlet in the parish in which the arable land 
might not be doubled. That the people themselves, who have 
only one year's tenure of their land, and who can only liquidate 
their debts by work, for which they are paid in cash, should im- 
prove so extensively, is not to be expected. If done at all, the 
proprietor must pay them for their labour until a crop is efficiently 
laid down ; then a rent may be exacted, which would bring in a 
handsome interest on the outlay. 

There are many families, however, in great destitution, who 
have at present no land ; who could not, therefore, be benefited 
by, the foregoing plan. Were sources of industry opened up, 
some of these might thereby be supported. But the most satis- 
factory method of disposing of these would be, to locate them in 
villages at the several fishing-stations ; to build commodious har- 
bours ; to encourage enterprising curers to settle among them ; 
and to secure a market for every species of fish : and thus, while 
the former depended wholly on the land, these should be made 
to depend wholly on the sea. Though the herring might occa- 
sionally fail, vast quantities of other fish could be caught on the 
coast, which are at present never brought to market ; and, as 
there is a probability that a steamer will soon ply on this coast 
from Caithness to Liverpool, a great inducement is held out to 
prosecute this trade with vigour. By this communication, all the 
exports of the country could obtain a ready market in the south. 

In conclusion, the writer expresses his full conviction, the re- 
sult of long observation, and many anxious thoughts on the sub- 
ject, that unless such, or some such plans are adopted regarding 
the interesting peasantry of his parish, the time will soon arrive 
when there will be no alternative but emigration, at the expense

either of landlord or Government ; a poor law assessment, or, 
■worse than either, a summary and universal ejection. Yet, rely- 
ing on the wealth and patriotic feelings of the Noble proprietor, 
and on the skill and intelligence of his agents, he confidently ex- 
pects that these sore evils will be prevented, and that the next 
Statistical Account will have to record an improvement in the as- 
pect of the parish, and an amelioration in the condition of the 
people, which will be alike profitable and honourable to all par- 
ties.

PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 

CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. DONALD ROSS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — This parish appears to have taken its name from the 
farm on which the church stands, now known as Loth-more, to 
distinguish it from the neighbouring farm of Loth-beg. Until 
the beginning of the seventeenth century, these two farms border- 
ed upon two lakes, which were formed by the river of the Glen 
of Loth being retarded in its progress to the sea, and hemmed in, 
in hollow. spaces of the low flat grounds, by a rocky eminence that 
runs parallel to the sea shore. A new course for the river was 
cut in a direct line to the sea, and through the solid rock, at the 
above period; and since that alteration, the spaces occupied by the 
lakes have been converted into rich arable land, although the extent 
and banks of the lakes can still be traced. The present name of 
Loth, which in Gaelic is still pronounced Logh, is, therefore, be- 
lieved to be a corruption of the word Loch, which, in the Scotch 
dialect, is descriptive of a sheet of water, in the same sense as the 
word in old German signified, — namely, apcrtura, hiatus, or cavitas 
rotunda ; or, as Cambden has it, " a place xohere rivers are stop- 
ped." This etymology also ngrees with the spelling of the 
name in ancient writings; and thus, in a Crown charter of the 
year 1451, the present Loth-more, — the site of the church and 

 Dia«-n by George Sutherland Taylor, Esq. Golspit-. 



LOTH. 



189 



manse, — is called " Ville de Estirfoc," the same being situated 
to the eastward of Loth-beg. The glen, also, through which the 
river of Loth flows is, in old writings, called " the Glen of Loth," 
and not Glen-Loth, as it is now most frequently named; thereby 
denoting that the glen was an appendage to the farm of Loth, 
instead of having a descriptive or distinct name of its own. 

It may be added, however, as a remarkable fact connected with 
this name, that Ptolemy places the Logi along the sea coast, of 
which the south boundary of the present parish of Loth forms a 
part; the Ila jlumen the river Ullie or Helmsdale being in 
their country, which seemed to extend between Veruhium promon- 
torium the Ord of Caithness and Rija alta, the Ardross range 
of mountains towards Tarbetness. And Richard of Cirencester, 
in his description of Caledonia, assigns the same locality to the 
Logi, and says, after naming the CantcB, and Promontorium Pe- 
noxullum, the high ground of the present Oykill, " Huic ordine 
proximus est fluvius Abona the Dornoch Frith ejusdemque ac- 
colse Logi. Hinc Ila fluvius," &amp;c. 

Boundaries, Extent, Topographical Appearances. — The parish 
extends in a straight line from west to east, about eleven miles 
in length; and its breadth, where broadest, from Ben-Uarie to 
the sea, is about five miles. The boundary line, if taken at 
the sea shore at the Bay of Kintradwell, proceeds northward 
to the top of Kollieben, and thence along a ridge of high hills, 
and in a half-circular sweep, by west and north, to the top of 
Ben-Uarie, 1923 feet high, and then eastward by the sum- 
mit of the high ground between the Strath of Kildonan and the 
glen of Loth, and, intersecting the top of the Crask, on to Ben 
Veallich, 1888 feet high, and to the top of Knock Elderaboll ; 
thence, down to the plane of the Strath of Kildonan and the river 
Helmsdale, at a point about three miles above the mouth of that 
river. Thereafter, following the river downwards for about one 
mile, the march ascends the east side of the valley, and, running 
nearly parallel with the line of sea coast, and at a distance of about 
two miles from it, terminates to the north of the Hill of the Ord, 
at the march with the county of Caithness. From this last point 
to the sea, the boundary between Sutherland and Caithness forms 
also the eastern boundary of the parish, and runs southward to the 
steep front of the Ord at the sea, and is marked out by a low turf 
wall, erected about thirty-five years ago, when this part of the 
march between the two counties, as to which there existed some 



190

differences, was finally adjusted and fixed by arbitration. From 
the Ord to the Bay of Kintradwell, the sea shore is the southern 
boundary. The parish of Loth is therefore bounded on the west 
by the parish of Clyne; on the north by the parish of Kildonan ; 
on the east by the parish of Latheron ; and on the south by the 
German Ocean, or rather by that part of it distinguished as the 
Moray Frith, which is here about forty miles broad. 

The whole length of the parish along its northern boundary is dis- 
tinguished by a ridge of high hills, which slope down towards the 
.south with a steep descent, except at the contracted opening form- 
ed by the Strath of Kildonan, where the march crosses the low 
grounds of the valley from the summits of the hills that enclose 
it. This lofty range is placed nearly parallel with the hue of sea 
coast which limits the parish to the south, and at a distance of 
from one to three miles from it ; the intervening space between 
the hills and the sea being either gently sloping ground, partially 
.cultivated, and otherwise yielding sound natural pasture ; or a le- 
vel flat of rich alluvial soil, all arable, and in a high state of culti- 
vation ; but at the eastern extremity of the parish, the huge head- 
land of the Ord leaves no intermediate space between the moun-. 
tain and the sea, but forms a sheer and abrupt wall, rising with 
great majesty from, and towering above, the ever-heaving and deep 
sea, whose only strand, at the lowest tides, is the perpendicular 

face of the rock. 

This headland of the Ord has been at all times an object of 
great interest to strangers; and before the present Parliamentary 
road from Sutherland into Caithness was formed, in the year 181 1, 
the path— for it did not deserve the name of a road— along the 

- The oldest name of the Ord, with the exception of VeruMum promontonum of 
Ptolemy, obi found in ancient 'writings, is Mon. Mound, -'"'=h.»PPf"V", f,"- 
rious "-eoffraphical fragment headed " Ue Situ Albania:," and which has been attri-

counties of Sutherland and Caithness, suys : " Septima enim pars est Cathanesia 
citra montem et ultra montem ; quid Mans Mound M Catbanesimn pe medMin,. 
In the geographical collections in the Advocates' Library, called M"'=f«' 
several references are also made to the Ord. Thus: " All that tract of -Incl 
lies betwixt Port.na.couterthe Dornoch Frith and Dungsbny,  Duncansbay head  
was of old called Caltey. That part of it which lies eastward ftom the hill J

outer edge of the rock, and witliont any protection from the pre- 
cipice tliat overhangs the sea, could not, with any degree of safe- 
ty, be passed in stormy weather, and never failed to inspire indi- 
viduals not accustomed to such passes, with great dread ; and 
among other travellers of the last century who describe the ter- 
rors of the passage across the Ord, the Rev. John Brand, in his 
Description of Orkney, Shetland, and Caithness in the year 1701, 
says, " The Ord which divideth Caithness from Sutherland is a 
high mountain, as the name Ord, which in Irish signifieth an height, 
doth imply, down which our way from Caithness to Sutherland 
doth lie. The road is but narrow, and the descent steep, and if 
any stumble thereupon, they are in hazard of falling down a pre- 
cipice into the sea at the bottom of the rock, which is very terrible 
to behold ; but who pass it for the more security, use to lead their 
horses to the foot of the hill, which is about a short mile in length, 
and no other way there is from Sutherland to Caithness, or from 
Caithness to Sutherland, but this, except we go 12 miles about." 

The Glen of Loth is a narrow opening of about three miles in- 
extent, surrounded by the highest hills in the parish, and is one 
of those wild glens, characteristic of a Highland district, which the 
superstition of former ages invested with traditional tales of wonder 
and terror. The glen, at the foot of an abrupt and prominent 
hill called Drumderg, was the scene of a bloody conflict between 
the men of Strathnaver and those of Loth in the sixteenth cen- 
tury ; and it possesses several objects to which the traditions of 
the country have given celebrity. Thus, a large cairn, called 
Cairn-Bran, marks the place where Ossian's dog Bran is said to 
have died, and been buried. At Cairn-in-iiag, an ancient hunt- 
ing-house stood. Tuber Massan is the name of a well of excel- 
lent water, which, in former ages, was resorted to as a specific for 
almost all diseases, provided silver or gold was left in the water 
for the officiating priest. Clack Mac-meas is a huge upright 
stone, which a precocious youth, at the tender age of one month, 
in that interesting period of the world's history, when " giants of 
mighty bone and bold emprise," dwelt in the land, hurled to the 
bottom of the glen from the top of Ben-Uarie. Carrihen-cligh 
are four stone pillars on an elevated barrow, that point out the 
resting-place of some leading men of a remote period ; and con- 
nected with this glen, and forming the very close and singular 
sides of a small burn that runs into it, are the lofty clifTs called 
Craig. Boddich and Craig-Bhokir, remarkable not only for their

towering and perpendicular height, but for the very narrow space 
. that separates them. 

The arable portion of the parish, between the hills along its 
northern boundary and the sea, is generally flat, and its naturally 
rich and fertile soil is well cultivated. The ravines formed by 
mountain streams, which intersect the south side of the hills at 
distances of two or three miles, are striking features in the land- 
scape ; particularly one of them, AultMlie, which is a remarkably 
deep, tortuous, and romantic gully. The sea coast is, with the 
exception of a few low rocky headlands, sandy and shallow, from 
the western extremity of the parish to Port-Gower; and thence 
to the Ord, the shore is one continued line of rock or rough gravel ; 
but no part of the coast aff"ords any natural protection for shipping. 

Meteorology. — The changes of the atmosphere have not been 
registered or ascertained by continued observations in this parish. 
The complete range of high hills that forms the northern and 
eastern boundaries of the parish, affords great shelter from the 
cold and piercing winter, and spring winds from these quarters ; 
and consequently, during the prevalence of such winds, the greater 
mildness of the atmosphere in this parish, compared with that 
along the more exposed sea coast on the Caithness side of the 
Ord, is often remarked by persons travelling between the two 
counties. The opening of the Strath of Kildonan at Helmsdale 
may be an exception to this remark, for there the wind, when high 
and coming down from the strath, is felt with peculiar violence. 
The parish is decidedly healthy, and instances of longevity are 
common ; and at present, a small tenant and his wife, whose 
ages are not correctly known, have been united in marriage for the 
long period of eighty years. There are no distempers peculiar to 
the parish; but in 1832, Asiatic cholera appeared very suddenly, 
and for the first time n6rth of Aberdeen, at Helmsdale, durmg 
the busiest period of the herring fishery, and in that town and 
neighbourhood between thirty and forty persons died of it. This 
mysterious disease was believed to have been introduced into the 
parish by some fishermen who then arrived at Helmsdale from 
the Frith of Forth, where the disease was raging at the time ; and 
it is certain that the first person who was seized with it in the pa- 
rish, was a female while in the act of washing clothes, belonging to

one of the fishermen who came from an infected quarter near 
Edinburgh. 

Hydrography. — The Moray Frith, the stuarium Vararis of 
Ptolemy, and the Breidajiord of the Northern sagas, is here a 
wide and stormy sea, without any islands. The projecting and 
bluff headland of the Ord affects the currents along the shore; 
and these currents, in the opinion of many practical fishermen, in- 
fluence and direct the progress and course of those shoals of her- 
rings which annually visit this coast ; and hence, a continuance of 
the success which has attended the herring fishery at Helmsdale, 
since it has been regularly prosecuted there, may be found to rest 
on more certain and durable causes than are generally supposed to 
exist. Thesaltnessof theseawateroffthe Ordhasbeen analyzed, and 
it has been ascertained to be much greater than that of water taken at 
Tarbartness, at the opening of the Dornoch Frith ; while the water 
at the latter point contains about double the quantity of salt found in 
water taken within the Frith, between thetownsofDornochaud Tain. 
There are now no lakes within the parish, and the onlyriversare those 
of the Glen of Loth and the Helmsdale, which last flows for about 
three miles along or within the parish, before it enters the sea at 
Helmsdale. The Helmsdale is a large and handsome stream ; 
but, having had no bridge across it until 1811, it retarded travel- 
lers ; and Pennant, in his tour in the northern counties in 1769, 
records, that he had to " ford the very dangerous water of Helms- 
dale, rapid and full of great stones." 

Geology. — The high hills of the parish present a steep front to 
the south, and are of primary formation, being composed of por- 
phyritic granite, chiefly of a brown colour, but often reddish and 
sometimes gray. This stone is fragile, and, as it cannot be quar- 
ried in large blocks, or formed into well-proportioned shapes, 
it is of little use for building. This stone is also distinguished 
by different degrees of coarseness in its grains, and by the pre- 
sence of veins of a large size. Thus, in the bed of the river 
Helmsdale, close to the march with Kildonan, a fine-grained por- 
phyry occurs ; and at Lothbeg, and thence to the west end of the 
parish, the same rock is a very rude compound, with large veins, 
in which felspar predominates, and which yield readily to the ac- 
tion of running water. 

In Mr Cunningham's Geognostical Account of the County of 
Sutherland, published in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, 
No. 46, that gentleman includes the coast side, or low-lying sec- 
tion of this parish, as part of the district in which the oolite se-

rics which he describes is developed ; and as his description is nii- 
nute and interesting, it is added in a note below  

About one-half of the whole stretch of sea coast ni this parish, or 
from the west end of it to Port Gower, is a sandy beach, with the 
exception of low rocks covered during full tides, but forming nar- 
row promontories during low water, which, at irregular intervals, 
break the uniformity of the sandy beach ; and, with the exception 
also of occasional deposits of boulder stones of various rocks, pn-

niitive, transition, and secondary, which the storms of centuries 
have collected in the bay of Kintradwell, and in one or two simi- 
lar localities. From Port Gower to the extremity of the parish at 
the Ord, the sea shore is formed of one continued and rugged mar- 
gin of limestone, part of the oolitic formation referred to by Mr 
Cunningham. This stone has often been burnt into lime, which 
was found to be of excellent quahty ; but the extra expense of fuel 
at a place remote from coal markets, increased the expense of the 
manufacture beyond the price at which English lime can be de- 
livered in the parish ; and besides, the encroachments of the sea 
on this coast require that the natural rocky barrier, which present- 
ly exists, should not be weakened or reduced by the removal of 
any part of it. 

Zoology. — The only rare species of animal now found in the 
parish is the red-deer {Cerviis elaphus, which occasionally wan- 
der from the interior recesses of the county, into the corries and 
passes of Ben Uarie and Ben Veallich. The fox, once so destruc- 
tive to the farmer, has been extirpated ; and one of the last wolves 
killed in the county of Sutherland was destroyed in the Glen of 
Loth, some time between the years 1690 and 1700  

The cattle, sheep, horses, and hogs, reared in the parish, are 
all superior animals, and often obtain the highest prizes, when ex- 
hibited at public competitions. The fishes that may be said to 
belong to Loth are extremely important and valuable. The sal- 
mon of the Helmsdale are of a large size, and the river being 
fished by the proprietor, the Duke of Sutherland, the utmost at- 
tention is directed to the proper mode of fishing, which annually 
closes two weeks before the legal period, in order to allow a 
greater number of spawning fish to ascend the river; and the 
spawning-beds and fry are afterwards carefully protected ; but no 
peculiarity in the habits of the fish have been observed in this 
river. Of sea fish, the herring is the most valuable, and when 
they approach this part of the coast in the months of July and 
August, are in prime condition, and of very superior quality. Cod 
are also got in great numbers, and excel in quality and size those 
obtained in the upper waters of the Frith ; and abundance of had- 
dock, skate, and whiting are constantly obtained. Turbot are 
plentiful at a distance of some miles from the coast; but the fisher- 
men have no inducement to follow the deep-sea fishing. Lobsters 
and crabs are, at present, very numerous, but the former were so 
Scrope's Art of Deer Stalking contains an account of this occurrence.

severely fished some years ago, by fishing- smacks, for tlie London 
market, that it was, for some time thereafter, thought that the lob- 
ster had been exterminated along the coast. 

Botany. — Rare native plants are seldom met with in the parish ; 
but the cultivated vegetable productions are important and of the 
best quality. With the exception of a clump of Scotch firs at 
Kintradwell, and some stately sycamore and ash-trees at Kilmote, 
and a few straggling young trees at Midgarty and Port Gower, 
there is no growing wood in the parish. The grains raised in the 
arable lands, are of superior quality, and ripen early and with little 
risk, even in unfavourable seasons. The deep carse soil in the 
centre of the parish, yields all descriptions of grain,— wheat, barley, 
oats, beans, and pease ; but the quality of the barley of this dis- 
trict is so superior, that its cultivation is the chief object of the 
farmer; and large parcels of this grain have been raised of late years 
in the parish, which weighed 57 lb. per bushel ; while one small 
parcel raised at Crakaig weighed 59 lb. The herbage of the 
hills and moorlands, however, do not excel similarly situated pas- 
turages in their neighbourhood ; and no rare plants appear in the 
uncultivated lands, unless we enumerate as such, Eriop/iorum, in 
boggy places ; Primula farinosa, in two or three plats of meadow ; 
Viola hitea in sheltered slopes of rivulets ; and the fragrant My- 
rica gale, in marshes and soft grounds. Vaccinium myrtillus, the 
blaeberry, and V. oxycoccos, afford their wild native fruits, along 
some of the sides of the highest mountains ; and V. vitis-idcBo, 
the red bilberry, is common in less elevated moorlands. The 
steep and comparatively dry sides of the hills to the north of 
Navidale are adorned with some of the richest and most luxu- 
riant furze-bushes, Ulex EuropcBus, to be met with in the north of 
Scotland, and which, when brilliant with their splendid golden 
blossoms, far exceed in wild beauty and richness, any other of our 
native plants, and invest with credit the anecdote of Lmnaeus, 
who, for the first time, saw the furze on his visit to England m 
1736, and was so enraptured with it, that it is said he fell on his 
knees in order to admire its bright blossoms. Another common 
plant, the spear-thistle, Carduus lanceolatus, rears its stately 
and barbed-head, along the line of the old road across the 
Ord, in such great numbers as to justify the assertion, that the 
national emblem of Scotland is the decorative crest of the bold 
sea-front of the Ord,— one of the most characteristic headlands of 
ancient Caledonia. In the barren shingle along the sea shore, 



LOTH. 197 

between Helmsdale and the Ord, Pulmonaria maritima, a rare 
plant on the northern shores, attracts attention by its beautiful 
azure leaves. The rocky parts of the coast of the parish also fur- 
nish several species of Fuci, and, in such abundance that, before 
the reduction in the price of the kelp, about thirty tons of kelp were 
annually manufactured in the parish ; but the present price of the 
article would not pay the expense of manufacturing it ; and no sea- 
ware has been burnt for several years past. The best known species 
of Fuci on this coast, are Fucus digitatus, F. palmatus, F. vesiculo- 
sus, F. nodosus, F. serratus, and F.jilum. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is no separate history of this parish known to exist ; but 
many events and occurrences connected with its annals are recorded 
in Sir Robert Gordon's History of the Earldom of Sutherland, 
which was written in the year 1630. 

The only direct land route to Caithness, and by the Pentland 
Firth to Orkney, being through this parish, it has, at different 
times, witnessed the march of hostile forces, and has often been 
the scene of disturbance and violence. During the inroads of the 
Northmen in, and preceding, the twelfth century, the coast of Loth 
appears to have been often visited by these daring invaders; and 
Helmsdale, a name evidently derived from them, is believed to be 
identical with the name " Hialmaidal" which occurs in one 
of the northern sagas. In the year 1198, the parish received a 
royal visit, on the occasion of King William the Lion's march 
into Caithness, to revenge the cruel death of John Bishop of Caith- 
ness ; for an ancient MS. descriptive of his expedition states, 
that the King had a great army, " and marched till he came to 
Eysteinsdale,— there are the boundaries of Katanes and Sudrland, 
—the camp of the King of Scots stretched along the Dais, and that 
is a very long way." These Dales are believed to have been the 
valleys of Kildonan, terminating at Helmsdale, and Strathmore in 
Caithness, which communicate with each other, " and that is a 
very long way;" and in the last of which valleys, there is a place 
still called Easterdale. 

During the turbulent ages that succeeded King William's ex- 

' " During King William's absence, Harold Earl of Orkney and Caitlmess ap- 
prehended John Bishop of Caithness, cut out his tongue, and put out his eyes, for 
having opposed some designs of his at Court. For wliich King William upon his 
return, caused the Karl to be apprehended, cut out his tongue, pulled out his eyes, 
aiid tiien hanged him upon a gibbet. These things happened in the year 1198."—

pedition, Lotli, being a border parish, was exposed to all the sud- 
den inroads and craiclis arising from the hostility which the inha- 
bitants of two adjoining districts, separated by a marked natural 
barrier, such as Sutherland and Caithness are, fostered against 
each other, before the blessings of regular government and the 
impartial administration of equal laws, were experienced; and the 
parish also suffered very much from the lawless depredations 
committed by fugitives, and persons of desperate character, who 
sought for temporary shelter amidst the solitary recesses of the 
Ord ; and the tales still, or very lately, lingering in the neigh- 
bourhood, with reference to these freebooters between the two 
counties, agree in spirit and tendency, with the sympathy expres- 
sed in some of the popular ballads of the period, in such terms, as, 

Alas  that e'er such laws were made, 

To hang ft man for gear ; 
Either for stealing cow or sheep, 

Or yet for horse or mare : 
Had not the laws then heen so strict, 

1 had never lost ray joy ; 
But now he lodges with Auld Nick 

That hanged my Gilderoy." 

But, notwithstanding the existence of this popular feeling, it is 
stated in Sir Robert Gordon's History, that, in the year 1617, a 
gibbet was erected on the top of the Ord, where « some notable 
robbers that exercised all kynd of thift, and other misdemeanors 
in Southerland, Catteynes, and Rosse, were hanged." 

The disastrous battle of Floudden was fought on 9th Septem- 
ber 1513, and, shortly before then, a gallant body of Caithness- 
men headed by their Earl, marched through this parish on their 
way to ioin the Scottish army. These brave men and their lead- 
er met; with an honourable death on the field of battle ; but as 
they happened, when leaving Caithness, to- cross the Ord on a 
Monday, and were dressed in a green uniform, there still exists a 
popular aversion among the natives of the district, to take a 
journey over the Ord on that day of the week, or in a green-co- 

°"piin°g over those other historical events connected with this 
parish, which are already before the public, in Sir Robert Gor- 
don's History, the next prominent occurrence was the appearance 
of about 700 Argyle Highlanders on their march into Caithness, 
in the summer of 1679, in order to support the I'"gMf f ° 
the Earldom of Caithness, which had been granted on 28th June 
1G77 in favour of John Campbell of Glenorchy, afterwards creat- 



LOTH.

ed Earl of BreatlalDane. This expedition, which terminated in 
the battle of Altimarlach, to the westward of Wick, is rennarkable 
as indicating the peculiar condition of Scotland at that compara- 
tively recent period, which admitted a subject to arm his vassals, 
and wage war, in support of his private legal claims. It was dur- 
ing the march northwards of the men of Glenorchy, on this occa- 
sion, that ihe well known quickstep airs, " The Campbells are 
coming," and " The Braes of Glenorchy," obtained their names. 

The Rebellions in 1715 and 1745, occasioned the arming of the 
male population of this parish, in support of the reigning dynasty. 
During the retreat of the insurgents before the battle of Culloden, 
in 1746, Lord Loudon was stationed in Dornoch, with some com- 
panies of the King's troops ; but, hearing of the advance into Ross- 
shire of a large force under the Duke of Perth, with the intention 
of attacking him, Lord Loudon and his men abruptly retired to 
the westward, leaving the whole county of Sutherland unprotect- 
ed. The Earl of Cromarty, with a considerable force, instantly 
marched through Sutherland into Caithness, with the intention of 
collecting together such men in that latter county, as might be in- 
clined to join the rebel army ; and the Earl's men, among other 
outrages committed by them against individuals and private pro- 
perty, burnt, in this parish, the mansion-houses of Kintradwell and 
Crakaig, and disinterred the corpse of a person recently interred 
in the burying-ground at Navidale, who had been the relative of 
a zealous royalist at that place, and left the partly decayed body 
in his bed, — he having previously fled from his home on the ap- 
proach of the enemy. These proceedings exasperated the parish 
people ; and two of Lord Cromarty's officers, who had wandered 
into the glen of Loth, on their return from Caithness, were killed 
there by three countrymen who met them. Before the return 
from Caithness of this invading force, the militia of the county had 
time to assemble, and having attacked them to the west of Golspie, 
the Earl of Cromarty's forces were defeated in a running fight 
between Rhives and the Little Ferry, and the Earl, and almost 
all his officers and men who were not slain, were taken prisoners. 
This occurred two days before the battle of Culloden was fought ; 
and while the Earl was hurrying south to join the rebel army. 

Land-owners.— E.IS Grace the Duke and Earl of Sutherland is 
heritor of the whole parish, which, at all times, formed part of 
the ancient Earldom of Sutherland. 

Parochial Registers. — Tliere is no register of births and mar-

riages for this parish, of any earlier date than the close of the last 
century ; and this is a defect common to almost all the neighbour- 
ing parishes, which has been often attended with the most vexa- 
tio°us and injurious consequences to persons in humble life, who 
required to establish their propinquity to deceased and remote re- 
latives. Older registers may have existed ; but, as there was no 
legal provision for the care and preservation of such records, the 
system under which they were entrusted to the parish schoolmas- 
ters, afforded little or no security for their preservation. All pa- 
rish registers are now under better and safer management than 
formerly ; but many persons who have directed their attention to 
the matter, are convinced, that, as national records, the parish 
registers of Scotland admit of being placed under more strict con- 
trol, and more certain protection, than have yet been devised for 
insuring their full public benefits. 

Antiquities.— The old Castle of Helmsdale, situate on an ele- 
vated green bank, close to the River of Helmsdale, where it min- 
gles with the sea water, is the only remarkable ruin now remaining 
in the parish. The date of its erection is not known : but the bmlding 
is of that square form, with sharp angles, generally attributed to 
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in the north of Scotland. 
It was a hunting-seat of the Sutherland family, adjoining the old 
deer-forest of Sledale, and the Ord, and is distinguished m the 
annals of the county, as the place where John, the eleventh Earl 
of Sutherland, and his Countess, were both poisoned m July 1567, 
in a diabolical, but fortunately abortive attempt to poison the 
whole family, and thereby divert the succession to their honours 
and estates, out of the direct line of descent. Several of those 
very ancient edifices, known as circular or Pictidi towers, stood 
formerly in the parish of Loth, and one of them, at Lothbeg, was 
entire It the time Pennant visited the county m 1769. It is now 
only distinguished as a circular cairn of small atones Another of 
these towers stood at Wilkhouse ; one to the east of Midgar y ; and 
a very large one, called Dun-Phail, crowned the brow of the high 
ground, close to the public road, and about half-way between 
Port Gower and Helmsdale. The foundation of this last tower 
could only be traced of late years, and the large stones forming 
that foundation have been dug up recently for budding purposes 
The old Hunting House in the Glen of Loth, of which Pennant 
gives a plan, has also disappeared.

In the west side of the steep bank of the Kintradwell Burn, an 
artificial opening or cave, and bnilt and roofed with stone, called 
Cosli-geavag, now shut by an accumulation of soil and rubbish, is 
said to lead to subterranean apartments, which, from descriptions 
given by persons who entered them, before the mouth of the cave 
became impeded, are . supposed to have been places of refuge or 
sepulchre. At a remote period, a chapel, called after St Ninian, 
stood at Navidale, and another, called John the Baptist's Chapel, 
close to the present bridge of Helmsdale ; and at both these places, 
there are burying-grounds, still used as such. Another of these 
chapels stood at Easter Garty, the ruins of which are still recol- 
lected ; and it is said that a fourth stood at Kintradwell, called St 
TruUew's Chapel, although the existence of this last one is not 
certain. Several barrows and tumuli are scattered throughout the 
parish, and the heads of ancient stone battle-axes have been found 
in some cairns supposed to point out the resting-place of persons 
slain in conflicts ; and at Strone-Rungie, a low-lying point of the 
coast between Culgower and Wester Garty, a number of battle 
cairns still mark the place where it is said foreign invaders were 
successfully opposed and overcome. 

III. — Population. 
The population of Loth has been, for several years past, and is 
rapidly increasing. The early state of its population cannot be 
traced satisfactorily ; but some occasional facts have been ascerr 
tained, which warrant the conclusion, that the number of inhabi- 
tants was stationary for the last two hundred years, until about the 
year 1811. Thus, in February 1651, the " Committee of War," for 
the shire, in fixing the number of men for a militia regiment. 



allocated those from the parish of Loth as follows : 

" Clynetraidwall and two davochs of Lotlibeg, ... 7 men. 

The three davoch lands ofCracaik and ye davoch of Lothe and ye glen . 7

Navidaill, . . ...... 2

These numbers of selected fighting men bear about the same 
proportion to the strength of the regiment then raised, which the 

viz. one on each side, and a third by way of covering. These arc made with tlio 
vast lags this country is famous for. At the extremity, is a larger .ip.irtment. of an 
oval figure, probably the quarters of the chieftain. Tlie passage or gallery is witliout

parish afforded of males able to carry arms, and between the ages 
of 16 and 60, in the year of the last Rebellion 1745, when nearly 
3000 men were enrolled as militiamen, on the estate of Suther- 
land. At this last period, the relative proportion also of men from 
each of the townships, does not much differ from the allocation in 
1651,— thus:

The Government returns give the following result for this pa- 
rish : 

In 1801, the population was 1374 
1811 : . 1330 

1821, • 2008 

1831. . • 2234 

This increase is to be attributed to the successful establishment 
of the herring-fishery at Helmsdale, and to the settlement of se- 
veral small tenants in that track of improvable land, chiefly near 
the coast, from Port Gower to Navidale. These causes of the 
increase have been in very active operation since the date of the 
last Government census, and, without attempting to anticipate, m 
exact numbers, the probable increase since that period, by trust- 
ing to any less authentic data than the census to be taken in the 
present year, it is believed by the reporter, that the increase will 
at least equal that which has occurred during the last two decades, 
or between the years 1811 and 1831. 

The erection of houses in Helmsdale, which, with the excep- 
tion of Port Gower, is the only village in the parish, is not only 
annually on the increase : but the accommodation they afford, and 
the style of building, are improving. This town, begun in 1 R 1 8, has 
beenregularly and steadily increasing since then; and the houses be- 
ing all new, and substantially built, and all roofed with slatesor tiles, 
and the streets regular, the general appearance of the whole place 
is as pleasing to a stranger as the prosperity of its principal trade, 
and the internal comforts of its dwelUngs, have been important 
and creditable to the inhabitants. 

There is no marked peculiarity in the habits of the people of the 
parish or in their style or manner of dress. They are generally 
frugal in their mode of living, but have a laudable anxiety to ap-

pear at all times in becoming and respectable apparel. The na- 
tive language of the country people is Gaelic, but almost all of 
them speak or understand English, and it may be said that all 
young persons, male and female, are able to read and write. The 
baneful but often alluring vices of poaching and smuggling have 
long ago ceased within the parish, in consequence, chiefly, of the 
superior and comfortable condition in which almost all the heads 
of families in it are placed, as tenants holding directly, at very mo- 
derate rents, under their landlord, independent of intermediate dic- 
tation over their time and industry ; and which healthy position pre- 
cludes all desire to engage in the ruinous practice of illegal of- 
fences. The general character of the population is that of a decid- 
edly moral, religious, and industrious people ; and nowhere are the 
safety and security of individuals, and the rights of property, more 
respected and upheld, and less interfered with, than in the parish 
of Loth. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The arable lands may conveniently be classed in- 
to large farms, and the allotments possessed by small tenants. 
There are seven large farms in the parish, which, besides valuable 
ranges of low-lying and hill pastures, have among them ] 182 acres 
of arable land, equal in fertility to any others in the county. 
These farms are held under leases of nineteen years endurance, 
and are laboured under the five years shift of husbandry, having 
annually one-fifth part in fallow, turnips, potatoes, or other green 
crop ; one-fifth part in grass one year old ; one-fifth part in grass 
two years old ; and not more than two-fifth parts in corn crop. 
All the farms are conveniently subdivided, and enclosed with sub- 
stantial stone dikes, and the farm buildings are modern and suitable. 

The lands held by the small tenants are also laboured with con- 
siderable skill and industry ; and each tenant raises annually bar- 
ley or bear, oats, and potatoes, besides small patches of turnips and 
sown grasses, and maintains one or more cows, and often rears his 
young cattle, and possesses one of the small hardy horses of the 
country, and a few of the small native sheep, besides swine and 
poultry in abundance. Their cottages, formerly very rude and 
mean, have been wisely removed by themselves, in situations where 
they were placed on improvable land, to more sterile parts of their 
lots, iti order to convert all that can be rendered arable into corn 
land ; and hence, the comfortable stone cottages, of improved con- 
struction, which they now occupy, are generally placed on the 



204 



SUTHERLANDSHUIE. 



highest ridges and more rocky eminences of the different town- 
ships. The industry with which the trenching and improving of 
hitherto waste land is carried on by these small tenants, is easily ac- 
counted for, when it is stated, that no advance of rent follows in con- 
sequence of any improvement or progressive amelioration of the soil ; 
that the whole benefits resulting from these causes have been enjoy- 
ed exclusively by the tenants, and thatthe rents have been placed on 
such a reasonable scale, that there was not a single sixpence of the 
rents of the whole parish left unpaid on last audit day; and thatsuch 
a proceeding as a distraint for rent has not been known among these 
tenants, for a long period of years. In addition to these mighty 
advantages, the whole allotments of the small tenants are very ju- 
diciously intersected by branch roads, along which the important 
article of fuel,— peats of excellent quality,— are readily carted home 
from the neighbouring hill mosses, and the necessary removal of 
manure and other field operations are effected with great facility. 

Fisheries.— The most important fisheries belonging to the pa- 
rish, are those of salmon in the river Helmsdale, and the herring- 
fishery at the village of Helmsdale. The former has been cele- 
brated from the oldest period of which we have record, as produc- 
tive and valuable. For several years past, the river has been fish- 
ed directly by the servants of the proprietor, who, avoiding all 
close and severe fishing, and taking every means to protect the 
spawning fish when ascending the river, and the fry afterwards, 
besides closing the fishing season, at least two weeks before the 
time fixed by law, and which is also done in all the other rivers 
on the estates of Sutherland, thus guard, by all available means, 
this fine salmon stream from the evils of too close and extermmat- 
ino- a system of fishing, so often complained of, when tenants oc- 
cupy such fishings. The fish are disposed of by contraet, at a 
certain price per pound, and are sent off in a fresh state in ice to 

the London market. 

Herrinff- Fisher/. —Th\s very important branch of industry has 
been conducted with such spirit, and such signal and increasing 
success, since it was established and prosecuted, on a regular sys- 
tem at Helmsdale, that its history and present condition claim 
particular notice in anv account of the parish of Loth. The un- 
settled state of the north of Scotland before the suppression of the 
Rebellion in 1746, may alone be adduced as a sufficient reason for 
the necrlect, down to that period, of the fisheries which now add 
so materially to the prosperity and well-being of the population of 



LOTH. 



205 



our sea coasts ; but from that date to the beginning of the present 
century, there was a period of fifty-four years of uninterrupted in- 
ternal peace and pubhc security, favourable for the pvirsuit of most 
branches of industry, and which could not be materially affected 
by a distant war such as that with America, during which the 
fisheries were as completely neglected as ever ; and in this state, 
it is probable, they would have continued much longer, had not 
Government and' patriotic individuals interfered. Capital is sel- 
dom embarked in hazardous and doubtful speculations, unless there 
be a chance of extraordinary profits. The ultimate success of the 
herring fishery was by no means certain ; great profits could not, 
with probability, be calculated upon ; and the Dutch, who, before 
the present century, supplied the continental markets, were, from 
their experience and perseverance, and more especially from their 
superior mode of curing, then supposed to be known to them ex- 
clusively, competitors of the most formidable description. The 
herring-fishery was, therefore, generally looked upon as an import- 
ant national concern, in so far as it reared a hardy class of sea- 
men, but as possessing few attractions for individual speculators. 
Hence, the first efforts of Government to advance the fisheries 
were attended with partial success only ; and such is the difficulty 
of selecting the most efficient means, at a first trial, in some legis- 
lative measures, that the principle upon which the Government 
bounties for the encouragement of the herring fishery were grant- 
ed, has been subsequently found to be an erroneous one. Busses' 
of not less than sixty tons burden were the description of vessels 
encouraged ; and all such, when fitted out for sea in a particular 
manner, were entitled to a bounty of L. 3 per ton, whether fish 
were caught or not. Consequently, it often followed that busses, 
after being passed for the deep sea fishery, skulked along shore, 
or lingered in safe retired creeks, among the Orkney and other 
islands, — only going to sea when the weather was inviting. The 
crews also were exempted from impressment; so that a number 
of lazy hands were thus obtained by the master, to man the bus- 
ses, at a trifling expense. This system was directly the reverse 
of the active and vigorous mode of fishing now prosecuted. The 
next measure, being a bounty of 4s. on the cran of fish, gutted, 
cured, and packed, in an improved manner at stations on shore, 
vvas, however, a most important and serviceable enactment, and may 
be considered as giving the first well-directed impulse which the pre- 
sent fishery system received. Tlic curcr, at first, when the busi- 



206 



SUTHERLANDSHIE. 



ness was imperfectly understood, and when he could only com- 
mand a limited number of fishermen, sufficiently skilful and ex- 
perienced, had to incur expenses and run risks, now guarded 
against ; and, at that time, the bounty often formed his only pro- 
fit, while without it, it is probable that the business would have 

lingered or decayed. As the trade prospered under the bounty 
system, several individuals without capital appeared as curers. 
They engaged a few inefficient boats, and the premium promised 
to the crews was' often made a postponed payment, consequent 
on the sale of the cured fish. If regular curing premises could 
not be procured, an open area with portable sheds was used. The 
staves, the salt, and the other curing materials were obtained up- 
on credit ; and whenever the barrels were packed, and branded by 
the fishery officer, the bounty was payable and obtained, and this 
advance paid off the pressing current expenses. Latterly, curers 
of this description increased too rapidly ; but the bounty, which 
originally worked so much good, although as the trade increased 
and was understood, it fostered unsound speculation, was withdrawn 
in time to place the herring-fishery on a more safe foundation ; 
because now, few persons will or can adventure in it, who are not 
possessed of some capital or credit. 

The regulations as to the size of the barrel, the curing and 
packing of the fish, and the branding of the barrels, are still at- 
tended to ; and indeed, these regulations are so well calculated to 
secure the proper curing of the fish, that self-interest alone must 
compel the respectable curer to observe them strictly. Fishery 
officers are still retained at the diff'erent stations, whose duty it is 
to brand all cured herrings submitted to them, in barrels of the 
legal size, if of good quality, and regularly cured ; and their 
brand, a crown, stamps them as of prime quality ; and thus the fish 
acquire a character, without which the curer could not obtain the 
current market-price. The barrel is, in all respects, the same as 
when the bounty was granted. The breadth of the staves is ge- 
nerally about three inches and a half, and the number in a barrel 
is 18. The barrel contains 32 gallons; and the number of hoops 
varies from 16 and 17 to 18. For the West India market can iron 
hoop at each end is added. The eff'ect of these regulations is 
equally beneficial to the public as to the curer; for, without them, 
or similar checks, boatmen and inexperienced persons would pack 
fish, without regard to quality, mode of cure, or size and descrip- 
tiuii of barrel ; and a quantity of inferior and bad fish would get

207 



into market, which might ultimaLely create a prejudice against all 
British cured herrings, and lower the price of the commodity so 
far, that no profit would be obtained for those regularly cured. 

The Helmsdale cured herrings are equal in quality to any in 
Britain, and have attained a very high character in the market. 
This excellence may be attributable, in a great degree, to the very 
superior curing-yards, with which all the curers in Helmsdale have 
supplied themselves. No fish are cured here in the open air, as is 
frequently done, from the want of accommodation, at other sta- 
tions, greatly to the prejudice of the commodity ; because the rich 
and admired qualities of the herring are of so volatile a quality, 
that the slightest exposure of the fish to the sun, or even to the 
glare of strong daylight, before or during the process of curing, de- 
teriorates the fish. The Helmsdale curing-yards are all perfect in 
their accommodation, and are cool and ample in their construction. 
The success attending the Helmsdale fishery has been so steady 
and progressive, that, although it did not commence until so late 
as the year 1814, when the first doubtful trial was made there, 
the number of barrels cured at Helmsdale, and the creeks within 
what is called, under the Fishery Board Control, the Helmsdale 
District, have increased more than nine-fold, up to the year 1840, 
the numbers, as appears from the subjoined table, in the year 
1815, being 5318 barrels, and in the year 1839, being 46,571 
barrels ; and of this last number, no less than 23,815 barrels were 
exported. This rate of increase considerably exceeds that of the 
success over the kingdom generally, the latter having only had an 
increase of six-fold since the establishment, in 1809, of the Fish- 
ery Board, which has so materially advanced the true interests of 
the trade ; the numbers at that time, throughout the whole king- 
dom, being only 90,000 barrels, or not double the number now 
cured in the Helmsdale District alone ; while, last year, the whole 
quantity cured in Britain were 530,000 barrels.

The future prosperity of this most valuable addition to the in- 
dustry of the parish may, with great confidence, be augured, from 
our knowledge of the sure and judicious foundation upon which 
it commenced, and also from the efficient means and resources 
which are now provided, on a permanent footing, for supporting 
the extension and high character of the trade at Helmsdale, in- 
cluding the settlement of native and regularly bred boat-builders 
and coopers, and the establishment also of a steam-mill for sawing 
barrel staves, in the village. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The only villages in the parish are Helmsdale and Port Gower, 
which are both on the sea coast, and distant about two miles from 
each other. Port Gower is partly supported by some excellent 
land adjoining it, which is divided among a few of the villagers, 
and by a settlement of active fishermen. It possesses a comfort- 
able and pleasantly situated inn; and the Parliamentary road 
along the coast, towards Caithness, runs along it. Helmsdale enjoys 
ample means of communication with all parts of the kmgdom, 
having the great North Parliamentary Road running through it, 
which, on one hand, leads to Wick and Thurso, and on the other, 
to all parts of the south of Scotland and England ; while a large 
steamer frequents Wick from Edinburgh, during eight months of 
the year; and the harbour of Helmsdale is often frequented by 
shipping from various ports of Britain and Ireland. The Parlia- 
mentary road through the parish, called the Dunrobin road, was 
completed, under one contract, in the year 1811, and extends 
from Golspie to the Ord, a distance of 2 miles and 880 yards, 
and originally cost L. 6000 ; and 13 miles of this road run 
through the parish of Loth. Another road leads from Helmsdale, 
through the Strath of Kildonan, to the North Sea at Bighouse; 
and a branch road, leading from Lothbeg, through the Glen, 
joins the last-mentioned line of road, to the north of the church 
and manse of Kildonan. The bridge of Helmsdale is a handsome 



LOTH. 



209 



Structure of two arches, and each of a span of 70 feet, and its 
erection cost L.2200. It was finished in 181 1. 

The first improvement on the harbour of Hehnsdale took place 
in 1818, when a pier and breastwork were erected, at an expense 
to the proprietor of L. 1600; but since then, several other sums 
have been expended in extending and enlarging the- harbour; and 
other improvements connected with it are understood to be in con- 
templation. 

Helmsdale has a post-office, one principal and commodious inn, 
and several other public-houses ; and the mail-coach passes and 
repasses through the village, daily. 

A large distillery, close to the town, had been in active opera- 
tion for several years, until last summer, when the circumstances 
of the distillers caused the work to be stopped ; and since then, 
this distillery, and a beer brewery connected with it, have not been 
in operation. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is now, owing to the 
great increase of the population of late years in and around Helms- 
dale, at an inconvenient distance from the greater part of the in- 
habitants, although it is locally situated nearly in the centre of 
the parish. It is a new and very handsome church, and in a com- 
plete state of repair. In order to accommodate the inhabitants of 
Helmsdale, and the increasing population of the eastern extremity 
of the parish, the late Duchess- Countess, and the present Duke 
of Sutherland, have erected a large, convenient, and substantial 
church in Helmsdale, which is now about being finished ; and of 
late years, a clergyman of the Church of Scotland has been resi- 
dent in Helmsdale, who regularly performs divine service there, 
so that church accommodation is amply provided for in this parish. 
The present parish of Loth does not appear to have been a dis- 
tinct religious district before the Reformation, and it is not even 
named in the charter of Erection of the bishopric of Caithness. It 
possessed, however, at that period, several religious chapels, of 
which, that called St John's Chapel, at Helmsdale, was the most 
important and best endowed ; and it is probable that, with the aid 
of these minor religious houses, the present parish of Loth was, 
in Catholic times, divided, quoad sacra, between the jurisdictions 
of the Prebendaries of Clyne and Kildonan. A church existed, 
however, at Loth in 1627, for Sir Robert Gordon states, that, in 
• that year, the church of Loth was repaired. During the period of 
Scotch Episcopacy, the conjunction of Loth and Clync appears to 



210 



SUTHERLANDSHIUE, 



have continued ; for some entries about the year 1618 mention, 
that " Andro Andersone, minister" of Clyne, had besides his sti- 
pend, the kirkland of Loth, and at the same time, Walter Ander- 
sone was " reidar at Clyne and Loth," and had his stipend with 
the kirkland of Clyne. In a deed granted by the Andrew Ander- 
son here referred to, he is designated " Ministro veriti Dei apud 
Loithe," and as the paper is only signed by his mark, there is ad- 
ded after it " cannot wreitt myself." Hector Pope, who died 
about the year 1719, was the last minister of Loth who retained 
the Episcopal form of appearing in the pulpit in a surplice. The 
succeeding ministers of Loth were, Robert Robertson, William 
•Rose, George Macculloch, George Gordon, and the present 
minister, and Rev. Donald Ross. 

Before the year 17'26, the Presbytery of Dornoch, which in- 
cludes this parish, formed part of the synod of Ross; but on the 
15th May 1726, the General Assembly disjoined this Presbytery 
from the synod of Ross, and erected the presbyteries of Dornoch, 
Caithness, and Tongue, into one synod, as they at present stand ; 
and the meetings of the synod to be held at Dornoch and Thurso, 
per vices. 

Education. — The parish school is at Port Gower, and is at- 
tended by all the children in the neighbourhood of that village, 
and in the western division of the parish. Another school, sup- 
ported in Helmsdale by the inhabitants, is well attended by the 
children in and around that village. There is also a female teach- 
er in Helmsdale. 

Poor. — The ordinary church collections and annual donations 
by the proprietor are the available funds for the benefit of the 
ordinary poor. In judging of the condition of, and necessary 
support by money payments to, the poor, in a country parish 
like Loth, a very misleading mistake is frequently committed, 
by assuming that their wants and destitution are the same 
as those of the poor in large towns. In such towns, owners of he- 
ritable property never permit part of their subjects to be gratui- 
tously occupied by any indigent person, and the very refuse and 
offals of all personal effects and articles are sacred, by day and 
night, against all intrusion. On the contrary, in Loth and similar 
parishes, the actual poor have ever the gratuitous accommodations 
from the proprietor, of dwelling-places in healthy localities, and 
small plats of ground for vegetables, and the rearing of common 
poultry, — of free access to water, open fields, peal mosses, decay- 
ed heather, furze, and brushwood, the products of the shore, and 



LOTH. 



211 



the o-leaninss of the harvest; from all which, shelter, constant 
fuel, and Umited supplies of food are certain, — while in most dis- 
tricts, the charitable seldom fail to add considerably, and in pri- 
vate to the necessities of the deserving poor. Under such cir- 
cumstances as these, a few shillings in addition from the parish 
funds are more valuable than the same sums among the poor of 
towns. In this part of the north of Scotland, the indigent poor 
are never neglected ; but in order to continue to act towards them 
as their wants require, it is now found absolutely necessary to pro- 
tect the northern inhabitants from the hordes of vagrants who have 
been wandering, of late years, from the southern parts of the king- 
dom, over the northern counties, and carrying with them all the 
moral and physical diseases of crowded cities in their most dread- 
ed forms.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1061313">SUTHERLAND</name>.</head> 
<p>


The superficial extent of the County of Sutherland is comput- 
ed to be 1865 square miles of land, and 38 square miles of water ; 
or 1,193,940 acres of land, and 24,230 acres of water. The ex- 
treme length of the county, in straight lines, at three different 
points, viz. from Inverkirkaig to the Ord of Caithness, is 60 miles; 
from Rhustoir in Assynt, to the Height of Knockfin, is 56 miles ; 
and from Cape Wrath to Drum-Hallastain, is 42 miles ; while the 
breadth from Dornoch to Strathy-point is 54 miles ; and from 
Rosehall to Whitenhead is 42 miles. Sutherland is situate be- 
tween 57° 55', and 58° 37' of north latitude ; and 34° 43' and 5° 
23' 30" west longitude. 

Name. — The name of the county in the earUest writings extant 
is ,e\tSudrland, — thereafter Southerland, and now Sutherland, 
and can be traced back to the ninth and tenth centuries, and is 
probably of an older date. It evidently originated among the north- 
men, who acquired settlements about the periods referred to, in 
Caithness and Orkney, and who, from their northern position, 
distinguished the country immediately adjoining them, by a gene- 
ral name, signifying the land south from them. In like manners 
the most southern habitation or township in the county was called 
Sudcrha the southern-hall, and is still known as Sidera, in the 
parish of Dornoch. 

Boundaries. — Sutherland is bounded on the south from the Ord, 
in a south-west direction to the Point of Dornoch, by the Ger- 
man Ocean or Moray Frith ; and thence to the west sea, by the 
county of Ross. The Dornoch Frith, formerly known as the 
River of Portnaculter, and its leading stream the Oykill, separate 
the two counties, in a straight line of about 35 miles. Thence, 
the march wanders among the high grounds, between the two 
seas ; whence the waters shed in opposite directions to the east and 
west and where the ancient and natural march was departed from 
in favour of Ross-shire, in coHsequence of an award upon evidence 

• Drawn up by George Sutherland Taylor, Esq. Golspie. 



OBSERVATIONS ON THE COUNTY OF SUTHERLAND. 213 



subsequently found to have been false. The windings of the pre- 
sent march at this part of the interior, are of considerable length; 
but the distance in a straight line from the source of the Oykill, 
to the east end of Loch Veyatie, where water again separates the 
counties, is only about 8 or 9 miles. Loch Veyatie, Fewn Loch 
and the river and bay of Kirkaig, all within Sutherland, complete 
the boundary to the West Sea. The western boundary of Su- 
therland is the West Sea or Atlantic Ocean ; and its northern 
boundary, from Cape Wrath to the confines of Caithness, is the 
North Sea. There are several islands along both these coasts, 
which form parts of the county. The county of Caithness forms 
the eastern boundary of Sutherland ; the two counties being se- 
parated by the summit of a high range of hills, — well defined, — 
from Fea-Drum-Hallastain at the North Sea, to the Ord of 
Caithness at the southern extremity. 

Physical Appearances. — The interior of the county is mark- 
ed by a lofty range of mountains, which separate the west and 
north coasts of the county from its southern districts. This range 
commencing with Suilven in Assynt, and ending with the two 
Ben-Griams, near Caithness, contains the highest mountains in. the 
county, many of them rising to heights of from 2500 feet to 3230 
feet, and presenting varied and very remarkable outlines. The 
alpine character of this extended range is also preserved in the 
magnitude of many lakes at the base of the mountains, in the 
depth of the openings and passes, in the expansion of widely spread 
mountain sides, and in a variety of romantic valleys, and rugged 
glens and hollows. Many parts of the interior also form exten- 
sive table-lands, chiefly of moss, and unbroken by any marked fea- 
tures.' The western and northern districts of the county, sepa- 
rated by the interior mountains from the southern parts, are quite 
dissimilar to them in appearance and character. Thus, the 
district of Assynt and Edderachillis, along the west coast, is one 
of the most remarkable in Scotland, for the general ruggedness

and inequalities of its surface, and for a great number of rocky 
eminences, and of second-rate lakes, which characterize its 
scenery. Along the north coast, the same description of sce- 
nery continues, but in a more modified form, and softened by an 
open track of arable land at Durness ; by the picturesque beauty 
of Tongue, and its improved policies; by the extensive and beau- 
tiful valley of Strathnaver; and the more tame but rather fertile 
strath of Hallodale. The sea coast of these two districts, also, 
presents headlands, and numerous cliffs of the boldest description. 
The eastern and southern parts of the county, again, are mark- 
ed by several extensive and pleasant valleys, surrounded by high 
hills, by rich pasture grounds, and by extensive tracks of well-cul- 
tivated arable land, in the parishes of Criech, Dornoch, Golspie, 
Clyne, and Loth. The sea coast in this direction is flat, with 
sandy shores, except at the eastern extremity of the county, where 
the majestic headland of the Ord stands erect out of the German 
Ocean. 

Mou7itains.— The mountains of Sutherland are very remarkable 
features of the county,— in their number,— their height,— their sin- 
gular and varied outlines, — and the detached position of a few of 
them. The altitude of the highest of these mountains has been 
ascertained to be as follows : —

Eivers.— The Sutherland rivers are very numerous ; but as all 
of them have their source in the Interior parts of this county, and 
do not receive any tributary streams or supplies from other coun- 
ties, except two rivers that join the Oykill from Ross-shire, they 
are not remarkable for size, or the volume of their waters. The 
larger rivers are all valuable for their salmon- fishings ; but none 
of them are navigable, except the estuaries of the Oykill and of 
the Fleet, for short distances. The largest of these rivers is the 
Oykill, which has its rise in Loch-Aish,— a wild mountain-lake 
near the eastern limb of Ben -More of Assynt. This stream forms 
the boundary between the counties of Ross and Sutherland, and 
is autrmented in its course by a number of burns, by the rivers of

Eanaig, from the Koss hills, and Cassley, and Shin, two large 
Sntherland rivers. After the junction of these streams, their 
united waters are generally called the Kyle of Sutherland ; and 
immediately above Bonar, where the Kyle is crossed by an elegant 
iron bridge, having one arch of 150 feet span, the River Carron 
from Ross-shire flows into it. The river thus augmented widens 
considerably ; and downwards, to Tarbetness, it is now generally 
named the Dornoch Frith, although, for several centuries, it was 
known as the River of Portnaculter. The tide flows up to a point 
at a short distance above the junction of the Cassley and Oykill, 
and vessels of small burden navigate the frith up to Bonar Bridge, 
although the formidable sand-banks, known as the Gizzen Briggs, 
at the entrance of the frith, formed by the descending stream being 
here first resisted by the flowing tides from the Moray Frith, ren- 
ders the entrance into the frith intricate at all times, and often 
very dangerous. The Cassley and the Shin are both large and 
handsome rivers, the former flowing along a lengthened valley of 
the same name, and the latter issuing out of Loch Shin, and hav- 
ing a course of six miles. There are other three rivers along the 
east and south coast of the county. The River Fleet forms an 
estuary, now known as the Little Ferry, but formerly called the 
River Unes. The upper part of the Fleet, which runs through 
Strathfleet, is an active rivulet, which, as it increases in size, flows 
with sluggish stream for several miles before it reaches the opening 
of the estuary. The next river is the Brora, having a course of 
about five miles from Loch Brora, before it enters the sea at the 
village of the same name ; and the only other river in this quarter 
is the handsome stream of the Helmsdale, which, after a course 
of upwards of twenty miles through the Strath of Kildonan, falls 
into the sea at Helmsdale. 

On the north coast of the county, the river of Hallodale, having 
a course of about twenty miles through the strath of the same 
name, joins the North Sea at the bay of the Tor of Bighouse, 
near the boundary with Caithness. The next river westward is 
rather a small one, the Strathy, flowing from a lake of the same 
name. Further on, the Naver enters the sea at a sandy bay of 
the coast. This river has a course of about thirty miles, from 
Loch Naver, through the strath of that name, and is about the 
same size as the Helmsdale. The Borgie or Torrisdale river, 
a much smaller stream, flows into the sea, within one mile's dis- 
tance from the mouth of the Naver ; but farther westward, as far as 



21 G GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

Cape Wrath, tliere is no other stream deserving tlic name of river, 
except the rather unimportant rivers of Hope and Dionard. The 
former has a very short course of about two miles from Loch Hope 
to the sea, but carries along with it a considerable body of water; 
and the Dionard, after forcing its way through all the obstructions 
of a particularly rugged mountain strati,, silently enters the head 
of the Bav of Durness. 

The rivers of the west coast having short courses througl, 
wild districts, are more remarkable for the turbulence of then- 
streams, than for their size. The Inchard is rather a small stream 
but has sufficient water to afford a salmon-fishing Ihe Laxfoid 
after a short course from Loch Stack, falls into Loch Laxford, a salt 
water loch. This stream is proverbially an excellent salmon river, 
and affords the best angling of any river in Britain, of its size. The 
Inver is a very rapid and headlong river, issuing from Loch As- 
svnt, and felling into Loch Inver, a deep sea-bay ; and the Kir- 
k;i. which divides Ross from Sutherland, is a tolerably la.-ge sized 
stream, having its source and its whole supply of water from Su- 
therland, it being wholly a river of this county. 

1.7... -The fresh-water lakes of Sutherland are very nume- 
rous, and many of them are of large size. The largest are con- 
nected with, or amidst, the interior range of lofty mountains. The 
first, as to size, is Loch Shin, the deep reservoir of an immense 
body of water that reposes on the heights of the parish of Lairg 
"nd stretches towards Assynt. This lake, including the smaU 
Loch Griam, at its west end, and which is ah.ost connected with 
it is in a straight line, eighteen miles long. It is one of a remaik- 
nble hain of kkes, which, with short intervening spaces, extends 
t /withinten miles of Bonar Bridge, the highest navigab 
oint of the Dornoch Frith, on the east coast, to Loch Laxfou

mile from its western extremity is Loch Stack, a large and nearly 
circular lake of about one mile in diameter, with a contracted limb 
towards the west, which brings the deep water of the lake to with- 
in three miles of the head of the sea water of Loch Laxford. 

In Edderachillis and Durness, many other lakes of considerable 
size, add to the beauty of the scenery, or agreeably break the uni- 
form bleakness and sterile appearance of parts of the country ; but 
Loch Hope, which is in this district, requires to be separately no- 
ticed, as being a singularly romantic and placid lake of six miles 
in length, situate at the foot of the majestic Ben Hope. The dis- 
trict of Assynt lies to the south of the chain of lakes already no- 
ticed, and may be said to be studded with lakes, having upwards 
of 200 moderately sized lakes, besides smaller tarns. Loch As- 
synt, about six miles and a half in length, is one of the most pic- 
turesque of all the Sutherland lakes, and presents many splendid 
views. Lochs Urigill, Cama, Veyatie, Na-gana, Beanoch, Gorm- 
loch, and Culfreich, in the same parish, are also large, and some 
of them romantic sheets of water. 

On the other hand. Loch Loyal, which reposes along the east 
side of the splendid mountain of the same name, is, with its con- 
tinuation, Loch Craigie, seven miles in length. To the south- 
west, Loch Maedie, having some small wooded islands, is three 
miles long ; and about five miles to the eastward. Loch Naver 
extends six miles along the foot of Ben Klibreck. On the east 
side of this mountain, are the secluded but very picturesque Lochs 
Corr and Vealloch, — the former three, and the latter two miles in 
length, and both almost unknown to the public. Still farther to 
the eastward are Loch Strathy, about a mile and-a-half long, and 
the lakes which distinguish the upper parts of the parish of Kil- 
donan ; but of these we will only enumerate Loch Badanloch, 
Loch-na-Clar, Loch-na-kuen, Loch Truderscaig, Loch-ari-cliny, 
and Loch-in-ruar.  

In the east district of Sutherland, several small lakes occur ; 
but Loch Brora is the only one of any note. It is greatly admir- 
ed, and its banks exhibit many of the bold and wild features of 
the Highlands, combined with verdant meadows, fertile fields, 
and vigorous plantations, amidst which the waters of the lake con- 
tract and expand at three different points, in its length of three 
miles and a-half. There are some other smaller lakes in the pa- 
rishes of Clyne, Golspie, Rogart, Lairg, Criech, and Dornoch ;

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



but none of them require to be individually noticed in this general 
Report. 

Islands, — The islands belonging to Sutherland are all situate 
along the west and northern coasts. They are very numerous, 
and some of them are inhabited. Handa, on the Edderachillis 
coast, is the most remarkable of these islands, from the altitude of 
its cliffs at one side, and as being the resort of innumerable sea- 
fowl during the hatching season. The Stack and Skerries, two 
remarkable islands, or rather lofty and narrow rocks, are the most 
distant from shore, of the Sutherland islands, and are resorted to 
in the summer months, by some of the Sutherland tenants, in quest 
of seals, which are found there in great numbers. 

UuralJffairs— The proportion of arable land is very small, 
compared with the extent of pasture ranges in the county ; but 
the system of agriculture pursued by the tenants of arable farms 
is not excelled in any part of the more favoured districts in Scot- 
land. The small tenants rear black-cattle, which are generally 
sold when young, and, being sound and improving animals, are 
eagerly purchased for the south country feeders. Cheviot sheep 
are the staple produce of the county ; and it is computed, that the 
permanent stock maintained in Sutherland is not under 170,000. 

Eoads.— Before the year 1811 there were no formed roads 
within the county ; but in that year, the first Parliamentary roads 
were completed, and since then the rapidity with which the whole 
county has been opened up, and intersected by leading lines and 
cross-branches of excellent roads, and all necessary bridges, is one 
of the most remarkable events in the annals of northern improve- 
ments. The Parliamentary Commissioners effected a great deal 
by the erection of Bonar Bridge, which opens the communication 
into the county, and across the Dornoch Frith, without being 
compelled to encounter the always disagreeable, and often preca- 
rious passage of a ferry ; and by the completion of a road from 
Bonar Bridge to the Ord, as the great and leading road from the 
south into Caithness; and also by the completion of another road 
from Bonar Bridge to Tongue on the north coast. Still, with 
the exception of these two roads, the county was as completely 
shut out from the rest of the empire as formerly ; but at this junc- 
ture, a new era for the completion and maintenance of all neces- 
sary lines of road, commenced to the county ; and the untired 
exertions, the liberality and patriotism of the late Duke of Suther- 
land, effected this mighty and lasting advantage for the county of

Sutherland, which has not only opened up its resources, and pav- 
ed the way for its further and future advancement in prosperity, 
but has also been of incalculable importance in a national point of 
view, as consolidating remote and hitherto secluded districts with 
the rest of the empire, and securing all the other collateral bene- 
fits of well directed labour, and the increase of local wealth and 
public revenue. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are thirteen parishes in the coun- 
ty of Sutherland, besides part of the parish of Reay in Caithness. 
Of these the parishes of Assynt, Clyne, Criech, Dornoch, Gol- 
spie, Kildonan, Lairg, Loth, and Rogart, nine in number, consti- 
tute, the Presbytery of Dornoch; and the minister of the Go- 
vernment church of Stoer, in the parish of Assynt, is now an ad- 
ditional member of this Presbytery. The remaining four parishes 
of Durness, Edderachillis, Farr, and Tongue, coastitute the Pres- 
bytery of Tongue, which has two additional members in the mi- 
nisters of the Government churches of Kinlochbervie, in the pa- 
rish of Edderachillis, and of Strathy, in the parish of Farr. 

Civil History. — The early history of this county has not been so 
satisfactorily traced as to authorize an epitome of it in a concise report 
like the present. Suffice it to say, that its early annals are only to be 
traced in the history of the ancient Earls of Sutherland, who ap- 
pear, at the very first dawn of our authentic history, as the power- 
ful and apparently long-settled rulers and proprietors of the terri- 
tories still enjoyed by their lineal descendant, the present Duke of 
Sutherland. Sir Robert Gordon's History of the Earldom of Su- 
therland, which was written in 1630, commences its narrative 
about the beginning of the thirteenth century, and is continued 
till the time when it was written. It affords ample details, expressed 
in quaint language, of the affairs of Sutherland, and has been sub- 
jected to several tests, by the examination of other writings and 
contemporary authorities, which prove the correctness of his lead- 
ing facts. 

There has been no history of the county written since 1630; but 
materials exist for such a work, including'public events in the north 
of Scotland, in the stirring times of the Revolution of 1688, and 
of the Rebellions of 1715, 1719, and 1745 ; which are, at present, 
either unknown, or ill understood by the public 

The Sutherland Family. — The foregoing brief observations on the 
county of Sutherland, may, with great propriety, be concluded iy

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



a short notice of the antiquity of this illustrious house, whose head 
has been Scotland's Premier Earl, for some generations. There is 
ample written evidence of Lords and Earls of Sutherland, in the early 
part of the thirteenth century ; and there is every probability in 
the supposition that they were of a far more ancient standing, when 
we tind the first written notices of them in deeds, by which 
they conveyed large tracks of country from their patrimonial estates, 
as gifts for behoof of the church. From this early period, the li- 
neal descent of the succeeding Earls rests on the most undoubted 
evidence that can be afforded by crown charters, marriage-contracts, 
and the services of heirs. 

There is written evidence that Hugo Freskyn was proprietor of 
Sutherland between the year 1186 and 1214. Without arguing 
here the probability that this person held the title of Comes or 
Earl, there is undeniable proof that his son, " Willielmus Dominus 
de Sutherlandia, filius et hseres quondam Hugonis Freskyn," died 
Earl of Sutherland about the year 1248. He was succeeded by 
his son, William the second Earl, who held the title forseventy-seven 
years, and died in 1325. He signed the letter from the nobility 
of Scotland to the Pope in 1320, and was with the Scottish army 
at Bannockburn, and at Brigland, in Yorkshire, in 1322. The 
third Earl was Kenneth, son of the last Earl, and he fell at the 
battle of Hallidon Hill, 22d July 1333. He was succeeded by 
his eldest son, William, the fourth Earl, who married the Lady 
Margaret Bruce, second daughter of King Robert the Bruce, by 
whom he had two sons, John, who died in England while detained 
a hostage for the ransom of his uncle, David H., and William, 
who succeeded his father ; and as all the subsequent Earls of Su- 
therland are directly descended from him, they are also lineally 
descended maternally from the royal family of Scotland, before 
the accession of the Stuarts to the Throne. This Earl was a 
very powerful Noble, and held lands in the shires of Aberdeen 
and Inverness, which he gifted, before the death of his son, the 
hostage, to several potent persons, {viri potentes, as they are called, 
in order to secure their support to his son's title to the Crown, 
who had been selected by King David to succeed him. Thus he 
conveyed the lands of Bonne, Enzie, Kincardine, Tomortine, Kin- 
tore, Kilcairne, Fetternairn, Dunnotter Castle, Enzie, Boyne, 
Chmy, Dunbeath, Downy, Aboyne, and the Barony of Urquhart, to 
the Hays, Sinclairs, Erasers, Ogilvies, and Gordons. William, the 
fifth Earl, the son of Earl William and Lady Margaret Bruce, was at

the battle of Otterburn, 6th August 1388, and died in 1389. He was 
succeeded by his son, Robert, the sixth Earl, who died in 1442; and 
Earl Robert was succeeded by his son, John, the seventh Earl, who 
dying in 1460, was succeeded by his son, John, the eighth Earl, 
who died in 1508, leaving one son and one daughter. The son, 
John, the ninth Earl, died without issue in 1514, and was succeed- 
ed by his sister-german Elizabeth, who thus, in her own right, was 
Countess of Sutherland, and, consequently, was the tenth person 
who held the title. She married Lord Aboyne, and, dying in 
1535, was succeeded by her son, John, the eleventh Earl, who was 
poisoned at Helmsdale in 1567, and was succeeded by his son 
Alexander, the twelfth Earl, who died in 1 594. He was succeed- 
ed by his son, John, the thirteenth Earl, who died in 1615. John 
was succeeded by his son, also named John, the fourteenth Earl, 
who died in 1679, and was succeeded by his son, George, the fif- 
teenth Earl, who died in 1703. Earl George was succeeded by 
his son, John, the sixteenth Earl. He, Earl John, rendered emi- 
nent services to his country, — in the senate as a Peer, and in the 
field as a General in the Army, and obtained the Royal authority 
for adding to his paternal coat of arms, the double Tressure cir~ 
confeurtlelire, to denote his descent from the Royal family of Scot- 
land. He died in 1733, and was succeeded by his grandson, 
William, the seventeenth Earl, who died in 1750, and was suc- 
ceeded by his son, William, the eighteenth Earl. This last Earl 
died in 1766, leaving only one infant daughter, the late Duchess- 
Countess of Sutherland. Her right of succession to the long-de- 
scended honours and earldom of her direct ancestors, was disput- 
ed, on the ground that the title did not descend to heirs-female ; 
but after a long, full, and arduous contest, during the young 
Countess's minority, the House of Lords, on the 21st day of March 
1771, solemnly " Resolved and adjudged, by the Lords Spiritual 
and Temporal in Parliament assembled. That the claimant, Eliza- 
beth Sutherland, has a right to the title, honour, and dignity of 
the Earldom of Sutherland, as heir of the body of William, who 
was Earl of Sutherland in 1275." The Countess of Sutherland 
married in 1785, George Granville, Viscount Trentham, eldest 
son of Granville, first Marquis of Stafford, by his second wife. 
Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of Scroop, first Duke of Bridge- 
water. His Lordship was successively. Earl Gower, and Marquis 
of Stafford, and was created Duke of Sutherland in 1833. I'he 
Duchess of Sutherland being also Countess of Sutherland in her

GENEUAL OBSERVATIONS 



own righl, was the nineteenth representative of the family who held 
the title, and which remained with Her Ladyship for the long 
period of 72 years, 7 months, and 13 days; she having died in 
London on 29th January J 839. Her Ladyship was succeeded in 
the Earldom of Sutherland, by her eldest son, the present George 
Granville, Duke of Sutherland, K.G., who, thus, is the twentieth 
Earl of Sutherland, in direct linea.1 descent, from the first Earl of 
this long ennobled family. 

The Duke and Earl of Sutherland is descended, in the pater- 
nal line, from several ancient and noble families of England : \st. 
From Sir Allan Gower of Stittenham,— an estate still held by his 
Grace,~who was Sheriff of York at the period of the Conquest, 
1066 ; and, according to others, from William Fitz-Guhyer of 
Stittenham, temp, H. H. -a. d. 1167. 2c, From Richard Leve- 
son of Willenhall, in the county of Stafford, who was grandfather 
to Richard Leveson, temp. Ed. L, a. d. 1289. 3d, His Grace is 
also, through his paternal descent, the representative of the Gran- 
villes, Earls of Bath, and, as such, is descended from Robert, the 
youngest son of Rollo, first Duke of Normandy. This descent is 
stated in the first patent of peerage granted to the family by 
Charles H., which bears, " Whereby he justly claims his descent 
from the youngest son of the Duke of Normandy, as we ourselves 
do from the eldest." This descent makes his Grace Count of 
Corbeil, Baron Torigny, and De Granville. 

In his father's maternal line, his Grace is descended from the 
Princess Mary, second daughter of Henry VH. and, as such, 
would have been a claimant to the throne, had the will of Henry 
VHI. been carried into effect, Hallam's Constitutional History of 
England, Vol. i. p. 316. In the same line of descent, his Grace 
is one of the claimants to the ancient barony in fee of Lord 
Strange of Knockyn, now in abeyance among the representatives 
of Ferdinando, fifth Earl of Derby. 

His Grace's father and mother had two descents in common ; 
the one through two females, descendants of Richard de Abriiicis, 
Earl of Chester, who married respectively into the Derby and 
Bruce families; and through the Scotch line, the late Duke of 
Sutherland was descended from a daughter of William the Lion 
of Scotland, through the De Ross of Hamlake.

PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 

CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. W. R. TAYLOR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is taken from that of the river 
which runs through it. It is made up of the words Thor, the 
name of one of the great northern deities, and aa, which, in the 
Icelandic dialect, signifies a river ; and so means Thor's river. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The mean length of the parish is 
about 7 miles, and the breadth about 4|, and the area about 34 
square miles. It is bounded on the north, by the sea ; on the 
west, south, and east, by the parishes of Reay, Halkirk, and 01- 
rig respectively. Its form is that of an irregular quadrilateral 
figure. 

Topographical Appearances. — It rises by a gentle acclivity from 
the sea shore, and in no part attains to any very great elevation. 
It presents various irregularities and undulations on its surface ; 
but, speaking generally, the land is flat. The coast, which ex- 
tends about eight miles, is in general rocky, though, in some parts, 
especially near the town of Thurso, it is flat and sandy. The bay 
of Thurso, which forms the coast of the parish of Olrig and part 
of that of Dunnet, forms about five miles of the coast of this pa- 
rish ; and, as seen from the town and neighbourhood, presents a 
very beautiful and striking appearance. It is included within the 
promontories of Dunnet-head, the most northerly land in Scot- 
land, situated in the parish of Dunnet on the east, and of Hol- 
burn-head, situated in this parish, on the west. Holburii-head, the 
only head-land in this parish, is about two miles to the north-west 
of the town of Thurso. At the extremity of this headland, there

is a remarkable insulated rock, called the Clett, about 480 feet 
long, 240 feet broad, and 400 feet high, and distant from the land 
about 240 feet. This rock is considered a great curiosity, and is 
frequently visited by strangers. In the summer months, it is co- 
vered with flocks of sea-fowl ; and this adds considerably to its 
striking and interesting appearance. 

Climate. — It is stated in Henderson's View of the Agriculture 
of Caithness, that for three-fourths of the year, viz. from Septem- 
ber to June, the wind generally blows from the west and north- 
west ; and that, during the other fourth of the year, it is variable 
from south-west to south-east, and is but seldom northerly. The 
climate is healthy, though variable. During a great part of the 
year, the air is keen and piercing ; but in summer there is a good 
deal of mild and warm weather. 

Hydrography. — There are two small rivers in the parish. The 
principal river in the parish and in the county, is the river Thurso, 
from which the parish takes its name. It rises in the heights of 
the parish of Halkirk, among the hills bounding Sutherland, and 
after reaching this parish traverses it from south to north, and 
flows into the sea in the immediate vicinity of the town. Its length 
is about thirty miles, and its greatest breadth about 100 yards. 
It adds much to the beauty of those parts of the parish through 
which it flows, at least, as much as can consist with unwooded banks. 
The other stream in the parish, and the fourth in size in the 
county, is the Water of Forss. It rises in the parish of Reay, and 
after reaching this parish divides it from that of Reay, forming the 
boundary between them, and flows into the sea at Cross-kirk Bay, 
near the House of Forss. 

Geoy.— The principal rocks in the parish belong to the so- 
called old red sandstone. The general direction of the strata is 
from north-east to south-west. The dip on the shore of Thurso 
is north-west, and the inclination about twenty degrees. In some 
of the quarries inland, the dip is south-east. 

The soil consists chiefly of clay and loam, resting on sandstone 
flag and slate-clay rock. 

2ooZoy,_The chief kinds of fish in the bay of Thurso are, had- 
dock, cod, herring, and salmon. The herring appear in May, and 
continue until August. The salmon, would go up the rivers to 
spawn in August, but are prevented till the 14th of September, 
until which time the rivers are shut. It is considered mjurious 



THURSO.

that the rivers are not open sooner, as the number of spawning 
fish is thus reduced. The spawning fish return to the sea about 
the month of April. The principal Crustacea found in the bay of 
Thurso are lobsters. 

II. — Civil History. 

Sir John Sinclair mentions that there is an account of this pa- 
rish in Macfarlane's Geographical Collection, preserved in the 
Advocates' Library ; but it is presumed that the account drawn 
up by Sir John himself, and contained in liis Statistical Account 
of Scotland, is the fullest that has ever been written. 

With regard to the ancient history of Thurso, Sir John ob- 
serves that the town appears to have been a place of very consi- 
derable trade and consequence, many centuries ago ; and, in proof 
of this, states, that, according to Skene's account of the assize of 
David, King of Scotland, the weight of Caithness was ordered to 
be observed in buying and selling over all Scotland ; which could 
not, he thinks, have been the case, had not Caithness been dis- 
tinguished for the extent of its commercial transactions, of which 
Thurso was probably the centre. It was not, however, till the 
year 1633, that Thurso was erected into a free burgh of barony. 
The only other events connected with its history, which Sir John 
considers worthy of being recorded, are the two following : In the 
reign of Charles the First, it was visited by the Earl of Montrose ; 
and in the spring of 1746, a band of rebels, under Lord M'Leod, 
marched into the county, but returned without doing more than 
obliging the landholders to pay them part of the land-tax, and 
were, on their return, attacked and worsted near Dunrobin Castle. 
There is a small map of the parish prefixed to Sir John Sinclair's 
Account. 

Eminent Characters. — Of the eminent characters connected 
with the parish by birth or residence, the name of Sir John Sin- 
clair of Ulbster, author of the former Statistical Account, whose 
patriotic and indefatigable labours for the welfare and improve- 
ment of his country, and of his native county in particular, are so 
well known, claims special notice. Nor would it be right to omit 
the names of his three daughters ;— Miss Hannah Sinclair, the 
writer of a short but very admirable letter on the Principles of the 
Christian Faith ; Lady Colquhoun, who has written two or three 
pious works of a plain and practical, but very attractive character; 
and Miss Catherine Sinclair, who has already given to the world 



4 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

several volumes of tales and travels, aud has distinguished herself 
as a very elegant and lively, as well as instructive writer. Sir 
John, in his account of eminent characters, states, that the Os- 
walds of Glasgow, who were eminent merchants there, were ori- 
ginally from Thurso; and that Richard Oswald, merchant m 
London, and one of the plenipotentiaries from Great Britain in 
settling the peace in 1783, was- an unsuccessful candidate, upon 
a comparative trial, for the office of schoolmaster of Thurso. He 
makes mention also of a Mr M'Intosh, son of a schoolmaster in 
Thurso, who became an eminent portrait painter in Moscow ; and 
of two young ladies of the name of Liddell, natives of Thurso, 
who had removed to Edinburgh, who showed a great turn for mu- 
sic and painting, and attained to considerable eminence m the 
Icitftsr 9rt» 

Chief Land-owners.—The chief land-owners in the parish, be- 
sides the Crown, which possesses the lands of Scrabster, are, bir 
George Sinclair of Ulbster, the present excellent and accom- 
plished Member for the county; James Sinclair, Esq. of lorss, 
who is constantly resident, and who deserves much commendation 
for his anxiety to provide the young on his estates with the means 
of a proper education ; Sir John Gordon Sinclair of Murkie, and 
Sir Patrick Murray Thriepland of Fipgask. 

Parochial Registers.-i:he parochial registers, includmg the 
Session records, extend to seven volumes, of about 600 foho pages 
each. The first entry is in 1648. 

Antiqrdties.-hhov.i half a mile to the west of Thurso, in the 
centre of the crescent-formed bank which skirts the bay, stand he 
ruins of an old castle, beautifully situated on the ea, once the 
residence of the bishops of Caithness Scarcely any of le build- 
ing remains, but it appears to have been a place of  
size and strength. About two miles to the east of  - to j, is 
the burial place of -Earl Harold, the possessor a one ime of the 
ha f of Orkney and Zetland, and of the half of Caithness, who 
was slain in battle in the year 1190, while endeavouring to recom- 
his propertv from the hands of a tyrant, the wicked Eail Harold. 
Over his grave the late Sir John Sinclair, on the suggestion of 
Mr Alexander Pope, minister of Reay, one of the --f -' 
auaries in the north, erected an edifice, called Haro d s Tower, 
which, as seen from a distance, possesses somewhat of a striking 
appearance.

Modern Buildings. — The principal modern building in tbe pa- 
rish is the parish church, which is a very handsome structure, and 
a great ornament to the town. It cost about L. 6000. 

III. — Population, 

The population of the parish, as given in the account of the 
parish already referred to, as preserved in the Advocates' Library, 
was 2200, 900 in the town of Thurso, and 1300 in the rest of the 
parish. The date of this account is not known. In 1755, the po- 
pulation was 2963; and at the date of Sir John Sinclair's Account 
in 1798, it was 3146. In 1831, the population was 4679, of which 
2124 were males, and 2555 females. The number of the popu- 
lation residing in the town of Thurso in 1831 was 2429, and in 
the country, 2250. The yearly average of births for the last 
seven years was about 140, and of marriages about 16. The num- 
ber of persons under 15 years of age is about 1600. 

There are very few individuals or families of independent for- 
tune residing in the parish. There are no proprietors of land of 
the yearly value of L. 50 or upwards, except those already men- 
tioned as the chief land-owners in the parish. They are five in 
number. The number of families in the parish in 1831 was 1036, 
596 in the town, and 440 in the country. The average number 
of children in each family is two, or rather less. The number of 
inhabited houses was in 1831, 739; 367 in the town, and 372 in 
the country. There were 17 houses uninhabited or buildino- in 
1831. 

There are 2 insane persons, 4 fatuous, 2 blind, and 2 deaf and 
dumb. 

The language generally spoken is the English. The Gaelic 
IS spoken by a few, but it is yearly losing ground. 

The ordinary food of the labouring classes consists of meal in 
its various preparations of bread, pottage, brose, and gruel ; milk, 
potatoes, and herring. 

Character of the People.— The general character of the people, 
mtellectual, moral, and religious, no doubt requires great improve- 
ment ; yet, as compared with that in other parts of Scotland, it is 
rather above than below mediocrity. The bulk of the people are 
quiet and orderly, and manifest considerable regard for religion 
and religious services. 

Neither poaching nor smuggling prevails to any groat extent.

Bent— The average rent of arable land in the parish is L. 1 
per acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L. '2 per 
ox or cow grazed, and 6s. 6d. per ewe or full-grown sheep pas- 
tured for the year. 

Wages— The rate of labour for farm-labourers is Is. 6d. per 
day, and for country artisans from 2s. to 3s. The rate of mason- 
work is L. 2 per rood. , t • 

Live-stock.— The common breed of sheep are the Leicester 
and Cheviot, and of cattle the Highland and Teeswater ; to the 
improvement of both of which much attention has been paid. 

HusbMidrt/.— The most approved system of husbandry pursued 
is that called the five crop shift, being a rotation of turnips bear, 
hay, pasture, and oats. Great improvements are taking place in 
the reclaiming of waste lands, and in draining, which is practised 
to a considerable extent on the most improved farms, and .s yearly 

extending to others. . 

Leases.-Leases generally extend from seven to nineteen years 
in the larger description of farms. The smaller farms are in ge- 
neral occupied without leases to the great injury of the land, and 

also of the tenant. . . 

Farm-buildings are improving rapidly, and are in general in a 
comfortable state. Inclosures are increasing, but not in the same 

The principal improvements which have recently been made in 
the parish consist in the dividing, draining, and enclosing of com- 
mons, and in the building of comfortable cottages for the settlers 

on their respective lands. • • i u  

The crreat want of capital may be stated as the principal obsta-

cle to improvement. To this are to be added the low price of 
farm produce, and the want of leases. 

Quarries. — There are in this parish several slate, freestone, and 
whinstone quarries. The slate quarries have been for some years 
extensively worked, and the flags which they furnish have been 
exported to London, Newcastle, and Glasgow, and other cities 
and towns in England and Scotland, where they have been used 
for pavement. About 250 men are employed in dressing these 
flags. 

Fisheries. — The principal fisheries carried on in the parish are, 
the herring, salmon, haddock, cod, and lobster. The salmon fish- 
ings rent at L. 1000, the others are free. 

Produce. — :The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : — •

ring nets, occupy about 200 persons. 

Navigation. — There are 14 ships or vessels belonging to the 
port. The number trading to the port, but not belonging to it, 
is about 40. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — The town of Thurso is the only market-town 
in the parish. It is pleasantly situated on the sea at the mouth 
of the river which bears its name. It commands a very noble and 
extensive sea-view, comprising, first, the beautiful bay of Thurso, 
included within the two commanding headlands of Dunnet and 
Holburn ; next, the more exposed and stormy waters of the Pent- 
land Frith ; and beyond, the islands of Orkney with their lofty 
and rocky sides, terminati.ng westward i i the majestic proniontory 
of Hoy. 

Thurso lays claim to considerable antiquity. As already stated, 
It was a place of soma consequence several centuries ago. The 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



old church, which was only quitted as a place of worship in 1832 
and which contained 900 sitters, was said to be upwards of oOO 

The town is made up of an old and a new town united together. 
The new town is built according to a regular plan; and though 
this cannot be said of the old town, yet it contains a few regular 
streets, and some good and substantial houses. The new town is 
yearly increasing in size. 

The present population of the town is, as has been stated al- 
ready, upwards of 2400. It has three magistrates, nominated by 
the superior of the burgh. Sir George Sinclair. 

McL of Corr,.munication.-The ordinary means of communica- 
tion are en oyed by the parish. There are good roads and a daily 
Til coach t and'from the south. Three times a week there is 
Hoach between Thurso and Tongue. There are two sa. mg 
vessels from Thurso to Leith, -"d, except during the winter 
months, there is weekly a steam-boat from Wick to Leith. io 
Tcrhich is twenty-one miles from Thurso, the -ad-coach 
travels daily, performing the journey in two hours and a halt 

Thurso fs a post-town, and has a daily dispatch and arrival to 
and from the south. It is itself the most northern Pt- -n in 
Great Britain. There is a post three times a week to and from 
Tongue and the places intervening, on the west, and a daily post 
to and from Castleton and Dunnet on the east. 

The turnpike road along the coast of the parish from east to west is 
eight miles'and a.half long, of which three miles - to te e t f 
the town, and five miles and a half to the west. Besides this road 
here Is he mail -road to the south, which traverses about six mil s 
o this parish. There is also another road to the west of themail- 
Id and almost parallel to it, on the west side of the river lead- 
from Thurso to the village of Halkirk. There are only four 
ing irom ximis ° , • j another road 

miles of this road in this parish. From thisjoa 
brinches off to the west, about two miles from Thuiso, and joins 
thT coast-road at Reay. Of this branch t--   J 
miles and a half in this parish, besides the two mdes from Thurso 
tn the point at which it branches off. 

The only public carriage which travels through the pansh is the 
,aU to and from the south, and to and from the west, as already 

TS"ere are several bridges in the parish, and all in good condi-

tion. The principal is that over the river Thurso, at the entrance 
to the town from the south and east. This bridge is a very large 
and substantial and ornamental one. It was not in existence at 
the time of Sir John Sinclair's Account, in which much is said of 
the great inconvenience felt by the want of a bridge. It is diffi- 
cult to imagine now, how this want could have been so long borne. 
There are not many fences in the parish ; but where they are to 
be found, they are generally in good condition. 

There is a harbour at Thurso at the mouth of the river, where 
vessels of twelve feet draught land and lie in safety. Scrabster Roads, 
within the bay of Thurso, distant about a mile from the town, 
affords good and safe anchorage for vessels of any size ; and it is 
at present in contemplation to erect a pier there. 

Ecclesiastical Slate. — The parish church has been already spoken 
of as a very handsome structure. It is situated in the town of 
Thurso, which, considering the number of people in the town, is 
manifestly the most convenient place for its erection. It is dis- 
tant three miles from the eastern extremity of the parish, and six 
from the southern and western extremities. On the north it is 
within a quarter of a mile from the sea. It was built in 1832, and 
opened for public worship in January 1833, and is, as might be 
expected, in a good state of repair. It affords accommodation for 
1 340 persons. There are but 32 free-sittings set apart for the 
use of the poor. 

The manse was built about the year 1770, and was repaired in 
1831. 

The glebe consists of about 7 or 8 acres, and ,may be of the 
yearly value of L.15. 

The stipend is 18 chalders standard imperial measure, half meal, 
half barley. There being no barley fiars struck in the county, 
the barley is paid according to the fiars' price of bear. L.10 are 
allowed for communion elements. 

There is no place of worship in the parish attached to the Esta- 
blishment, except the parish church. 

There is no missionary in the parish. There is a catechist sup- 
ported by the people, with the aid of a small salary from the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge. The office has been 
for some time vacant, but a new appointment is about being 
made. 

There is a meeting-house in the town belonging to a congrega- 



10 CAITIINESS-SIIIRE. 

tion of Original Seceders. There is also an Independent chapel. 
A small Baptist congregation assembles in a room in a private 
house. The ministers of these places of worship are paid by their 

hearers. . ' , • i 

There is no Episcopalian or Roman Catholic chapel m the 

""rte number of families attending the Established Church may 
be about 800, and the number of individuals about 2400. _ 

The number of families attending the other places of worship 
may be about 200, and the number of individuals about 600. 
• Some of these are from other parishes. 

The average attendance in ordinary weather at the parish 
church is from 1400 to 1500; and at the Dissentmg places ot 

""The'iiumber of communicants connected with the Established 

Church is about 300. rii w f 

There is a Bible Society in Thurso, supported by Christians of 
all denominations, which collects about L. 30 annually. There is 
a Parochial Association for support of the Assembly s schemes, 
whose funds, except for Church Extension, are derived who ly 
from collections at the church door. The sum collected may also 
average about L. 30 per annum. This is independent of an an- • 
nual sum of L. 38, subscribed for church extension for five years, 
and which has already been paid for one year. 

There is a Society in the parish for the relief of the destitute 
sick, supported by Christians of all denominations, whose receipts 
mav average L.15 annually. . . , , , „ 

The average amount of collections at the parish church for e 
ligLsand charitable objects, including the L 30 a -dy secifi 
and includino- also the ordinary collections for the pooi, is about

EdZtion.-The number of schools in the parish is about 16 
vftXM 12 unendowed, 2 supported by societies, and 1 
. by sKon. Besides these, an Assembly school IS about being 

'Intany of these schools only English reading is taught. In 
otl ersrare' taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in female 
M sewing ; and in a few, the usual higher branches. 

The sl'y o the parochial schoolmaster is the maximum. The 



THURSO. 



11 



salaries of the Society teachers are L.13 and L.12. Tlie promised 
salary of the Assembly teacher to be appointed is L. 20. With 
the exception of the parish school and two or three others, the 
aniount of fees is very small. The parochial teacher possesses 
the legal accommodations. 

The general expense of education for the year in the parish 
school, is 10s. for beginners, increasing to L.l, 10s. or L.2 for the 
more advanced. In inferior schools, the expense for beginners is 
about 6s. a-year, and 10s. for the more advanced. In female 
schools, in which the higher branches are taught, the expense is 
considerably greater than in the parish school. 

About 200 children between six and fifteen years of age cannot 
read ; about 600 cannot write. The whole number of children 
between six and fifteen is about 950. The number of persons 
above fifteen who cannot read is about 120. 

The people in general are alive to the benefits of education, 
and are anxious to have their children educated. 

After the Assembly school is opened, there will be no part of 
the parish so distant from school as to prevent attendance, nor 
will there be any additional schools required ; but some of the 
schools in existence are in a very precarious state from the want 
of any endowment. 

Literature. — There are two circulating libraries in the parish, 
and two reading-rooms. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There is no almshouse, hos- 
pital, dispensary, or asylum. There are 5 Friendly Societies, the 
oldest of which has existed about forty years, and the latest about 
twenty. Their design and tendency are manifestly good, but they 
are not by any means in a flourishing state. There is no Sa- 
vings Bank. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 160. The average sum allotted to each 
is 5s. The annual amount contributed for their relief is about 
L.l 12, of which there is collected at the church door L.80; L.25 
is voluntarily subscribed by the heritors for the support of two lu- 
natics ; and L. 6, 18s. is the interest of two sums left as legacies. 
With a few exceptions the poor do not consider it degrading to 
apply for parochial relief. 

Prisons. — The county jail is in Wick. There is merely a 
lock-up-housc in Thurso, where criminals are confined till they 
be sent to Wick. Within the last year there were five persons 



12 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



confined here, three for rioting, and two for theft. The longest 
period any of them was confined here was ten days. 

ifliVs.— There are three fairs held in the parish, the Peters- 
mas, in the end of June ; the Georgemas, in July ; and the Mary- 
mas, in the beginning of September. They are intended chiefly 
for the sale of cattle and sheep. 

Inns and Alehouses.— There are 2 or 3 inns and about 30 ale- 
houses in the parish. These last cannot but have an mjunous ef- 
fect ; but it is hoped both their number and their mfluence are 

decreasing. . 

Fuel.— A good deal of English coal is used m the town ol 
Thurso ; but many of the town's people, and all the people m the 
country, with a few exceptions, consume nothing but peats. 
These are to be found in abundance in the parish ; and the tenants 
have a right to take of them at no other cost but that of the time 
and labour, which, however, are considerable, required for cast- 
ing them and carrying them home. .

or Miora — two Gaelic terms signifying smooth and plain, that 
part of the parish particularly named Reay, being smooth and 
plain, in comparison of the other parts which are in general rug- 
ged and hilly. But the most probable derivation is, that Reay 
is a corruption from Urray, the name of a Pictish hero, who 
inhabited the castle, to this day called Knock-Urray. The an- 
cient orthography of the parish was Re, or Rae, but the modern 
is Reay. It would appear from the fragment of an old poem, for- 
merly among the northern Highlanders, which was sung in 
honour of Dornadilla, that Reay was a place of some note. The 
lines are : — 

" Duu Dornigil MacDufF, 

Ain n'taodh re Miora do n'trath." 

Eng. — " The dun or castle of Dornadilla, the son of Duff, built on 
the side of the strath next to Reay." But that Reay was anciently 
a place of consequence appears from a discovery made in 1751. 
A water-spout which fell in that year five miles above Reay, oc- 
casioned so great a torrent as to cut out a new channel through 
the sand between Reay and the shore 16 feet deep, which disco- 
vered the remains of a town. The ends of seven houses, built with 
stone, were seen in a line, and the remains of several others, with 
some pieces of pavement. The stones being of good quality were 
carried off, and the banks soon falling prevented any farther search. 
Pieces of earthenware were found among the ruins. Tradition 
says that Reay was a burgh of regality. A market cross stood 
there formerly ; but it has now been removed to New Reay. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its figure, particularly on the 
south and south-east, is very irregular. There are no mountain 
ranges. The only considerable mountains are, part of Ben Greim, 
Ben-na-Bad, Ben Shurery, Ben Radh, and Ben Ruaidh. There 
are, besides, several hills Qf considerable height, Knock-na-Barei- 
bhich, Knock-Sleitill, and Muillanan Liadh, &amp;c. Strathalladale, 
lying in the county of Sutherland, presents the appearance of a 
valley from top to bottom, extending in length eighteen miles. 
The only flat and low lands lie along the coast. 

The shore at Borrowston presents a number of small caves ; one 
in particular, into which, when a stone is cast, it emits a hollow echo- 
ing sound, resembling that of Gling Glang, which is the name given 
it by the inhabitants. On the same shore, there is also a strong na- 
tural arch, covered with green turf, on a level with the adjacent 
ground, and leading over a chasm about forty feet deep, into which 



14 CA1THNL'.SS-SHIUE. 

the tide flows. In Ben Radh there is a cavern said to have been 
formerly the resort of a gang of robbers, the entrance of which ,s 
formed by two natural stone pillars inclining towards each other. 
There are several other caves of various forms and sizes to the 
west of Fresgo- Head. • i 1 1„ 

The extent of the sea shore is about nine miles, a considerable 
part of which is clayey, incumbent on a horizontal rock, and its 

aspect is bold and rocky. , t' u 

The principal bays are those of Sandside and Bighouse, the 
former of which is about a mile in breadth, surrounded by beauti- 
ful sandy links, to the extent of about a mde These hnks pro- 
duce excellent pasture, and in them are found great J-nUties of 
various kinds of sea-shells. The principal headland is Fresgo- 

Head at Sandside. mu j a 

Climate.-The atmosphere is dry and healthy. Thunder and 
lightning, followed by heavy falls of rain, generally occur m the 
months of June and July. When flashes of lightning are seen 
during the winter months, they prognosticate severe gales of wind 
ZAe north-west, accompanied by rain or snow. The count y 
people remark, that when on a clear night they observe the de- 
Lent of a meteor called by them a falling star, it indicas an ap 
preaching storm. The Polar Lights are seen frequently dunn. 
Ttumn and winter, and sometimes at other periods of the year. 
When seen low in the horizon they are said to prognosticate fair 
Ztherand when extended across our zenith, foul and stormy 
weather The prevailing winds are from the north and north- 
Te t a d in the'winter and spring seasons, there are frequent hard 
X: fr m those quarters, and as there are no woods nor high lands 
n h n'rth side of the parish, the inclemency of t - weather is 
latly lit. From the beginning of May to the middle of June 
Sie p ailing wind is generally from the north-west, with, bleak

There is another mineral spring issuing at the foot of a rock at 
Craigtown in Dunreay, on the sea shore, of superior quality. The 
mineral springs in general are seemingly chalybeate. In Brawlbin 
there are perennial springs, remarkable for the purity and light- 
ness of their waters, which are rather of a whitish colour. But as 
these waters are seldom applied to the cure of diseases, they do 
not engage the attention of the public. 

Of the lakes, which are numerous but small, the principal are, 
Loch Shurery, Loch Cailm, Loch Scye, Loch Sleitill, — the last 
of which in particular abounds with superior red trout, some of 
which measure from two to three feet long. The scenery is 
varied, and in general not uninteresting. The Halladale river 
takes its rise near Knock-na-Ba-Reibhich,in the boundary between 
the parishes of Kildonan and Reay, and in its course runs in a di- 
rection almost due north, through a strath of the same name, un- 
til it discharges itself into the bay of Bighouse. Its length is up- 
wards of twenty miles and average breadth twenty yards. Again, 
the Forss river, which originates from a small lake south of Ben-na- 
Bad passes near Loch Cailm, and through Loch Shurery, and af- 
ter various windings falls into the bay of Crosskirk, dividing this 
parish on the east from the parish of Thurso. 

Geology and Mineralogy .—Mountain Rock Formations. — There 
are numerous interesting displays of the sandstones and sandstone 
slates so prevalent in the county ; and of the primitive formations 
there are granite, syenite, hornblende rocks, gneiss and quartz rock. 
Limestones and Ores. — In 1802, there was discovered upon 
the estate of Sandside, the property of William Innes, Esq. a little 
to the west of his house, a bed of limestone, apparently ten feet 
thick ; the bed dips to the north. A little to the west of 
that, another limestone bed occurs, four feet thick, of which the 
dip is north-west; and still farther west, red granite comes boldly 
down to the sea, interspersed with several veins of granite, and 
large veins of felspar. On the east side of this ridge of granite 
occur the strata, which are general on the coast, of a bluish slate. 
Near Lake-na-Clachan Geal, was found oxyde of manganese of 
considerable purity, imbedded in decomposed red granite. There 
has been opened at a place named Ary-Leive, the property of the 
same gentleman, a fine limestone quarry, in which the strata dip 
north-east. It is at present wrought on a large scale, and the lime 
is much used in the cultivation of new lands. Large quarries of 



15 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

freestone are found in different parts of the parisb. And sliell 
marl is dug up in large quantities in Dunreay and Brawlbin, which 
is of no small advantage to the adjoining lands. 

In the Caithness division of the parish, the sod is fertile. lo- 
wards the sea coast, about Borrowston and Dunreay, the sod is 
clayey, incumbent on a gray freestone and bluish slate, and very 
tenacious of moisture, but sandy about Reay and Sandside 

In the Sutherland division, the soil is composed of dark earth 
mixed with crystally sand, and yields good crops when proper- 

Iv cultivated. . , 

ooloqy.-Ol the animals found in the parish, the rarer are, deei, 
roebuckf, badgers, foxes, otters, goats, and polecats. The birds 
are, eagles, cormorants, marrots, kingfishers, herons, swans, wood- 
cocks, blackcocks, moorfowl, &amp;c. „ , • j f a 

Fo Irly in the spring season, large flocks of a small bird o the 
sparrow kind used to appear ; but for some years past, they have 
Tt been seen. The rivers abound with salmon, grilse, trout, and 
eels as also flounders. Lobsters are plentiful on the coast 

rrl -There are neither forests nor plantations in the pa- 
rish except a few natural birches in Strathalladale. The sod 
tis to be nowise congenial to their growth. A green hiU to tlie 
easHf the manse, nam'ed Koltag, produces different plants adapt- 
ed for medicinal purposes.

Gospel, an intelligent, judicious, and instructive interpreter of the 
word of God ; and from his pen appeared some interesting papers, 
distinguished by perspicuity, accuracy of reasoning, and orthodoxy 
of sentiment. Perhaps the most remarkable feature in his character 
was the interest he took in young men of talent, and the unweari- 
ed efforts he made to bring them forward from humble life, to 
stations of usefulness and respectability. His purse, his pen, and 
his whole energies were put forth, in order to foster rising merit, 
and patronize pious and gifted youth. And there are now those 
adorning important stations in the church, and in our highest aca- 
demical institutions, who fondly and gratefully cherish the re- 
membrance of a time when he, under God, was their only patron, 
and his recommendation their chief passport to the situations of 
importance which they now hold. 

Land-oioners. — Sir John Gordon Sinclair of Murkle, Bart.; the 
Duke of Sutherland ; Major Innes of Sandside ; James Sinclair of 
Forss; Captain Macdonald of Shebster, are the chief land-owners. 

Parochial Registers, — The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ters is dated 1745 : but the registers were not regularly kept until 
the year 1783, 

Antiquities. — At Lybster, in the eastern part of the parish, stand 
the ruins of a Roman Catholic chapel, near which is a spring of 
water, thought to be the sacred fount; and also in Shebster lie the 
ruins of another chapel of the same description ; close to which is 
a tomb, wherein lies a coffin, formed of four blocks of stone from 
6 to 7 feet long, and Q.\ feet broad. Along the Halladale 
strath are the remains of several circular towers, about 60 or 70 
feet in diameter. The walls are thick, and artfully built of large 
stones, without mortar. They do not seem to have been intended 
for dwelling places, nor is it easy to determine to what purposes 
they were appropriated, unless it was for beacons, or watch-towers, 
— which is most probable, as they stand in sight of each other. 
On the top of Benfrectan, in Shurery, is an ancient fort, nearly a 
mile in circumference, the walls of which are upwards of twelve feet 
thick at bottom. 

 Benfrectan, or the hil\ of the watch, is steep and rocky on three sides, and is con- 
nected with another liill by a narrow rock. In one of the steep sides of the rock 
there is a cave, narrow at the mouth, but capacious within. Shelves of rocks upon 
each side have the appearance of side benches. The length of the cave is about 
25 feet, brcadtli 9 or 10 feet, and it has a small aperture on the io\i. It was the 
asylum of two disafiected families for some time in 1745. 

The hill of Shebster has the remains of two forts of the same kind, at some dis- 
tance from each other. Tradition says, there had been a subterranonus passage hc 
twecn these two buildings, and this is rendered |robablc by the appearance of the 
ground.

Language, Sfc. — The GaeUc language is still spoken, but has 
greatly lost ground within these last twenty years. The inhabit- 
ants are in general industrious, temperate, economical, and very 
hospitable. Some years ago, the best dress of the women was a blue 
duffle cloak : now they appear on Sabbath days in silk and muslin 
gowns, shawls, and straw bonnets. The farmers' wives do not now 
make those coarse low-priced cloths for the market, which they 
made formerly, owing to their having no sheep, and the price of 
wool being high. The ordinary food of the peasantry is oat- 
cakes, potatoes, fish, milk, and, on particular occasions, they have 
mutton, beef, &amp;c. They are in general intelligent, moral, and re- 
ligious. The distress at present existing in the parish, however, 
is great in the extreme. The most of the parish has been con- 
verted into sheep-farms, and consequently, the poor people have 
been ejected from their houses and lands, many of them reduced 
to indigence and misery, and others necessitated to. emigrate to a 
foreio-n land. Formerly, smuggling or illicit distillation prevailed 
very much,— which was attended with very pernicious consequences

AgricuUure.— B ancient calculation, the parish contains 
271 pennylands of arable ground, at eight acres to each 
pennyland. The pasture ground unfit for cultivation is very 
extensive ; but its precise extent has not been ascertained. 

The average rent of arable ground per acre is L,l ; of grazing, 
L 1, Is. per annum ; for an ox per month, 4s. 6d. ; for a cow 
from L. 1, Is. to L.1, 4s. per annum ; for a ewe, Ss. per annum.

Waffes. — Maid-servants' wages in the half year, from L. 1, 5s. 
to L.l, 10s., and men-servants', from L.3 to LA, 10s. per half 
year. The prices of provisions are as follow : Beef, 4d. to 
5d. per lb. ; mutton, 4d. per do. ; pork, 3d.; butter, 8d. to lOd. 
cheese, 3d. to 4d. ; tallow, 5d. to 6d. per lb. ; average price of 
beans per boll, L. 1 ; oatmeal, 16s. ; geese, from 2s. 6d. to 3s, 
each ; hens, 8d. to lOd. ; eggs, 3d. per dozen ; salmon, 6d. per lb. ; 
haddocks, from 6d. to 8d. per dozen. 

Day labourers in husbandry receive from Is. to Is. 8d. per day 
without victuals ; carpenters and masons from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per 
day. 

Live-Stock.—T\ie Cheviot breed of sheep are the most com- 
mon since the introduction of sheep-farming. Our small native 
breed of sheep is fast decreasing. Our breed of cattle is the black 
Highland. Prior to the introduction of sheep-farming, improve- 
ments in agriculture were daily increasing, and still a considerable 
extent of new land is cultivated from the moor or hill, by Major 
Innes of Sandside and Captain Macdonald of Shebster. A great 
part of Major Innes and Captain Macdonald's lands are enclos- 
ed. The roads have been greatly improved, and bridges built 
where they were necessary. But the greatest improvement is at 
Halladale, belonging to the Duke of Sutherland. A new channel, 
at a vast expense, has been dug for the water, and a high and 
strong embankment raised to confine the river from flooding an ex- 
tensive meadow of very excellent pasture, thought to be worth up- 
wards of L. 200 per annum. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is seven, fourteen, nine- 
teen, and twenty- one years ; but leases are in fact seldom granted, 
which is a principal obstacle to agricultural improvements, as the 
tenant, who may be removed at the will of the proprietor, cannot 
depend on reaping the benefit of his labour ; he is, therefore, loth 
to incur expenses in improving his farm. 

Qiiarries. — Quarries of freestone have been opened in different 
parts of the parish, one in particular at Glen-Craggach, from 40 
to 50 feet deep, from which large blocks of stone for millstones 
are extracted. 

Fisheries. — For several years past we have had a herring- fishery 
established here, at Portskerray, Sandside bay, and Lybster ; as 
also salmon-fishing at the same ports. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Thurso, which is eleven miles dis-.

tant. The only village is New Reay. A mail-coach runs be- 
tween Thurso and Tongue, and passes here every alternate day ; 
and there is a post-office at Reay and at Melvich. 

A very neat and commodious harbour has lately been budt in 
the bay of Sandside by Major Innes, on which upwards of L. 3000 
have already been expended. While it encourages and promotes 
trade and commerce, it is also of great advantage to the herring- 
fishing. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\\e parish church was built in 1739, is at 
present in good repair, and conveniently situated for the greater part 
of the population. It affords accommodation for 650 sitters. All 
the sittings are free, except in one gallery, built out of the poor's 
fund, and rented for behoof of the poor of the parish. The manse 
was built in 1788. The extent of the glebe is from 6 to 7 acres. 
It lies at a mile's distance from the manse, and lets at L.5 Sterlmg, 
butthere isalso a small croft contiguous to the manse, which may be 
worth about L.2. The amount of stipend is 190 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 
pecks grain, with L. 60 Scots, allowance for communion elements. 
A missionary preaches every third Sabbath at Dispolly in Strathal- 
ladale, supported partly by the Royal Bounty, and pa'rtly by the 
people. There is a catechist, too, supported in the same manner, 
and elected by the kirk-session. We have no Dissenting nor Se- 
ceding chapels, nor indeed any Dissenters. Divine service on 
the Lord's-day is well attended. 

Education.— i:hBve are five schools in the parish— the parochial 
school at New Reav, an Assembly's school at Melvich, and three 
supported by individual subscription. The branches of instruction 
generally taught in them, are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, 
and English grammar, and in the parochial and Assembly schoo s, 
Greek, Latin, mathematics, geography, &amp;c. The salary of the 
parochial schoolmaster is the maximum. The number of young be- 
tween the ages of six and fifteen years who can neither read nor 
write is about 54, and the number of those upwards of fifteen years 
unable to read or write is about 200. The people m general are 
alive to the benefits of education, and there is a great and visible 
chancre in their conduct and morals since the diffusion of know- 
ledge became so general. That pernicious attachment to the 
drinking of spirituous liquors, which formerly prevailed, has now 
been in a o-reat measure abandoned. 

Poor mid Parochial Funds.-HXo average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is at present upwards of 100, and average

sum allotted each per year, 5s. The annual amount of contribu- 
tions for their relief is principally from church collections. There 
is certainly a disposition among them to refrain from seeking pa- 
rochial relief; and they do consider it degrading, but sheer ne- 
cessity urges them to it. There are no prisons. • 

Fairs. — Two fairs are held at the cross of New Reay, one in 
the beginning of September, and the other in the end of Decem- 
ber ; but very little business is transacted at either. 

Inns. — There are four inns or public-houses ; but we are happy 
to state, that the people are now so far alive to the evils of 
whisky-drinking, and the poverty and misery attendant on in- 
temperance, as to frequent them but very seldom. 

Fuel. — The fuel commonly made use of is peat. Every one 
cuts and prepares this for himself.

PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF CAITHNESS AND 
SUTHERLAND. 

THE REV. PETER JOLLY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Extent, Sj-c. — It is difficult to say what is the 
origin of the name of this parish. Some have supposed it to be 
a corruption of " Canute's bay." Others imagine it to be from the 
plant Canna, which seems to have been at one time very abundant 
in the place. This latter derivation appears the more probable, 
from the circumstance that in all the older parochial registers the 
name is spelt Cannashay. 

The figure of the parish is on the whole exceedingly regular. 
It forms the north-east corner of Scotland ; and is bounded on 
the east, by the German Ocean ; on the north, liy the Pentland 
Frith ; on the west, by the parish of Dunnet ; and on the south, 
by the parishes of Bower and Wick. From east to west along the 
Pentland Frith the length is upwards of 8 miles ; and from north 
to south, where it is washed by the German Ocean, the breadth is 
nearly 8 miles, but the mean breadth may be estimated at G 



22 CAITHNESS-3HIRE. 

miles. The island of Stroma, situated in the Pentland Frith, and 
about a league distant from the mainland, belongs to the parish. 
The word Stroma is supposed to be of Danish or Norwegian on- 
gin, and signifies the island in the current. Stroma contams about 
a square mile of surface ; thus the whole extent of the parish may 
be stated at about 50 square miles. 

Canisbay is remarkably level. The Ward or Watch hill is the 
only eminence of any moment in the parish. Its height above 
the level of the sea may be about 300 feet.  
The principal headlands are Grey-head, Skirsa-head, St Johns 
or Mey-head, and Duncansbay-head. The last mentioned head- 
land, the BeruUum of Ptolemy, from which the shore runs nearly 
due west and due south, is decidedly the most beautiful promontory 
in the north of Scotland. It is about two miles in circumference, 
and is indented by several large ravines or goes, as they are here 
termed. It contains one remarkable fissure open down to the level 
of the sea, into which the tides ebb and flow through an opening at 
the base of the intervening rock. It has a natural bridge across 
of about six yards wide, which is called by the inhabitants, i\xeglupe. 
In the west end of the island of Stroma there is a similar chasm 
about thirty yards from the precipice. The sea has access to 
it also by an opening at the bottom ; and the natives ot the 
island are in the habit of descending into the chasm, a task which 
is not extremely difficult to accomplish, and of going out at the 
entrance below, and of fishing from the rocks. _ _ 

The coast on the east side is bold and precipitous; on the 
north it is more level, though in different places the rocks are of 
considerable altitude. Near Duncansbay Head are two insulated 
rocks of an oval form, surrounded by the sea, called the Stacks of 
Duncansbay. They shoot up fantastically to a great height. One 
of them is considerably larger than the other : and when seen from 
a little distance, they look like the huge spires of some old Got ic 
edifice. During the spring and summer months they form the 
rendezvous of innumerable sea fowl ; and on the top of the larger 
stack the eagle has its eyrie. 

The only bays arc, Freswick bay on the east; and Duncansbay 
and Gills bays on the north. Along Freswick bay, the beach is 
composed principally of sand, a mixture of sandstone and shells 
The beach at Duncansbay is altogether of broken sliell . At 
G s he beach consists of flat rocks mterspersed with shingle. 
There is a sandy beach at Huna, a mixture of shells and sand- 
alone, but scarcely any thing deserving the name of a bay.

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere is milder 
than might be expected in this high latitude. The summers are 
not very warm, nor the winters very cold. This may be attributed 
to the flatness of the surface, and to the sea bordering on so great 
a part of the parish. The most prevalent winds are from the west 
and south-west. After the autumnal equinox, there commonly 
falls a great quantity of rain for the subsequent six months. The 
weather, on the average of the year, may be described as moist 
and variable, rather than tempestuous. The aurora borealis is 
often seen here in great splendour. It begins to be visible in the 
month of September, and is occasionally of uncommon brilliancy, 
it has been observed in a few instances to assume a dark purple 
tinge, which gives it an awfully beautiful and magnificent appear- 
ance. 

Climate. — There are no diseases peculiar to the place. The 
most prevalent distempers are, fever, inflammation, and rheuma- 
tism. The employments of the greater part of the inhabitants, 
exposing them to the moisture and variableness of the climate, 
may partially account for the predominance of these. 

Hydrography. — The Pentland Frith separates the Orkney 
islands from the north of Scotland. It forms a communication 
between the German and Atlantic Oceans, and is reckoned twenty- 
four miles in length, and from twelve to fourteen miles in average 
breadth. At the east end of the frith, stretching from Duncans- 
bay Head, is a rough and dangerous piece of sea, called the Boars 
of Duncansbay ; and opposite to St John's Head in Mey, there 
is also a similar piece of sea, called the Men of Mey. In both 
places, the tide is very rapid, and the roughness is produced by 
the collision of different currents. The Men of Mey and the 
Boars of Duncansbay appear only alternately, the former with the 
ebb, and the latter with the flood-tide. The current in the Pent- 
land Frith is said to run at spring-tides nine miles, and in stormy 
weather ten miles an hour. For about half an hour at the turn 
of the tide, little or no current is perceptible. North-east from 
Duncansbay Head, in the eastern entrance of the frith, and about 
six miles distant, lie the Pentland Skerries. On the larger of the 
two, a light-house was erected some years ago. It consists of 
two towers, the one considerably higher than the other, with a 
stationary light on each. Now that a light-house has been erected 
on Dunnet Head, at the western entrance of the frith, the navi- 
gation has become comparatively safe even at night. 

Springs. — There is abundance of fresh water springs in the pa- 



24 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

rish. There are also some mineral springs of the chalybeate kind. 
The most remarkable of these is one near the old castle of Fres- 
wick. The loch of Mey is the only loch in the parish ; its cir- 
cumference may be about a mile and a-half, and its depth is not 
great. There is no river,— and only a few rivulets or burns, col- 
lected from the different mosses in the winter season ; the chief 
of these is the burn of Freswick. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rocks in general are composed 
of a red sandstone, and in some places of a rock resembling grey- 
wacke. At Quoys there is a little limestone ; and at Mey, on the 
property of the Earl of Caithness, there is abundance of it to be ob- 
tained. A light black loam, with an intermixture of moss, forms 
the general character of the cultivated ground. The lands of Mey 
have in some places a mixture of clay. Heath and deep moss, 
with an occasional patch of rough pasture grass, cover fully nine- 
tenths of the parish. 

Zoology. — There are no rare or uncommon animals. At one 
period, indeed, wolves are said to have existed in the parish. 
Between Brabster and Freswick, there is a hollow, called Wolfs 
Burn : the tradition is, that the last wolf seen in Caithness was 
killed in this particular spot. All around the coast, cod are to- 
lerablv numerous : and lobsters also are caught in considerable 
numbers. Coal-fish, or, as they are provincially termeA, cuddens, 
are at some seasons of the year caught in immense quantities, and 
are of great use to the poorer inhabitants, as they not only serve 
for food, but supply plenty of oil for light. 

II, — Civil History. 
JSminent Men.— Under this head we may notice the Rev. John 
Morison, D. D., for eighteen years minister of this parish. He 
was the author of several of the paraphrases approved by a Com- 
mittee of the General Assembly, and appended to the Version ot 
the Psalms used in the Church of Scotland. His are, the 19th, 
21st, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 35th. His versions of the 27th 
and 28th were said to have been slightly altered by Logan, who 
was his contemporary and intimate friend. Several effusions of 
Dr Morison's youthful muse appeared in the Edinburgh Weekly 
Magazine, under the signature of Musaeus. By the testimony of 
all who knew him, Dr Morison was an accomplished scholar, and 
an eloquent preacher. He was a native of Aberdeenshire, and 
died on 12th June 1798, in the 49th year of his age. 

Land-owners.-Tho proprietors are, the Right Honourable the 
Earl of Caithness; William James John Alexander Sinclair ot 



CANISBAY. 



25 



Freswick, at present a minor, patron of the parish ; and George 
Sutherland Sinclair, Esq. of Brabster. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers commence in 1651, and 
were regularly kept till the Restoration. From that period down 
to 1706, there are no records of any kind whatever. The only 
other gap occurs a few years prior to 1747. From this latter 
date down to the present time, the registers have been regularly 
kept ; all the births and marriages are registered ; the deaths are 
not. 

Antiquities This parish seems at one time to have been di- 
vided into districts, and to have had chapels for religious purposes 
in each of them. Scarcely a vestige now remains of any of these 
chapels, but several aged individuals remember to have seen some 
of them. They are still known by name. At Mey, on St John's 
Head, there was one dedicated to St John ; at Freswick, one to 
St Maddan; at Brabster, one to St Tustan; at Duncansbay, one 
to the Virgin Mary, the locality of which is still known by the 
name of Lady Kirk ; and it is highly probable that what is now 
the parish church was originally intended only for the use of the 
adjoining district. At Freswick are to be seen the ruins of an 
old castle, called Bucholie Castle. It seems to be of very great 
antiquity. Pennant in his Tour says that it was inhabited by a 
Danish nobleman of the name of Suenus Asteilf in the twelfth 
century. It is situated on a high rock, almost surrounded by the 
sea, and appears to have been a place of considerable strength. 
On the top of Duncansbay Head, and about fifty yards from the 
precipice, may be traced the site of a circular building of about 
twenty feet diameter, which is supposed to have been a watch- 
tower, and to have communicated with a similar one on the top 
of the Warth Hill, The distance from Duncansbay Head to 
the Warth or Watch Hill is about two miles, and a signal from 
the one would of course be readily perceived at the other. 

There are no traces of camps or forts; but from some entries 
in the Session records it would appear that either Cromwell or 
some of his officers were in this remote corner. Thus March 29, 
1652, " No session holden, by reasone the Inglishe being quarter- 
ed in the bounds, the congregation was few in number, and ther 
was not a sederunt of elders,, nather was ther any delinquents 
charged." Again May 2, 1652, « Ther not being a sederunt, by 
reasone of a partie of Inglishe horsemen being in our feilds, whilk 
made the congregation fewer in number, and severall of the elders 
to be absent." Andgain, December 30, 1655, " Adam Seattoa 



26 



CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 



convict of drinking on the Sabbatlie, and haveing masking plays 
in his house for the Inglishemen, he was ordained to mak publick 
confession of his fault the next Sabbath." 

As this old register contains some curious entries, I shall quote 
a few of them. " December 27, 1652, Ordained yt for mending 
ye people, ye better to keepe the kirk, a roll of ye names of the 
families be taken up,- and Sabbathlie, yt they be called upon by 
name, and who bees notted absent sail pay 40d. toties quoties." 
Again same day and date, " Item, Ordained yt if ane elder 
or other paroshiner be fund drinking in ane ailhouse on the 
Sabbath day, or extraordinary on the week-day, who bees- not- 
ted to faill sail pay 40d. for the first fait, and mak publick 
confession before the congregation, with certification if any be 
fund to fall therein againe, they sail undergoe higher censure, 
especially an elder." Again, « March 4, 1654, For mending 
the people of Stroma to keepe the kirk better, it was ordained 
yt no passenger coming over to the kirk sail pay any fraught, 
and if any yt heve boats stay away they sail pay 3 p. 4d. and 
others 40d." This is a most salutary regulation, and, I am 
sorry to say, as necessary now, if it could be carried into effect as it 
was nearly 200 years ago. I shall only add one other extract. It is 
regarding the appointment of a schoolmaster in this parish in the 
year 1660, and furnishes a remarkable contrast even with the present 
very inadequate remuneration of parochial teachers : " Oct. 28, 
1 660. So few elders remaining as no session culd be holden, yet 
the minister with them yt were present haveing the consent of the 
rest, condescended and agreed with Donald Reid Skinner to be 
schoolmaster at Cannisbey, for teaching the young children that 
suld be sent to him, and for his paines 5 bolls victuall was pro- 
mised him in the yeir, whilk he thinking too little yet accepted to 
undertake the charge, and to enter with all convenient diligence 
provideing the said 5 bolls victuall be duelie payed, and that he 
may have furniture of peats to supplie his present need." 
. About a mile and a half to the west of the beautiful promon- 
tory of Duncansbay Head stood the celebrated John o' Groats 
House Nothing but the site where this once famous building is 
said to'have stood, is now to be discerned. The traditionary story 
resnecting Malcolm, Gavin, and John de Groat having arrived 
here from Holland in the reign of James IV. of Scotland; their 
having purchased the lands of Duncansbay ; their commemorating 
their arrival by an annual festive meeting, and the ingenious plan 
which John de Groat adopted of building an octagonal house with

a corresponding number of doors, &amp;c., to prevent all quarrels about 
precedence among the eight different famiHes or proprietors of 
that name, among whom the property seems, in process of time, 
to have been divided ;— is so well known, that it would be superflu- 
ous to repeat it here. 

Modern Buildings. — Barrogill Castle, the seat of the Earls of 
Caithness, has of late received great additions, and is now an ele- 
gant and commodious residence. The House of Freswick is a 
large building, but from its not having been inhabited for many 
years, is in a state of disrepair. The mansion-house of Brabster 
is situated in an inland part of the parish, and is not now inhabited : 
its owner, George S. Sinclair, Esq. has lately enlarged the House 
of West Canisbay, situated on a part of his property near the sea, 
and rendered it a comfortable residence. 

The parish church received a very extensive repair in the years 
1832-33. It was newly floored, seated, and roofed.

The only permanently residing heritor is George Sutherland 
Sinclair, Esq. of Brabster. The Earl of Caithness occasionally 
passes a few months at Barrogill Castle. 

There are only two farms in the parish, with the exception of 
what the heritors themselves cultivate, that let for more than L.50 
per annum. The inhabitants in general rent small possessions, 
varying from L. to L.30 per annum. The most common rent is 
from L. 5 to L, 20. The principal dependence of the people is 
upon fishing, and, with very few exceptions, all the males fish for 
themselves and their families. 

The houses in general are built partly of stones and partly of turf : 
they are roofed with turf and straw, and contain two apartments. 

The people are sober and industrious, and, were it not for the 
excessively high rents, would be contented with their situation and 
circumstances. 

There arc at present in the parish 2 insane, 3 idiots, 3 blind, 
2 deaf and dumb children.

CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



A considerable degree of acuteness and shrewdness is observ- 
able among the population, and scandalous offences are seldom 
heard of. The language spoken is the common dialect of the 
lowlands of Scotland. Gaelic is not known. 

Smuggling prevailed at one time to a great extent in the island 
of Stroma, and its peculiar situation gave it great advantages for 
that illicit trade ; but, by the indefatigable exertions of the Excise, 
it has within the last year or two been entirely suppressed. As 
might naturally be expected, the effects of smuggling on the morals 
of the inhabitants were most pernicious ; and from their being oc- 
casionally detected by the excise, and severely fined, their worldly 
circumstances were materially injured. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The precise number of acres 
in the parish has never been ascertained. I should think that not 
more than one-tenth has ever been in a state of cultivation. The 
arable ground may therefore be estimated at 3200 acres, and the 
moorland and pasture at 28,800 acres. The latter is in a state 
of undivided common, and, from the great depth of moss that 
covers the greater part of it, would be very difficult to bring it into 
cultivation. The tenants are in the habit of sending their horses, 
cattle, swine, and sheep during the spring, summer, and autumn 
months, to pasture on the common nearest their possessions. Re- 
cently, however, the Earl of Caithness has instituted a process 
claiming a division of the whole commons in the parish, the pre- 
lude, it is to be hoped, of a better system. 

Rent.~T\ie rent of arable land is high ; little of it being lower 
than L.1, and the greater part as high as L.2, 2s. per acre. Till of 
late years, it was the practice to pay part of the rent in money, and 
part in victual. The proprietor of the lands of Freswick stdl re- 
ceives the rent in this latter manner ; but the other two proprietors 
have converted the victual into money, at the rate of L.l per boll. 
This has proved virtually a very great raising of rent, as none of 
the tenants have, with the exception of the crop 1838, received 
more than from 12s. to 18s. per boll for their victual at market. 

Bate of faes.— Farm-servants are generally hired for the 
year, and receive from L.6 to L.8, with .3 bolls of oatmeal, 3 bolls 
of barleymeal, and a competent quantity of potatoes, peats, and 
milk. A day labourer's wages are Is. 6d. in summer, and Is. in 
winter. Females employed as shearers in harvest receive L. 1, 
with half a boll of meal, and some potatoes; and males L. 1, 2s. 
to L. 1, 5s., with a boll of meal, and potatoes for the whole har-

vest. A mason's daily wages are from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; and a car- 
penter's from 2s. 6d. to 3s. ; and other artisans in proportion. 

Implements of Husbandry. — The ploughs now generally in use 
are made of iron, and cost from L. 2, lOs. to L. 3, and are drawn 
by two horses. The carts had till lately wooden axles ; now they 
are seldom to be seen, having almost all been supplanted by iron 
ones. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The sheep are in general of a very in- 
different, and, 1 suppose, indigenous breed. They are small in 
size, and of every shade of colour from black to white. No at- 
tempts have been made to improve them. They belong to the 
different tenants, who may have from ten to twenty each. Their 
wool is short but soft. It is spun by the females in the winter sea- 
son, and either weaved into blankets or knit into stockings for the 
use of the family. It is also woven into a kind of cloth here 
called black-grey, which is made into wearing clothes for the more 
aged members of the family. The breed of cattle is also very infe- 
rior. Swine are exceedingly numerous. Every family rears one, and 
most families two. They grow to a greater size than might be ex- 
pected from the manner in which they are attended to in their 
youth, and bring at market from L.l, 10s. to L.2, 10s. The Earl 
of Caithness, on his farm of Barrogill mains, has a few Cheviots, 
which answer well. He has also several fine cattle of the Tees- 
water breed. The proprietor of Freswick has at his farm at Fres- 
wick some very fine Highland cattle. And George S. Sinclair of 
Brabster has on his farm several of the Teeswater breed ; and he 
has lately got a few sheep of a cross between the Leicester and 
Cheviot, which have hitherto fully answered his expectations. 

Husbandry.— With the exception of what the proprietors them- 
selves cultivate, the land is wretchedly cultivated. Rotation of 
crops is unknown among the common people. Bear or big, and 
oats with potatoes for the use of the family, are the only crops to 
be seen. From the cultivated parts of the parish lying in general 
along the shore, and, from the great abundance of sea-weed for 
manure, the crops of bear are good ; but the oat crop is almost 
always very indifferent. The fructifying qualities of the sea-weed 
seem to be exhausted in one season ; and as neither sea-weed nor 
any other manure is ever laid on the land allotted to the oats, this 
may account for their inferiority. 

Leases are seldom granted, and this is a very great obstacle to 
improvement. 

Little has been done in the way of reclaiming waste land. The 



30 CAlTHNEoS-SHIUE. 

proprietors do not attempt it, and the people are deterred by the 
LLdiate imposition of rent. Some of the tenants are beg 
to see the advantage of sowing turnips and grass ; bu the want o 
all enclosures, and the common practice of turnmg at large horses 
and c whenever the harvest is gathered, to nd provender 
wherever Jhey can, have hitherto prevented njo. and tdl 
the proprietors enforce a different system, wdl contmue to keep 
this parish behind the rest of Scotland m agriculture. 

The tenants have the houses on possessions valued at t

is the market-town of the east end of the parish, being sixteen 
miles and a-half distant from the church, and ten miles from the 
nearest boundary ; and Thurso, of the west end of the parish, be- 
ing eighteen miles from the church and twelve miles from the 
nearest boundary. 

There are two post-offices, one at Mey and one at Huna. From 
the last mentioned, the mail-boat with the Orkney bags crosses 
the frith three times a week : but, by a recent arrangement, it is 
intended to cross every lawful day. The distance from Huna to 
the landing place in Orkney is twelve miles, and the freight of the 
boat is 10s. ; but a passenger going along with the mails pays only 
Is. To Huna the mail is conveyed daily from Wick in a gig ; 
and to Mey there is a runner from Thurso post-office every lawful 
day ; between Mey and Huna post-offices, a distance of five miles, 
there is no communication. 

Boads. — The length of good and passable turnpike road in the 
parish is twelve miles. An old road that runs for a considerable 
distance parallel to the new line, and which passes through the 
inhabited parts of the parish, is principally used by the parishioners, 
though in a total state of disrepair. By the Act of Parliament 
that authorized the new line, the old line also is appointed to be 
kept in repair, but, I believe, want of funds has hitherto prevented 
this most desirable object from being carried into effect. A cross 
road through Brabstermire is very much needed to give the inha- 
bitants access to the middle of the county. The roads in this pa- 
rish, as in Caithness, generally present the rather anomalous fact 
of being almost all parallel to each other, with scarcely a single 
connecting cross road. 

iy«-5o«r5.— Notwithstanding the great number of boats, there 
is no regularly built harbour. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The period at which the church was built 
cannot be ascertained. It received a substantial repair, as was stated 
before, in the years 1832-3. Previously, the inhabitants had seats 
ol their own, which they claimed as private property ; but since the 
new seating m 1833, the heritors have divided the sittings accord- 
ing to their respective valued rents, and let them annually_a svs- 
tem consKlered:by the people not only an innovation but an impo- 
smon The form of the church is that of a cross : it is as conve- 
niently situated as It can possibly be,-being six miles and a-half 
iro n the one extremity of the parish, and five and a-half from the 
"'cr. uiving the customary allowance to each sitter, the church 



32 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

would let for 512 sitters, but will accommodate more. There are 

no free sittings. . . 

The manse received an extensive repair at the same time with 
the church, but cannot be made a comfortable house. The glebe, 
including garden and stance of manse and offices, is barely 4 
Scotch acres in extent, and may be valued at about L. 8 Sterhng. 
The stipend is 120 imperial bolls of oat-meal ; 87 quarters, 3 
bushels barley ; and L. 10 for communion elements. 

There are no Government churches in the parish ; but to the Go- 
vernment church at Keiss, in the parish of Wick, there is annexed a 
contiguous district of this parish, containing, according to the cen- 
sus of 1831, exactly 160 individuals. There is no Dissenting place 
of worship in the parish, unless we give that name to a meeting ot 
a few Scotch Baptists in a room situate at the west end oi the 

From a survey made in the spring of the year 1836, it appears 
that there are in the parish, quoad sacra, 24 Baptists, and 6 Inde- 
pendents,-who along with their families make in all 77 souls i lie 
members of the Establishment in full communion are 182, and with 
their famines, and such as attend the Established Church but are 
not communicants, comprehend all the other inhabitants The 
parish church is well attended in the summer months, but, from the 
badness of the roads in many places, often indifferently in winter. 

Education.-The schools are, the parochial school, two sup- 
ported by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, one subscription school, and two others on the teachers own 
adventure. The parochial teacher has the legal — od 
and the salary is the maximum, with an -'-.f  fjf: 
in lieu of a garden. The usual branches are taught, and the lees 
Ire extremely moderate. The total income, including the emolu- 
mentfaTilg from the office of session-clerk, does not exceed L. 4o 
per nn m. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge 
ow their teacher at Mey L. 15; and their teacher in Sterna LIO 
with L. 4 to his wife for teaching females to knit and sew. The 
Thole income of each does not exceed L- — ' J 
teacher of the subscription school at Freswick receives L. 14, but no 
ees .nd the schools on the teachers' own adventure, being m the re- 
mote and poo er districts, cannot be reckoned as yielding more ban 
mote and poo  principally taught in all the

district most in want of" the means of education is the inland part 
of the parish, where the population is too small to be able to sup- 
port a teacher, and too remote to benefit by the schools already 
in existence. 

Literature. — Two years ago, Messrs Morison and Andrew 
Snody, natives of this parish, who left it many years ago, and have 
prospered in the legal profession, made a present of about 100 vo- 
lumes on religious subjects, as the beginning of a religious library. 
Mr George Dunnet, merchant in Thurso, also a native of this pa- 
rish, has since given five guineas for the same benevolent purpose. 
The books already obtained are all generally taken out, and, from 
the care with which they have been selected, must prove of great 
advantage. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 90. The annual allowance to 
each varies from 6s. to 10s. ; certainly a very trifling sum, but the 
poor receive it very gratefully, as a small addition to their other 
means of subsistence. The collections in the church average about 
L. 14 annually. There are several small mortifications, the inte- 
rest of which is divided among the poor along with the annual col- 
lections. There is one legacy by a Mr Oswald of L. 100 ; one 
of L. 80 by a Mr Innes of South Carolina, son of Mr Innes who 
was once minister of this parish, and an annuity of 100 merks Scots, 
left by William Sinclair, Esq. of Freswick. ' To this, there is to 
be added interest upon an accumulation of L. 205 of William Sin- 
clair of Freswick's annuity, which had not been paid for many years. 
The whole gross income from interest of mortification and arrears, 
together with the collections in church, amounts annually to about 
L. 38 Sterling. There is no other fund for the support of the 
poor, and assessment for the purpose has never yet been made. 

Fairs.— Tvio small markets for the sale of horses, cattle, and 
swine are held in the parish— one in February at Freswick, and 
the other in December at Canisbay. 

Inns and Me-kouscs. —There are no less than six inns, which 
have a pernicious influence on the morals and industry of the peo- 
ple. Half the number would be more than sufficient for all use- 
ful purposes. Indeed, Huna inn may be said to be the only one 
indispensably necessary. 

Fuel — The only fuel is peat and turf from the mosses, which 
appear to be inexhaustible. The only expense incurred is the la- 
bour necessary for cutting, drying, and carrying the fuel home.

I —Topography AND Natural History. , 
Name-n name Dunnet is apparently derived f.om the 
Gari..., signifying hill. The names .f P--; 
parish are, however, of Dan.sh extraction, as Ratter, bys 

esttSLng about ..miles, its g-e. b.adth an

DUNNKT. 



35 



The extent of sea coast is about 15 miles, miles of which 
to the south of Dunnet are level sand, the remainder rocky. The 
shore round Dunnet-head is quite inaccessible from the land, 
for about eight miles, except at two or three places where the in- 
habitants can go down with difficulty. The remainder along the 
Pentland Frith is low and accessible at several creeks. 

Climate. — The atmosphere is clear when the wind is from the 
sea; when from the land it is in autumn and spring moist, and the 
weather variable. The climate is on the whole healthy. Snow 
seldom lies any length of time, nor do frosts generally go deep 
into the soil. Crops are late in ripening — in general from four- 
teen to twenty days behind the Lothians. 

The current in the Pentland Frith is exceedingly strong during 
spring tides, so that no vessel can stem it. The flood tide runs 
from west to east at the rate of ten miles an hour, with new and 
full moon. It is then high water at Scarfskerry at nine o'clock. 
Immediately as the water begins to fall on the shore, the cur- 
rent. turns to the west, but the strength of the flood is so great in 
the middle of the Frith, that it continues to run east till about 
twelve. These contiguous currents, running with such velocity from 
opposite directions, have a strange appearance from the land. 
With a gentle breeze of westerly wind about eight o'clock in the 
morning, the whole frith seems as smooth as a sheet of glass, 
from Dunnet-head to Hoy-head in Orkney. About nine the sea 
begins to rage for about 100 yards off the Head, while all without 
continues smooth as before. This appearance gradually advances 
towards the frith, and along the shore to the east, though the eflects 
are not much felt upon the shore till it reaches Scarfskerry- 
head, which is about three miles distant from Dunnet-head, as 
the land between these points forms a considerable bay. By two 
o'clock the whole frith seems to rage. About three in the after- 
noon, it is low water on the shore, when all the former phenome- 
na are reversed— the smooth water beginning to appear next the 
land, and advancing gradually till it reaches the middle of the 
frith. From the strength of the tides, and the surprising velo- 
city of these contiguous currents in opposite directions, Pentland 
Frith IS a very dangerous navigation to strangers, especially if they 
approach near the land. But the natives along the coast are so 
well acquainted with the direction of the tides, that they can take 
advantage of every one of these currents, to carry them safe to 
one harbour or another. Hence very few accidents happen but

from want of skill or knowledge of the tides. The frith is about 
twelve miles broad opposite to Dunnet. , , j 

ZZqraph,-Le are ten small lakes on Dunne -head ; 
the"n'no'fish of any kind. There are t-e of a mde each 
or thereby, in length, and about half that extent m breadth, m the 
ower parfof the plish, viz. the Loch of Hayland Syster and S 
John's The principal mills are supplied by them with water. There 
are a few troutsin the Loch of Syster ; tl- others are frequ d 
eels. There is a considerable quantity of marl m Loch Hajland 
L ch Syster is also said to contain marl, but it J- -t b n 
searched. The scenery of Loch Syster is very lonely, being 
nearly surrounded with deeiD moss in a barren district. 

GiZ.-In this parish there are only two distinct formations

There are ereat varieties of soil in the parish. Dunnet-head is

the soil is black loam lying on a sandy clay at about hve  
the rock. This soil is generally f   ' on the

acres of land covered with sand, from 1 to 10 feet, the debris of 
Dunnet-head, carried into the bay by the sea, and drifted eastwards. 
These links were formerly common, and overstocked and poached 
with cattle. They were subject to break up and drift into the ih- 
.terior, covering up considerable tracts of arable land, where the 
vestiges of the houses are still seen. They have since been di- 
vided and protected ; they are now covered with herbage. Bent 
grows rapidly near the shore, and arrests the progress of the sand, 
which is forming rapidly into a ridge of knolls already from 20 to 30 
feet above high water mark, and covered to the sea with bent. A 
small portion is still used as a common by the township of Dunnet; 
the cattle destroy the bent, and it is still subject to breaking up 
and drifting. On these links, where spongy, a vast number of the 
marl shells breed on the surface ; but except the Loch of Hayland 
on the east of the links, there is no pond to retain them : hence, 
except in this loch, there is no marl, as the shells are swept to the 
sea by the winter floods. 

Zoology. — Numbers of the various kinds of sea-fowl frequent 
the coast. There are a few eagles, hawks, and ravens, vast num- 
bers of plovers and snipes, with a fair proportion of partridges and 
grouse, and almost all the varieties of small birds peculiar to Scot- 
land. Of wild quadrupeds the number is few, comprising otters, 
polecats, and weasels. Foxes have disappeared from the district; 
hares abound, and there are a number of rabbits in the links — also 
a few seals along the coast. 

There are still about 400 sheep on Dunnet-head, belonging to 
the small tenants surrounding it on the east, mostly of the original 
short-tailed breed of the country. They are the same race as the 
Shetland sheep— are small and nimble— produce a httle fine wool, 
of various colours ; their mutton is very fine, but they seldom get 
fat, or weigh above 36 lbs. The young lambs are covered with a 
strong coat of curled hair for a few weeks after lambing, exactly 
resembling Siberian lamb skin,— hence I would attribute to them, 
a Scandinavian origin. They are altogether a worthless breed, 
and not easily improved by crossing with more improved races of 
sheep. 

Dunnet Bay abounds with haddocks and other white fish. 
There is likewise a tolerable salmon-fishing at the mouth of 
the Burn of Dunnet. Salmon are also taken in the Pentland 
iTith, near Brough, but the fishing there has not as yet been much 
prosecuted. There are occasionally shoals of herrings in the bay, 



38 CAITHNESS-SHIIIE. 

in June and July, but they are not to be depended on as affording a 
regular fishing. Great numbersof cod and ling are taken in the Pent- 
land Frith, as well as lobsters and other shell fish. The lobsters are 
collected by a London company at 3d. each, from the fishermen, 
and forwarded by smacks to the London market. Numbers of Lon- 
don fishing smacks also frequent the frith for cod and ling. In the 
lakes there are a number of eels; and trouts only in the Loch of 
Syster. A few of these were put into the Loch of Dunnet, or 
St John's Loch, a few years ago, by Dr John Jolly. It is not 
yet ascertained if they have bred. St John's Loch is much re- 
sorted to on the first Monday of May, and the first Monday of 
August, November, and February, O. S„ by invahds from all 
parts of the country. They walk round it, bathe, throw a piece of 
money into the water, and are out of sight of it by sunrise. Hy- 
pochondriacs and nervous people may sometimes feel better after 
this, from the power of imagination and exertion ; but those seri- 
ously ill are of course the worse for it, and die occasionally by 
the road. 

The secret of the matter seems to be this : there was a Ca- 
tholic chapel St John's, at the east end of the lake, to the wa- 
ters of which the saint must have communicated virtuous quahties. 
The money is evidently the offering to the altar ; hence the very 
worthy practice of curing the sick and enriching the church. 
After the Reformation, the practice of throwing the money into the 
loch would begin, it being possible that the minister would instruct 
them to do so. It is astonishing, that in these days such a su- 
perstitious rite should be continued ; but so it is, and people who 
should know better have recourse to it. I do not think it does much 
good to the people in the parish ; it seems most efficacious to 

those at a distance. r»  

Botanu —There are a vast number of rare plants on Dunnet- 
Head in a dwarf state. It is said to be a field worth the in- 
spection of the scientific botanist. The other districts of the pa- 
rish possess little rare or curious in this department. There is 
nothing worthy of the name of a tree in the parish. A few acres 
of hard-wood were planted three years ago by Mr Traill ; and 
they are promising to grow. Thorn hedges thrive pretty well on 
the clay soils, and walled gardens produce apples and other small 
fruit. 

II. — Civil History. 
The following inscription occurs on a grave- stone in the church-

yard : « Here lies Margaret Wallace, daughter of William Wal- 
lace, who was murdered by Alexander Calder, son of Alexander 
Calder, in Dunnet, because he could not have her in marriage ; 
August 29, in the year of God 1635." There is still a tra- 
dition that the murder was committed on a Sunday morning, 
and that the murderer, by fleeing to Orkney, escaped punish- 
ment. 

Land-owners. — The parish is divided into three properties, be- 
twixt James Traill, Esq. of Ratter; William Sinclair, Esq. of 
Freswick ; and the Kirk-session. The valued rent is L. 2309, 
12s. 6d. Scots, and the real rent about L. 3600. 

The average of births and baptisms for the last seven years has been 61

There has not been a register of deaths or burials kept in the 
parish. Many of those whose forefathers resided in the neigh- 
bouring parishes have been buried with them, and many from 
the neighbouring parishes have, for a similar reason, been buried 
here. 

Antiquities. — Vestiges of three Roman Catholic chapels are still 
visible. One of them was situated at Dunnet-Head, and is supposed 
to have been a place of penance. There are a number of what are 
called Pictish houses over the parish. One of these at Ham is still 
pretty entire. They are supposed by Pennant to have been built 
by the Danes, who at one time possessed all the lower district of 
the county. Their construction seems to have been a circular 
room in the centre, contracting at the top like a bottle, by the pro- 
jection of one stone over another, with a number of out-buildings 
or cells all around. A doorway and passage, covered with strong 
lintels of stone, seem to have led into the centre apartment. 
There is seldom any thing discovered in them when opened, ex- 
cept deer horns, bones, and shells, and occasionally a quern 
stone. They are uniformly situated in the best land, which leads 
us to suppose they were the first settlements for cultivation 
in the county. Another peculiarity is, that there are always 
several of them to be seen from the one you stand upon. This may 
have been for mutual alarm. There are tumuli on all the prin- 
cipal heights in the parish, chiefly composed of small stones, which 
have evidently been in the fire. We are led to suppose they were 
beacons. There is one on the highest point of Dunnet-Head, 
one on the Hill of Barrock, and one on the Hill of Greenland.

the north-west extremity of Dunnet-Head, which has been erect- 
ed at a great expense, by the Commissioners for Northern 
Lights. It has proved useful for vessels passing the frith, — 
they frequently mistaking the Bay of Dunnet for it, and get- 
ting wrecked on the sands. Here, on a promontory nearly 500 
feet above the level of the sea, exposed to the fury of the gales 
from the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded with moss, and about 
three miles from the nearest habitation, the art of man has made 
a comfortable dwelling, a garden on deep nioss producing fine 
vegetables, and parks where tolerable crops of corn and grass 
are raised on moss twelve feet deep. The principal light-keeper, 
Mr Adair, deserves much credit for his perseverance as a culti- 
vator. 

III. — Population. 

The population, till within sixty years ago consisted simply of 
the proprietors and their tenants. The proprietors farmed the 
Mains; the tenants had all more or less land allotted them, and 
the pasturage in common. They ploughed the land for the pro- 
prietors, carried the manure on their backs, or in creels on ponies. 
They reaped, thrashed, and manufactured the crop, carried it to 
market, and shipped it. They gave the proprietor part of their 
sheep, cattle, swine, geese, hens and eggs, and a small victual and 
money rent— they were, in fact, next thing to slaves. However, 
in this state, it is said, the proprietors kept excellent tables and 
lived well. The people, too, were not without their comforts. 
All their clothing was of home manufacture, some remnants of 
which are still to be seen— a kind of stuff of fine worsted, dyed 
very dark blue. It served for coat, vest, and breeches for Sun- 
days, and also for gowns to the females; a more comfortable dress 
for a cold climate than the ruffles, ribbons, and flimsy fabrics now- 
a-days of Glasgow and Manchester.

The great disproportion of males and females in the beginning 
of this century was occasioned by the number of young men who 
had gone to the army and navy, or some other seafaring line ; and 
the great increase of population in 1821, was produced chiefly by 



DUNNET. 



41 



about 300 Highlanders from Assynt and Strathnaver, who had 
been removed from their possessions by the introduction of sheep- 
fanning, and came to this parish. The greater part of them had 
removed before 1831. Their habits not being adapted to an in- 
dustrious hfe, they soon got in arrears with the landlord, and 
went off, some to the Highlands, others to America. With the 
above exception, the increase of population has risen partly from 
the extension of cultivation, and the fisheries, and the abolition of 
the feudal service which left the people more to their own re- 
sources. 

The whole inhabitants may be said to be of the agricultural 
class, though those along the shore side are frequently employ- 
ed in fishing. The parish is occupied by 84 tenants, paying from 
L. 8 to L. 350 rent yearly, and 201 paying from 5s. to L. 8 year- 
ly : there are besides ten large farms or mains in the occupation 
of the proprietors. 

Language, §-0. — The English language only is spoken by the 
original inhabitants. The few Highlanders remaining still partly 
retain the Gaelic. The children all speak English, and that much 
better than in the southern counties. Playing the knotty golf 
on New- Year's Day is almost the only game practised. 

Habits of the People. — The habits of the people in dress and 
cleanliness have much improved of late years. The ordinary food 
is oat and barley-meal, with potatoes, fish, pork, beef, and occa- 
sionally tea and coffee. The practice of making malt and brew- 
ing ale is still understood ; but the severity of the excise laws pre- 
vents people from a liberal use of this wholesome beverage. There 
are, no doubt, numbers in the parish who are much pinched in cir- 
cumstances ; but in general, potatoes and fish of one kind or ano- 
ther, and meal and milk, are within the reach of all. Mostly every 
householder keeps a pig, the pork of which is used in summer, boil- 
ed with cabbage, and though there are a number of families very 
poor, from circumstances over which they have no control, still 
the mass of the population may be said to live comfortably, and 
with a considerable degree of independence. 

With regard to general character, they are an acute, sagacious, 
and moral set of people, and possessed of considerable energy in 
managing their own alfairs. With some there is, perhaps, a want 
of industry, but this originates more from the nature of their 
situation than from indolence. The fisherman's life is too near 
akin to the hunter's for constant application, and the smaller tc- 



42 



CAITIINESS-SIIIRE. 



Hants, having always a home, food, and fuel, do not, perhaps, be- 
stir themselves so much as they ought. 

Poaching prevails to a considerable extent among the young 
men, when there is snow on the ground. Smuggling is unknown, 
with the exception of small quantities of foreign spirits got by the 
fishermen from vessels passing the frith, and making a little malt 
for ale. But all that is done in either way is quite trifling. 

IV. — Industry. 
The general employment of the people is agriculture and 
fishing. On the coast all are, to a certain extent, fishermen. 
After laying down their crofts in spring, they proceed to the lob- 
ster fishing. In the end of May and June, they cut their peats, 
and prepare for the herring fishing, which commences to the west 
of Thurso about the 1st of July, and sets in at Wick about the 
18th. The whole fishermen and most of the young females set off 
for that station, and remain there for six weeks. They come home 
in September, get their crops cut, and potatoes dug, and betake them- 
selves again to the fishing of cod, saithes, and silags. This is the 
ordinary routine with the coast side population. In the interior, most 
of the cottagers go to the herring fishing, and are employed by the 
proprietors or larger farmers at the harvest, when not needed at 
home, and afterwards at draining, ditching, and other agricultural 
operations. There is also a number of shoemakers, tailors, smiths, 
Wrights, and weavers in the parish, but all hold more or less land, 
and a great portion of them are at some seasons fishermen. The 
above is the most numerous class in the parish. The next is the 
tenant, paying from L. 15 to L. 50 rent, who follows no profession 
save agriculture, and that generally in its ancient form, viz. bear 
and oats alternately. Most of them, however, now grow a few 
turnips and a little clover, and are decidedly improving; but, partly 
from want of skill, capital, and encouragement from proprietors in 
leases, fencing, and draining, they have made little progress in 
improving their farms or bettering their own condition. From the 
circumstance of the produce of the county far exceeding the wants 
of the population, especially the growth of beef and mutton, and 
the means of transport by steam being in operation, it is a ques- 
tion whether this class can long hold land, either with benefit to 
themselves or the proprietors, unless they exert themselves, and 
produce articles fit for the market, seeing that land is much lower 
rented here than farther south. And the southern markets being 



DUNNET. 



43 



now opened up, it is folly to think that the land will lie idle, or 
only half-cultivated, for any length of time. 

The next classes are the large tenants and the proprietors' farm- 
servants, who are constantly employed in agriculture. 

There are two retail shops and two public-houses in the parish. 

The extent of the parish is about 17,000 acres, whereof 5000 
are cultivated, and the remainder improvable pasture, moss, and 
links. The links may be stated at 2000 acres ; the moss 6000 acres, 
— which leaves 4000 acres still capable of being brought into culti- 
vation. The rent of land varies much according to circumstances. 
It may, however, be taken as an average at 12s. per acre ; for arable 
land, varying from 5s. to L.l, 10s.°; the average of grazing a cow for 
a year on good land is L.4, on poor soils L.2. Leicester sheep, 
of which there are upwards of 700 in the parish, pay about L.l 
a-head ; the sheep kept on the moors by small tenants and on 
Dunnet-Head, are of little value, perhaps Is. 6d. each per 
annum. 

Wages. — Farm servants' wages are, for men L. 6 to L. 8 yearly, 
6| bolls oatmeal, 2 bolls potatoes, with house and fire, and a chopin 
of milk daily. Boys less in proportion. Out-door women get 
L. I, 10s., 2 bolls meal, with milk and potatoes for the half year. 
House servants women get from L.l, 10s. to L.l, 15s. half yearly. 
Shearers in harvest, for eight weeks, men get L.l, 10s, with a 
stone of meal weekly, a few potatoes, and a chopin of milk daily. 
Women, L. I wages, half a boll of meal, a few potatoes, and a 
mutchkin of milk daily. Ordinary labourers get from Is. to Is. 6d. 
per day ; women 6d. ; wrights 2s. ; masons and blacksmiths the 
same. Mason work, wall height, girth measure, is done for 
L.1, 16s. per rood of 36 yards, all materials found. Wood, iron 
work, and saddlers' are fully higher than in other parts of the 
kingdom. 

The common breed of cattle is an inferior description of the 
Highland, much deteriorated by importations fromOrkney. They 
are generally sleek-skinned and coarsely made. In many instances 
they come to a good size, and the cows milk better than pure High- 
landers. In most cases, they are badly kept, and of course ihc 
great proportion of cattle stock in the parish is bad. The ordi- 
nary price of small tenants' two year old stots and queys, taken 
. off by drovers, has for the last fifteen years ranged from L.1, 15s. 
to L. 3 ; the price of cows from L. 3 to L. 6. On the large farms 
and mains, where the land is well cultivated, and a regular sys- 



44 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



tem of alternate husbandry introduced, there are good stocks of 
cattle of the Teeswater breed, reaching at three years old, from 45 
to 56 stones beef, and bringing in the London market from L.15 
to L.18. 

The general breed of sheep is the Leicester, with those before- 
mentioned on Dunnet-Head, and a few Cheviots kept by tenants. 
The Leicesters have hitherto thriven very well, produce wool 
equal to any in the kingdom, and get to a good weight at 15 
months old. Wedders of that age bring from L. 1, 8s. to L.l, 10s. 
each, and best ewes nearly the same. 

The breed of horses is of all descriptions, from the pony to the 
first-rate Clydesdale. Mr Gunn of Ratter imported a stallion 
twelve months ago from Lanarkshire, of an excellent figure, and 
at a high price L. 200. The size of cattle, horses, and other 
stock, as well as the quality of grain and green crops, is regulated 
by the size of the farms — where large, things in general are good, 
■where small, bad in the extreme. The breed of swine has been 
much improved of late, by importations of the best English va- 
rieties. 

Iniprovements. — On the farms in the parish, where improve- 
ments have been made, or are making, the mode of reclaiming 
waste land is, to lay it out in suitable fields with ditches and thorn 
hedges, protected either with flag, which makes an excellent fence, 
or stone dikes 20 inches high with a Galloway cope, then under- 
drain with drains from B to 5 feet deep, as is necessary ; plough 
and allow it to lie for two years, then fallow and lime or marl, and 
if dry soil, make turnips with bone dust, which are fed off with 
sheep, — then a crop and grass seeds, if sufficiently reduced, if not, 
two crops, — then fallow and dung, and a crop with grass seeds, — 
then pasture for three or four years. 

Substantial farm buildings have been erected and are erecting 
where improvements are going on. Mr Traill has expended a 
large sum in buildings, fences, drains, roads, and every thing else 
connected with the improvement of his estate. Freswick is also 
improving of late years. The links, moss, and waste ground, 
where under sheep, have been pasture-drained, which has improv- 
ed the surface much. The parish, with a trifling exception be- 
twixt Dunnet and Brough, is well provided with roads, and is ra- 
pidly improving, and there is httle doubt of its continuing to do 
so, till its whole resources are called out; and, however the occu- 
pations of the population may be changed, capital is only wanted.

to employ and give subsistence to more people than it contains at 
present. 

The principal tenants have, in general, leases of from fourteen to 
twenty-one years. The smaller are at will, but are seldom re- 
moved so long as they pay their rents, or conduct themselves with 
propriety, unless to make way for some other arrangement ; and 
in that case they are generally provided with a possession else- 
where. 

Qwarnes.— Dunnet-Head affords excellent freestone for all 
building purposes, besides mill-stones, rollers, gate-posts, &amp;c. 
The demand is limited, and the rent about L. 10 yearly. The 
other parts of the parish are well supplied with quarries for build- 
ing, making roads, fences, and drains ; and in one case there is a 
tolerable quarry for pavement, which is at present working on Mr 
Traill's estate of Inkstack, which pavement is sawn in the edges, 
and wrought up to be fit for exportation to London, at a conside- 
rable expense, affording profitable employment to a number of 
people. 

Fisheries. — The salmon are kitted in the usual way, and sent 
to London. The cod and ling are sometimes sold as mud-fish in 
winter ; in spring and summer they are dried.

Manufactures. — Formerly, a quantity of kelp was burned along 
the shore. It has been discontinued for some years, not paying 
the expense of manufacture. A number of females are employed 
in winter making herring nets, and working straw plait ; but neither 
affords above 4d. per day. The growing of flax and making of 
linen has also been discontinued in a great measure ; and from 
there being no other employment, except a little woollen cloth for 
home wear, females are not well employed in the winter season. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, c, — Thurso and Wick are the market-towns. 
There is nothing that can be called a village in the parish. Thur- 
so is nine miles from Dunnet church. A sub-oftice to Thurso 
was established in 1839. There is no post-office at present. 
It is hoped this grievance will soon be remedied. There

is one good and safe harbour at Ham, built at Mr Traill's 
expense. There are three landing places for boats at Dunnet, 
Brough, and Scarffskerry. A slip has been built at Brough, at 
the expense of the Commissioners for Northern Lights, for land- 
ing their stores. Here a good harbour could be formed. Nothing 
has been done at Dunnet or Scarffskerry to aid nature. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is inconveniently si- 
tuated, being nearly at the western extremity of the parish, and 
distant about seven miles from the most easterly point. But the 
few inhabitants in that remote quarter are near the church of 
Bower, and very seldom attend at Dunnet. The great bulk of 
the population are within four miles of the church. The church 
is an ancient building, was repaired in 1837, and an aisle added. 
It is now a comfortable and commodious edifice, capable of con- 
taining 700 sitters. The manse is in indifferent repair, and the 
offices ruinous. The glebe contains eight acres, besides the gar- 
den and the site of manse and offices, and is worth L. 12 yearly. 
The stipend is 112 bolls of oatmeal, 81 quarters, 4 bolls, 1 peck, 
1 gallon, 1: quart bear, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. of money. The liv- 
ing is in the gift of Sir James Colquhoun. The number of com- 
municants is nearly 200, of whom 58 are male heads of families. 
There are a few Dissenters in the parish. Burghers, Anabaptists, 
and Methodists, — not exceeding 40 of all these persuasions. 

The average amount of church collections from Whitsunday 
1830 to Whitsunday 1836 was L. 10, 16s. lid. annually. From 
Whitsunday 1836 to Whitsunday 1837, they were only L. 6, 6s. 
2d., in consequence of the church being under repair. 

Education. — There are in the winter season, four schools in 
the parish besides the parochial school, supported by private sub- 
scription. The salary of the parish school is the maximum, 
amounting to L. 34, 4s. 4.d. The school fees are moderate and 
ill paid. The salary, fees, &amp;c. may amount to L. 45 per annum. 
Reading, writing, and arithmetic are principally taught in all the 
schools. The parochial schoolmaster teaches the higher branches 
of education. The people are quite alive to the value of educa- 
tion ; but, for the most part, can only send their children to school 
during the winter months, which prevents there being many good 
scholars. All, however, are taught to read and write, and have 
been so for many years. There is a new school erected by Mr 
Traill in a centrical part of the parish,, to which the Education

Committee of the General Assembly has appointed a teacher with 
a salary of L.20 per annum, and which will be of great benefit. 

Friendly Society. — There is one Friendly Society in the parish, 
but it has been productive of no obvious advantages. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 100. The sum allotted to each 
of the greater part of them is a few shillings twice in the year. 
The more necessitous are supplied more liberally. 

The lands of Hollandmaik in the parish, were purchased in 
1835 for the poor, at the price of L. 630, yielding a clear rent of 
about L. 25 per annum. There is also an annuity of L. 5, lis. 
1 5d. payable from the estate of Freswick, and interest of L. 300 
capital, at 4 per cent. L. 13, 10s. which, with the collections, 
say L. 10, 16s. lid., make a sum of L. 54, 18s. From this sum is 
to be deducted L. 4, 10s., the interest of L. 100, appropriated by 
the donor, the late George Oswald, Esq. of Scotston, for paying 
the school fees of those children whose parents are unable to pay, 
which leaves the sum of L. 52, 13s. for annual distribution. 
There are no poor. rates. With few exceptions, those among whom 
the poor funds are divided, are objects of charity ; old and infirm 
people, who have no families to help them ; widows with weak fa- 
milies, and the like. There is no general disposition to take pa- 
rochial relief where they have other means to rely on, such as as- 
sistance from children or relatives. 

Fairs. — There are four fairs or markets held in the parish an- 
nually for the sale of cattle, horses, sheep, &amp;c., viz. one at Dun- 
net, first Tuesday of April, and the great market at the same place, 
on Tuesday, after 15th August, old style, which lasts two days, 
and is well attended. There is another on the first Tuesday of 
October, old style; and theReaster market, third Tuesday of 
October, old style. 

Fuel. — The fuel used is nearly altogether peats : it is of 
easy access, and good quality. The expense of it is not easily as- 
certained. A large cart load sells for 2s. Coals are imported 
at the neighbouring harbour of Castlehill, but little is used. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
The arable land, by last Statistical Account, was 1600 Scots, 
or 2000 imperial acres ; it is now upwards of 5000 acres : the rent 
was then L.950, it is now about L.3600. The system of ploughing 
with oxen and horses, three and four abreast, has been dicontinued ;

iron ploughs and two horses being in general use. the pernicious 
system of servitude is abolished. Wages of labour of all kinds are 
more than doubled. The population was then 1791 t is 

no„ 1906 -certainly enjoying more comfort than at that period, 
and doino- a vast deal more business. The houses also, with a 
few exceptions, have been much improved: in many cases, com- 
fortable cottages have been erected. r , i j 

The improvement which the parish is susceptible of, has already 
been pointed out. There is certainly a want of employment for fe- 
males within doors ; perhaps the growth of flax and the working o it 
as in Flanders, might be of use to remedy thisev.l. There are also 
a number of small tenants at a distance from the sea, who wou d be 
better employed as labourers, and the land they possess would be 
more productive under a different system. Seeing the climate for- 
bids the cultivation of the more valuable grains, wheat, barley, 
beans, and pease, of all which the soil produces great crops, but 
thev only ripen well in favourable seasons, and are not for a man 
to meddle with who has a rent to pay,-the attention of the far- 
mer should be turned to grass, turnips, bear, and oats which are 
produced, where well cultivated, in abundance. He should be ac- 
tive in rearing and feeding cattle and sheep for the southern mar- 
kets which, now from the introduction of steam navigation, can 
be sent as cheap in a few hours by sea, as they could be driven by 
land in a month, some years ago. Thus, by increasing the ex- 
ports of the parish, and getting money in return its cultivation 
may be still farther extended and improved, and f --'fy f 
labour increased, which is the only sure means of adding to the 
happ ness and comfort of the labouring classes in a rural commu-

PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER GUNN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The etymology of the name Watten is uncertain. 
Some have supposed it to be a Danish word, signifying water, and 
to have derived its apphcation from the circumstance of this pa- 
rish containing the .largest lake in the county. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish extends in extreme length from north- 
east to south-west about 10 miles, and in extreme breadth from 
north-west to south-east about 7 ; and its superficial contents may 
be reckoned in square miles at from 60 to 65. It is surrounded 
on the north, east, south, and west, by the parishes of Bower, 
Wick, Latheron, and Halkirk, respectively ; the boundaries or di- 
viding fines, however, cannot with propriety be called natural, but 
are, generally speaking, wholly conventional. 

Its figure, making allowance for some considerable irregulari- 
ties, may be called rhomboidal. Its surface is in general extreme- 
ly level, the principal irregularities deserving rather the name of 
undulations than of hills. The valleys are consequently of very in- 
considerable depth, with the exception of that which forms the 
basin of the principal lake. Its range is from north-west by west, 
to south-east by east, and the adjoining ground rises with a very 
trifling acclivity. The medium elevation of its bottom above the 
level of the sea is thirty feet. There are various glens in the 
southern part of the parish, but of small size, forming the chan- 
nels of rivulets which have their sources in wet moorland grounds. 
Their forms are exceedingly irregular, their connections at an ave- 
rage angle of .SO", and their differences in point of elevation very 
inconsiderable. 

Meteorolofjy.~\Jx\Aev this head, little can bo said either inte- 
resting or important. The average temperature of the atmosphere

coast of Scotland, at least, where the country is unsheltered by 
hills. There is generally an excess of cloudy and foggy weather 
in the end of spring, beginning of summer, and end of autumn. 

The average quantity of rain is moderate, although occasionally, 
in autumn, it is such, that, for a considerable period, the streams 

are swollen beyond their ordinary limits, and the adjacent grounds 

under water. • • j i 

Climate.— The climate is subject to very great vicissitudes, and 
the prevalent distempers, which are colds, inflammation of the 
throat, and other organs, the latter more rarely, rheumatism, &amp;c. 
unquestionably originate in the rapid alternations of heat and cold, 
drought and moisture. The parish is also sometimes, but not very 
frequently, visited by the usual epidemic diseases. There is sel- 
dom a long continuance of dry weather until near the summer 
solstice, and comparatively little dew falls until that period, when 
the nights are generally clear and calm. The prevaihng wmds 
are easterly, except during the months of June, July, August, and 
September, when the excess of wind ranges from south-east to 
west. The most violent gales are always from north by west. 

Hydrography.— The springs are all perennial, and of a tempe- 
rature not very different from the annual average of the atmosphere ; 
their magnitude is generally inconsiderable, their water pure and 
colourless, with a few exceptions, which are powerful chalybeates ; 
and the rocks from which they flow, excepting two or three m- 
stances of secondary limestone, are clay-slate. The parish con- 
tains two lakes, those of Watten and Toftingall, the first extend- 
ing in length 3 miles, and in its greatest breadth about con- 
taining 840 imperial acres, with an average depth of 10 feet, and 
surrounded by gently rising ground, generally in the highest state 
of cultivation ; the other being about 5 miles in circumference, 
with an average depth of perhaps 8 feet, and surrounded by bleak 
dismal moors. Each of these lakes contributes its stream to the 
river of Wick, the channel by which the numerous rivulets having 
their source in the moorland grounds find their way to the ocean. 
The direction of these streams is generally northerly, untd they 
arrive at the river of Wick, when it becomes east by south, with a 
small velocity. They vary much in length, and the course of the 
longest does not exceed 10 miles, including 2 miles of the river 
of Wick within the boundaries of this parish. , • , r 

Geology and Mineralogy.- K very characteristic geological fea- 
ture of this parish, and a feature that belongs more or less to the 



WATTEN. 



51 



county generally, is the remarkably horizontal position of the 
strata. In a great many cases, there is not the slightest dip or 
inclination perceptible ; and when this does appear, the average 
angle does not exceed 10°. The strata are almost universally in- 
tersected by minute fissures, perpendicular, and often rectilineal, 
the principal of which seem to run from east to west ; these again 
are met, but not traversed, by others, often at right angles. Tra- 
versing veins are rare, and in no instance do they exceed an inch 
in thickness. In one part of the parish, they are met with running 
generally from north-east to south-west, composed of gypsum, and 
in some instances of felspar, and met in a very irregular manner 
by minute fissures. It is in this district that the greatest inclina- 
tion is found, as well as the greatest derangement of the strata. 

The rocks are composed entirely of flagstone slate or clay-slate, 
with two orthree very trifling exceptions, consisting of limestone and 
whinstone,the formeroccurring perhaps not more than twice, in small 
quantity, and the latter hardly oftener. All these rocks appear to be 
of the secondary order, and although, from the limited observations 
which it has hitherto been possible to make, it cannot be deci- 
sively stated, yet there is reason to think that the clay-slate gene- 
rally is superimposed over a bed of limestone, and has an average 
thickness of from 10 to 20 feet or upwards. Few or none of the 
simple minerals seem to have been met with imbedded in rock, 
but the beds of the rivulets are frequently strewn with the usual 
debris of primitive rocks, such as small pieces of granite containing 
minute portions of garnet and schorl, fragments of mica schist, 
quartz, &amp;c. 

Among the alluvial deposits covering the solid rocks, we may 
mention first those occurring along the course of the streams. 
Where the water has worn out for itself a deep channel, and a 
perpendicular section of the bank is presented, these deposits are 
seen frequently to consist of alternate horizontal layers of clay, 
light-coloured towards the surface, and darker as it descends, and 
coarse gravel, composed, as that in the beds of the water-courses 
generally is, of clay-slate, porphyry, sandstone, white and red, 
quartz, mica, and occasionally bog iron-ore. These layers of 
gravel rarely exceed 3 feet in depth, those of clay often occur 
with a depth of from 8 to 16 feet, containing disseminated por- 
tions of rock of various sizes. By far the most general, indeed 
the unvversal alluvial deposit resting on the rocks elsewhere is clay, 
hard, tenacious, of a bluish colour, and containing in greater or less

quantities gravel and pieces of rock imbedded. This clay occurs 
in quantity underneath a layer of peat in several places 16 feet in 
depth. Superimposed upon this sort of clay is often found another 
of a yellowish colour, less tenacious and in smaller quantity. 
Marl occurs pretty extensively in the bed of the principal lake, 
but rarely elsewhere. It does not exceed 4 or 5 feet in depth, 
and is generally covered with several feet of mud. Bog iron-ore 
occurs ill various places, generally in dry, clayey moorland ground, 
but only scattered over the surface. Of peat there is a very great 
quantity, varying in depth from a few inches to 16 or 20 feet, and 
always resting on a bed of clay. It contains, as is usual, immense 
quantities of wood, oak, birch, and pine : very large puie trunks 
are frequently found, being sometimes met with even at the depth 
of 16 feet, with the bark and wood apparently quite entire, very • 
light, and highly inflammable. The bark is generally of a silvery 
gray colour, and the wood dark-brown. Here chiefly occur horns 
of deer, and the very few other remains of animals that have been 
hitherto discovered. , • u i 

The soil is generallv composed of a clayey loam, in which the 
clay preponderates, with an average depth of from one to two feet, 
and naturally wet, from the very retentive nature of the subsoil. 
Though the soil is now much improved by draining, the only other 
varieties occur in the low flats adjacent to the water courses, which 
are composed of sand and other alluvial matters, and in the moor- 
land districts where the peat predominates over the clay. Boulders 
are not unfrequent in the first mentioned soil; they rarely exceed 
two or three feet in diameter, and are composed of granite, lime- 
stone, whinstone, sandstone, &amp;c. but most frequently of porphyry. 
II —Civil History. 
Land-ow7iers.-The chief land-owners are, Sir Ralph A. An- 
struther, Bart, of Balcaskie; William Home Esq. of Stirkoke ; 
William Sinclair, Esq. of Freswick; Sir P. M. B. Thneplaiid of 
Fino-ask; Major- General William Stewart of Strath, &amp;c. 

Parochial Reffisters.-The parochial registers have been regu- 
larly kept since 1701, and are not very voluminous. 

Antiquities.— Theve are numerous remains of Pictish houses, 
aonarently similar in every respect to those elsewhere found, but 
in such a state of ruin that nothing material appears which has 
not been already often noticed. In one part of the parish, here 
still exist what are supposed to be the remains of a Druidical cir- 
cle in a beautiful natural amphitheatre, covered with verdant turf, 



WATT EN. 



53 



appearing to have been at all times destitute of wood, as the places 
of Druidical worship were, and situated in the midst of moors, once 
the site of seemingly boundless forests. There exist many tradi- 
tions in the parish relative to the incursions of the Danes, and con- 
flicts of the clans, but altogether so vague, and unauthenticated 
by positive evidence, as to be wholly unworthy of notice. 

III. — Population. 

The only existing data from which an estimate can be formed 
of the ancient state of the population of the parish are the regis- 
ters of births and marriages. The average amount which the regis - 
ter of somewhat more than a century back gave is about 3000 
inhabitants, or nearly triple the present number. The amount 
of population by the census of 1811 was 1109; by that of 1821, 
1158; and by that of 1831, 1234. It is believed that since 1831 
the population has decreased, chiefly from the great size of some 
of the farms, the introduction of sheep, &amp;c. There is no 
town or village in the parish. The yearly average of births 
for the last seven years is 32, of marriages, 8. There are no re- 
sident heritors in the parish. The number of proprietors of land 
of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards is 7. The number of fa- 
milies, 241 ; of houses inhabited, 241 ; of houses uninhabited, 9; 
number of blind, 1. 

Habits of the People, 8c. — In the language generally spoken, in 
the habits of the people as to cleanliness, and in the style and man- 
ner of their dress, a remarkable improvement has taken place 
within the last forty years. They appear on the whole to enjoy a 
reasonable degree of comfort and contentment, are distinguished 
for industry and economy, and their general character may 
be inferred from the fact, that crimes requiring the cognizance of 
the civil power are so rare as to be almost unheard of. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— ks nearly as can be estimated, the number ofacres 
standard imperial measure in the parish, which are either cultivated 
or occasionally in tillage, is about 5500. Supposing the contenls 
of the parish to be sixty square miles, or 38,400 acres, the num- 
ber of acres constantly waste, or in pasture, will be about 33,000, 
composed in many parts of deep flow-moss, and, with the ex- 
ception of some small green patches along the banks of the streams, 
generally of little use as pasture. It is unsound for sheep, of 
which stock very few indeed have of late years been kept by the 



54 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

smaller tenants, whose farms are, in general, adjoining to the 
above-mentioned moss ground. 

By a calculation, as accurate as circumstances admit of, it ap- 
pears that there are upwards of 5000 acres presently waste that 
might be added to the cultivated land of the parish; and from the 
apparent quality of the soil, as well as the result of experiments 
already made, there is no doubt of their affordmg m time a fair 
return for the capital employed in bringing them into a productive 

The commons are all divided, or in process of division, except 
one of no great extent Kilminster, on the east side of the parish. 

It can scarcely be said there is wood in the parish, except a few 
trees at the old garden of Achingale, which have attained a pretty 
good size. Sir Ralph Anstruther has planted about an acre at 
Watten ; it was trenched and well drained, has been now planted 
about twelve years, and appears thriving. There seems little doubt of 
raising wood by the above process, if it is protected. Hard-wood 
seems to thrive. There are about 10 acres of natural copse at 
Scouthil, composed chiefly of dwarf birch, hiizel, and quaking- 
ash, but its height is trifling. 

Rent of Z,azrf.— The average rent of arable land per acre is not 
easily ascertained. Enclosed land may be valued at 16s. per acre, 
and the general rent paid by tenants for their whole land, both 
arable and pasture, is at the rate of from 12s. to L.l per arable 
acre The pasture is often four times the extent of the arable, 
and there are some tenants not possessing more than 20 acres of 
arable and meadow ground, who have 800 acres of moor pasture. 
A cow's keep throughout the year may be taken at L. 4 on arable, 
and L.2 on waste land. Leicester sheep, of which there are 
some large flocks in this parish, pay about L.l a-head; the sheep 
kept on the moors by small tenants are of little value, and may 
be reckoned at 2s. per head yearly. ,1,11 
Farm-servants' wages are, for men L. 8 yearly, 6i bolls 
oatmeal,2bollspotat.oes,'onechopinofmilkdaily,vvithhouseandfire; 

for boys less in proportion. Out-door women for the half-year, L. 1, 
15s , 2 bolls meal, milk and potatoes. House servants, L.1, 10s. to 
L 1 15s. Shearers in harvest, men L.l, 10s. with a stone of 
meal weekly, a few potatoes, and a chopin of milk daily ; women, 
L 1 Is 13 lbs. oatmeal weekly, potatoes, and half a chopin ot 
milk dally, house room and fire. The above for six weeks, or the 
duration of harvest and raising the potatoes. Of ordinary la- 



WATTE N. 



55 



bourers, men get from Is. 6d. to is. 8d. per day in summer, and 
from Is. 2d. to Is. 4d. in winter; women get 6d. in winter, and 
8d. in summer. Wright's work may be stated at 2s. to 2s. 6d. per 
day ; blacksmith's the same. Mason work L. 2 per rood of 36 square 
yards. Iron, wood, and leather are about the same prices as in 
other parts of the kingdom. 

Live-Stock. — The native breed of cattle is an inferior descrip- 
tion of the Highland breed, generally sleek-skinned and coarsely 
made. In many instances they get to a good size, and the cows 
milk better than the pure Highlanders. There is not sufficient 
attention paid to them in general, and, of course, a considerable pro- 
portion of the cattle stock in the parish is inferior. The ge- 
neral price of two year old cattle taken off by drovers to the south 
country markets has for the last few years, including the pre- 
sent, ranged from L. 3 to L. 8 each ; the ordinary price of cows 
from L. 5 to L. 11. 

The few sheep kept by the smaller tenants are Cheviots ; but, 
being ill-treated, and many of them dying of rot, they generally 
come to very little account, 

These remarks are applicable only to the smaller class of farms, 
on which the old system of husbandry still obtains, which is as 
follows : viz. on the best land, bear after manuring, followed by 
two crops of oats, and this followed in endless succession : on the 
outfield arable, two or three crops of oats, and then five or six 
rest; a few potatoes and turnips, and a patch of sown grass. The 
number of farms, however, managed after this mode is every year 
decreasing. 

Where a better system obtains, there are, of course, better 
stocks of cattle. A cross with the Teeswater has become very 
general, and seems likely, as agriculture improves, to supersede 
the native breeds. Leicester sheep, and Cheviot crossed with 
Leicester, are reared extensively, thrive well, and equal in weight 
any in the kingdom. Their wool gives great satisfaction in the 
southern markets. 

Improvements. — A great and rapid change to the better has 
taken place in agriculture during the last twenty years. There 
are several very extensive farms in the highest state of cultivation, 
thoroughly drained ; some of them to a considerable extent fur- 
row-drained, and enclosed with fences consisting of dry stone dike, 
hedge, and ditch. On one of these, the farm of Wester Watten, 
belonging to William Home, Esq. of Scouthel, it is believed that 



56 CAITHNKSS-SHIRE. 

there are from twenty to twenty-five miles of fences of this de- 
scription. 

It may be worthy of remark, that, about fifty years ago, the late 
Sir Robert Anstruther improved the Mains of Watten most ju- 
diciously, enclosed it with hedges and dikes, built a steading on 
' it, and laid it out in the best style. The late Mr Home of Lang- 
well was the first to follow his example on his property of Wester 
Watten above-mentioned, which, from being almost entirely waste 
and unproductive, was converted, under the able management of 
Mr James Purvis, now manager to Mr Traill of Ratter, into one 
of the finest, as it certainly is one of the largest farms in the north 
of Scotland. What his uncle did to Wester Watten, Mr Home 
of Scouthel, well known for many years past as the greatest and 
most successful improver in this county, has more recently done 
to his property of Lynegar, also in this parish ; and Sir R. A. 
Anstruther of Balcaskie, the principal proprietor in the parish, 
has, for some years past, been pursuing a most admirable system 
on his extensive estates, viz. that of granting, on improving leases, 
moderate-sized farms, regularly subdivided, fenced, and intersected 
by good roads, with all requisite encouragement to the tenantry, 
as respects draining, manure, comfortable dwelling-houses, &amp;c. 
His tenantry are amply supplied, at a low rate, with marl raised 
by dredging in a small loch adjoining the west end of the parish. 

It is the opinion of many, that, under such circumstances as 
these, the system of moderate-sized farms would eventually prove 
the most advantageous to the landlords in a pecuniary point of 
view, as it certainly would in a moral and economical, both to 
them and to the country at large, being the only means of pre- 
serving a class of men now fast wearing out, and whom the rapid 
extension of sheep-farming threatens in many districts to annihi- 
late altogether-the substantial peasantry of Scotland, the trus- 
tiest bulwark of the aristocracy, and the best defence under Pro- 
vidence of the altar, the throne, and the constitution ; a class ot 
men among whom religion, morality, and good order have flou- 
rished more than among any other ; a class who are seldom ap- 
preciated as they should be, and whose services may be most 
needed when they cannot be had. 

A wonderful stimulus has been given to agriculture, and the 
rearing of improved stock in this parish, as well as others in the 
county, by the easy access to the southern markets, opened up 
by steam within these few years, for fat cattle and sheep, a great

number of which are now annually shipped to Leith, Newcastle, 
and London. Great advantages have also followed from the spi- 
rited exertions of the county gentlemen to improve the breed of 
cattle, sheep, horses, &amp;c., by giving annual premiums to the ex- 
hibitors of the best stock. So successful, indeed, have these been, 
that this county need not now dread a competition in these mat- 
ters, open to all Scotland, as was amply shown at the Highland 
Society's meeting at Inverness in 1839. 

Produce. — Average gross amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained : — 

Oats, 6500 quarters, at L.l, Is. per quarter, . . L. 6825 0 0 

Bear, 860 do. at L.l, 8s. per do. . . 1204 0 0 

Potatoes, 2800 bolls at 10s. per boll, . . 1400 0 0 

Turnips, 300 acres, at L.7 per acre, . . 2100 0 0 

Hay, 30,000 stones, at 6d. per stone, . . 750 0 0 

Land in pasture and miscellaneous produce, . 700 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, . L.12,979 0 0 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 

Market- Toio7i. — There are no market or other towns in the pa- 
rish. The nearest market-town is Wick, distant eight miles. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are, one post-office, at the bridge of Watten, 
being a sub-office to Wick, — twenty miles of turnpike roads, along 
seven miles of which the mail passes daily, and a carrier twice a- 
week, and various bridges, all of inconsiderable size, excepting two 
at Watten and Dunn. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very inconveniently 
situated, being distant from the north-east extremity of the parish 
only one mile, and nearly nine miles from the south-west. The 
date of its erection is unknown. It appears from the session re- 
cords to have been repaired in 1714. Since that period, it has 
received several repairs, and was propped with wooden supports 
two years ago. It is in a very bad state. It may accommodate 
from 700 to 800 persons, and the sittings are all free. 1 he 
manse was built in 1778. There is a glebe of 24 acres, worth 
about 15s. per acre, and the amount of stipend is 14 chalders, 
half meal and half barley, with L. 10 for communion elements. 
There is no Government church. Dissenting, Seceding, Episcopa- 
lian, or Roman Catholic chapel in the parish. There is one mis- 
sionary in the Highland part of it, supported partly by the Royal 
Bounty Committee, and partly by the -people ; also, a cate- 
chist. The number of families attending the Established Church 



58 



CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 



is nearly equal to the number of families in the parish, and the 
church is generally full. The average number of communicants is 
about 120. There is one society in the parish— a Bible, Jewish, 
and Missionary Society. The average yearly collections for reli- 
gious purposes are about L. 25, and for charitable L. 20. 

Education.— The number of schools in the parish is 3, of which 
one is parochial, one endowed by the General Assembly's Educa- 
tion Committee, and one supported by fees. The parochial 
schoolmaster has the hiaximum salary of L. 34. He is obliged 
from age to have an assistant, who receives the fees, averaging 
L. 12, and occasional donations from the heritors. The general 
expense of education is, for reading. Is. 6d. or 2s. ; writing and 
arithmetic, 6d. each additional per quarter, Latin, 5s. Poor 
children are taught gratis at the parochial and General Assem- 
bly's schools. There are no children upwards of six years of age 
who are not in course of learning reading, writing, and arith- 
metic. Some aged persons there are, who cannot read, but the 
number of these is exceedingly small. The people universally 
are much alive to the benefits of education, and two additional 
schools are required which they are unable regularly to maintain. 

A parochial library has been established this year, which al- 
ready possesses upwards of 300 volumes ; there are also two Sab- 
bath schools very efficiently taught, and numerously attended. 

Friendbj Society.— Under this head there is nothing to parti- 
cularize excepting a Friendly Society instituted in 1819, for the 
purpose of aiding its members when sick, and their widows after 
their decease. It is sufficiently desirable in this point of view, 
but in other respects its advantages are not very obvious. _ 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average of persons receiving 
parochial aid is 35, and the average sum given to each 15s. per 
annum. The average sum at the disposal of the kirk-session for 
all parochial purposes, is about L. 34, of which L. 20 arise from 
church collections, the remainder being the interest of legacies, 
and sums collected many years ago by fines, and economy in the 
distribution of the funds. There is no other regular mode of pro- 
curintr fnnds for the poor. There are none unemployed who are 
able and willing to work, and there are none so destitute as not to 
have a cottage, plenty of fuel, and a spot of ground for cabbages 

The following are held in the parish, for the sale of 
horses, cattle, sheep, and other stock, for hiring servants, and

other purposes of markets generally. 1. Roodsmass, on the first 
Tuesday of May, old style ; 2. Roodsmass, on the third Tues- 
day of September, O. S. ; 3. Wester Market, on the last Tues- 
day of October ; 4. Maguusmass, on the last Tuesday of De- 
cember. Also three cattle-trysts, on the first Mondays of July, 
August, aud September, on the Hill of Backless., 

Inns. — There are 4 of these, being three more than the public 
accommodation requires. They receive almost no countenance 
from the people of the parish. 

, Fuel. — The fuel almost universally used is peat or turf, pro- 
cured from the peat-bogs, with which the parish abounds, at an 
expense of about 6d. per cart load, exclusive of carriage.

PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 

CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. WILLIAM M'KENZIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The word Olrick or Olrig, is of Norwegian deri- 
vation, and may be interpreted " the son of Erick :" it was ap- 
plied to this parish in allusion to a settlement made by some 
chief of that name on this part of the coast, about the end of 
the eighth or the beginning of the ninth century, when an inva- 
sion of this northern part of the kingdom is supposed to have taken 
place. 

Extent— The length of the parish from north-west to south-east 
is 5 miles, its medium breadth 3 miles: and it contains I5i 
square miles, or about 10,000 imperial acres. It is bounded on the 
west, east, and south by the parishes of Thurso, Dunnet, and 
Bower,— and the sea is the boundary on the north. 

Soil and Produce.— ThQ soil throughout the parish may 
be considered good; and as improvements in agriculture are ear- 
ned on, on the most approved plans, perhaps there is not a parish 
in the north of Scotland whore better crops of all kinds of useful 
produce are raised. There is abundance of marl in the parish, 



GO 



CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 



which, along with sand and sea-weed, afford every facility in the 
way of manure. The common of HilHclay being now divided 
and enclosed by the respective proprietors, and fast yielding to 
cultivation, very little of the parish can be considered as unfit for 
husbandry, and what is not already under cultivation, affords ex- 
cellent pasture for young cattle and sheep,— of the latter of which 
there is a large increase of late years, and that of the best de- 
scription. 

Minerals, 8c. — Limestone and freestone, slates and flags abound 
in the parish. 

In the raising of stone for pavement much has been done for 
some years back. The finest quality of this is found on the pro- 
perly of Mr Traill of Ratter, the stratification being so very regu- 
lar and plane, that it answers admirably for streets, without any 
surface dressing. The layers are from three-quarters of an inch 
to five inches thick and upwards in the quarry ; the colour of the 
stone from a smoke-gray to blue. This stone is very hard, and 
exceedingly strong and durable. Some of the oldest houses in 
Caithness are roofed with it, and it has been employed with 
advantage for granary floors, being laid on joists at the ordinary 
distance, in the upper as well as low flats of buildings. The 
inhabitants of London, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and 
other towns are now reaping the benefit of pavement exported 
from this parish. At Castlehill, machinery is employed in 
sawing the edges and polishing the surface of the stone, which, 
is now used in this prepared form for lobby floors, tables, hearth- 
stones, and mantel-pieces, and other purposes within doors. Up- 
wards of 100 labourers are constantly employed, and numerous 
cargoes of this useful commodity are exported every season; the 
proprietor having erected a neat and commodious harbour for 
his own use, has now the pleasure and advantage of seemg his 
own and other vessels coming in and going out in safety in the 
immediate neighbourhood of his mansion-house,— the tonnage-re- 
quired beina from 3000 to 4000, and the annual shipment of pave- 
ment alone°being from 300,000 to 400,000 square fe et. 

On the estates of Olrig and Murkle, there are also quarries of 
slate and flag of good quality. 

The line of sea coast belonging to this parish is not more than 
two miles from east to west. At the extremities of this line are 
the bavs of Castlehill and Murkle, both abounding with fish of 
every kind peculiar lo the coast, sought after with the exception 



OLRICK. 



Gl 



of the salmon-fishing, let to a respectable tenant, now only by the 
labourers as a recreation from other work, and for the use of their 
families. 

Allusion has been already made to the harbour at Castlehill ; 
and it is much to be regretted that no steps have been taken for 
having a harbour also erected in the bay of Murkle, which is so 
well adapted for the purpose, and which would afford shelter to 
vessels in distress, or retarded in their progress by contrary winds, 
being almost naturally locked in from the effects of that dangerous 
neighbour, the Pentland Frith, and there being abundance of water 
at all times of tide. 

Lakes. — The only lake, that of Durran, mentioned in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, was drained many years ago, and has 
amply rewarded the proprietors, — the surface of water being now 
exchanged for inexhaustible pits of marl and rich meadow pas- 
ture. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Begisters. — The earliest date of these is 1700, since 
which period the record of session, including births and marriages, 
has been regularly kept ; but no record of deaths seems to have 
been kept in this parish at any period. 

Antiquities. — Torfseus mentions a nunnery, the site of which is 
obviously indicated by the burn of Closters cloisters, running 
through the farm of Redlands, on the estate of Murkle, and not 
far from a green hillock resembling the Pictish cairns, which 
abound in the county, and of which there are several in this pa- 
rish. 

On the top of the hill of Olrick, on the southern boundary of the 
pari.sh, there are evident remains of a watch-tower, which, in for- 
mer times, must have been of no little importance, from the ex- 
tensive view it commands of the coast and the country round. 
Pom this spot the bays of Sandside, Scrabster, Dunnet, Freswick, 
and Reiss, Dunnet-head, the hills of Canisbay and Noss-head, all 
in this county, together with some of the islands of Orkney, and 
also some of the mountainous parts of Sutherland, Moray, Banff, 
and Aberdeen shires are visible,— affording one of the most exten- 
sive and finest views to be found in this northern partof the country. 

On the boundary of the parish on the east, towards Dunnet, 
It IS said there existed a church, the position of which is as- 
certained by the name of St Coomb's Kirk perhaps in honour 
of St Columba, being still given to the spot; and there is a 
farther tradition, that this church and the adjoiningman.se, sup- 



G2 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



posed to have been the parish church and manse of the united pa- 
rishes of Dunnet and Olrick, were, in the night season, suddenly 
overwhelmed with sand during the prevalence of a storm, the mi- 
nister and his family effecting their escape with difficulty by the 
roof; and it is probable that it was at this period that the adjoin- 
ing lands of the property of Tain shared the same fate. The dis- 
trict is now known by the name of the Links of Old Tain. 

The only other place in the parish worthy of note is Murkle, 
on the western boundary ; which name is believed to have been ori- 
ginally Mort Hill, or the field of death, applied in allusion to a bat- 
tle fought between the Danes and natives, in which the latter were 
victorious. It is said that the Scottish chief, on seeing a large hol- 
low at the head of Mnrkle Bay filled with the enemy, called out to 
his followers, " clear the den," which was responded to with such 
destruction of the invaders, that the place got the name of Clear 
Den, or Clairden, which it bears to this day. 

Land-owners. — The only two residing heritors are, James Traill, 
Esq, of Ratter, and James Smith, Esq. of Olrig, who have done 
much for the encouragement and comfort of their numerous te- 
nantry. The other non-residing heritors are, the Earl of Caith- 
ness ; Sir John Gordon Sinclair, Bart. ; and the Trustees of the 
late George Miller, Esq., who bequeathed the small property of 
Swarclet for the benefit of the poor of the parish of Thurso. 
III. — Population. 

By Dr Webster's Report in 1755, - 875 souls. 

By Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account in 1792, 1001 

By Government census in 1821, - - 1098 

By Do. Do. 1831, - - 1146 

And by a census taken up by the present parish minister in 
1835, in order accurately to meet some Government queries, the 
population was found to amount to 1352 souls, composed chiefly 
of farmers, farm-servants, and labourers. This increase is to be 
attributed to the erection and prosperity of the village of Castle- 
town, the only one in the parish, on the property of James Traill, 
Esq. of Ratter, and to the employment and liberal wages through- 
out the year afforded by him to numerous workmen in raising and 
preparing pavement for the southern markets. The number of 
inhabitants in this village, which is rising in importance, from the

In their general character, the people may be stated to be so- 
ber, industrious, intelligent, and attentive to the outward ordi- 
nances of religion. 

IV. — Industry. 

Affriciddire, Sfc. — The extent of the parish being about 10,000 
acres, 6000 may be reported as cultivated, and the remainder, 
with the exception of about 500 acres of links and moss, is ca- 
pable of cultivation. 

There are 20 acres under wood on the estates of Castlehill and 
Olrig. The oldest was planted by the present proprietor, James 
Traill, Esq. about fifty years ago, consisting principally of ash, 
plane, elm, oak, mountain-ash, and larch. Some of the trees have 
grown as high as 50 feet. The ash seems to thrive the best. 
Fir does not succeed. 

Rent. — The rent of arable land varies much, depending in a 
great measure on proximity to the sea-coast. Near the sea it may 
be stated at from L. 1 to L. 1, 5s. per acre; in the interior from 
12s. to 15s. is near the average. The rate of grazing a cow is 
L.2 in summer, and L.l, 10s. for wintering. Keep of a Leicester 
sheep is worth from 15s. to 20s. during the year. 

Wages. — Farm-servants' wages are, for men, from L, 6 to L. 8 
in money per annum, with 6i bolls meal, 2 bolls potatoes, house- 
room, fire, and a chopin of milk daily. Boys less in proportion. 
Out-door women get L. 3, 4 bolls of meal, with lodgings, fire, 
milk, and potatoes. House female servants L. 3 to L. 3, 10s. 
yearly. Harvest labourers are engaged for eight weeks. Men 
get L. 1, 10s., and one boll meal, with a chopin of milk daily, and 
a few potatoes; women L.l, and half a boll meal for the harvest, 
■ with potatoes and a mutchkin of milk daily. The price of la- 
bour has risen considerably within the last two years, from the 
great demand for hands at the stone-works, making roads, fur- 
row-draining, enclosing, 8cc. and may be stated for common la- 
bourers Is. 6d. per day in winter, and Is. lOd. in summer. Wo- 
men get now pretty generally 8d, a day for turuip-hoeing, and 6d. 
m winter for barn-work, pulHng turnips, &amp;c. Wrights, masons, 
and blacksmiths get about 2s. 6d. per day. Mason-work of ordi- 
nary wall height and girth measure is done for L.2 per rood of 36 
square yards. Blacksmiths get L.2, 10s. per annum for each pair 
of horses. They uphold the horses' shoes, iron-work of ploughs 
and carts. Saddlers get from L. 1 to L. 1, 5s. for upholding the 
harness of each pair of horses during the year. 



G4 CAITIINESS-SIIIUE. 

Breeds of Live-Stock.— The common breed of cattle among the 
proprietors and larger tenants is a cross with the Highland and 
Teeswater, which Mr Traill introduced some years ago. They 
have answered very well, and are a vast improvement compared 
with the old stock. The smaller tenants still keep the old breed, 
an inferior description of highlanders. 

The breed of sheep is the Leicester, which was also introduced 
by Mr Traill eight years ago : it has succeeded beyond expecta- 
tion, both as to weight and the quality of the wool. There are 
now about 1500 sheep of this kind in the parish ; and the num- 
ber is yearly increasing. 

Husbandry.— The husbandry of the parish is of all kinds, from 
the best modern systems to the most antiquated. On the improv- 
ed farms the five and six shift courses are followed. Turnips eat 
off with sheep, and business managed much the same as in the 
southern part of the kingdom. On the lands occupied by the 
smaller tenantry they occupy more than one-half of the parish, 
the system is continual cropping, or nearly so, viz. bear and oats 
alternatelv. Numbers are beginning to sow a few turnips and 
grass-seeds ; but there is scarcely as yet any regular rotation in- 
troduced. However, with the great command the parish has of 
manure, viz. marl, sea-weed, and shell-sand, vast quantities of bear 
and oats are raised of good quality— Angus oats generally weigh- 
ing from 40 lb. to 42 lb. per bushel, and bear from 48 lb. to 52 
lb. A part of the parish Murkle is remarkable for producing 
black oats. They degenerate everywhere else by repeated sowing 
except here; the consequence of which is, that the whole coun- 
ty take a change of seed of their oats from Murkle. 

The mode of reclaiming waste lands is,— first enclose with ditch 
and thorn hedge, protected with flags set on edge; then drain out the 
springs with three feet or four feet drains as required ; plough in and 
allowit to lie a year or more; lay on marl or shell sand at the rate 
of twenty to twenty-five loads per acre; then cross plough and 
work it down for turnips with dung, or bone-dust, or both ; feed 
the turnips off with sheep ; then oats, or bear and grass seeds ; 
then pasture with sheep for a few years; and the land is general- 
ly afterwards fit for any rotation. The quality of the soil being 
eood, considerable progress is made and making in thus reclaim- 
L v4ste lands. Furrow draining has also been introduced on Mr 
Traill's estate. The effect is wonderful, and the practice vfiH, 
though expensive, in a few years be common. 



OLRICK.

The principal tenants have in general leases of from fourteen to 
twenty-one years, with stipulations as to cropping. The small occu- 
piers are at icill, and are wearing out, — the tendency of the present 
system of improvement being to throw the whole lands into large 
farms. 

Where the farms are large the steadings are substantial and com- 
modious ; slates, flags, and building stones of the best quality be- 
ing abundant ; the fences are also very good, either stone walls Or 
hedges protected with flags. On the small farms the houses are al- 
most wholly built with feal covered with divots, — chimneys few 
In number — and fences of a very indifferent description. 

The principal improvements made in the parish have been 
done by James Traill, Esq. of Ratter, and James Smith, Esq. 
of Olrig. The other proprietors are non-resident, and do not 
seem to give much attention to their estates. Mr Traill may well 
be called the author of all improvements in the county ; which a 
single view of his property in this parish, after surveying Caithness, 
will sufficiently testify, either as regards culture, plantations, build- 
ings, harbours, roads, live-stock, or crops ; indeed, what he has ac- 
complished could scarcely be credited as being the work of one in- 
dividual, and is and will be a great example to Caithness proprie- 
tors in all time comino'. 

o 

The obstacles to improvements are the state of occupancy by 
small tenants, and the want of capital. 

The rental of the parish is about L. 4000 a year ; L. 50,000 
laid out on buildings, enclosures, roads, and drains, would not do 
more than put the parish into a fair state of cultivation. It is, 
therefore, easily seen that its final improvement must be a work of 
time. The facilities of procuring manure ; the excellent materi- 
als for buildings, enclosures, and drains, got from the refuse of the 
flag quarries, are its great advantages, and will ultimately produce 
great results. The surface is capable of producing more than 
double of what it does at present ; and as a matter of course will 
pay double rent ; there is, therefore, little doubt, that ere long, in 
consequence of easy access to the southern markets by the aid of 
steam-vessels, that capital will find its way to call out the dormant 
and neglected resources of this and every other parish in the coun- 
ty of Caithness. 

. V. — Parochial Economy. 
A he parish is well accommodated with roads. The county 
Ime, from Thurso to Wick, passes through it, and there is no

deficiency of cross-roads. There is a daily post between Castle- 
town and Thurso ; and a regular carrier to Wick. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\ie present church, conveniently situated 
for the parish, seems to have been built in 1633, and though fre- 
quently repaired, has never had any addition made to it. It has 
never been divided, nor seated at the expense of the heritors. It 
affords accommodation for only 403 sitters, at 18 inches; and this 
being far below what the increasing population require of seat- 
room, the heritors have lately adopted a very handsome plan 
by Mr David Cousin, architect in Edinburgh, agreeable to which 
a'new church is now building, which will afford the requisite ac- 
commodation, and be a great ornament to the village of Castle- 
town, at the east end of which it is situated. The manse was built 
about fifty years ago, and along with the offices underwent consider- 
able repairs in 1825. . There is a glebe attached to it of 8 Scotch 
acres, which may be valued at L. 10. The amount of stipend is 
14 chalders, half barley and half oatmeal, with L. 8, 6s. Sd. for 
communion elements. The number of communicants is 120. 
There is no Dissenting place of worship in the parish ; the num- 
ber of Dissenters is under 100 ; and these belong to the Original 
Seceders, Independents, and Baptists, the great majority of whom 
readily signed a late petition to the Legislature in behalf of the ex- 
tension and endowment of the Established Church. 

Education— are one parochial and four other schools m 
the parish. About one-eighth of the population may be comput- 
ed as attending school. 

The salary of the parish teacher is the maximum. All the 
usual branches of a classical and commercial education are 
taught. The fees are moderate, in no case exceeding 7s. per 
quarter, whatsoever branches are taught. The other teachers 
are upon their own adventure. There is not a person m the pa- 
rish above five years of age but who can read, and, with few ex- 
ceptions, also write. The children of such as are in indigent 
circumstances are educated gratuitously. There is a Sabbath 
school, where the youth of both sexes are carefully instructed m 
the principles of the Christian religion. 

Lihrar7j.—T\\eve is a parish library consisting of some hun- 
dred volumes of useful books, of a miscellaneous and religious 

character. . • , r 

Friendly Societies.— Oi these there are three in the parish, from

which much benefit has been derived by the aged and infirm, as 
well as by widows and orphans. Allowances are also made for de- 
fraying the funeral expenses of members and their widows. The 
Castletown Society alone, since its commencement in 1797, has 
distributed nearly L. 4000. These Societies have prevented many 
from being on the poor's roll. 

Poo7- and Parocliial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 35, whose circumstances are taken into 
due consideration without any special or fixed sum being allotted. 
There is a mortification of L. 100, left by the late Dr Oswald of 
Scotstown, the interest of which, along with L. 25 of collections, 
and some seat-rents in the church, nnder the direction of the ses- 
sion, placed at their disposal last year L. 36, 12s. 4d. There is 
no assessment of the heritors. Particular care is taken in the ad- 
mission of parties on the poor roll — vagrancy is disco\iraged — no 
pauper certificate for begging has been granted during the last 
fifteen years — and in various cases, the heritors and parishioners 
have subscribed liberally, in order to prevent families from be- 
coming a permanent burden upon the parish. 

Fairs. — There are three annual fairs held in the parish, in 
March, June, and November, for the sale and purchase of cattle. 

Inns. — There are two in the parish, which are well kept, but 

one would be fully sufficient for the accommodation required by 
travellers. 

Fuel. — Moss is not very abundant in this parish ; but there is 
now an abundant supply of English coal to be had at the village 
of Castletown : it is conveyed in vessels that are constantly ar- 
riving at Castlehill for cargoes of pavement.

PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 
CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. JOHN MUNRO, MINISTER. 



L_T0P0GRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

Name.— Th-e ancient name of this parish was St Fergus and 
St Thomas. It had this name because the parish of St Fergus 
was united to that of St Thomas's soon after or about the time of 
the Reformation. It is very probable that the tract of country 
now known by the name of the parish of Halkirk, or the united 
parishes of Halkirk and Skinnet, contained at some remote period 
more than the two parishes above alluded to : the number of bury- 
ing grounds, and the ruins of several places of worship, afford a 
presumptive proof of this. Some of these, however, are said to 
have been chapelries in the times of Popery. The etymology of 
the modern name, Halkirk, is involved in the greatest obscurity, 
and, as there is no tradition regarding it, the conjectures of ima- 
gination are the only sources from which any thing probable can 

be drawn. . 

Extent, S{c.-The very irregular figure of the parish makes it 
difficult to ascertain its real extent. The extreme length is 24 
miles, the breadth varies from 12 to 3 miles. From these consi- 
derations, we may suppose that the parish contains about 90 or 
92 square miles. The parish is bounded on the north by the pa- 
rish of Thurso ; on the north-east and east by the parishes of Bow- 
er and Watten; on the south and south-west by the parishes ol 
Latheron, Kildonan, and Reay ; on the west by Dorrory, a detach- 
ed part of the parish of Thurso ; and on the north-west by the pa- 
rish of Reay. 

Topographical Appearanccs.-Theve is neither I'll nor moun- 
tain remarkable for height in the parish, except the Spittal hill 
partly in this parish and partly in the parish of Watten, and about 
Cee miles sovUh-east from the church of Halkirk. The elevation of 
this hill above the level of the sea is not known ; its height, how- 



HALKIRK. CO 

ever, is such that the greater part of the county may be seen from 
its summit. From time immemorial till within the last seven or 
eight years, it was customary to have an annual market on the very 
top of this hill. From the name of the market, the Jamesmas, 
it is evident that it had its origin during the prevalence of Popery 
in Scotland. This market is now held in a place equally centrical 
and far easier of access, and will be afterwards mentioned under 
another head. 

Hydrography. — There is a considerable number of lakes in the 
parish, from twenty-two to twenty-four, including small and great. 
The loch of Calder is about 3 miles in length, and from one 
mile to half a mile in breadth. The next in magnitude is Loch- 
raore, which differs very little in size from the other. Both these 
lochs have a very pleasing effect on the scenery. In travel- 
ling towards either of them a person does not see them till 
they burst at once on his view, and they form a striking and a 
lively contrast to the moss and the heath with which they 
are surrounded. There are two rivers which pass through the 
parish. By the inhabitants of this parish, the principal of 
these rivers is called the river of Halkirk, but at Thurso, near 
which it enters the sea, it is called the river of Thurso. The 
source of this river is Alltan na cat, or Cat'sbrook, which is about 
eight miles south-west from Lochmore and in Sutherlandshire. 
Though this brook is considered the source of the river, there are 
several lakes, upwards of twenty, which pour their waters into the 
river. Some of these lakes are in this parish, and some in the 
mountains which divide this county from Sutherlandshire. As 
this river flows through a wide extent of country it receives into 
its channel and discharges into the sea a great quantity of water. 
After much rain or a rapid thaw it overflows its banks, and, du- 
ring the harvest months, has at times done great damage to grass 
and other crops which lie within its range. Its course is nearly 
through the centre of the parish ; and, taking into calculation its 
various windings, its length from the source to its junction with 
the sea is from 40 to 50 miles. The other river, that of Forssy, 
divides this parish from Reay on the north-west, and joins the sea at 
Forss, in the parish of Thurso. This river, after great falls of rain, 
comes down in torrents, and does much injury to corn and grass in 
low situations near its course. It is from 15 to 20 miles in 
length. Trout and salmon are taken in both the rivers, and 
trout of various kinds in the lakes. — There are two springs in the

parish which may be noticed. Tobair Acraig, the well of Halkirk, 
about a mile south-east from the church, is believed to be medi- 
cinal, and partakes of the nature of chalybeate waters. The other 
is at the north-west end of the Loch of Calder, and is believed by 
the inhabitants in its vicinity to be useful for the cure of diseases. 
It is of the same nature with the one just mentioned. It may be 
observed that marl is found in the Loch of Calder, and that a 
year or two ago, exertions were made, which are still persevered m, 
to raise it by means of a boat having machinery attached for the 
purpose. Another loch, that of Leurary, the whole bottom of 
which is a bed of iiiarl, was drained a number of years ago, and 
the loch being now Jry, this substance is easily obtained, and is 
found very useful for agricultural purposes. 

II. — Civil History. 
La7id-oioners.— The land-owners in this parish are. Sir George 
Sinclair of Uibster, Bart. M. P. for the county ; Lord Duffus ; 
Sir Patrick M. B. Thriepland of Fingask and Toftingal, Bart. ; 
James Sinclair, Esq. of Forss; Charles S. Guthrie, Esq. of Scots 
Calder; Donald Home, Esq. of Langwell; David Henderson, Esq. 
of Westerdale ; James Smith, Esq. of Olrig ; and Adam Duff, Esq. 
of Banniskirk. None of these except Mr Henderson of Wester- 
dale reside in the parish. 

Parochial Registers The old registers of this parish were de- 
stroyed many years ago by some ill disposed persons. The present 
ones commence with the year 1790. 

Antiquities.- One of the relics of antiquity in this parish is the 
Castle of Brawl. It is situated on the north bank of the river 
Thurso, which flows through the middle of a valley, long and broad, 
commencing to form at the sea, and extending fully twelve miles 
into the interior. A place equidistant from both the extremities 
of this valley, and at which there is a peculiar winding in the 
course of the river, attractive and pleasing to the eye, is the spot 
chosen for this once strong and well fortified, but now ruined 
haunt of ancient heroes. Under the general designation, Castle 
of Brawl, are comprehended two distinct buildings, belonging to 
different eras of architecture. The most ancient of these is a 
tower 39 by 36 feet; and there still remain 35 feet of the height. 
The walls are 9 feet thick; and in the centre of the east wall is 
formed a stone stair leading to the very top of the building. In 
the walls there are several recesses 2 feet and 2 feet 8 inches m 
breadth, which may contain two or three persons in a standing po- 



HALKIRK. 



71 



sition. These recesses diminish oradually bolh in height and 
breadth towards the outside of the wall, and each of them ends in 
a narrow opening-, which appears to have admitted all the light 
which found an entrance to this gloomy abode of the heroes of 
battle and of rapine. These openings seem also to have been cal- 
culated as convenient positions from which those within the castle 
could shoot at such of their foes as dared attack them in this fast- 
ness, which, before the invention of gunpowder, must have been of 
considerable strength. There are other recesses in the walls, not 
unlike small rooms, 5, 6, 7, and 8 feet long, by 3, 4, and 5 broad, 
and 6i, 7, and 8 feet high. On the ground floor in the north 
side there is a strongly built dismal hole, 10 or 12 feet by 4, and 
about the same height with those already mentioned. It is cover- 
ed with massy stones, and must from its appearance have been a 
place either of concealment or of imprisonment. The whole su- 
perstructure is of a hard durable species of stone found in the vi- 
cinity. On the north-west side of the tower there is a fosse, 6 feet 
deep, and about 20 broad, which jjrotei-ted it on that side, and the 
river alforded it some defence on the other. The other building in 
ruins, or rather the commencement of a more spacious and com- 
modious castle, projected on a more elegant plan, belongs to a 
more improved era of architecture, and is of a modern date com- 
pared to the tower. The front height of this ruin varies from 12 
to 15 feet. The building is erected on a bank elevated 6 or 7 
feet above the bed of the river, and looks towards the east, on 
which side, and within a very short distance thereof, the river flows 
with a murmuring hum over a rough stony channek All that 
seems to have been built of this well projected and pleasantly si- 
tuated castle is the ground floor, 100 feet in length by 50 in 
breadth, divided into six vaults, four of which have two port-holes 
in each ; and there is one in each end of a passage which runs be- 
twixt the end and the centre vaults. The diameter of these port- 
holes varies from 3 to 4 inches. Each vault has a door com- 
municating with the passage just mentioned, and to each end of 
which there is a stair descending from the back of the building. 
The dimensions of these vaults are 16 and 17 feet square, by 12 
in height. Some of them have small windows li, feet by 1 foot. 
All the light admitted into two of them enters through a very nar- 
row opening above the port-holes. By whom and at what period 
the tower was built and inhabited, and by whom the more modern 
building was commenced and so far carried on, arc questions not 



72 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE, 



easily solved. Some say that the former was inhabited by a suc- 
cession of the Bishops of Caithness and Sutherland, and that the 
latter, so far as it was finished, was the work .of one of these bi- 
shops. The only foundation for this lame tradition is a story, quite 
a true one, that one of the bishops who occupied the see was 
burnt by some lawless miscreants in his castle of Halkirk. There 
is no reason for confounding Halkirk with Brawl, as they are on 
opposite sides of the river. The place where the horrid deed was 
perpetrated was a residence which the bishops had on the Hal- 
kirk bank of the river, opposite the Castle of Brawl. There is 
no vestige of a ruin to point out where the bishop's residence 
stood. It is probable, however, it was in a field to the north-east 
of the present manse, where the parochial ministers had their re- 
sidence till the present house was built. The total removal of 
every stone of this building has obliterated the memory of its ex- 
istence. This has been the means of ascribing to the bishops the 
ruins which remain ; it has been the means of placing them in a 
tower over which they never had any control; and of fathering 
on their invention and power a project which never owed its form 
or its existence either to their wealth or to their contrivance. The 
more probable opinion is, that the Castle of Brawl was a residence 
of the Harolds and Sinclairs, who were Earls of Caithness, the 
former at a very early period, and the latter ever since the Ha- 
rolds lost the title. At Brawl there is an extensive garden, by 
far the most ancient in the county, belonging to the family of Ulb- 
ster, which, notwithstanding its northern latitude, and its being ra- 
ther neglected, produces considerable quantities of fruit, and in 
and around it stand chestnut, ash, and elm trees, of good size 
both in height and circumference. 

There was also a castle on the rugged crag of Dirlot, said to 
have been inhabited by a bold and daring fieebooter of the name 
of Sutherland, a near relation of the Dunrobin Sutherlauds, whose 
lands of Dylrid and Cattak were forfeited for treason, and given 
to M'Kay of Strathnaver by charter, dated at Inverness, 4th 
November 1489. The rock of Dirlot is said to have been sur- 
rounded at one time by the river, and accessible only by a draw- 
bridge. The nature of the ground gives some countenance to 
this tradition ; but now the river flows entirely on one side of the 
crag, on whose summit the gray remains of the castle are to be 
seen. There was also a place of defence, and of no small im- 
portance, at the north corner of Lochmore, where the river issues 



HALKIRK. 



73 



from that lake. There was another at the east end of the Loch 
of Calder. These relics of towers, castles, and forts, are the only 
monuments remaining of the wealth and the power of the chief- 
tains of days that are gone ; these are the only remnants of their 
possessions ; the only indications of their greatness. The fame 
of their possessors is not recorded in story : if the bard ever sung 
of their valour ; if tradition for a while spoke of their achievements 
in war, or commended their heroism in the day of battle, the 
■song of the one is no longer sung in the hall, and the tongue of 
the other is for ever silent. If a little green hill, or three gray 
stones did for years point out the tomb of their rest, they are now 
thoughtlessly trodden upon by a race to whom their names and 
their deeds are alike unknown. If a rude unsculptured pillar 
marked out the spot or the field where they fell, it stands on a 
lonely moor, or the side of a barren hill, without a name engraved 
either by tool or tradition. 

There are also some remains of ecclesiastical antiquity. Of 
these are the relics of St Thomas's Chapel at Skinnet. Here 
was left to stand the sacred chair of St Thomas, of exquisite 
workmanship in stone, an object of some curiosity ; it may be of 
superstitious veneration, till broken down and used in building a 
fence. Within the walls of the chapel which still remain, as well 
as in the ground around, a few continue to bury their dead. There 
was another of these chapels at Banniskirk, of which there are no 
remains ; its stones have been removed, and the silent mansions 
of the dead, by which it was surrounded, have been ploughed up, 
and added to an adjoining field  

A third of these ruined chapels, St Magnus, said to have been 
founded by the same individual who was the originator and the 
benefactor of the Kirkwall Cathedral, is at a place called Spittal. 
It appears to have been 60 feet by 20, and the walls, though in a 
dilapidated condition, have been left to decay under the slow 
but sure process of the blasting elements, and the demolishing 
progress of time ; and no views of expediency have induced the 
proprietor of the lands on which it is built to increase his re- 
venues by demolition and sacrilege ; nor has the occupant of the 
farm, in the centre of which it stands, so far forgotten the reve- 
rence due to the mighty dead, as to enlarge his fields by disturb- 
ing their repose, scattering their ashes, and exposing their bones 
to the bleaching influence of sun and of rain. Here was the ce- 
metery of the clan Gunn, at one time a powerful and a warlike.

finn, in order to be interred in the Chapel of Spittal. There was, 
besides, the Chapel of St Peter at Olgnimore, that of St Columba 
at Dirlot, and that of St Ciran in Strathmore. These last bear 
the names of the early propagators of Christianity in Scotland ; 
but whether built in their time, or by others in honour of them 
after their dav, is a subject that must for ever remam in doubt. 
If the pure doctrines of Christianity were for a time declared ni 
these ancient places of worship, it is certain, that during the dark 
aTes they were the temples of idols and their superstitious wor- 
shippers. In proof of this, it is traditionally reported, that a band 
of marauders made the image of St Ciran the butt of their arrows, 
and thus for their own amusement destroyed the last of the dumb 
idols worshipped in this part of the country. Of the Clachans of 
Gerston and Achardale, little remains exceil the name, and the 
certainty that each of them contains the ashes of the dead. It is 
evident from this enumeration of ruined chapels, whatever was 
the quality of the instruction given, that the people had more 
easy access to the public worship than at present. Whatever su- 
perior advantages the present generation enjoy compared to those 
that are gone, it appears that the latter were more zealous in sup- 
porting a false religion than the former are in supportmg and at- 
tending the pure doctrines of the Gospel. 

III. — Population. 
Were we to be guided by the former Slatistical Account, we 
would be led to think that the population was greater at the time 
it was written than at present. There cannot, however, be the 
least ground for such an opinion, as the Government census shows 
an increase at each of the periods it was taken. No part ol tne 
parish has been depopulated, and, in moors where ten years ago 
there was no house, a considerable number of dwelhngs is now 
■ built The occupiers improve as much of the waste ground as 
their circumstances enable them. The gradual increase 6f the 
population is to be attributed to ihe cultivation of waste ground - 
he improvement of which'is carried on by those poor and mdus- 
tvious individuals who build houses in moors, and by formers who 



HALKIRK. 



75 



employ labourers to cultivate wastes adjacent to the arable land 
they occupy. Thus there is a demand for labour, and the soil 
yields a produce sufficient to remunerate the farmer for the capi- 
tal he may have laid out. 

In 1831 the population was 2847, viz. 1322 males ; 1525 females. 
In 1836, - 3085 

of whom about 1180 were under 15 years of age, 

875 were between 15 and 30 years, 
645 - 30 and 50 

294 - 50 and 70 

91 were upwards of 70 yeai-s. 

There is a population of 1 70 in the village of Halkirk, and the 
rest spread over the extent of the parish. The average number 
of marriages is 18 in the year, and of baptisms, 74. There is no 
register of deaths kept. 

Language. — The Gaelic language and the Scots dialect of 
English are spoken in the parish. A considerable majority of the 
old people speak the Gaelic ; but there are not many of the young 
who cannot speak the Scotch, which, it is acknowledged, prevails 
now more than it did thirty or forty years ago. 

According to the usages of this parish, and, indeed, of the 
county, the terms for hiring farm as well as domestic servants, 
commence for the summer half year on the 20th of June, and for 
the winter half year on the 26th of November, or the 9th of June, 
and 15th of November old style. This is a very unequal division 
of the year, inasmuch as it makes a difference of very nearly seven 
weeks betwixt the summer and the winter half year. But this is 
not all ; for servants who complete their service on the 20th of 
June are not considered entitled to their wages till towards the 
end of August,— the time of a great annual market at Thurso, 
and as a great number of servants attend this market it gives them 
an opportunity of mis-spending their wages. A servant, whose 
term of service ends on the 26th of November, is not paid hir, 
wages till the 12th of January thereafter, which is the day observed 
by the country people as New- Year's Day,— a time when servants 
are too apt to spend their hard-earned penny in drink and other 
equally useless purposes. The dwelling-houses of the peasantry, 
constructed without much regard to the rules of architecture, have 
a forbidding appearance. This description is applicable to the 
greater nmnber of houses. In most cases, all the houses neces- 
sary for the generality of tenants are built in a continued line. 
The barn and the kiln are in one end of this line, after these fol- 
lows the dwelling-house, generally divided into three apartments. 



76 CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 

After this come the byre, stable, and other necessary houses, ar- 
ranged in an order by no means the most convenient or pleasing. 
Some have of late built houses of better construction, which have 
a more pleasing aspect, and must at the same time afford their oc- 
cupiers more comfort than houses built after the structure follow- 
ed till very lately in this county. It may be mentioned that at- 
tention is paid to cleanliness, both in the domestic economy and 
dress of the peasantry, and the sober and the industrious enjoy 
that share of the comforts of life with which people in the lower 
ranks are generally found to be content ; and that they are so in 
this parish, the writer knows from the experience of several years 
spent among them. In a population so great, there must of neces- 
sity be individuals of very different dispositions, and of various de- 
.grees of intelligence ; but, keeping out of view occasional brawls 
and a few squabbles which very seldom occur, the great mass of the 
population is to be considered as composed of good moral charac- 
ters, who, in outward behaviour, conduct themselves in a manner 
becoming the Christian name; and there is a reason to hope, that 
not a few have felt the vital influences of the gospel of peace. 
The whole of the inhabitants, with the exception of thirty-three 
individuals, are attached to the Established Church of Scotland. 
Making allowances for the distances which they have to travel, 
and the very bad roads by which they must come, the people on 
the whole are regular in attending public worship on the Sabbath, 
as well as catechetical exercises on week-days. That they are 
exempted from the failings and short-comings of our nature, is 
what can be neither expected nor affirmed. That a few young men, 
prompted by folly and the mere love of sport, should occasionally 
trespass against the game laws, can surprise no one who considers 
the temptations to which individuals are exposed in a place where 
wide extended moors, with abundance of game, are inducements 
to the sportsman too powerful to be resisted. This is not an apo- 
logy for breaches of law ; it is a mere statement of facts, which, 
when considered, must make the rarity of such breaches highly 
creditable to the inhabitants of remote districts, who can often 
commit a trespass of this nature without the least fear of de- 
tection.

dered in extent as about 90 or 92 square miles, — 73,600 imperial 
acres : about 6000 of these are cultivated, as many under natural 
or meadow grass, and the rest is moor, moss, lakes, rivers, &amp;c. The 
rate of annual rent is as high as L. 1, 10s. and as low as '2s. 6d. 
per acre. From what has already been done, it is quite evident 
that a great proportion of what is now waste ground might be im- 
proved to advantage, and, were the people encouraged to labour in 
this work, many would undertake the cultivation of such ground in 
preference to going to America at the imminent risk of their lives, 
and in violation of those feelings which make man cleave to the 
rugged rocks of his native mountain, the remembrance of which is 
associated in foreign climes with his recollection of the home and 
the country of his fathers. It is much to be regretted that those 
who do their utmost to subdue the stubborn soil of the moor 
and the mountain meet with so little encouragement. Instead of 
being made to pay a rent of 5s. or 2s. 6d, for every acre brought 
into cultivation, it would be better policy to give four times the 
sum for every acre so cultivated, for at least five or six years after 
a poor person commences such laborious and expensive work, and. 
then a moderate rent might be charged for an equal number of 
years. A plan of this nature would encourage individuals to improve 
waste grounds, which, as they are, yield no food for man, no re- 
venue for the proprietors, — whereas, by following a different system 
from that adopted, they might be made to support the labourer,, 
and to pay the landlord a certain per centage for moneys expended 
in inducing people to embark in the work. A good deal is cer-, 
tainly done, but infinitely more would be cheerfully performed 
under a system which would hold out inducements for adding to 
what one may already possess, instead of deterring him from doino- 
anything that way, by the certainty of 5s. being added to his rent 
for every acre brought into cultivation. 

Quarries.— There are quarries of limestone in different parts of 
thepari.sb. The lime made from these is used in masonry ; but it 
answers better in agricultural processes than for any other Je it can 
be applied to. There are also quarries of flags. These are mudi 
used m floormg m country houses; they are also used in paving ; 
lor which they are remarkably well adapted. Great numbers of 
ttiem are annually exported to Leith, Aberdeen, &amp;c. 

 - — Parochial Economy, 

iVirto- ro7/;»._The nearest market-town is Thurso, which is 
about seven miles from the parish church. 



78 CAITHNlCSS-SniRK. 

Means of Communication.— There are three roads through the 
parish by which people can travel to Thurso ; these are not finish- 
ed to the different extremities of the parish. They have been 
made within the last three years on Macadam's principles, and 
are in very good repair. An annual market is held in the 
-village of Halkirk on the Tuesday before the 26th December. Its 
name is St Magnus ; it is not much attended. Another annual 
Ttiarket is held within two miles of the church. The site of this mar- 
ket is the hill of Ruggy, which is partly in this parish, and partly in 
the parishes of Tburso and Bower. The market is principally a 
cattle one ; the situation is centrical ; and people from all parts of 
the county can conveniently attend. Five roads may be said to 
lead to the place where it is held : one from Thurso, one through 
Bower and Watten, one from Wick, one from Latheron, and one 
through this parish. 

There are two bridges on the river of Halkirk ; one at the vil- 
lage not more than a quarter of a mile from the church. It was 
built in 1731, consists of three arches, and is very convenient and 
useful. It has of late undergone considerable repairs, and, if no 
unforeseen accident happen, it may stand for centuries to come. 
The other bridge is at Dale, five miles farther up the river than 
the Halkirk bridge. It contains two arches, each thirty feet span. 
It is quite new, having been finished in 1834. There is also a 
timber bridge in the Mission at Dirlot. It is intended for the con- 
venience of people coming to hear preaching at the Mission-house, 
and is equally convenient for general and ordinary communication. 

There is a mile of turnpike road passing through a corner of 
the parish, and the mail-coach passes through this part of the pa- 
rish twice every day, but the inhabitants do not enjoy the benefit 
of it, for all letters for the parish are carried to Thurso, and some- 
times lie there a day or two before they are broughtto the Bridge- 
end of Halkirk, to which there is a penny-bag thrice a week, ihis 
is kept up at an expense of L.9,-a much greater expenditure 
than could be incurred were there a bag with all letters for the pa- 
rish left at one or other of the houses in that part of the parish 
throuMi which the mail passes. Besides this mile of turnpike, 
therem-e three branches of county road,-the whole making an 
aeeregate of about fifteen miles. , -j . 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church is situated on the east side of 
the river,-near the extremity of the parish on that side,-on the 
other, however, the parish extends three miles towards Thurso. 



HALKIRK.

The distance from the church to Achpheadair Peter's-field and 
Knock-glass, the extremities on the west and north-west, is from five 
to six miles and a-half; the distance to Banniskirk and Achchipster, 
the extremities on the east and south-east, is three miles and a-half 
to the former, and six and a-half to the latter ; and the distance to 
Dalghanachain, Glutt, and Rumsdale, the utmost extremity to the 
south, is from twenty to twenty-four miles. The church was built in 
1753, and underwent a substantial repair in 1833. It accommo- 
dates about 756 individuals ; 18 sittings are set apart for the poor 
by the heritors, and about 20 are provided for them by the minis- 
ter and session, by placing benches in wide passages. Till after 
the last repair of the church, none of the heritors rented their pro- 
portion of sittings in the church; some of them have since let the 
sittings to the tenants, and others have not. A few farmers have 
claimed and obtained the same right to a seat in the church that 
they had previous to the repair. The highest rent charged for a 
sitting is 4s. and the lowest Is. The manse was built about the 
same time with the church, and underwent some repairs in 1823. 
The extent of the glebe is from 7i to 8 imperial acres; this in- 
cludes the site of the manse, the garden, &amp;c. The annual value 
of the whole is from L. 8 to L. 10. The stipend is 15 chalders 
of victual, half meal and half barley, and L. 10 for communion 
elements. There is a missionary employed in the most distant 
parts of the parish, who is partly supported by the Committee for 
managing the Royal Bounty, and partly by the inhabitants of the 
mission district of the parish. The missionary has three preach- 
ing stations— one at Achrenny in this parish ; one at Halsary in 
the parish of Watten ; and the third at Halladale in the parish of 
Reay. To the Halsary district there is attached a part of the pa- 
rish of Latheron. The population in this parish within the bounds 
of the mission is 784 ; these are very much scattered, and are 
often prevented from attending the missionary's preaching by the 
river and other streams, which, especially during the winter and 
spring, are so much swollen, and that perhaps on the day the 
missionary is to preach in the district, that it is impossible for 
many to attend, and very hkely they will not hear sermon again 
till the missionary is there three weeks thereafter. This produces 
great evils,— it begets indifference to the means of grace, and at 
last, in too many cases, a total neglect of these means. This is 
not to be attributed to the missionary, nor, humanly speaking, to 
the people, but to the system on which the mission is established,

and the utter impossibility of any one man being able, however 
gifted with abilities and zeal, to discharge aright duties requiring 
continual devotedness and unwearied labours to perform them 
either with success or efficiency. Is it to be supposed that a mi- 
nister can administer religious instruction to a population of at 
least 2500, scattered over the remote parts of three parishes, and 
the greater number of the distant glens and valleys in the high 
and mountainous districts of the county of Caithness Here is 
committed to the pastoral superintendence of a missionary a boun- 
dary, the extremes of which, by a practicable road, are from forty 
to fifty miles distant from one another. The distance, however, is 
the least of the obstructions in the missionary's way, and of the 
difficulties he has to encounter in the discharge of his highly im- 
portant duties : there are moors, mosses, and quaking fens which 
disjoin one valley from another, and which make it impossible, ex- 
cept by circuitous routes, to pass from glen to glen during the win- 
ter and spring months. The number of sittings in the mission 
house is 403, of which 351 were let when a survey was made dur- 
ing the spring of last year ; the highest rent charged is" Is. and the 
lowest 6d. per sitting. The whole church accommodation then 
in the parish is 1159 sittings, which is by far too few were the 
people within a distance that could enable them to attend regu- 
larly. It is questionable, however, how far the mission-house, 
from the circumstances mentioned, with preaching once in the 
three weeks, ought to he- reckoned church accommodation. There 
are two catechists employed by the minister and session, but they 
are principally paid by the parishioners. The parisji church and 
the iTiission chapel are the only places of worship in the parish. 
The total of all denominations who do not attend public worship 
in the Established Church is about 33 individuals; some of these 
are Seceders, others Independents, and a few Baptists and Epis- 
copalians. 

The number of communicants in the parish is 110. These bear 
a small proportion to the population ; but it is better to have a few 
whose walk and conversation are in conformity with the faith and 
the doctrines of Christianity, than to admit a promiscuous multi- 
tude, whose only motive might be the enjoyment of the outward 
privileges conferred on the partakers of this sacrament. 

iifZyMhoH.— The number of schools taught in the parish during 
the last two or three years is 13. One of these is the parochial 
school ; another is supported by the Society in Scotland for Pro- 



HALKIRK. 



81 



pagatiiig Christian Knowledge; and the others, three of which are 
female schools, are wholly supported by the parents of the chil- 
dren. The branches taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, English grammar, and at the parochial school Latin 
and all the other branches. The salary for the parochial school 
is the maximum, and the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge allow their teacher at Assary L.15. The amount of fees 
varies according to attendance, from L, 3 to L. 5, per quarter; the 
quarterly fees for each individual is. Is. 6d. for reading; 2s. for 
reading and writing; 2s. 6d. for arithmetic; 3s. for book-keep- 
ing and Enghsh grammar; and 5s. for Latin and geography. 
That the people are alive to the benefits of education, is evident 
from their supporting so many schools at their own charges, to in- 
struct their children in the elements of reading, writing, and arith- 
metic. Were schools established at all the stations at which the 
people employ teachers, the inhabitants generally would be within 
such a distance of a school as would put it in their power to cause 
their children attend. The total number of children who attend- 
ed the different schools during the year 1835 was 411, and the 
average number for some years is 390. 

Friendly Societies.— There are five Friendly Societies in the pa- 
rish. The object of these is to give a weekly allowance to sick 
members, a sum for funeral charges when any of the member's fa- 
mily dies, and a quarterly allowance to the widows of members, 
who shall have contributed to the funds of the society at least se- 
ven years previous to their death. The total number of members 
in these five societies is 644 ; and the number of widows support- 
ed by them is 29. The funds of the Halkirk Village Society 
amount to L. 300. This is the first that was established in the 
parish. The others have been instituted at various periods since ; 
and one thing that stimulated their founders to get them establish- 
ed may have been the success that attended the first. These 
societies are useful, inasmuch as they put in the power of heads 
of families to provide so far for their wives and children, as to 
leave them independent of parochial relief. 

_ Poor and Parochial Funds.— The anual average number receiv- 
mg parochial relief during the last ten years has been 95 ; and the 
average yearly sum given to each is 5s. Some of the absentee

heritors give occasionally a donation of L. 1 or L.2, in aid of the 
poor's funds. There has been received in this way since 1828, 
about L. 13, 7s. There are two legacies of L. 100 each, the in- 
terest of which is given to the poor. The average of the church 
collections for the last few years has been L. 20, which, with the 
interest of the L. 200 and the donations, generally amount to 
L 30 or L. 32. Out of this sum the session pay their clerk, pre- 
centor, officer, &amp;c. This, the only mode of supplying the wants 
of the poor, is, except in very few cases, found adequate to re- 
lieve the poor and the needy, on whose part there is no desire to 
become chargeable to the parish when they can avoid it ; indeed, 
the very small sum the funds afford is no inducetnent to any, ex- 
cept the truly destitute, to apply for parochial relief. In addition 
to what the very poorest receive from the session, they beg among 
the farmers, who are sufficiently liberal in giving them meal and 
other provisions, fully as acceptable to, and necessary for the poor 



lln the village of Halkirk there are three inns and four 
in other parts of the parish. Of the whole, three might be re- 
quired, but it is most surprising how such public nuisances are 
allowed to increase to so alarming an extent, to the manifest in- 
iurv of the morals of the youth of the parish. 

Fuel— There is great abundance of moss in every part of the 
parish,'from which the inhabitants have an excellent supply o 
peats the only fuel used in the parish. Every farmer is allowed 
L cut as many peats on his landlord's property as he requires, 
and as farmers either cut and bring home their own peats, or em- 
ly lir servants in doing so, the expense is very little, and sel- 
dom thought of, as the people have more time than money. 
General Observations. 
The most striking contrast betwixt the present state of the pa- 
ine mosi suiKuig  cultivation 
rish and its state forty years ago is, tiat there is 
carried on,-more of the waste grounds '"P'-f  
of husbandry introduced,-and the quantity of grain ra-ed ,s 
greater than at the former period. The new roads j e m de 
Ld those intended to be made, as soon as an increase in the fms 
Tihe disposal of the trustees permits, will, in the course of some 
. r e able landlords and tenants to carry on improvements, 
rS m: colce almost every one how little has yet been done 
of what it is possible to accomplish.

PRESBYIERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND 

CAITHNESS. 

THE REV. GEORGE DAVIDSON, MINISTER, 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Sfc. — The parish of Latheron is situated on the south- 
east coast of Caithness, and bounded in that direction by the Ger- 
man Ocean and Moray Frith ; on the west, by Sutherlandshire ; 
and on the north and east, by the parishes of Halkirk, Watten, 
and Wick. It is 27 miles in length along the sea coast, and from 
10 to 15 in breadth, containing about 300 square miles. 

Name. — By the last Statistical Account, the ancient name of 
the parish is said to be " Loinn, derived from Luidhoin, which 
signifies, in the Gaelic, lodffed or bedded bear, because the lands 
contiguous to the church are of a good quality, and yield excellent 
bear." But there is another derivation, which has always appeared 
to the present writer equally probable and rather more natural, 
viz. from the Gaelic words Ldthair Roin, which signifies the re- 
sort of seals,— species of animal with which the whole coast is 
covered. Numbers of them are still taken, as will afterwards be 
noticed, and no doubt, in former times, the oil obtained from them 
afforded one means of support to the inhabitants. Besides, this 
derivation seems to accord best with the Gaelic name Latharn, 
and to admit of a more easy transition into the modern or English 
name of Latheron. But especially it will be found by a reference 
to the Norse or Icelandic language, that the derivation here pre- 
ferred is much confirmed as to its probable correctness,— the words 
m that language having very much the same meaning. 

There is also another derivation suggested by the aspect of the 
parish, which seems scarcely less probable than that now conjec- 
tured, VIZ. from the Gaelic Lath-dr-shonn, signifying the day of 
the slaughter of heroes, or Lathair shonn, the place of heroes, 
inaeed, considering the ancient predilection for commemonitinp; 

' to

the wavlike achievements of heroes who had partjcularly singahzed 
themselves, together with the many rehcs of bloody -rfare suU 
extant, this derivation has strong claims to a preference to the 



former. ,  ■ u; 

Topographical Appearance.-The general aspec of the pansh  

remarkably diversified, presenting a continued and frequently rapul 
succession of " hill and valley ;" in which respect, it forms a strik- 
ing contrast to all the other parishes in the county. In the western 
extremity, in particular, the ravines are so deep and precipitous as 
to render the access to them difficult and sometimes dangerous ; 
whilst in the same quarter, the hills and mountains of various height 
and figure are in great abundance. Of the former the Ord of 
Caithness Brenahfgleish, and Benachielt are of 
and of the latter Mor-bhein or Morven, Scaraben, and the Ir-ap, 
are most conspicuous. The view from their summits is very ex- 
tensive, embracing, in a clear atmosphere a great part of twdve 
different counties, besides a vast range of the Atlantic and Ger- 
man oceans. Of the three, Morven, as its Gaelic name indicate , 
is by much the highest, and is supposed to be more than a mi e 
abo e the level of' the sea, whence it is generally the first land 
in this quarter seen by mariners, and, as a landmark, is of 
leTusl in stormy weather. It is worthy of not- that, a 
indicating wet or dry weather, it possesses the confidence ot the 
"ho e county. DuHng harvest especially, all eyes are directed to- 
lart t and it never deceives. Near its summit there is a del. 
Tous spring, which is very refreshing to the traveller exhausted in 
Hn ng tstop. The straths are numerous and very beautiful par- 
tly those along the rivers of Langwell, Bernedale, a,.d Dun-

The whle line of coast is composed of bold and perpend.culai 
rocks rising from 100 to 300 feet above the sea; forming 
V ban-ier to the tremendous surge which frequently rolls m 
Lm the ocean. It is also much indented, in consequence of 
e numerous streams that flow from the interior, and at Jieir un 
ion with the sea form inlets more or less spacious. These aito d

ing. The caves are luimeroiis, and some of them from 50 to 60 
fathoms long. Very fine massive specimens of crystalHzed lime 
have been taken from the tops and sides of them, and are still 
preserved. But they are chiefly celebrated for the great numbers 
of seals that frequent them at all seasons, which renders them not 
merely convenient but often lucrative. The caves are usually vi- 
sited in November, and entered by means of a boat during the 
night when the seals are at rest. The boat is well manned with 
experienced hands, having each a large piece of wood, and a torch 
or candle. They require to use great caution in approaching the 
cave, as the seals are always on the alert, and upon hearing the least 
noise rush forward with astonishing rapidity towards the sea, in 
which they immediately disappear, putting the water into great agi- 
tation. When the boat is perceived before taking the ground, 
most of them escape in this way. As soon as the boat has ground- 
ed, the men leap out with great agility, and, intercepting the seals 
in their progress downwards, strike them on the head, when they 
instantly fall. On any other part the blow has no effect. In this 
manner, several scores have been captured at a time ; but of late 
from twenty to thirty is considered a good taking. 

The principal headlands are the Ord, Berriedale-head, and 
Clyth-ness. 

Climate. — The climate, generally speaking, is dry, and, for or- 
dinary constitutions, extremely healthy ; to which the elevation of 
the land and the consequent rarity of the atmosphere much con- 
tribute. These circumstances, however, seem to favour heavy 
gales of wind, which are frequently experienced, particularly from 
the west and north-west. The temperature of the atmosphere 
may be about 56° Fahrenheit. 

Considering the extraordinary density of the population, diseas- 
es are by no means frequent. Fever and rheumatism are certain- 
ly most prevalent. It has been observed that the former is very 
commonly carried by infection from the lower parts of the county, 
and the latter appears to be much occasioned by the want of 
warm clothing suited to the laborious habits of the people. For- 
merly, all the small tenantry were in possession of a few sheep, and 
by this means provided themselves with, suitable clothing; but of 
late, owing to the great increase of population, and the conse- 
quent demand for land, their farms have been so reduced in ex- 
tent by division and subdivision from year to year, that comparative- 



86 CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 

ly few sheep can be kept by them, which, both in respect to food and 
clothing, is most disadvantageous. Instances of longevity are very 
frequent,— several persons now living are nearly 100 years of age, 
and one man has completed his 105th year, and is still in possession 
of all his faculties. As formerly stated, the Moray Frith forms 
the boundary of this parish on the south-east. It varies in breadth 
from 50 to 60 miles, possesses fine fishing-ground ; but in stormy 
weather the sea is easily raised into what sailors call a short tumb- 
ling swell, which frequently proves fatal to fishing boats. The 
tides are of considerable rapidity, and may be about two hours and 
three-quarters before Leith. Perennial springs abound throughout 
the parish, and the -temperature of such as have been tried was 
found, some of the more copious at 54°, and the less so at 56° and 
58«. Many of them are much impregnated with iron. There are 
three rivers in the parish, viz. Dunbeath, Berriedale and Langwell, 
which abound with trout and. salmon. They have their source 
from twelve to sixteen miles from the sea, but are very small m 
summer, though much swollen in winter, and very rapid. The 
only lakes are Rangay and Stempster, inboth of which there is plen- 
ty of trout and eels. On the east side of the former, there are the 
remains of a small fortification, which was evidently surrounded by 
the water of the lake by means of a ditch ; and contiguous to the 
latter are; the ruins of a Druidical temple and the Arch-Druid's 

house. . 

Geoloffij.— The geological features of this parish are totally dit- 
ferent from those of the rest of the county, and merit more notice 
than the prescribed limits of this Account admit of. The greater 
part of Caithness is what is called a secondary formation, consist- 
ing chiefly of clay flagstone, having more or less calcareous matter, 
with a few instances of the red sandstone, elevated into lofty head- 
lands at Dunnet and Duncansbay. On approaching the northern 
boundary of the parish, betwixt Ulbster and Bruan, a great change 
is observable in the physical character of the country. Beyond 
this point, the southern portion of the county, embracing this parish, 
along Che eastern coast is hilly and much diversified. A number 
of streams intersect it, swelling in the winter to a great size. The 
elevated portion of this district rises from the knotty promontory 
of Clvth-ness, and forms several irregular terraces, occupying the 
north part of the parish. The lowest of these dip 25° to 30° in- 
land, while the higher and more rotund incline only 8° or 10°. 



LA rilEUON. 



Near the shore, bhie calcareous lagstoiio occurs, ami is ovorlaiil 
by a series of sandstone beds of considorablo thickness. Hona- 
cheilt is the higliest part of tliis region, and round it the strata lu-o 
arranged in a fan«shaped form, so that while tho beds on tho coast, 
at Nottingham and Latheron, dip westerly, at Hraihungay on iho 
south side of this hill, they veer round to tho N.E. against tho 
hill; and still farther inland, at Achavanich, tho dip is K.S. K. 
Between Latheron and Dunbeath, tho bods rise into micaceous 
sandstones alternating with blue calcareous llagstono. At iUii lat- 
ter place they consist of bluish and gray close-grained sandstouo, 
with occasional alternating of greenish and bluish llagstonos, and 
are prolonged into hills in tho interior, distinctly resting upon tho 
old red conglomerate, or puddingstono of Ihaomore, connected 
with the chain of mountains Ibrniing the southern boundary of tho 
county. Along the coast, the same slaty bods continue to prevail 
in high clilT's to the south of Berriedale. At Borguo, there is an 
isolated mass of the old conglomerate, probably owing its oxislonco 
to the degradation of the nearest point of tho Scarabins, a [rimary 
mass of quartz rock. This range of high bare rock is cluspod on 
each side by the conglomerate series, composing nearly tho whole 
of the surrounding hills, which, being prolonged between the 
Scarabins and the granite of the Ord, t,erniinate in the clilf be- 
tween Berriedale and Ausdale. The coast thence to the Ord is 
occupied by red micaceous flagstone, succeeded by Home bods of 
red sandstone rising into a perpendicular clilf alout .'300 feet higli 
at Trefad. Masses of the conglomerate also present tliomselvoH 
occasionally, particularly in tho clilf at Badboa. Further Houth, 
the chff again changes its character, and is occupied by gnjat 
crumbling masses of red marl and sandstone, containing a few 
bands of bluish flagstone. These gradually pass into a strong rod 
sandstone, which is separated from the granite mass of tho Ord by 
a high clifl" of conglomerate. The junction is nearly marked Ijy 
a cascade of the Ausdale rivulet, which tumbles into the sea frorn 
the height of 100 feet over these conglomerate rocks. 

The necessarily brief and imperfect outline hero given aflords 
no adequate idea of the interesting geological character of thiH 
district. To convey a more complete view of it would bo in- 
admissible here. It may be proper, however, to state that the 
old conglomerate, composing the southern hills of this parish, 
and stretching thence along the borders to tho west side i\'

CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



county, is considered as forming the lowest bed of the secondary 
formation, being succeeded by beds of siliceous and calcareo- sili- 
ceous flagstone and slate-clay, which occupies the great body of 
the county from sea to sea, sinking at length under the highest or 
uppermost of the secondary series, the new red sandstone of Dun- 
net and Duncansbay Heads. 

Soil The soil varies considerably in nature and quality in dif- 
ferent parts of the parish. On the estates of Langwell and Dun- 
beath in the west end, it is generally of a sharp gravelly description, 
and very dry. Latheronwheel and Latheron, being next in order, 
are less gravelly, but sufficiently sharp and mellow. Torse, Swiney, 
and Lybster rather wet and cold, having for the substratum a strong 
tenacious clay, which renders it later in bringing the crops to ma- 
turity ; whilst the estate of Clyth in the eastern extremity very 
much partakes of the dry, sharp loam of the centre and western 
districts. Upon the whole, the soil may be pronounced shallow, 
but easily wrought, and, with good management, capable of pro- 
ducing all kinds of grain, together with clover, turnips and pota- 
toes. In many parts it abounds with detached rocks and large 
stones, which form a serious obstacle to the plough ; and though 
much has been done towards the removing of them out of the cul- 
tivated ground, yet still much remains to be done, and this circum- 
stance presents a great discouragement in the way of improvement ; 
yet it is, nevertheless, progressing rapidly. 

Zoolopj.—Behre the introduction of sheep-farming, deer were 
to be found in considerable numbers on the estates of Langwell, 
Braeraore, and Dunbeath, but for many years back they are rarely 
to be met with ; but grouse, ptarmigan, and blackcock are in great 
abundance. The salmon on the rivers are of uncommonly fine 
quality. The rivers of Berriedale and Langwell unite when about 
200 yards from the sea, and it is remarkable that the native fish 
of one river are rarely to be found in the other. At the spawning 
season, the salmon of both rivers seem to bear one another com- 
pany till they come to the point of separation, when,, from a cu- 
rious peculiarity of natural instinct, each selects its native stream. 
There are about twenty different species of fish caught on the 
coast. Those of greatest importance in an economical point of 
view are, herrings, cod, haddocks, skate, and flounders. 

II. — Civil History. 
From the want of authentic records as to the early history of 



LATHEIION. 



S9 



this parish, very little can be noticed under this head. Judging, 
however, from the number and variety of the remains of tliose 
places of strength which it contains, together with the other war- 
like relics of barbarous and feudal times with which it is every- 
where bestudded, there can be no doubt that it formed the scene 
of many a well fought field. But, as usually happens in such 
cases, tradition has been very fertile in supplying the lack of more 
correct information. One tradition out of many may be noticed as 
highly probable. It refers to the last invasion of this county by the 
Danes. On that occasion they landed near the town of Thurso, 
under the command of the young Prince of Denmark, and the 
natives, not being in sufficient strength to oppose them, retreated 
across the county, followed by the invaders, till they came to the 
hill of Ben-a-gheil, in this parish, distant twenty miles from Thurso- 
By this time, the ranks of the natives having been greatly increased 
in number, and being now in view of the coast where their retreat 
must be stopped, deriving courage also from the very favourable 
position they occupied on this hill, — they resolved to try the fate 
of a pitched battle. Having taken their ground, the enemy soon 
came up and attempted to dislodge them, when they ]oured down 
in one dense mass, broke the enemy's ranks, killed their leader, 
and routed their whole force. A huge stone, placed perpendicular 
in the ground, resembling a pillar, marks the place where the 
Prince fell ; and from this occurrence the hill itself seems to de- 
rive its Gaelic name, Ben-a-gheil, signifying the hill where they 
yielded, or were overcome. 

Eminent Men. — One of the most eminent men known to have 
been connected with this parish, was the late Sir John Sinclair 
of Ulbster, Bart., author of the former Statistical Account of 
Scotland, the Code of Agriculture, &amp;c. &amp;c. ; a man who was an 
ornament to the age in which he lived, and of whom any parish 
or county might deservedly boast. Sir John was principal pro- 
prietor in this parish, and the estate of Langwell, then in his pos- 
session, was his favourite resort during the periods of his re- 
sidence in the county. Here he commenced some of his earliest 
and most extensive improvements in the several departments of 
plantation, agriculture, and sheep-farming, in the first and last 
of which he completely succeeded ; and much of the beauty and 
utility of this valuable property is owing to his spirited and perse- 
vering exertions, seconded, as they were, by the skill and good 



90 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



taste of liis successor, the late James Home, Esq. of Langwell. 
On Sir John Sinclair's merits as a man of varied talent, an able 
and extensive author, an accomplished scholar, or skilful states- 
man, it is not intended here to enlarge, as the subject more pro- 
perly belongs to his native parish of Thurso. He was possessed of 
a singularly intelligent, active, and benevolent mind, insomuch 
that no parish or district of country could have enjoyed his pre- 
sence for any length of time without being benefited thereby. 
Indeed, such was the quickness of his perception, and the warmth 
of his philanthropy, that even in his passing visits to quarters 
where he had no personal interest, he seldom failed to suggest 
some measures for the improvement of the soil, and especially of 
its inhabitants, and was always ready, from his own resources, to 
assist in carrying them into execution. Of this a very striking 
instance occurred in the highlands of Perthshire, and was com- 
municated to the writer when visiting the person with whom the 
transaction was entered into. On one occasion Sir John hap- 
pened to be travelling along Loch Tay side, and observing 
the country very densely peopled with small tenantry, and that 
the lofty range of mountains, green to the very summits, with 
which this beautiful lake is surrounded, were chiefly pastured by 
sheep, inquired how the people, in so remote a quarter, disposed 
of their wool ; and being informed that each family employed one, 
two, or three spinning wheels, according to the number of females 
it contained, it readily occurred to him that a spinning mill might 
prove a great acquisition in the district, and find abundant em- 
■ ployment. He accordingly sought out the ablest person for such 
an undertaking, and was directed to a Mr M-Naughton in the 
vicinity of Kenmore. To him he immediately repaired, and, after 
enumerating the advantages likely to arise to the whole neighbour- 
hood from such a concern, together with the great probabdity of 
its success, and the prospect of the emoluments which it held out, 
strongly urged him to undertake it. This Mr M'Naughton at 
first declined, assigning as a reason, that neither he nor any other 
individual in the place could afford to run the risk of a failure. 
" Well," said Sir John, "but will you conduct it, provided I take the 
risk upon myself" To this Mr M'Naughton, after some hesita- 
tion, assented. The mill was soon procured and commenced ope- 
rations, and so completely were Sir John's predictions realized, 
that in'a few years thereafter, Mr M'Naughton erected other two 



LATHE RON. 



91 



at his own expense in other parts of the country ; a circumstance 
no less Gratifying to the originator, than advantageous to the sur- 
rounding community. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners of the parish are, Sir 
George Sinclair of Ulbster, Bart.; William Sinclair, Esq. of 
Freswick ; John Sutherland, Esq. of Forse ; Donald Home, Esq. 
of Langwell; Colonel Gordon of Swiney ; Lord Dufifus ; Sir 
Ralph A. Anstruther, Bart. ; Temple Frederick Sinclair, Esq. of 
Lybster ; and Donald Munro, Esq. of Latheron. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest date of the parochial records 
now extant is 1755. They have been pretty regularly kept till 
1770. There is then a chasm of nearly thirteen years to 1733, 
after which they have, with few exceptions, been correctly kept ; 
especially since 1813, the entries are scrupulously correct. 

Antiquities. — From the great number of castles in this parish, it 
would appear as if the chief strength of the county were concentrat- 
ed in it. There are no fewer than eight of them along the sea-coast, 
and for the most part built on the very brink of high and perpendicu- 
lar rocks overhanging the sea, and inaccessible from that quarter. 
They were also so constructed as to admit of separation from the 
land at pleasure, the chief connection being by means of a draw- 
bridge. The greater number of them are now in ruins, but, from 
the height, strength, and thickness of the walls of those that re- 
main, it may easily be conceived what a formidable obstacle they 
presented to an invading enemy in those times, standing as they 
do in such close succession. Beginning at the south, their names 
are Berriedale, Achastle, Dunbeath, still inhabited, Knockinnan, 
Latheron, Forse, Swiney, and Clyth. Several of them are still 
celebrated for the warlike deeds of their brave, though ferocious 
original possessors, and it is highly instructive to contrast the se- 
curity, peace, and tranquillity of those who now surround them, 
with the insecurity, rapine, and bloodshed that prevailed in former 
days. It is hardly necessary to add, that these ruins present not 
the slightest traces either of the graces of ornament, or the em- 
bellishments of art, which so tastefully adorn more modern archi • 
tecture. 

Modern Buildings. — The only buildings of recent erection de- 
serving of notice are the churches of Berriedale and Lybster. The 
former is a Government church, of very neat construction, though 
small in size. It was built in 1826, and contains about 300 sitters. 



92 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



There is a very comfortable manse close by it. Both are very 
compact, and a great ornament to the district in which they are 
placed. The latter, viz. Lybster, was built by subscription in 
1836. It is a substantial, well-finished, and most comfortable 
church. It contains 805 sittings, and cost L.830. It is placed 
in the village of Lybster, from which it takes its name, and to the 
importance of which it contributes not less by its utility than its 
acknowledged ornament. 

III. — Population. 
From the want of correct records, it is impossible to ascertain 
the ancient state of the population with accuracy. There can be 
no doubt, however, that it has been progressing during the last 
century at a very rapid rate. It is stated in the former Statistical 
Account, that the population had nearly doubled during the 
seventy years preceding 1794, when it amounted to 4006 ; and 
such has been the extraordinary rapidity of the increase during 
the forty years that have since elapsed, that it is now fully double 
that amount. Where this extraordinary increase of country po- 
pulation is to terminate, and by what means a suitable provision is 
to be made foi-their comfortable support, it is difficult to imagine. 
At present there are no indications of a decrease, unless sheep- 
farming, which commenced some time ago, should become more 
general. 

The chief cause of the recent astonishing increase in the 
population is unquestionably the great and growing extent to 
which the herring-fishing has been prosecuted along the whole 
coast, and the extraordinary success with which it has generally 
been attended. Upon its permanency or failure, therefore, mam- 
ly depends the future continued increase, or rapid decrease of the 
population.

Language, Habits, -c— The Gaelic language is generally 
spoken by the lower class of people throughout the greater part 
of the parish, but it has certainly lost ground during the last forty 
years, and, in proportion as the improved system of education ad- 
vances, it will no doubt continue to decline still more. In proof 
of this, the presbytery of Caithness have lately come to the deci- 
sion to discontinue the preaching of the Gaelic language in the 
eastern district of the parish occupied by the mission of Bruan, 
where a missionary was last year appointed, who has no Gaelic. 
Formerly the missionary always preached in both languages, but, 
in all probability, this system is not likely to be again resorted to. 
It is a singular circumstance that, for a long period, the burn of 
East Clyth seems to have formed the boundary between the Gae- 
lic and English languages. On the east side of it, scarcely a word 
of Gaelic was either spoken or understood, and on the west side the 
English shared the same fate ; and this was the more wonderful, 
as both sides were rather densely peopled. Now, however, the 
English has not only made encroachments upon the Gaelic terri- 
tory, but has extended itself over the whole neighbouring dis- 
trict ; and, indeed, were it not that its progress was consider- 
ably impeded by the importation of several colonies of High- 
landers from the heights of Kildonan and other parts of Suther- 
landshire about twenty years ago, when the sheep system com- 
menced there, its triumphs, ere now, would have been still more 
extensive. 

A very decided improvement has, for many years back, been ob- 
servable both in the external appearance and internal comforts of 
the cottages of the peasantry. The old hovels are fast disappear- 
ing, and neat substantial houses, having vents and chimney tops in 
one or both ends, are occupying their places. With these im- 
provements in the accommodations and comforts of the people, 
there has, as might naturally be expected, been a somewhat pro- 
portional advance in their habits of cleanliness and manner of 
dress, in both of which many of them display considerable taste 
and neatness. Indeed, there is reason to fear that the youth of 
both sexes are, in the article of dress, rather in danger of exceed- 
ing their means. The ordinary food consists of oat and beat- 



94 



CAITHNESS-SHIllE. 



meal, potatoes, and fish of various kinds, of which there is usually 
an abundant supply. In the latter article, few parishes are pos- 
sessed of equal advantages, for, in addition to the opportunities of 
obtaining white fish of excellent quality when the weather is noo- 
derate, each family lays in a regular stock of from one to three 
barrels of cured herrings, according to the number of persons of 
which it consists. This, with potatoes, milk, and a moderate 
quantity of bread, together with a little animal food occasionally, 
forms a wholesome and nourishing diet at all seasons. 

Considering the many disadvantages in respect to religious and 
moral training under which this parish has long laboured, arising 
from its immense extent, and the density of its population, crowd- 
ed together, in many quarters, in large masses, — the extraordi- 
nary lack of respectable and exemplary families located among 
them, so necessary to give a tone to the morals of the lower 
classes, — the very unfavourable nature of their ordinary avocations 
towards the fostering and maturing of religious habits, — together 
with the scarcity of competent instructors to maintain a strict and 
continuous pastoral superintendence among them, — considering 
these acknowledged disadvantages, it is wonderful and pleasing to 
perceive the hold which religious principle and moral responsibility 
possess over the people generally ; whilst in very many particular 
cases, the acuteness and intelligence discoverable on religious sub- 
jects, combined, as frequently happens, with fervent and unobtru- 
sive piety, are not less strikingand refreshing to contemplate, than 
diffusive and beneficial in their consequences. That instances of 
ignorance and irreligion, attended by their natural offspring, vice 
and immorality, are to be met with, cannot be denied; but, in a 
community so circumstanced, the great wonder is, that they do 
not prevail to a much greater extent.' This is to be attributed,, 
under Providence, to the wholesome checks and remedies which 
have more recently been applied, by extending, as far as possible, 
the improved system of education, and providing additional facili- 
ties of religious instruction and pastoral superintendence over the 
more remote and destitute districts ; a system which, even in its 
infancy, is already producing a marked improvement on the ha- 
bits of the people generally. 

Upon the whole, the peasantry may be said to possess a tole- 
rable degree of knowledge for their station in life. With few ex- 
ceptions, they are well acquainted with the catechisms and leading 



LATHERON. 



95 



doctrines of our church, which maintain a powerful influence over 
them in all the relations of life. In particular, their minds are 
deeply imbued with suitable impressions of an overruling Provi- 
dence governing all things according to the Divine will ; a prin- 
ciple which, whilst it moderates their joy in prosperity, power- 
fully supports them under adversity. Of this there were innume- 
rable instances of a very pleasing nature during the three past 
years, when, as is well known, the crops were almost a total fail- 
ure all over the Highlands. The patient resignation and deep 
submission with which this heavy calamity was borne, could not 
fail to excite the admiration of every attentive observer. Instead 
of riot, robbery, and bloodshed, which in many other quarters fol- 
low in the train of less formidable privations, here the public peace 
was never disturbed ; but, on the contrary, life, and even property 
in general, were alike secure as in more favourable circumstances. 
To behold 7000 people suffering under the most distressing des- 
titution for three successive years, many families without a hand- 
ful of meal in their houses for weeks together, others satisfied 
with a little water-gruel once a-day, and still nothing but quiet- 
ness and submission prevailing, what a triumph for that sound 
Scriptural education to which they are early habituated, and con- 
sequent religious principle of which it seldom fails to be produc- 
tive  A high veneration for the being, attributes, and worship 
of the Deity is everywhere observable. The sanctity of the Sab- 
bath is universally upheld. Scarcely a movement is to be seen 
during that sacred day excepting to or from the places of public 
worship, which are remarkably well attended. The important 
duty of family worship, so necessary for the formation and 
exhibition of the Christian character, is also very generally 
observed. 

But whilst it is truly pleasing to dwell upon the ascendency 
which these principles and habits possess among the great body 
of the peasantry, yet a regard to truth requires the admission, 
however painful, that instances do occur, from time to time, of 
a character directly opposite. Of these one of the greatest irregu- 
larities is that of drinking ardent spirits, to which not a few are 
addicted, especially during the winter season. This degrading 
practice was formerly occasioned by the extent to which the smug- 
gling of whisky was carried on ; but the system of heavy fines or im- 
prisonment, introduced many years ago in all cases of detection, 



96 



CAITIINESS-SHinE. 



was the means of checking it in a great degree. But this system 
was soon relaxed on account of the expenses attending the im- 
prisonment of delinquents. Then followed a more vigilant and 
active surveillance on the part of the excise, particularly the inde- 
fatigable exertions of one active officer, a Mr M'Mahon, whose 
very name spread terror all over the county, from the Ord of 
Caithness to John O'Groats, by the havoc he made upon this ne- 
farious and demoraUzing trade. He was neither to be bribed nor 
deceived, and scarce a single case escaped his detection m the 
whole range of the county. This has given the finishing blow to 
smuggling in this quarter, and for several years not a single case 
has occurred here. The good effects of this change are already 
apparent in the districts where the practice most prevailed; but 
it is onlyhen the present generation shall have passed away, that 
the full advantage will be appreciated. Another practice attend- 
ed with very pernicious effects is that frequently adopted by fish- 
curers, of giving from five to seven gallons of whisky to each boat's 
crew during the herring-fishing season, which, on an average, will 
be at the rate of one bottle to each crew of four men every fishing 
night ; and although some have the prudence to reserve a consi- 
derable part of it, yet others consume their whole allowance. By 
this means young men are led into drinking habits very early. It 
is a great evil, and loudly calls for a remedy. 

Poaching iii the moors and rivers can hardly be said to exist, 
owing to the strict regulations adopted by the proprietors. In- 
deed such is their authority over the tenantry, that it is complete- 
ly in their power to suppress smuggling, thieving, and even habits 
of excessive drinking at any time, were they to put that authority 
in vigorous execution, and to act in concert. But so far is this 
from being always the case, as it certainly ought to be, that it is 
no uncommon occurrence to see individuals notorious for one or 
other of the above practices, when removed from one property, 
received on that immediately adjoining it; by which means they 
sometimes become more injurious to that from which they have 
been removed, by theft for instance, than if they had been per- 
mitted to remain unmolested. Besides, how cruel is it towards 
those among whom such characters are placed  Were certifi- 
cates of moral character strictly insisted upon from every new te- 
nant, many irregularities would be greatly checked— a precaution 
urgently called for.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — Although the lands in this 
parish are well adapted for agriculture, and although it contains 
several farms in the very highest state of cultivation, yet, as the 
great body of its inhabitants are engaged in the herring-fishing, 
and make the cultivation of the soil little more than a secondary 
concern, it is, perhaps, less agricultural than many other parishes 
in the county, that are greatly inferior in extent, population, and 
internal resources. Its pastoral qualities are peculiarly valuable, 
and likely to be put in still more extensive requisition. 

It contains fully 140,000 imperial acres, of which about 9000 
are arable, and about an equal quantity capable of being made so, 
though at a considerable expense, from the great number of rocks 
and isolated large stones near the surface. There are probably not 
more than 250 acres of undivided common in the whole parish, 
and about 720 acres of wood of all descriptions ; by far the greater 
part of which consists of natural brushwood, chiefly along the ro- 
mantic banks of the rivers Berriedale, Langwell, and Dunbeath. 
At the former, however, there is a considerable extent of planted 
wood of all kinds, and well attended to in respect to pruning, &amp;c. ; 
and at the latter, there is a tasteful plantation just laid out, which 
will in a few years appear highly ornamental as well as useful. At 
Braemore and Latheronwheel also a good deal has been done, and 
with considerable success ; as also at Lybster, where neither pains 
nor expense have been spared for many years back. But here the 
roots have to contend with a less favourable soil, whilst the trees 
themselves are much exposed from the want of natural shelter, the 
ground being flat, and the soil damp and tenacious, — two obstacles 
formidable in an ungenial climate ; yet'there is a striking evidence 
of what can be done by pains and perseverance. 

Eent.—The average rent of arable land is certainly very high, 
considering the indifferent crops raised by the small tenantry ge- 
nerally. It is about L.l, 5s. per acre,— more than can be realized 
by the occupiers generally,— but then the fishing is expected to 
make up the deficiency. The rate of grazing may be about 
L. 2, 1 Os. for a cow, and 9s. for a sheep on arable ground, and 
15s. for a cow, and 3s. for a sheep on hill pasture. 

Wages. — Day-labourers, employed in ditching, draining, or 
roads, usually receive at the rate of 2d. per hour, or 9s. per week. 
Masons and carpenters from 2s. to 3s. per day ; men and women 
employed for harvest work, the former L.l, 10s. and the latter L.l, 

CAITHNESS. r

CAITIINESS-SIIIIIE. 



with an allowance of meal and potatoes sufficient to support them 
until the crops are secured. Farm-servants obtain from L. 6 to 
L.8 a-year, according to their qualifications, and 6 bolls of meal, 
together with potatoes and a little milk. Women for household 
work are from L. 3 to L. 4 with their victuals, &amp;c. in the family. 

Breeds of Live-StocL— Much attention is now being paid to the 
improvement of the breeds of sheep and cattle. Cheviot sheep of the 
finest description are reared on the farms of Langwelland Dunbealh, 
and frequently obtain prizes at the shows at Inverness. On several 
corn farms, crosses between the Leicester and Cheviot breeds are be- 
coming common. The same system is pursued in respect to cattle, 
and the crosses most in repute are between the Teeswater and 
good Highlanders. For this description there is a ready demand 
at good prices, and, in all probability, the great attention now paid 
to the rearing of stock is only in its infancy. The great facilities 
now afforded for the conveyance of stock by steam to the Edin- 
burgh and London markets with such regularity and rapidity, is 
fast drawino- forth the resources of this county generally, and every 
parish in particular. 

Husbandry.— Ahhough the greater portion of the land is occu- 
pied by small tenantry, with whom the cultivation of the soil forms 
but a secondary concern, yet there are several extensive and well- 
managed farms in the parish, on which crops of the best descrip- 
tion Ire raised. The six-year shift is that in most general use, 
viz. turnip, barley or bear, two crops grass, one cut and the other 
pastured, and two crops oats, one of potato or Hopetoun, and the 
other of Angus or dun oats. Wheat is sometimes raised of good 
quality ; butin the general run of seasons it has not been found a 
profitable crop, owing chiefly to the want of sufficient warm wea- 
ther to bring it to maturity. Pease and beans are also tried, and 
sometimes succeed ; but they may be considered a very precarious 
crop, owing to the wet weather often experienced during harvest, 
when it is extremely difficult to secure them in a good state. , 

Draining has of late been practised to a very great extent on 
the principal farms, and with evident advantage. For example, 
one small field of about four acres has been drained this year at 
an expense of about L.20. Even furrow draining has been tried 
on a small scale, and in ail probability will become more general. 
Lime has been found most serviceable on dry lands, and has been 
a good deal in use ; but the depressed state of farm produce for 
many years back has operated as a great discouragement to ihc 



LATHEUON. 



99 



use of this expensive but valuable manure. Considerable tracts 
of waste ground have been reclaimed by almost all the proprietors 
during the last twenty years ; chiefly, however, with the view of 
extending the farms under their own management. Among these 
improvements, none have been so perfectly executed as those on the 
beautiful estate of Langwell, by the late proprietor, James Horne, 
Esq. A considerable portion was trenched at a great expense 
where the soil was shallow, and other parts of moor ground, hav- 
ing from one to two feet of moss on the surface, were first plough- 
ed, then burnt, and laid down with a large allowance of lime, 
carted a distance of ten miles. This was done twelve or fourteen 
years ago, and has never yet been turned up, yet it continues to 
retain a rich and close sward of pasture grass, without discovering 
any symptoms of relapsing into its original heath, as so general- 
ly happens when the work is done in a less perfect style. On the 
estates of Dunbeath, Latheronwheel, Forse, Lybster, and Clyth, 
much has also been done, though in a less expensive manner. 
The system pursued by the smaller tenantry has in several respects 
been improved of late. Instead of four small horses and a driver 
to every plough, two horses without a driver are now universal- 
ly used. And, instead of the clumsy awkward plough formerly 
in use, the neat iron plough is becoming very general. The land 
is also better cleaned, although the rotation of oats and bear al- 
ternately is very little changed ; only a greator breadth of potatoes 
is planted, and good white and dun oats have supplanted the old 
black and gray inferior qualities. In a few cases also small patches 
of grass are sown out after potatoes. This practice would speedi- 
ly become general, were it not for the want of enclosures to pre- 
serve the grass from being injured during winter, and that there 
is no winter herding. 

Leases. — Leases of fourteen or nineteen years are granted on 
the larger farms, but the small tenantry generally hold their farms 
only from year to year — a system alike prejudicial to their com- 
forts, and the interests of the proprietor. Short leases are, how- 
ever, becoming more common, and will no doubt speedily become 
universal. 

The condition of some of the farm-buildings is excellent, others 
of them again are exceedingly bad. But, as in all other things con- 
nected with rural economy, there has been a progressive improve- 
mentof late. The same observations are applicable to the enclosures. 
These ciiiefly consist of stone fences, together with whin and thorn 



100 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



hedges. Most of the stone fences are old and decayed, and do not 
suit tlieimproved system of keeping a suitable portion of each 
farm under sheep. Should the present system be persevered in, 
as is most probable, they will require to be renewed. Indeed, this 
is to commence immediately on the farm of Clyth, the property 
of Sir George Sinclair, where a new farm-steading and proper en- 
closures are forthwith to be erected on a new lease of that excel- 
lent farm. All the new houses are slated, and in other respects 
very commodious. 

Improvements. — The principal improvements which have taken 
place within the last thirty years, in as far as agriculture is con- 
cerned, may be briefly enumerated as follows : fully 2000 acres of 
waste ground reclaimed; better accommodations in farm-buildings; 
a vast extent of enclosures executed ; agriculture much more sys- 
tematically and advantageously pursued ; more attention given to 
the culture and clearing of the land; draining practised much 
more extensively, and executed in a more skilful style; better breeds 
of horses, cows, and sheep ; superior facilities both for expedition 
and security in conveying them to the southern markets ; a much 
wider breadth of turnips sown and heavier crops raised, and con- 
sequently a much larger quantity of stock reared and fed, and fit- 
ted in a much shorter time for the butcher. After shipping the 
stock at Wick in the morning, it is possible for them to be shown 
in the Edinburgh market next afternoon ; thus accomplishing in 
the astonishingly short period of thirty hours what used to occupy 
nearly as many days, to the much greater damage of the stock. 

Great as these improvements are, nothing but the want of ca- 
pital prevents their proceeding at a much more rapid rate ; and 
were additional encouragement to be given by proprietors, by grant- 
ing leases to the small tenantry on reasonable terms, a great deal 
more might be done, even upon the existing resources of the peo- 
ple. One of the greatest obstacles with which the spirit of im- 
provement has now to contend, is the non-residence of almost all 
the proprietors ; a circumstance which did not exist, to the same 
extent, until very recently ; and hence the same interest can hard- 
ly be expected to be . taken, either in promoting the comforts of 
the inhabitants, or in reclaiming or ornamenting the lands. But it 
is hoped that this inconvenience may only be of short duration. 

Fisheries. There are four descriptions of fisheries prosecuted m 

this parish, viz, the herring, cod, salmon, and lobster. Of these 
t\ie herring-fishery is the most considerable, forming as it does, 



LATHE RON. 



101 



the principal source whence the revenue of the parish is derived. 
This fishing commences about the middle of July, when the her- 
ring usually make ;;their appearance in small shoals on the coast 
and continues till the middle of September. Great numbers of 
young men come from Assynt in Sutherlandshire, and Lochbroom 
and Lewis in Ross-shire, to engage as hired hands. They are 
employed by the owners of the boats to make up the boats' crew 
along with themselves, and receive from L. 3 to L. 4 each, for six 
weeks, besides their victuals. Each boat carries four men, and is 
furnished with from twenty to thirty-eight nets, according to the 
size of the boat. A good boat costs L. 50, and her drift" of nets 
L.76; a sum too large for one individual, and consequently there 
are generally two and sometimes more who share in the same boat. 
They usually last in a seaworthy state about twelve years, and 
the nets six years. No employment can be prosecuted with great- 
er spirit and assiduity ; and few scenes are more enlivening, both 
on land and water, than it occasions, especially when any measure 
of success attends the labours of the fishermen. The boats usu- 
ally leave the shore from five o'clock to seven o'clock in the after- 
noon, according to the direction of the wind and the distance at which 
the fish are supposed to be found, and shoot their nets about dusk. 
In this state they remain, with the boat attached to each drift by 
means of a head rope, and slowly carried east or west by the tide, 
until about three o'clock the next morning. Then all hands are em- 
ployed in hauling in the nets and fish at the boat's stern, where 
they remain together, dispersed all over the boat, till it comes to 
shore, when they commence the operation of disengaging the fish 
from the meshes of the net, by shaking the nets. This ope- 
ration is frequently performed at the time of hauling the nets, 
should time and the weather permit. The herring being thus 
separated from the nets, are immediately landed and deposit- 
ed m the curing box, where a number of women are engaged in 
guttnig and packing them in barrels with salt. Having'' deli- 
vered their fish, they bundle up their nets, carry them on shore, 
and spread them out carefully one over the other. Here they re- 
mam to dry, until taken up again in the afternoon to be used as 
formerly. After securing their boats, they return to their homes, 
take some refreshment, and a few hours repose, as their time per- 
mits, and proceed to take up their nets, and put to sea again lor 
tlie next night's fishing. In this manner they proceed for five suc- 
cessive nights, every week. Sometimes, however, when the quan- 



102 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



tity offish to be delivered is large, they do not get to bed for days 
together. This makes it a very fatiguing and even oppressive em- 
ployment. But the prospect of success is so very enticing, that 
it is submitted to with wonderful cheerfulness. 

The boats used in this parish may contain from 30 to 50 crans 
or barrels for both are nearly alike, of herrings, and it is diffi- 
cult to say which of the sights is most pleasingly interesting to 
a stranger, that of beholding on a fine evening the whole coast, 
as far as the eye can reach, covered with human beings in their 
little barks, as they issue forth from every creek, and disperse in 
different directions, full of life ; or that of attending at one of the 
stations in the morning, and witnessing the return of 40, 60, or 
100 boats, all crowding into one creek, most of them, perhaps, 
laden with fish to the gunwale, and then the scene of bustle and_ 
animation that succeeds and continues till night  And what 
ought not to be omitted as being still more delightful to a serious- 
ly contemplative mind, it is not unusual, where there are boats 
having individuals of acknowledged piety, for the crew to en- 
gage in worship after shooting their nets. On these occasions 
a portion of a psalm is sung, followed with prayer, and the effect 
is represented as truly solemn and heart-stirring, as the melodious 
strains of the GaeUc music, carried along the surface of the 
waters, several being similarly engaged, spread throughout the 
whole fleet. 

But not unfrequently the scene is sadly reversed, for in the 
midst of the joys of life, we often are in death. A storm suddenly 
arises during the night. The boats are all riding quietly at their 
nets and unprepared to meet it. Some endeavour to haul their 
nets, others cut from them, and make for the place of great- 
est shelter, whilst others, afraid to put up sail and encounter it, 
abide by their nets in the hope of the storm's abating. In propor- 
tion to the danger at sea, are the confusion and anxiety on land. 
The shores are instantly crowded by inquiring relatives, hurrymg 
from place to place in search of husbands, brothers, or sons. 
Astonishing instances of preservation often occur ; but no season 
passes without serious losses to individuals, either of boats, or nets, 
and sometimes of lives. The risks are very great, and the em- 
ployment, even when successful, most trying to the constitution. 

The following presents a pretty correct state of the fishing of 
1838 at the different stations in the parish. The fishing stations 
with the boats attached to each are, Dunbcath, 76; Latheron- 



LATHERON.

wheel, 35; Forse, 32; Swiney, 10; Lybster, 101; Clytb, 53; 
and East Clyth, 18: in all 325 boats. Connected with these 
there are 1321 fishermen, 106 coopers, 937 women as packers, 
and 178 labourers, in all 2540 persons,— besides about 30 fish cur- 
ers, many of whom take an active, part in the busmess. The 
number of barrels cured at all these stations in 1838, was 39,093, 
exclusive of the fish cured by the fishermen and others at their 
own houses, which may be estimated at about 2800 barrels,— be- 
sides quantities of green fish purchased at all the stations by 
strangers from all parts of the county in exchange for cash, milk, 
butte°, cheese, &amp;c. &amp;c.-say 907. The average price per cran 
of green fish was 9s., and that per barrel when cured, L.l. 1 he 
barrels are made at the different stations, the hemp spun and the 
nets wrought in the fishermen's families during the winter and 
spring months. From all this, it may be conceived what an en- 
grossing and important concern the herring-fishing has become in 
this parish. 

But, notwithstanding these advantages, which are confessedly 
great in a temporal point of view, yet it is very doubtful whether 
they are not more than counterbalanced by the pernicious effects 
upon the morals of the people, which never fail to result from this 
employment, especially the young of both sexes. No doubt the 
sound religious education now becoming so general, has a ten- 
dency to counteract such habits. Indeed, this is already appa- 
rent, and it is to be hoped, if persevered in, will become still more 
so. At all events, as matters now stand, it is evident that the 
failure of the fishing would be attended with the most ruinous con- 
sequences, so that it becomes no less the duty than the interest of 
the landed proprietors, whilst encouraging the fishing, by which 
the value of land has been so greatly enhanced, to afford every 
practicable facility to the diffusion of knowledge, by means of edu- 
cation and religious instruction both to young and old. These 
have ever been found the best safeguards of morality in a country, 
and are the surest means of rearing and pepetuating an enlighten- 
ed, intelligent, and industrious peasantry. 

The cod-fishing is not carried on to any great extent, although 
there are immense quantities to be found on the coast, particu- 
larly at the commencement of the herring fishing. At this pe- 
riod there are a good many caught ; but as soon as the herring ap- 
pear in such numbers as to induce the fishermen to shoot their 
nets, then the cod-fishing is deserted, that of the herring being 



104 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



much more profitable. On an average there may be about 
10,000 cod cured in a season, for which 6d. each may be ob- 
tained. 

Lobsters also are in great abundance, and frequently many of 
them are taken in boxes ; but this trade is little attended to, as the 
herring trade has been the all-engrossing business for many years 
back. 

There are two salmon-fishing stations in the parish, viz. at 
Berriedale and Dunbeath, the former belonging to Mr Home of 
Langwell, and the latter to Mr Sinclair of Freswick. At Berrie- 
dale, salmon and grilse are frequently caught in great abundance, 
particularly since the herring-fishing was discontinued there. It 
is rented by the Messrs Hogarth of Aberdeen, and the fishing at 
Dunbeath by Mr Martin of Dundee, the former at L. 275, and 
the latter at L.27. This great dlEFerence in rent is chiefly occa- 
sioned by the herring-fishing at the latter place having a ten- 
dency to annoy the fish, and frighten them from the shore. In 
other respects, Dunbeath seems the preferable station, as the chan- 
nel of the river is always open. The fish on both rivers are good ; 
that of Berriedale particularly so. Very few of them are sold in 
the parish, on account of the high price demanded ; salmon Is., and 
grilse 6d. per lb. They are kitted and sent to the London market. 

Baiv Produce. — It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the 
precise amount of raw produce raised in the parish; but an attempt 
has been made to approach it pretty nearly, though with consider- 
able difficulty, under the following heads : 

Grain of all kinds, about 11,882 qrs. at L.l, 5s. per quarter, L-14,852 0 0 

Potatoes, 4535 bolls, at 10s. per boll, • • A-'o7 lU U 

Turnips,236acres, at 1,-6 per acre, • • , nn ,n a

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. The- 
nearest to it is Wick, the county town, which is at the medium 
distance of twenty miles. Several villages have been projected, 
but none of them have yet arisen to any consequence except Lyb- 
ster, which cootains many excellent houses, and a population of 
fully 400 individuals. Several new buildings are now in progress, 
and many of the inhabitants are very reipectable. It was com-

nienced by the late proprietor, Lieutenant- General Sinclair, in 
1802 • but it is only within the last twenty years that the spirit of 
improvement has been particularly called forth. It is now a ns- 
incT place, and evidently promises to be of considerable conse- 
quence at no very distant period, should the herring-fishing con- 
tinue to flourish, of which there is every prospect. 

Means of Communication.— 'Wiexe are two post-offices m the 
parish, viz. Dunbeath and Lybster, the former of old establish- 
ment, and the latter more recent. 

The great north road runs from one extremity of the parish to the 
other, a distance of twenty-eight miles along the coast, and is of im- 
mense importance in facilitating the means of communication. The 
mail-coach from Inverness to Thurso has contibued to run since 
the completion of this road, about twenty-two years ago. The 
weekly communication by steam from Leith and Aberdeen to 
Wick and Orkney, has considerably lessened the number of pas- 
sengers by the coach. 

The bridges along the Parliamentary and county ror.ds are kept 

in excellent repair. 

Hariowrs.— Considering the vast importance of this coast in a 
commercial point of view, the great number of vessels that fre- 
quent it in connection with the fisheries, and the many risks to 
which life and property are exposed in consequence of its bold, 
rocky, and exposed character, it is much to be regretted that so 
little has hitherto been done in order to obtain safe and commo- 
dious harbours. With the exception of a neat little pier at Clyth, 
which is occasionally of 'service in loading vessels in very mode- 
rate weather, the only attempt that has yet been made in this way 
is at Lybster, where the proprietor, T. Frederick Sinclair, Esq. has, 
in a very spirited manner, and at considerable expense, been en- 
gaged for several years back in providing a harbour for the en- 
couragement of the increasing trade and population of that place. 
This has been effected by running a stone pier of about 300 feet 
in length along the west bank of a rivulet which runs into the sea 
at this place, and which formerly was usually choked up by the 
shifting beach, now confined behind the pier. By this means 
shelter and accommodation have been effected for upwards of one 
hundred boats of from ten to fifteen tons burden, besides admit- 
ting decked vessels of one hundred tons burden. Within the last 
three years, from sixty to eighty of the latter have loaded and dis-. 
charged cargoes during the summer and harvest seasons ; and it 



lOG 



CAITHNESS-SHIIIE. 



is supposed that it is practicable, by a small additional outlay, to 
deepen the harbour so as to receive vessels of the necessary ton- 
nage even at lovif water. The value of such an improvement on 
the coast would be incalculable, considering the thousands of in- 
dividuals engaged in the herring fishing. At present, there is not 
a single place to run to at low water, when vessels or boats are 
suddenly overtaken with a heavy storm, as not unfrequently hap- 
pens, to the great loss of life and property. Dunbeath is also 
remarkably well calculated for a harbour, and in all probability 
the time cannot be far distant, when something on an extensive 
scale will be attempted there. Nature has done her part admir- 
ably, and it only requires the hand of art to turn her varied re- 
sources to good account. Petitions have this year been numerous- 
ly signed and sent to the Admiralty, praying the appointment of 
a survey of this coast, in order to select one or more of the fittest 
stations with the view of erecting harbours for the protection of 
property, and the lives of the fishermen, now exposed to such im- 
minent hazard. Should these applications succeed, as it is to be 
hoped they eventually will, then a new era will arise with respect 
to agricultural and commercial pursuits, and it will only require 
the united efforts of enterprising and intelligent men to occupy 
the field thus opened up, and call forth a spirit of industry hither- 
to unexampled in this quarter. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated close by the 
sea, and is seventeen miles from the western extremity of the pa- 
rish, eleven miles from the eastern, and ten from the northern ex- 
tremity. It is, however, sufficiently centrical for the population, 
though it must be obvious, from the great territorial extent, that 
comparatively few of the inhabitants, were they solely dependent 
upon it, could derive much benefit on account of the distance to 
which they are removed. The church seems to have been built 
about the year 1734. It received a large addition by way of an 
aisle in 1822, and was, besides, new roofed and new seated. It may 
contain about 900 sitters, and no seat-rents have been demanded 
since it received extensive repairs in 1822. It is one of the larg- 
est and most commodious country churches in the county. The 
only thing wanted to its comfort is that of having it ceiled above, 
which it is hoped may, ere long, be accomplished. 

The manse was built about forty years ago, and is a substantial 
building, with sufficient accommodation. The glebe consists of 
15 acres of arable land. Its extent was a little increased by an 



LATHE HON. 



107 



excambion about fourteen years ago, and it may be worth about L.20 
per annum. The amount of the stipend is 16 chalders, the one-half 
meal and the other barley, with L. 10 for communion elements. 

As stated under a former head, there is a Government church 
at Berriedale, in the west end of the parish. It was built in 1826, 
and accommodates 300 sitters. The district connected with it 
how forms a quoad sacra parish. In consequence of some of the 
families having been removed since the church was built, it is now 
too remote for the more populous districts connected with it, but 
is, notwithstanding, still very useful ; and were a small church to 
be erected in the eastern quarter, where the minister could preach 
every alternate Sabbath, it would be still more so. There is an 
excellent manse near the church, as also a garden and small 
glebe. Both the latter were furnished by the late proprietor Mr 
Home of Langwell, and are continued by his successor Mr Do- 
nald Home. The stipend, amounting to L.120, is paid by Govern- 
ment, and the population is fully 1400. There was also a church 
built at the village of Lybster In 1836 by subscription, and the 
district connected with it constituted a parish quoad sacra. It is four 
miles east of the parish church, has a regular minister settled in 
it, and a population exceeding 2500 souls. A manse has not yet 
been built, nor a glebe assigned, but the minister has been pro- 
vided with a good house in the meantime, and a stipend of L.lOO 
per annum, which is paid from the seat-rents. The church is a 
neat, commodious, and well-finished building, constructed of the 
best materials. It contains 805 sitters, and the contract price was 
L. 830, all of which was cleared off the same" year in which the 
house was finished. Its grea't utility in that district is universally 
acknowledged. All the seats are let, the church crowded, and 
yet the parish church as well attended as formerly. This is the 
only attempt hitherto made, on the Church extension plan, in any 
of the counties north of Inverness, and it has succeeded far beyond 
the most sanguine expectations of its promoters. How long the 
people, who are almost all composed of the poor and working 
classes, may be able to afford seat-rents equal to their minister's 
stipend, must depend upOn the future success of the herring- fish- 
ing. It is hoped, however, that Government will ere long see the 
expediency and necessity of appropriating a small sum by way of 
stipend to assist such necessitous places. The proprietors con- 
nected with the district contributed liberally towards its erection, 
as also several others both in and out of the parish, together with

the whole body of the inhabitants of this and the other parishes of 
the county. It was a favourite measure, in which all felt interest- 
ed; and it would have delighted the writer to record here the 
names of all the principal subscribers, could it be admitted, in tes- 
timony of the grateful sense he entertains of the handsome and 
cordial manner in which his appeals in behalf of this important 
object were responded to by all classes. 

There is a mission on the establishment of the Society in Scot- 
land for Propagating Christian Knowledge, at Bruan, in the east- 
ern extremity of the parish. This station was formerly connected 
with Berriedale, where the missionary resides. The disjunction 
took place in 1826, when the Government church was erected at 
the latter place. A comfortable manse has been erected at Bruan 
for the missionary, which cost L.232, and the expense was defrayed 
by the people connected with the district. A glebe of four acres 
of excellent land was handsomely made over to the mission by the 
late Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, Bart., whose estates are chiefly 
benefited thereby. The mission-house stands on the boundary 
betwixt this parish and Wick, and now accommodates about an 
equal number from each parish. The church is seated for 600. 
The population from both parishes is 1800, and the mission is one 
of the most compact anywhere to be found. The present mis- 
sionary's stipend has recently been augmented to L.lOO, only L.25 
of which is paid by the Society — the remainder is paid, or at least 
promised, by the people, and raised from the seat-rents as far as 
these can be realized. This district also ought to be made a parish 
quoad sacra, more especially as it is now completely disjoined from 
the parish church, by that of Lybster intervening betwixt them. 

About 350 of the inhabitants of the interior of the parish are 
connected with the Royal Bounty Mission of Dirlot, in the parish 
of Halkirk, and attend public worship at the meeting-house of 
Halsary, where a new and more suitable house is about to be budt, 
and is much needed. 

There are four catechists in the parish. They are appomted 
by the kirk-sessions, with the consent and approbation of the peo- 
ple among whom they labour, and by whom they are paid. There 
are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish. An attempt 
was made a few years ago to introduce dissent into the village of 
Lybster, where the most strenuous exertions were made and great 
expense' incurred by the United Secession body to establish a con- 
gregation, but it has signally failed, and is now given up as hope-

less. This might have been foreseen from first, as there were no 
members of that or any other Dissenting denomination there, and 
the inhabitants generally neither desired nor countenanced such 
a measure.  With the exception of a few strangers who may 
settle among them, the people are most devotedly and con- 
scientiously attached to the Established Church, to which the 
whole population of 8000 belong, with the exception of about 
twelve families in the eastern extremity of the parish. One, and 
sometimes both the heads of these families usually attend the Se- 
cession church at Wick, but the young people belonging to them 
generally attend at the mission of Bruan on Sabbath. Consider- 
ing the poverty of many of the inhabitants, excepting those from 
the very remote districts where meetings are frequently kept by 
the catechists or others for the convenience of the people, divine 
service is remarkably well attended in the several places of wor- 
ship. On this subject it is recorded, with peculiar satisfac- 
tion, that, within the last few years, a marked improvement has 
taken place in the attendance of the young, and there is every 
reason to hope that it will be progressive. This is to be attribut- 
ed not merely to the public exhortations addressed to parents 
from the pulpit, but also to the more than ordinary attention of 
the parochial and other schoolmasters in inculcating this most im- 
portant duty upon their scholars. 

The average number of communicants has varied from 130 to 
180 during the last seven years. The fewness of their number is 
to be ascribed to the feelings of reverential awe with which they 
view this solemn ordinance, and the diffidence they experience as 
to their being possessed of the necessary qualifications for enaff- 
ing in it.   

The yearly collections for the poor may be averaged at L. 52, 
and those for religious purposes at L. 30. ' 
_ Education.-mthevto there has been only one parochial school 
in this extensive parish. There are, however, 14 unendowed and 
three Society schools; two supported by the General Assembly, 
and one by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Know, 
ieage ; in all 18, besides a few female schools where reading as well 
as needle-work is taught. The languages and the higher branches 

mathematics are taught in the parochial and Assembly's schools,

when required; but only the elementary branches in those unen- 
dowed ; and many of the latter, being in remote districts, where the 
people are very poor, are kept open during only six months of the 
year, viz. winter and spring. In all the schools the Scriptures 
are read daily, and the catechisms taught. The salary of the pa- 
rish teacher is the maximum, and the fees may amount to from 
L 20 to L. 30 a year. That of the Society teachers is from L.20 
to' L. 25 each, and their fees from L.8 to L.IO. The unendowed 
teachers are by far the worst paid ; their emoluments may average 
from L.3 to L.4, including fees, though usually they have their 
victuals in addition. From the smallness of their emoluments it will 
readily be conceived that the acquirements of these teachers can- 
not be great. They are selected from the most talented and pro- 
mising of the scholars in attendance at the parish school, where 
they are ao-ain to be found in attendance how soon their own schools 
close in the beginning of summer. Here they spend the sum- 
mer and harvest in revising their former studies, and adding as 
much as possible to their stock of already acquired knowledge. 
By these means they return with fresh vigour and increased re- 
sources to their former stations in winter. Thus they continue to 
advance in the higher branches of education, until quali6ed for the 
Society or even parochial schools. But to these schools again, 
the different districts look for other young men to supply their 
nlaces so that the district schools are a kind of nurseries for the 
more Advanced seminaries, which in their turn liberally repay the 
debt they have incurred. There have been five of hese district 
teachers prosecuting their studies most creditably at the university 

for several years back. i • i i i 

"it is proper to notice that there is another parochial school 
being huWt at Dunbeath, in connection with the Government pa- 
Sh of Berriedale. Mr Sinclair of Freswick, at the -Vecommen- 
d.tion of his curators, has, in the handsomest manner, agreea to 
hear the whole expense of furnishing the necessary accommoda- 
tions These will at least cost L.300 ; they are upon a scale more 
than'ordinarily liberal, and will be finished this season. 1 he be- 
nefits to result from such an establishment in that quarter, it is 
Scult to calculate, and the example of Mr Sinclair and lus h- 
b rll minded curators cannot be too highly recommended. From 
ti rexertions made in furnishing the means of education, thei

there is a considerable number who can neither read nor write. 
The people in general are certainly alive to the benefits that 
arise from a good education, and therefore make considerable ex- 
ertions, according to their small means, for supporting schools 
among them. No doubt several of the unendowed schools are 
of very inferior quality, as may be expected from the trifling re- 
muneration that some districts can afford, so that what is wanted 
is not so much additional schools as additional salaries, and con- 
sequently better qualified teachers. Without the former, it is 
hopeless to attempt to raise the character of the latter beyond 
what has already been done. There are four stations at least, 
where Society schools could be most advantageously located, and 
for which applications have frequently been made, though hitherto 
without effect. It has already been observed, that the improve- 
ment in the conduct and morals of the young people is everywhere 
recognized by those who are acquainted with the parish'; and that 
this change is in a great measure to be ascribed to the additional 
facdities and improved system of education, cannot be doubted. 
The proprietors have already done much, and it is to be hoped, 
that the altered state of society for the better will encourage them 
to persevere, until all the scattered hamlets of this extensive and 
populous parish, second perhaps to no landward parish in Scot- 
land, are brought under the influence of a sound, moral, and re- 
ligious education. 

Having already noticed the recent improvements of an agri- 
cultural nature under that head, it may not be improper here to 
enumerate briefly those of an ecclesiastical and educational na- 
ture, which have taken place during the last twenty years, being 
• the period of the incumbency of the present writer. The parish 
church, remodelled and greatly enlarged,— a Government church, 
manse, and glebe, established at Berriedale, and that district 
formed into a quoad sacra parish, with a separate minister,— a 
new church built at Lybster, with a separate minister settled' 
there, and also formed into a quoad sacra parish,— the mission 
ot lruan, confined to that station, instead of two as formerly, and 
a commodious manse built for the missionary, with a suitable 
glebe attached;— all of these ministers, actively and laboriously 
engaged in communicating religious instruction, and discharging 
duties of pastoral superintendence among the people. As to 
eaucation, there has been a new parish school, with schoolmaster's 
accommodation erected ; another parochial school in the course 



112 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



of erection at Dunbeath ; an Assembly school established at Ber- 
riedale, with schoolmaster's accommodation ; another Assembly 
school similarly provided at Reisgill, together with eight unen- 
dowed schools in different localities; the general qualifications 
of the teachers considerably raised ; the system of teaching vastly 
improved ; and, consequently, the number of scholars almost in- 
credibly increased : the general average exceeds 1200. But still 
much remains to be done in both departments ; and as it is pleas- 
ing to reflect, that, in carrying forward these improvements, the 
harmony and good understanding subsisting betwixt the heritors 
and the present incumbent, have never been interrupted; a circum- 
stance not a little creditable to the heritors, considering how many 
demands were necessarily made upon them ; so it is to be hoped 
that the same cordiality and good feeling will be mutually mam- 
tained in prosecuting those that are still in contemplation. The 
readiness with which they have promoted these improvements, is 
very commendable. 

Friendly Societies.— There are two of these of long standing, 
one at Dunbeath and the other at Lybster. In many Instances 
they have been remarkably useful, both in respect to widows and 
orphans, and also the aged and infirm ; but for several years back, 
they have not been becoming more flourishing, either as to members 
or funds. However, it is to be hoped that they may yet revive. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons at present 
on the poor's roll is 202 ; each of whom only receives at the rate 
of from 4s. to 8s. at the time of distribution, which is oncea-year. 
Such of them as are able, make their rounds through the parish 
occasionally, in order to obtain aid from those families whose cir- 
cumstances enable them to assist them; and those that are bed- 
ridden or infirm have assistance sent them by the charitable and 
well disposed around them. There beingno parochial assessment, 
the collections made at the church doors, together with the inte- 
rest arising from a few benefactions, furnish the funds from which 
the poor receive the small pittance which can be assigned them. 
The average church collections may amount to L. 52 yearly, and 
the interest from benefactions to L. 18. The latter consist of 
L. 100, left many years ago, by the late Rev. Dr James Oswald 
of Glasgow ; L. 100 by the late John C. Sutherland, Esq. of 
Forse in this parish ; L. 100 by Conductor Sutherland of North 
America • and L. 40 by Mr Alexander Finlayson Macdonald ot 
same place Much to the credit of the poorer classes, they very

generally manifest a strong disinclination to seek relief from the 
poor's funds. There is a degree of virtuous pride, as well as 
strong natural affection very prevalent, which induces the children 
to support their aged and infirm parents to the utmost of their abi- 
lily ; and when applications are made for parochial relief, the 
cases are usually found to be very necessitous. This feeling is 
always encouraged, and its opposite discountenanced by the kirk- 
session, by every possible means. Hence, in ordinary seasons, 
very few indeed apply for certificates of poverty ; and it is truly as- 
tonishing among such a large population, almost solely composed 
of the poorer classes, how very few are to be met with, asking cha- 
rity. The numbers of this description from the south are very 
great, and generally of very indifferent character ; but resolutions 
have recently been entered into by the county gentlemen, with a 
view of checking this great grievance, which, it is hoped, will have 
the desired effect. No year passes without many gross deceptions 
being practised upon the unsuspecting inhabitants, by designing 
persons of this description. 

Fairs. — There are four fairs held in the parish for general pur- 
poses, two at Dunbeath and two at Lybster, during the year. 

injis.— There are not fewer than 26 public-houses, for retail - 
ing spirits, &amp;c. in the parish, when six would have been quite 
sufficient for every necessary purpose. 

Fuel. — Almost all the fuel used consists of peats. The ex- 
pense attending its manufacture and carriage makes it ultimately 
very little cheaper than coal ; only, it is more convenient, being 
always at hand.

Name, -c— The name of the parish is supposed to be derived 
from a Danish word signifying a valley. Its extent is 7 miles in 
length and 3 in breadth. 

IL — Civil History. 

State of Property and Antiquities, Sf c— The boundary of the 
parish was formerly, in the greater part of its extent, the boundary 
of distinct properties. 

The estates of Tister formerly written Thuspisteer, and 
Northfield, in this parish, connected with Durran, in the parish 
of Olrick, had belonged to the family of Mr Sinclair Worth of 
Durran. Both of these estates are now the property of the Earl 
of Caithness. 

The property of Lyth, in this parish, separated by a burn only 
from How and Myreland, in the parish of Wick, belongs to Mr Sm- 
clair of Barrack. That of Bowermaddon, and half of Mursay, 
in this parish, have been added to Tain and Hoy, in the parish of 

Olrick. , 

The boundary of Bowermaddon and Mursay was supposed to 
extend to the burn of Amatan ; and the intervening house and 
farm of Hartfield is partly in this parish, and partly in that of 
Dunnet. The mills on these two last have been pulled down, 
and a new one erected in place of them, on the boundary of 
Bowermaddon. 

The estate of Scarmclet, on the south-west side of this parish, 
has been acquired by Sir R. Anstruther, and added to his property 
of Dunn, in the parish of Watten, and improved by a new farm 
at Blackcarn, beyond Larel, and a steading of buildings at Bleedy- 
Quov and the erection of an excellent new mill. On the pre- 
mises on which the old mill stood, Sir Ralph Anstruther has 
caused a school-house to be built.

The improvements formerly begun on the estates of Scarm- 
clet and Clayock, by the late Lieutenant-Colonel Benjamin 
Williamson of Bauneskirk, have been considerably advanced by 
Sir Ralph Anstruther, by the erection of new farms and stead- 
ings, and dividing the possessions of the tenants by ditches 6 feet 
wide by 3 feet deep, which preclude the encroachments of cattle, 
and lay the land dry. Mr Henderson of Stempster has inclosed 
many acres by ditches, and improved his property by digging marl 
pits. 

The estate of Brabsterdorran said once to have belonged to 
the earldom of Caithness was lately acquired from that of South 
Dunn, by Colonel Stewart of Strath, and resold to David Hen- 
derson, younger of Stempster : it is now more than four or five 
times the value of what it was when it belonged to the late Mrs 
Henrietta Sinclair Wemyss of South Dunn. 

The improvements begun on it by General Stewart, by the 
erection of a dwelling and offices on the site of the old mansion, 
some hedging, draining, and road-making, have been further ad- 
vanced, and the mains enlarged, with extended lillage, fallowing, 
and enclosures with stone and turf dikes, as also drains ; on the 
Mains, there were added a steading of offices, and a thrashing-mill 
driven by water, besides a new farm at lower Gillock, bounding 
with Lower Scarmclet and Quoynce. 

On the hill-ground to the east, beyond Brabster and Lister, at 
nearly equal distance from Brabster, Campster, and Belster of 
Lord Caithness's property, is placed the standing-stone called 
Stone Ludd, which, by an old tradition, is supposed to be the me- 
morial of a battle fought and gained. 

Torfaeus mentions a fight begun in the moss of Skitten, {paludi- 
bus Shidensibus, now oftener called Kilmster, by two brothers for 
the Earldom of Caithness, — Liotus, the elder, being supported in 
his right by the King of Norway,— Scullius, the younger, being aid- 
ed by the King of Scotland. It is said that the younger was slain 
in battle, and buried in Hofn, probably Stone Hone, near Wat- 
ten ; and that the elder, victorious brother, was mortally wounded. 
It IS not improbable that the stone was raised as a memorial of 
Liotus, the Earl of Caithness and Orkney, in the tenth century. 

The lands of Bowertower and Auckhorn, Seater, Hastigrow, 
Kirk, and Stanstill, with Whitegan, belong to David Sinclair 
Wemyss of South Dunn, and still make up the highest share of the 
valuation of the parish. The mansion-house of Stanstill is let to a

tenant, witli the mains enlarged, and a new square of offices, and 
thrashing-mill driven by horses. 

The estate of Thura was, within the last forty years, purchas- 
ed by the late William Sinclair, Esq. of Freswick. It is now the 
property of his son. The Mains have been lately improved by 
drains and extended enclosures. 

, Among the improvements in this parish, those earned on by 
John Sinclair of Barrack, on the property of Lyth and Alterwall, 
may be reckoned the greatest. He has added several hundred 
acres to the land in his own possession, laid much ground dry, 
multiphed enclosures, and on some of the pastures for sheep added 
wire fences, besides erecting a new mansion-house, and squares of 
farm-steadings.

I'RESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF CAITHNESS AND 
SUTHERLAND. 

THE REV. CHARLES THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History, 
Name. — The vocable wic in Danish, Saxon, and other northern 
languages of Gothic origin, signifies a corner, a flexure, a bending 
reach in a river, a hay. Hence the derivation of Wick, formerly 
spelled Weik, which has always been the name of this parish, is 
obvious. A well-defined and rather beautiful little wic, or bay, 
which, no doubt, formed a comparatively safe and commodious 
harbour to the Danish and Norwegian pirates of ancient davs, 
communicated its appellation to the village which gradually rose 
on its northern shore ; and, finally, the name was extended to the 
whole parochial district which, ultimately, became connected with 
the town. 

Extent. — The parish of Wick is 15i miles in extreme length 
from north to south ; its average breadth is about 5 miles; and its 
superficial extent may be estimated at 77 square miles, or 61,600 
imperial acres. 

Boundaries.— The parish of Wick is bounded, on the south by 
the parish of Latheron ; on the south-west, by the parish of 
Wattin; on the north-west, by the parish of Bower; on the 
north, by the parish of Canisbay ; and on the east, by the Moray 
Frith.   

Coast.— The coast of this parish presents along its line, which 
is about twenty-six miles in length, a great variety of features. Near 
the northern extremity, on the townland, or estate of Nybster, it 
IS formed by lofty rugged rocks. These are succeeded by gently 
slopmg fields, on the northern limit of the Bay of Keiss. Almost 
the whole of the shore on the bosom of this capacious bay is low, 

thev liirlJri,'"fi''" ""' received the name of Vikingr, that is bay-men, because

and formed of flinty sand. Towards the southern side, it is com- 
posed of comminuted shells. The coast now becomes bold an d 
rocky till it reaches the Noss, or, as it is usually, but tauto- 
logically, styled, Noss-Head. From Noss to Staxigoe it is 
composed of lofty, black, and rugged rocks, which are continued 
with more or less of the same savage character to Proudfoot, the 
northern side of the entrance to the Bay of Wick. At the Head 
of Wick, opposite to Proudfoot, the same kind of rugged, rocky 
coast- recommences, and continues, with but trifling interruptions, 
till it passes beyond the southern boundary of the parish. On the 
coast of the parish of Wick, there are numerous goes or small 
inlets of the sea, with steep and rocky sides. Commencing at 
the south side of Keiss Bay, the principal of these, between it 
and Noss-Head, are Braidgoe; Caldersgoe; Sclatygoe; Ruthigoe; 
Girnigoe, crowned with the hideous ruins of Castle Sinclair and 
Girnigoe, the principal ancient baronial stronghold of the Sinclairs, 
Earls'of Caithness ; Manigoe, supposed to be properly Moneygoe, 
because it is reported, and the fact, that in it several parcels of base 
copper coins have at diff"erent times been found, corroborates the 
tradition, that Earl George the Wicked entertained in it one 
Smith, a coiner of bad money ; Sandygoe ; and Mursligoe, the 
cove frequented by seals. An entrance from this goe leads under 
a small rock, by a dry passage, into an immense cavern under 
Noss-Head. Between this headland and Broad Haven, are 
Staxigoe, so called from some Stacks, or detached rocks, which 
rise above the sea at its entrance ; and Eltrigoe. Papigoe lies m 
the Bay of Wick. A passage is said to lead a considerable way 
from the sea, to a small knoll called the Pap, whence the name 

of Papigoe. , « . , r , 

On the shore to the south of Wick Bay, lies a black and frightful 
chasm, on which stands the dismantled tower of Auld Wick. At 
sea, this ruin forms an excellent landmark, and is by sailors called 
the AuV Man o' Wick. Southward from Auld Wick is the Burgh 
of Hempriggs, so called from its having been in very ancient times 
the site of a brucli, or fort, the traces of which are still visible. 
It forms a small fishing haven. In the mouth of it stand the 
Stacks of Hempriggs. The principal of these is an immense 
outstanding rock, perforated from side to side, and from top to 
bottom ; the resort, in the breeding season, of innumerable sea-

fowl ; and always of a pair or two of merlin hawks. The Brig o 
Tram, Craig- Ammel, Brickigoe, and Falligoe, near the southern 
termination of the parochial coast, are some of its more interesting 
features. 

Keiss Bay, called also Reiss Bay, from the townland of Reiss, 
which lies upon it; Ackergill Bay, from the noble Tower of Acker- 
gill, which stands on its shore, and likewise Sinclair Bay, from 
the neighbourhood of Castle Sinclair and Girnigoe ; and the Bay 
of Wick are the only two bays on the coast. The former is by 
far the larger. Ships have often been stranded on its shore. 
This has arisen from its having been mistaken for the eastern en- 
trance of the Pentland Frith. A lighthouse ought to be erected 
on Noss-Head. 

This dangerous promontory, Proudfoot, the Head of Wick, 
and Ulbster Head, are the most important headlands on the 
coast 

Surface. — The surface of the parish of Wick is in general flat, 
or but very gently sloping in different directions. The northern 
parts generally face the south, and the southern have anorthernand 
north-eastern exposure, as shown by the run of the water. Its aspect 
is bleak, unpicturesque, and tame. The heights of Yarrows and 
Camster, towards the south-west of the parish, are the only hills 
deserving of the name. Their elevation above the sea is conside- 
rable ; but iheir appearance is dull and heavy. 

A spacious valley, forming the fertile strath of Stirkoke, stretches 
in a westerly direction from the Bay of Wick to the Loch of Wat- 
tin, — a distance of about twelve miles, without ever attaining an 
elevation of more than 60 feet above the level of the sea. Half 
. a mile above Wick, a similar valley, running southwards in a cir- 
cumlinear direction, and keeping nearly parallel to the sea coast, 
but bending a little more to the west, arrives at a somewhat greater 
elevation at its southern extremity, than the former. Another val- 
ley, containing the deep and extensive moss of Kilminster, separates 
the parishes of Wick and Bower. 

Meteorology. — The climate of this parish is that of the whole of 
Caithness, — very windy, humid, and variable. The average num- 
ber of days in the year with rain is 190 ; with snow, 36 ; and with 
frost, 3.5. The fall of rain is pretty equally distributed through- 
out the twelve months. The quantity of rain that fell in 1840, 
from the 1st of January to the 31st of December inclusively, was 
as follows ; —

Fogs, which are often very dense and wetting, generally come 
from the east. They seldom last above an hour or two. This is 
owing to the breezy character of the weather, The days with fog 
amount in the year to 35. Westerly winds prevail. The winter 
is in general windy. In the beginning and the fall of the year, it 
is often exceedingly tempestuous. The following table, calculated 
from observations made for several years, will give some intimation 
of the various atmospherical conditions of the climate of this part 
of Scotland.

It appears from this table that the range of the barometer is least 
in summer, and of almost equal extent in the other three quarters, 
and that of the thermometer is nearly equal throughout the year ; 
the greatest range of each instrument being in spring. The range 
of the prevalent winds in winter is very circumscribed. In spring 
and autumn, they go round half the compass, and in the same 
direction from south-east by south to north-west. In summer, 
their range is also limited, but not to such a degree as in 
winter. 

The winters are becoming milder and more open than they for- 
merly were. The number of days in the year with frost, and of 
those with snow, is decreasing. This pre.'ent winter, however, has 
been very severe; much more so, indeed, than any preceding win-

ter ill the memory of the oldest inhabitants. Snow seldom falls 
for more than a day, or lies above two days, at a time. Thunder 
is very rare. It generally occurs at a great distance ; and light- 
ning seldom strikes or does any injury. 

In 1784, a halo, " superbly bright and luminous, consisting of 
two bows, concentric, with an apparent interval of from three to 
four feet between them, and extending over a great part of the 
hemisphere, was distinctly seen."  What are usually called fall- 
ing stars are frequently seen shooting across the nocturnal sky. 
The polar lights are visible almost every night, and generally pre- 
vent it from ever being very dark. 

Diseases. — Fevers, rheumatism, pleuritis, catarrh, cough, inflam- 
mation of the throat, are amongst the most numerous of the diseases. 
Pulmonary consumption is not frequent amongst adults; but in- 
fants with any weakness about the chest £ire generally carried oft' in 
childhood by hooping-cough, which is often very general and fatal, 
or by different pectoral affections. Rheumatism was not common 
till about the beginning of the present century, when the homely 
warm woollen clothing of olden times began to give place to the 
flimsier though gayer cotton dresses, which are now very generally 
worn. Itch is exceedingly prevalent among the children. The 
kind of food on which the lower orders chiefly subsist, the state of 
their habitations, the scantiness of their clothing, and their indif- 
ference to cleanliness, along with the contagious nature of the 
complaint, sufficiently account for this. Fever of a typhoid type 
is seldom absent from one lane or other in the burgh of Wick, 
Louisburgh, and Pulteneytown, whence it breaks out, and becomes 
epidemic in the neighbouring country. It is generally most acute 
soon after the close of the fishing-season. Nor is it difficult to 
account for its severity at that period. During the fishing there 
are not fewer than 10,000 persons added to the ordinary popula- 
tion of the place; and these are necessarily crowded together, 
sometimes to the number of ten or twelve, in one small room. 
This circumstance, taken in connection with the great consump- 
tion of spirits, and the very filthy state of the hojjses, shores, and 
streets, with putrescent effluvia steaming up from the fish offals 
lying everywhere about, render it a wonder that typhoid diseases 
are not much more prevalent. The shortness of the fishing-sct\.

son, the greater supply of food, and the state of excitement and 
activity in which all connected with the fishing live during the 
period of its continuance, are no doubt the great counteracting 
preservatives. Indigestion, arising from the almost exclusive vege- 
table food of the commonalty, is very frequent. The small ten- 
ants, especially the females, are perhaps most liable to this com- 
plaint ; which seems to be on the increase. Small-pox is seldom 
long absent from the parish, and is often very fatal. Great numbers 
of the people have a strange antipathy to vaccination. They brand 
it as a tempting of Providence ; whereas their rejection of this 
preservative is this sin. British cholera is endemic and epi- 
demic, and often makes its appearance, especially in the latter 
form. It is never fatal in ordinary circumstances. Pestilential 
cholera visited Wick during the fishing season of 1832, a short 
while after its appearance at Thurso. The number of cases re- 
ported amounted to 306, of which 66 proved fatal. 

From various calculations it appears, that the proportion of sick- 
ness in the different sexes gives 141 females to 100 males. Under 
twenty years of age, more males are sick than females ; between 
twenty and seventy more females than males; and above the lat- 
ter age, they are equal. The proportion of sickness, to such a 
degree as to demand medical attention, is about 5 or 6 per 
cent, of the population. The deaths are about 20 per cent, of 
the sick. 

Instances of great longevity are not uncommon. There is at 
present an old lady, resident in the burgh, who has entered into her 
101st year, and an old farmer, in the landward part of the parish, 
who has entered into his 102d. Both these venerable persons are 
in the perfect possession of all their mental and bodily faculties. 

Maniacs are very rare. Idiots and fatuous persons are remark- 
ably common. 

A singular lusus nature, which occurred in the person of a child 
in the neighbourhood of Wick, about eighteen years ago, may 
here be mentioned. This child had a perfect eye on the back of 
the head. It lived for two years ; and it is evident had the use of 
the supernumerary organ, from its never allowing a cap to be 
kept over it. 

Hydrojraphy.—\i is needless to describe the well-known stormy 
Moray Frith, which, as has already been said, forms the eastern 
boundary of the parish of Wick.

The burns of Slickly, Slanstill, and Kilminster contribute to 
supply the Loch of Wester, which lies within three-quarters of a 
mile of the shore of Keiss Bay. This loch is about a mile long and 
a third of a mile broad. Its outlet forms the River or Water of 
Wester, which, after a winding course, flows into the Bay of Keiss. 
On the very highest ground of Noss-Head is the Loch of Noss, 
which, notwithstanding its elevated situation, and though no stream- 
lets fall into if, is seldom if ever dry. The Loch of Kilminster lies 
in the middle of the moss of that name, and does not exceed 
three-fourths of a mile in breadth. The Loch of Winless is to 
the south of the Loch of Kilminster. The waters of both fall into 
the River of Wick. 

The River of Wick, by far the largest stream in the parish, is 
the outlet of the beautiful Loch of Wattin, in the parish of that 
name. It lazily flows in a south-easterly direction through the 
rich and loamy strath of Stirkoke, till, after a winding course of 
eleven or twelve miles, about nine of which are within the parish 
of Wick, which it divides into two parts of almost equal extent, 
it disembogues itself into Wick Bay. Its average breadth is about 
thirty feet; but in rainy seasons, it overflows its banks, and over- 
floods the strath through which it winds. The principal stream- 
lets which it receives within the parish of Wick from the north, are 
the Burn of Winless, which issues from the loch of that name, 
the streamlet which flows from the Loch of Kilminster and Alti- 
marlach, close on the west side of the upper glebe. 

On the south side, the Burn of Bilbster is the first considerable 
streamlet which the River of Wick receives within the parish. The 
Burn of Hauster collects the greater part of its waters on the north 
and east of Camster, a townland belonging partly to Wick and 
partly to Latheron, one of its sources being the little moss- fed 
Loch of Carnlia; and after a sweeping course of eight miles around 
the south side of Stirkoke, falls into the same river, upwards of 
three miles below the Burn of Bilbster. In the north end of the 
Moss of Tannach is Loch Dhu, three-quarters of a mile in cir- 
cumference. Its outlet falls into the Burn of Hauster. Haifa 
nnle to the south of Loch Dhu, lies the Loch of Hempriggs, about 
a mile in length from north to south, and more than half a mile 
in breadth. The natural outlet of this loch is the Burn of New- 
ton, which fails into the River of Wick, below the Burn of Haus- 
ter : but a lade, which has been cut from it, carries a runnel of

water of fifty horse-power into Pulteneytown for various industrial 
purposes. This loch is supplied chiefly from the Loch of Yar- 
rows, two miles and a half distant to the south-west, into which 
runs the water of the drained Loch of Brickigoe. Two trifling 
, lochs, one of which is named Wairows, among the hills of Yar- 
rows, send out, towards the sea, a little stream, which divides into 
two streamlets, one of which runs into the Loch of Sarclet, lying 
half-way between Sarclet and Ulbster House; and the other 
falls into the sea at Falligo, southwards of Ulbster. The Loch of 
Sarclet, which is not above three-fourths of a mile in circumfe- 
rence, discharges its waters into the sea, a little to the south of 
the village of that name. The waters of the valley of Camster 
fall away, to the south, into the. parish of Latheron. 

Except a few rather pretty braes towards the mouth of the River 
of Wick, the scenery, both on the lochs and on the brooks of the 
parish, is as tame and unpicturesque as it possibly can be. Most 
of the well-water of the parish of Wick is impregnated with lime 
or iron. Chalybeate springs of considerable strength occur a 
little to the south of the Castle, of Auld Wick, and on the face of 
a low bank to the north of Proudfoot, the north-eastern extremity 
of the Bay of Wick. 

Geology. — Of the hilly ranges on the south and west of the pa- 
rish, the formation is principally composed of greywacke and grey- 
wacke slate, with a few limestones, sandstones, &amp;c. Towards the 
summit of the Yarrows Hills, a gneissy formation abounds. With 
these exceptions, the rock- formations of this parish consist almost 
entirely of the coarser kinds of the clay-slate or flagstone, so pre- 
valent in the flatter grounds of Caithness. This is an immense 
formation of alternating beds of siiicious and calcareo-silicious flag- 
stone or slate-clay ; dark, foliated, bituminous limestone ; pyri- 
tous shale ; sandstone, &amp;c. The siiicious beds predominate in 
the lowest position in this formation, and the calcareo- bituminous 
bed gives the type to the intermediate part, becoming more siiici- 
ous and arenaceous at the upper posture, and so graduating into 
the superior division. The aggregate thickness of these deposits 
is very great. 

The cliffs along the coast to the north of Keiss are chiefly com- 
posed of grey, brown, and greenish sandstone in thin layers, alter- 
nating with pyritous shale, which disappear in the Bay of Keiss. 
At the Castle of Girnigoe, there is a remarkable section of the 



WICK. 



125 



dark- bluish calcareous flagstone, which continues along the coast 
to the cliffs southwards of the burgh of Wick. This deposit dif- 
fers from the general formation of the district in being in thicker 
beds, on which account it is much used in building. The stratal 
dip is generally to the north-east, with, however, numerous inter- 
ruptions. 

Of the cliffs to the south of the Bay of Wick, the stratal 
dip is in the same direction, and the flagstone is surmounted 
by soft greenish micaceous shale and sandstone. The opera- 
tions near the southern side of the new harbour of Pulteneytown 
have brought into view a ver.y singular disposition of the superior 
recumbent detritus. This, for the space of about 100 yards, is 
composed of large stones, huddled together like the rubbish of a 
quarry. The bank of fine bluish clay, resting upon this, is of con- 
siderable height. Imbedded in it, and near its summit, lies a con- 
spicuous mass of coarse-grained dark-grey granite, of perhaps 
twenty tons in weight. It has been blasted with gunpowder, and 
various idle attempts have been made, but happily without success, 
to destroy this huge and remarkable boulder. A similar granitic 
boulder is found opposite, on the northern side of the bay. These 
are the only specimens known of this kind of stone in the parish ; 
and they bear evident marks of having been rolled along by some 
mighty current. 

Farther along the coast, on the south side of Wick Bay, nearer 
the Castle of Auld Wick, where the sea-cliffs are above thirty feet 
in height, and far above the reach of the high tide, the uppermost 
strata have been deranged by some mighty force directed upon 
them from the Moray Fvith. Enormous masses of rock have been 
broken off from their beds, and thrown upon one another in most 
terrific confusion. One prodigious mass has been heaved from its 
bed below, and placed upon a similar rock immediately above, on 
which it is supported by a small stone between them, so that a 
person can walk beneath it. 

About four miles to the south of Wick, the line of bearing of 
the schistose rocks is altered ; and from a point near Ulbster, 
where they begin to dip in an inland or westerly direction, a great 
change is observable in the physical character of the country. 

Fossil Organic Remains. — Ichthyolitcs are universally spread 
over this extensive deposit ; and their occurrence is not confined 
to one particidar stratum, but is characteristic of this vast schis-

tose formation, from tlie lowest to the highest beds; They have 
been found at Wester, near Keiss Bay, and elsewhere. These stone- 
fish occur in beds of dark-gray calcareous schist, highly bitumi- 
nous and micaceous. In general, the animal remains are easily 
distinguishable from the imbedding matrix by their dark colour. 
Professor Agassiz, the celebrated naturalist, who has devoted so 
much of his time to the study of fossil fishes, has determined, and 
for the first time, with accuracy, the characters of our Caith- 
ness species. 

Mineralogy. — Minerals are not abundant. The laminated beds 
of the rock-formation are, over all the parish, much intersected by 
symmetrical joints and fissures, which are filled up in numerous in- 
stances with trap. This often has the direct effect of altering 
the stratal inclination, and indeed of twisting and contorting it in 
all imaginable directions. Quartz or felspar likewise often fills up 
these fissures ; the smaller of which are sometimes occupied en- 
tirely with calc-spar. The clay-slate contains many varied pyrites. 
At Staxigoe there is a vein of ironstone. Running down into the 
harbour of this village, there is a vein of lead-ore imbedded in fel- 
spar. Between Staxigoe and Broad Haven are several small veins 
of copper-ore. At the latter village there is a pretty good appear- 
ance of alum-rock. Immediately to the south of the Castle of 
Auld Wick, is the best vein of copper in the parish. It was wrought 
about eighty years ago by a company of miners, who carried off 
several shiploads of ore; but, having found a better vein in Shet- 
land, it was abandoned ; but not, however, before they secured 
themselves against competition, by taking a lease of it from 
the proprietor. Sulphate of barytes occurs on the coast opposite 
to the House of Ulbster, and is in some places three feet thick. 

In the immediate neighbourhood of the Tower of Ackergill, 
there is a considerable vein of a kind of parrot-coal, which emits 
a bright flame in burning, but is not reduced to ashes. 

Marl of various qualities abounds in this parish. The draining 
of the loch of Brickigoe has made accessible a bed of most excel- 
lent marl of 20 feet in depth. 

The soil varies in different places. The moss at the foot of the 
hills of Yarrows, the one between Sarcletand Ulbster; the Moss 
of Tannach, and the Moss of Kilminster, the last of which is many 
feet in depth and of great extent,— are the principal deposits of 
peat-earth in the parish of Wick. 



WICK.

From three to four biindred acres in tliesfratli of Stirkoke are 
covered to the depth of from three to five feet, with an alluvial and 
loamy soil, which has evidently been brought by the River of Wick 
in repeated floods from the parish of Wattin. This track is one 
of the richest meadows for the grazing of cattle in Caithness, but 
is subject to frequent inundations. On the banks of the Hauster 
Water, and, in several other places, a deep covering of detritus 
and shale is to be met with. These contain many fragmentary 
remains of ostraceous shells, which are found at a height of from 
100 to 150 feet above the level of the sea. 

Though the soil is in some places light and sandy, and in other 
places rich and loamy, yet in by far the greater part of the parish 
it consists of a stiff hard clay, produced by the decomposition of 
the clay-slate. In general, the subsoil is composed of a close, 
retentive, gravelly clay, mixed with fragments of slate not yet de- 
composed, and resting on the surface of the flagstone or clay-slate. 
This construction retains the moisture which, along with the hu- 
midity of the climate, renders the soil not merely damp, but in 
many places wet, and thus offers the greatest obstacle to the im- 
provement of the land. 

Botamj.— The two Scottish heaths. Erica cinerea, heather, and 
E. tetralix, bell-heather, abound on the moors. A purely white 
variety of the former is occasionally found. The bilberry, Vac- 
cirdum myrtillus, blaeberry ; the Empetrum nigrum, cranberry ; 
the black bear-berry, Arhiitus alpina ; and the red bearberry, A. 
Uva ursi, may Hkewise be found on heathery banks and heights. 
Myrica gale, the Scottish myrtle, is occasionally found shedding 
its agreeable perfume across an impassable bog. One of the 
most elegant of our indigenous flowers, the birds'-eye primrose. 
Primula farinosa, called also from its flowering in April and Au- 
gust, Primula Scotica, the Scottish primrose, adorns, with its 
lovely little purple flowers, the savage heights of the coast of the 
Moray Frith. It is also called the powdered beau, from the white 
dust which plentifully covers the under side of the petals. The 
primrose. Primula veris, is found on the burn sides. A very 
dwarfish species of willow may be met with creeping among 
the heather in wet places. Orchidaceous flowers, baldairies, in 
great variety abound. The Links of Keiss are begemmed in the 
season with the beautiful little white flower of Parnassus, Parnas- 
sia palustris. White and red clovers are indigenous ; the former

often springs up spontaneously on ground wliich has never been 
cultivated, when a little lime may have fallen upon it, or it may 
have been casually turned up by the wheel of a cart or the plough. 
This is also the case with a species of hearts-ease. The tubers 
of Orobus tuherosus, knappards or caperoilie, which have a sweetish 
taste, somewhat like that of liquorice, are sometimes chewed to 
allay hunger. Corncockle, Agrostemma Githago, which has but 
very lately made its appearance in this quarter ; betony, B. offi- 
cinalis, found, though but dwarfish, on the road sides; ground- 
ivy, Gkchoma hederacea ; and foxglove, Digitalis purpurea, 
found near Thrumster, are of comparatively rare occurrence. 
The last plant is provincially called dead men's bells, and has many 
superstitions connected with it. But the rarest plant in the parish 
of Wick was the white water-lily, Nymphaa alba, which \'as found 
only in one spot in all the county of Caithness. This was the 
Loch of Brickigoe, on the estate of Thrumster. But some time 
ago this loch was drained for marl, and the pride of the Catha- 
nensian Flora destroyed. Roots, however, were taken from the 
Loch of Brickigoe, and planted in a pond near the House 
of Stirkoke, and at different places in the county of Caith- 
ness. 

Lichens in great variety, and often of great beauty, clothe the 
rocks and stones in all parts of the parish. The rein-deer lichen, 
L. rangiferinus, grows to the height of about three or four inches 
among the heather. 

Woods.— There are at present no natural woods in the parish. 
Trees have been planted to a considerable extent around the 
houses of Hempriggs, Stirkoke, and Thrumster; but neither the 
climate nor the soil is congenial to their growth, and they do not 
thrive. Elder is excepted ; almost everywhere it flourishes amaz- 
ingly. Quickset hedges have, in many places, been trained mto 

good fences. • r i 

But though the parish of Wick is at present destitute of natural 
wood, such does not appear to have been always the case. It js 
.aid, that, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, the hills 
of Yarrows were covered with copse-wood, which was destroyed 
by fire for the purpose of expelling the wolves, with which, the 
place was infested. But the most remarkable evidence of ancient 
woods is found in the Bay of Keiss. Between the links and the 
sand and running down under the sea, there are found the re-

mains of a submarine forest. These are like peat moss, entirely 
composed of decayed wood. The barks of various kinds of trees 
are quite discernible ; and even the seeds of the birch and ash 
are so well preserved, as to appear but lately from the tree. No 
large trunks are found ; only small specimens of oak, ash, birch, 
and plane-tree ; but none of fir. 

Mammalogy. — Remains of bovine ruminants of a very large size 
have been found in the mosses and marl-pits of this parish. The 
wolf and the wild-goat were once common in the district, but 
have both been extinct long ago. 

The wild-cat is occasionally seen. Otters are often found. 
The Links of Reiss are stored with rabbits. Hares are numerous. 
The fox breeds in the rocks about the coast. Moles are super- 
abundant. Weasels, ferrets, and polecats, are not uncommon. 
Ermines have been found at Stirkoke. A stray deer from the 
heights of Morven is occasionally met with. 

The native breed of horses, still employed by the smaller ten- 
ants, is diminutive and weak. Their provincial name is garrons. 
The original stock of cattle was also small, but the beef was ex- 
cellent. Probably the ancient Cathanensian breed of sheep is not 
yet altogether extinct in the parish of Wick. They are very 
small, with a dirty brown fleece and four small horns. 

Ornithology. — By the kindness of Eric Sutherland Sinclair, 
Esq., surgeon in Wick, who has paid much attention to this sub- 
ject, this Report Is enriched with the following " List of birds found 
in the county of Caithness, and principally in the parish of Wick." 
It cannot fail to be extremely interesting ; and may astonish some

II. — Civil History 
There can be no doubt that the aboiigi 
district which now forms the parish of Wick 
This is proved by several names of places 



nal inhabitants of the 
:, were of Celtic origin, 
and rivulets, such as 



vvrcK. 



Auchairn, Altimarlacli, Drumdriy, which are significant, in the 
Gaehc lanonaoe. 

The Celtic inhabitants were invaded and evidently subjugated 
by the Pechts or Picts, a people of Scythic, or more properly 
Scuthic, extraction, who sailed from Scandinavia to Orkney; 
whence they passed into Caithness across the straits denominat- 
ed from them the Pechtland, softened into the Pentland, Frith, 
and spread themselves over almost the whole of Scotland. Many 
traces of them are yet to be met with in the parish of Wick, both 
in traditions, and in the shape of those singular and curious ar- 
chitectural ruins called to this day by the common people, Pecht's 
houses. The designation Cruithnich, pronounced Creenich, that 
is, wheatmen, by which the Pechts are known in the Gaelic lan- 
guage' — the durability of their habitations extending even to pre- 
sent times, when all traces of the turfen huts of their Celtic pre- 
decessors have long ago passed away — the legendary marvels of 
their strength and skill — and the superstitious awe with which, 
even to this day, the places of their residence are regarded, evince 
that the Pechts must have been a people greatly superior to the 
Celts, and far advanced beyond them in knowledge and civili- 
zation. 

About the year 910, Harrold the Fair-haired, a Norwegian 
king, having expelled the pirates who infested the Northern Sea, 
from the Orkneys, carried the war into Pictland, where he was 
defeated with great slaughter. On his return to Norway, he 
granted the Orcadian Islands to Ronald, a powerful Norwegian 
chieftain, to comfort him for the loss of Ivar, his son, who had 
fallen in battle. Ronald made over this grant to Sigurd, his bro- 
ther, who, having speedily reduced the Orcadians, passed into 
Caithness, and subdued it, with Sutherland and Ross, under his 
authority. Under a succession of Norwegian earls, a very close 
and frequent intercourse subsisted after this event, for ages, be- 
tween the north of Scotland and Norway; whence numerous bands 
of Norwegians successively came and settled in Caithness. Sur- 
names of Norwegian extraction, as Swanson, son of Swen, Man- 
son, son of Magnus, Ronald, Harrold, &amp;c. are frequent in this pa- 
rish. The termination stcr, softened from stadr, a steading, which 
enters into the names of Camster, Ulbster, Stemster, Hauster, 
Thuster, Bilbster, Sibster, Wester, Thurster, and Nybster, shows

also the prevalence of Norwegian colonization within the district 
now forming the parish of Wick. 

The clan Gun are said to have originated in the twelfth cen- 
tury within the parish of Wick, where they once were very power- 
ful, and still are very numerous. About the year 1100, Olaf, a 
man of great bravery, dwelt in the isle of Graemsay, one of the 
Orkneys. He had three sons, Waltheof, Gun, and Swen. 
From the second of these, traditionally called the Great Gun of 
Ulbster, where he dwelt, the clan Gun deduce their descent. 

About 1140, Ronald, Earl of Orkney, whose name was canon- 
ized at Rome in 1192, " was entertained at a town called Wick, 
by Roald, who had a son that was come to maturity, called Swen, 
who was one of those that waited at table." f Margad, who ma- 
naged the possessions at Dungaldsbay, now Duncansbay, of Swen 
Olafson, who followed the profession of a pirate, went some time 
afterwards to Wick, and twenty men with him, to transact some 
business, and before his return slew Roald in his own house, and 
some others with him. Earl Ronald was urged by Swen, the son 
of Roald, to avenge the murder of his father; but the Romish 
saint, after some feeble attempts to seize the person of Margad, 
who was successfully protected by Swen, his master, was, after stdl 
more horrible atrocities had been perpetrated, reconciled at last to 
both the murderer and the pirate. Some time thereafter, whilst 
Ronald was on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Harrold the Wicked, 
Earl of Orkney, spent the winter at Wick, and was robbed of the 
rents of his estates in Zetland by Swen the pirate, whose strong- 
hold was at Lambsburgh, hodiernally BuchoUie's Castle in Cams- 
bay, near the northern boundary of the parish of Wick. § 

Caithness continued subject to Orcadian earls of Scandinavian 
extraction till about 1330, when, owing to the failure of the male 
line, this earldom went into other families, and the power and in- 
fluence of the Norwegians passed away. 

At, and for some time previously to this era, more than a third 
part of Caithness, including the district which now forms the pa- 
rish of Wick, was possessed by a family surnamed De Cheyne. 
The last of the male line, Sir Reginald, is yet under the designation 
of Morar na Sliien, famous in the Highland districts as a mighty 
hunter. He was most anxious for a son to heir his vast estates ; 
and when his wife, Mary, brought him a daughter,- he order- 
ed, in a paroxysm of fury, the child to be destroyed. It was,

however, conveyed away ; and a little sister escaped, in a similar 
manner, the rage of her twice disappointed father. Years rolled on, 
and Morar na Shien often lamented his childless condition. At 
length, on some public occasion, a great festival was held, at which 
SirReginald noticed two young ladies, who far outshone the rest 
of the company. Morar na Shien expressed his admiration, and 
lamented to his wife his cruel infatuation, by which he had been 
deprived of daughters, who, had they been allowed to live, would 
have been about the age of these peerless beauties. Mary de 
Cheyne hastened to confess her justifiable disobedience to her 
husband's orders, and introduced the young ladies to him as 
his own daughters. Overpowered with joy, Sir Reginald de 
Cheyne acknowledged them as his, and constituted them heiresses 
of his extensive possessions. Morar na Shien died about the year 
1350. Mariotta, his elder daughter, married John de Keith, the 
second son of Edward the Marischal, by whom she had a son, An- 
drew, who became possessed, in right of his mother, of the lands 
of Ackergill and other estates in the parish of Wick. Marjory, 
the younger, was heiress of Duffus, and married Nicholas, the se- 
cond son of Kenneth, Earl of Sutherland, who thus obtained the 
castle and lands of Auld Wick, in the same parish. William, on 
whom his father. Earl William, passing by an elder brother of the 
same name, entailed the earldom of Caithness, married a daugh- 
ter of Keith of Ackergill. 

These various marriages brought the Sinclairs, Sutherlands, 
and Keiths into the parish of Wick ; and subsequent events gave 
rise to the following couplet, which is yet often repeated : 

Sinclair, Sutlierlaml, Keith, and clan Gun, 
There never was peace whar thae four war in. 

About the year 1464, serious disputes having arisen between 
the Keiths and the clan Gun, Keith of Ackergill associated with 
himself the Mackays of Strathnaver, who readily entered into the 
quarrel, and marched against his enemies. The hostile parties 
encountered each other on the Moor of Tannach, in the parish of 
Wick. A desperate conflict ensued, but after a cruel slaughter 
on both sides, the Guns were at last defeated. To terminate 
these bitter and bloody feuds, it was arranged that a meeting should 
take place with twelve horses on each side, between Ackergill and 
the Cruner, as the chief of the clan Gun was styled. This in- 
terview was appointed to be held in the Chapel of St Tears, not 
far from Ackergill. The Cruner, with the greater part of his sons 



134 



CAITHNESS-SHIRK. 



and principal kinsmen, to the number of twelve altogether, came' 
at the time appointed, and, as Keith had not yet arrived, they pro- 
ceeded into the chapel to their devotions. Whilst they were at 
prayer, Ackergill came up with twenty-four men, on each horse 
two, and rushing on the Cruner and his followers, overpowered 
and slew them all, but not before the greater part of the Keiths 
had fallen. This horrid act of treachery did not pass unreveng- 
ed. William, the grandson of the Cruner, afterwards intercepted 
and cut off George Keith of Ackergill and his son, with twelve of 
their retainers, at Drummoy in Sutherland. The lands of Ac- 
kergill passed into the possession of the Earl of Caithness. 

The earls of Caithness, who had acquired the greater part of 
the parish of Wick, fixed their baronial residence at the Castle of 
Girnigoe, near the Tower of Ackergill. In 1.576, this stronghold 
became the scene of one of the most fearful atrocities on re- 
cord. John, the Master of Caithness, surnamed from his great 
strength, Garrow, had incurred the displeasure of his father, 
George, the fifth Earl of Caithness of the name of Sinclair, be- 
cause he would not execute the revengeful hatred of the earl 
against Dornock, and extirpate its inhabitants. Having inveigled 
the Master into the snares which had been laid for him, his father 
had him seized at Girnigoe, and cast into a dark and noisome dun- 
geon below ground, in which he dragged out for years a wretched 
existence. At last his keepers, David and Ingram Sinclair, rela- 
tives of his own, determined to destroy him ; and after having 
kept him for some time without food, gave him a large mess of 
salt beef, and then withholding all drink from him, left him to die 
of raging thirst. 

This inhuman earl died at Edinburgh in 1583, and his body 
was buried in St Giles's, where his monument is still to be seen. 
His heart was cased in lead, and placed in the Sinclair's aisle, 
where his murdered son was buried at the church of Wick. 
There is evidence that, if not a Papist, he leaned much to Popery. 

He was succeeded by his grandson, George, son of John Gar- 
row, who began his career by avenging his father's death. David 
Sinclair resided at Keiss, and Ingram at Wester. The daughter 
of the latter was to be married, and a large party were invited to 
the wedding. Earl George met David on his way to Wester, 
and ran him through the body with his sword. The earl then rode 
over to Wester, and accosted Ingram as he was playing at foot-

ball on the green. " Do you know," said he, " that one of my 
corbies," so he called his pistols, " missed fire this morning " — 
and drawing it from the holster as if to look at it, shot him through 
the head.- 

In 1588, the Earl of Sutherland, in revenge for the slaughter 
of one of his dependents by the Sinclairs, made an inroad into 
Caithness, and advanced as far as Wick, which he took and burn- 
ed. One of his followers, having entered the church, found the 
leaden box enclosing the heart of the late Earl of Caithness, and, 
disappointed in his expectations of treasure, broke the casket open, 
and flung the corrupted heart into the air. Proceeding onwards, 
the Sutherlands laid siege to the Castle of Girnigoe, from which 
they retired, after having beleaguered it in vain for twelve days. 
Next year the men of Caithness having killed the Earl of Suth- 
erland's herdsman, that chieftain sent an army of 300 men, 
who marched almost as far as Girnigoe, and cruelly ravaged the 
country. In this inroad, they spoiled the ship, and plundered 
the goods of one Andrew Wardlaw, a merchant in the town of 
Wick, 

In 1606, the Earl of Caithness, by purchase of some estates, 
became proprietor of almost all the parish of Wick ; but his infa- 
mous conduct, which has procured for him in the traditions of this 
parish, the cognomen of the Wicked, involved him in inextrica- 
ble difficulties. To recruit his exhausted resources, he harbour- 
ed at Girnigoe a coiner called Arthur Smith, who filled the coun- 
try with bad money. This, and his turbulence brought down upon 
his head the vengeance of the Court; and Sir Robert Gordon, 
the first Knight-baronet of Scotland, was despatched with ample 
powers to chastise the treasonable earl. Lord Caithness fled ; 
but Sir Robert laid waste his estates, and took possession of his 
castles of Girnigoe, Ackergill, and Keiss. The earl at length 
submitted himself, and was alimented by his creditors with an an- 
nuity out of his dilapidated estates. He died in 1643, and was 
succeeded by his great-grandson, George, who sold in 1672, the 
vrhole earldom, title, and all, to the Laird of Glenorchy, and died 
in 1676. 

Glenorchy, who thus had become proprietor of the greater part 
of the parish of Wick, having married the Countess, assumed the 
title of Karl of Caithness. His right to this honour was disput- 
ed by Goorgo Sinclair of Keiss. To vindicate his claim, Glen- 
orchy having obtained letters from the C'ouncil, raised a troop of 



136 



CAITHNESS-SHlRE. 



several hundred men, and marched against Sinclair, to dispossess 
him of his patrimonial estate. Keiss collected a force of 400 
men, and awaited his enemy in the borough of Wick. There he" 
plentifully regaled his followers ; who had not recovered from their 
revelling, when, on the 13th of July 1680, they were informed 
that the Campbells were crossing the country towards Keiss. In- 
flamed with drink, the men of Caithness vauntingly rushed on the 
men of Glenorchy, who were strongly posted on the western bank 
of the burn of Altimarlach, on the northern side of the River of 
Wick, close above what now forms the upper glebe. A total rout 
of the revellers immediately ensued, who turned their backs and 
fled through the gully towards the river. Numbers were killed 
in attempting to cross ; and tradition says, that the Campbells, in 
pursuit of the fugitives, passed over the river dry-shod, on the 
bodies of the slain. Notwithstanding this disaster, the right of 
Sinclair of Keiss to the title of Earl of Caithness was at last re- 
cognized, and Glenorchy was created, as a sort of compensation, 
Baron of Weik. 

The Baron of Weik was hated by the people. They burned 
the corn and houghed the cattle of the tenants on his estates ; till 
at last, utterly wearied with these incessant vexations, he divided the 
whole of his lands in Caithness into sixty-two portions, great and 
small, which he sold in 1690. 

In this transaction terminated the civil history of the parish of 
Wick. Nothing has since occurred within it worth recording. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owner is the Right Ho- 
nourable Benjamin Dunbar Sutherland, Baron of Duffus, and a Ba- 
ronet. Lord DuS'us is paternally descended from Nicholas Suther- 
land, second son of Kenneth, Earl of Sutherland, who married Mar- 
jory de Cheyne, second daughter of the celebrated hunter, Morarna 
Shien. Marjory was heiress of Duffus, and likewise of Auld Wick 
in this parish, of which her descendant is proprietor at this day. 
The other land-owners are, William Home, Esq. of Scouthel, 
who possesses, in the parish of Wick, the estates of Stirkoke and 
Sibster ; Robert Innes, Esq. of Thrumster ; Kenneth Macleay, Esq. 
of Keiss and Bilbster ; John Sinclair, Esq. of Barrock, proprietor 
in Wick, of Howe and Mireland ; Sir George Sinclair, Bart, of 
Ulbster ; the Earl of Caithness, of Mirelandorn ; William Sin- 
clair, Esq. of Freswick, proprietor in Wick, of Nybster ; the Bri- 
tish Society for improving the fisheries are feudatories under Lord 



WICK. 



137 



Duffus of Pulteiieytown ; and James Smith, Esq. of Olrig, is owner 
of a small property. 

Of these, Lord Duffus and Robert Innes, Esq. are the only con- 
stantly resident land-owners. William Home, Esq. is occasional- 
ly resident at Stirkoke. All the rest are non-resident. 

Parochial Registers. — The records belonging to the Kirk-session 
have not been well preserved. The earlier minutes of session have 
been lost. Those at present extant consist of five volumes. Of these, 
the first, which contains 237 folio pages, commences on the "iOth 
of July 170J, and ends on May 13th 1723 ; the second, which con- 
tains 85 folios, begins on May 2d 1742, and ends on September 
24th 1758; the third, containing 145 folios, begins on October 
1st 1758, and ends on January 13th 1793; the fourth, which 
contains 139 leaves, and is a mere ragged fragment of a quarto 
volume, wanting both beginning and end, commences on the 29th 
of October 1801, and terminates on February 9th 1816; and the 
fifth, in which the minutes of Session are being recorded, commen- 
ces on July 12th 1816. The baptismal registers, which have not 
been regularly kept, consist of six volumes, and commence on the 
3d of November 1701. Up till a late date the registers of ma- 
trimonial contracts, and of births and baptisms, were strangely mix- 
ed and jumbled together. The register of marriages commences 
on the 28th of August 1840. There is no register of deaths. 

nMzVzes.— Several cairns on the Yarrows Hills are, perhaps, 
with the addition of some Gaelic names of places, the only remains 
of the aboriginal Celtic inhabitants of this district. 

The curious ruins of the Pechtish habitations are numerously 
scattered all over Caithness. Several of these are in the southern 
division of the parish of Wick. Some occupy the most fertile 
situations ; others again are placed on barren land, where there are 
no traces of cultivation. 

In their outward appearance the Pechtish houses look like little 
round grassy knolls, about twelve or sixteen feet in height. One 
at Thrumster, the seat of Robert Innes, Esq., from which the earth 
has m part been removed, was found to have been composed of 
two concentric circular walls, built of stone and clay, with a con- 
siderable interval between them filled up with earth ; the whole 
forming a rampart of about eighteen feet in thickness. The en- 
closed area was occupied with several cells; and evident marks of 
hye hre-places around the inside of the inner wall were discovered. 
Ihe whole was very inartificially vaulted with flagstones, and cover- 



138 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



cd over with a thick coating of earth. Various articles were found 
among the rubbish ; such as a wooden distaff, which soon crumb- 
led into dust; a freestone basin ; and three bullets about the size 
af musket-balls, of a substance like marbles streaked with blue. 
The skeleton of a tall man, who had been buried in a coffin made 
of flags, was dug up from the mould which had been heaped up 
against the outside of the fabric. In most of the Pechtish houses 
which have been opened, there were found little recesses in the 
inner walls, which had evidently been used as dormitories for the 
inhabitants. 

There can be little doubt that these remarkable structures were 
the dwellings of the Pechtish chiefs, who were in all likelihood 
both the leaders and priests of their people. The power and in- 
fluence with which, by force and fraud, they ruled over and oppres- 
sed the Celts who formed the bulk of the population, have mvested 
even to this dav, the places of their abode with dread and terror. It 
is still deemed" no cannie to dig up a Pecht's house. Scarcely will 
a peasant profane their verdant sward with a spade. He stands 
in dread of the fairies, who yet are believed to haunt such places, 
or of some other unknown and revengeful power. 

A ruin on the Links of Keiss, called Toft-Ferry, is pmnted out 
bv tradition as the remains of the first house built of stone in Keiss, 
and one of the first three built in the parish of Wick. The other 
two were, one at Harland and one at Hauster. 

On the Links of Kiess, and about half-a-mile to the south ot 
Toft- Ferry, there are near the beach other two ruins covered with 
sand, called the Birkle Hills. These are more conspicuous than 
Toft-Ferrv, being of a conical form, and elevated about tlnrty- 
five feet from their base, and about sixty-five yards asunder. They 
are said to be the ruins of two castles, called Castles Linglass. 
Tradition reports that the castles were burned down ; and the re- 
port is confirmed by the calcined state of such stones as have been 
clu- from the ruins. It is said that a village was connected with 
them, of which, however, there are now no remains. 

An apparently monumental stone at Ulbster, on which are en- 
nraved some untraceable sculptures, is said to mark the grave of 
\ Danish princess, whom Gun, the progenitor of U.e c an Gun 
' r ed in Denmark. The vessel in which the Great Gun of 
U bster returned home with his bride was wrecked on the iron- 
bound shores of Caithness, and the Dan.sh prnicess was drowned

where it is traditionally reported that an Earl Alexander was slain. 
Who he was, or whence he drew his title, is not known. 

Along the coast, are four very ancient strongholds, three of which 
are in ruins. The Castle of Auld Wick is perhaps one of the 
oldest buildings in Caithness. It stands to the south of Wick 
Bay, on a lofty peninsular rock projecting into the Moray Frith, 
and consists at present of the grim remains of a strong tower of 
the rudest masonry, with the merest slits for windows. The space 
behind it towards the sea, has been occupied with two ranges of lower 
buildings, the foundations of which are yet traceable. On the 
very point of the projecting rock, is a flat smooth space, surrounded 
by the remains of a wall, which appears to have been a kind of 
garden, promenade, or bowling-green. Rude steps lead down to 
the sea. The whole has been defended on the land-side by a 
deep ditch, over which communication has been held with the land 
by means of a drawbridge. The ruins of this black unsightly 
tower, still nearly three stories high, form an excellent land-mark 
to sailors, by whom it is called the Aul' Man o' Wick. 

The Castle of Auld Wick was, in the beginning of the fourteenth 
century, one of the strongholds of Sir Reginald de Cheyne. On his 
death, before 1350, it passed into the possession of Nicholas Suth- 
erland, second son of Kenneth Earl of Sutherland, and ancestor 
of the Barons of Duffus, who married Marjory, second daughter 
of Sir Reginald. The castle and lands of Auld Wick after- 
wards went by marriage into the family of Oliphant; and tradition 
says that a Lord Oliphant was slain in a rencounter not far from the 
tower. By the Oliphants they were sold to the Earl of Caithness ; 
by a subsequent earl, they were disposed of to Glenorchy, by whom 
they were sold to Dunbar of Hempriggs, and finally by the mar- 
riage of Sir James Sutherland, second son of James, second Lord 
Duffus, with Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir William Dun- 
bar of Hempriggs, the lands and castle of Auld Wick have come 
into the possession of the present Lord Duffus, the lineal male re- 
presentative of Nicholas Sutherland and Marjory de Cheyne. 

The Castle of Girnigoe, which stands a little to the west of 
Noss-Head, was the chief baronial stronghold of the Sinclairs, 
Earls of Caithness. Its ruins occupy the whole surface of a bold 
peninsular rock, which, starling from a shoulder of the mainland, 
shelters a goe or inlet of some width, whence the castle received 
Its name. The ruins are evidently of different ages. The date

of the older and larger portion, which is the one farther out, is 
buried in remote antiquity. The newer portion seems to have 
been built in the sixteenth century. The extremity of the penin- 
sular rock is occupied by a chamber said to have been the Earl's 
bed-room. A trap-door in the middle of the floor led through 
the rock to the sea. This room communicated by a flight of steps 
with the court, which stood on a higher level. On the right side, 
facing the Bar of Keiss, ran a range of low rooms all the way to 
the dungeon-keep, while towards the land there were only three 
or four small rooms next the bed-chamber, the rest of the court 
on that side having been shut in by a high wall, pierced with 
seven loop-holes. The tower, which consisted of five stories, and 
is about fifty feet in height, occupied the whole breadth of the 
rock. The staircase, circular within, stood in the north-east 
corner next the land. No part of the stair remains. The mam 
part of the tower is of such a size as to contain several vaulted 
apartments on the ground floor, besides the passage to the newer 
building. In one corner of the room next the sea there is a nar- 
row stair leading into a cell, partly formed in the rock. A small 
window opening on the Bay, but beyond the reach of the hapless 
captive, gives light enough to reveal the gloom which pervades the 
duncreon. Here languished for several years, till he was ultimately 
murdered, John Garrow the Master of Caithness, a victim to the 
hatred of his unnatural father, who revelled in the chambers above, 
xvhile his son was perishing in the dungeons below. In the north- 
west corner of the court, a passage leads through the tower to the 
edge of a chasm in the rock, over which a draw-bridge led to the 

court of the new castle. 

With the exception of one or two outer rooms, and of a narrow 
chimney-stalk of the main tower, this part of the bu.ldmg is now 
a Cap of rubbish, presenting a singular contrast to f - « d-vall 
which are nearly entire. This decay must be ascribed to a defect 
in the foundation, which seems to have been built with clay. The 
superstructure being cemented with lime, fell almost m one mass 
into the hollow between the castle and the mainland, and still 
shows the sides of several arches of very strong masonry prostrate 
on the ground. The tower of this part of the castle was no 
nea lY so lofty as that of the other; but much more attention had 
It V been paid in the construction of it to mternal fimshmg.

artificial ditch across the neck of the peninsula, through an arched 
passage into the court. 

The situation of this castle is naturally strong, and its occu- 
pants could have set at defiance assailants armed with the weapons 
of ancient days. A garrison could not have been pressed by fa- 
mine, so long as they commanded the sea, for they could always 
obtain provisions through the secret passage, and the goe would 
afford secure accommodation for such small craft as they might 
employ for traffic with the neighbouring shores. 

In 1606, George the "Wicked, Earl of Caithness, obtained an 
act of Parliament changing the old name of Girnigoe into that 
of Sinclair. Both names, however, are applied to the ruins, which 
are always called Castles Sinclair and Girnigoe, the latter name 
being applied to the more ancient portion. A drawing was taken 
of these castles by Daniell, before Castle Sinclair became so rui- 
nous as it now is. 

The tower of Ackergill, anciently written Aikrigill, which 
stands on the bosom of the Bay of Keiss, is a noble and impres- 
sive structure. It is perfectly rectangular, eighty-two feet in 
height, and baftlemented. The walls are extremely massive, up- 
wards of thirteen feet in thickness : and the wliole building: is ve- 
nerably grey with the hoar of great antiquity. It is in excellent 
repair; and is at present the residence of the Honourable George 
Dunbar, Master of Duflfus, to whose fether it and the Castles 
Sinclair and Girnigoe belong. 

By whom, or at what time, the tower of Ackergill was erected, 
is altogether unknown. The lands of Ackergill belonged to Morar 
na Shien, with whose daughter Mariotta they went into the pos- 
session of the Keiths, and, after passing through the hands of the 
Sinclairs and others, came at last into the family of Duffus. 

On the northern side of Keiss Bay stand the ruins of the Castle 
of Keiss, opposite the Castles Sinclair and Girnigoe. It con- 
sists at present of the remains of a paltry tower. 

This stronghold was formerly called the Fortalice of Radder. 
It anciently belonged to the Earls of Caithness. At present, it 
is the property of Kenneth Macleay, Esq. of Newmore and Keiss. 

Near Thrumster House is a standing-stone, respecting which 
there is an ancient tradition in this district, that Margaret the 
Maiden of Norway, heiress of the Scottish Crown, was wrecked 
on this coast on her return to Scotland, and buried under the 
" Standing-Stane o' Thrumster."

Tlie only other antiquity worth noticing, is that of the Sinclairs' 
Aisle, in the church-yard, opposite the door of the Parish Church. 
It is in the form of a small but elegant chapel. The walls are 
entire, but roofless. It was built by that Earl George who mur- 
dered his own son in the vaults of the Castle of Girnigoe.  

An old image of St Fergus, the tutelary saint of the parish in 
Popish times, habited in a monkish dress, and standing on some 
sort of animal, which formerly lay in the church, has now been 
placed in the jail. Its features are altogether effaced. 

Modern Buildings. — The chief of these is the parish Church. 
This is a large substantial fabric of the very plainest Gothic, built 
of blue flagstone, with freestone at the corners, doors, and win- 
dows, and on the spire. It is imposing from its size. The Town 
and County Hull is likewise of flagstone, ornamented in front 
with freestone, and a belfry like a cupola. The hall itself is a 
large and well-proportioned room. Its walls are adorned with 
well executed portraits of the late Earl of Caithness; the late Sir 
John Sinclair of Ulbster ; James Traill, Esq. of Rattar ; and 
Kenneth Macleay, Esq. The Commercial Bank is of freestone, 
with pillars of the Ionic order. The Congregational Chapel in 
Wick, the United Secession, the Reformed Presbyterian, and 
the Popish chapels in Pulteneytown, are very plain buildings. 
The Academy, built by the British Fishery Company, is a good 
and commodious building. A new church, in connection with the 
Church of Scotland, is about to be commenced in Pulteneytown. 

A Temperance Hall, capable of holding 1000 persons, is in 
the course of being erected in Wick, by the Total Abstinence 
Society of Wick and Pulteneytown. 

Hempriggs House, formerly Telstone, the seat of Lord Duffus, 
though of considerable antiquity, is a large and commodious man- 
sion.° The House of Stirkoke, the seat of William Home, Esq. 
of Scouthel ; the House of Thrumster, the seat of Robert Lines, 
Esq. ; and Rosebank, the property of Kenneth Macleay, Esq. of 
Newmore, — are excellent residences. There are also substantial 
houses at Ulbster, Tannach, Bilbster, Sibster, Harlan, Reiss, 
and Noss, and not a few in the burgh of Wick.

tlie pnrisli are composeJ, is the universal clayslate, or dark-blue 
Hagstone of the county. Tliis, when the stones are well selected 
and squared, makes a beautiful wall. Buildings of it, however, 
from the darkness of its hue, have a very sombre appearance. 

Many houses in Pulteneytown, and throughout the landward 
part of the parish, are built without lime. The wind sifts through 
their walls, and makes them very cold. The houses of many of 
the smaller tenants, and of the cottars, are built partly of stone 
and partly of turf. Some of them are of turf altogether, and are 
wretched hovels. But these very miserable huts are happily be- 
coming rare in the parish of Wick.

It is impossible to ascertain the yearly average of births, mar- 
riages, and deaths, seeing that there is no register of deaths ; that 
the Dissenters do not register their children's births ; that great 
numbers of Churchmen are guilty of the same culpable negligence; 
an} that a register of marriages solemnized within the Establish- 
ment, was commenced only about four months ago. 

Lord Duffus is the only nobleman resident in the parish. His 
seat is Hemprigg House. His son, the Master of Duffus, dwells at 
Ackergill. 

People.~The Celts were, for anything that appears, aboriginal in 
the district. They were in early times invaded and subjugated by the 
Pechts, a Scandinavian race, whose descendants intermingled their 
blood with thatoftheir Celticvassals. The Norwegian conquerors and

colonists, a people cognate with tlie Pechts, infused a much larger 
portion of Gothic blood into the Celtico-Pechtish population of 
the district. , The changes made, a few years ago, on the estates 
of the Duchess- Countess of Sutherland, drove a great many 
Highlanders into Caithness, who found work and sustenance chiefly 
in the more commercial districts of the county. This Celtic sup- 
ply is kept up by the herring fishery, which annually brings into 
Wick very great numbers of young Highlanders, several of whom 
every year settle in the parish. From all these causes it follows, 
that the present parishioners of "Wick are an intermixture of the 
Celtic, Pechtish, Norwegian, and, latterly, again of the Celtic 



races. 



This is evident, both from the names and from the physical 
character, of the people. It is difficult to say whether the sur- 
names of Gothic or those of Gaelic origin predominate. Gaelic 
baptismal names are likewise very common. The physical cha- 
racter of the people also denotes their Celtico- Gothic origin. 
Though there are some, yet there are remarkably few red or yel- 
low-haired- persons in the parish. Their hair is generally black 
or very dark-brown, and their complexions correspondent. Their 
persons are taller and larger limbed than those of their Celtic 
neighbours, though not so tall nor large as those of unmingled 
Gothic descent. In general, their countenances are rather round- 
ish than oval; their eyes dark; their teeth short, white and firmly 
set; and their frames spare, but straight, alert, and sinewy. Many 
are very handsome. 

Laiiffuage.— The language spoken over all the parish is, with 
exception of that of some Gaelic incomers, a dialect of the low- 
land Scottish. It is distinguished, however, by several pecuhari- 
ties. Wherever the classical Scottish has loh, the dialect of the 
parish of Wick has/; as/at for what, fan for whan ; and where- 
ever the Scottish has u, this dialect has ee ; as seen for sune, meen 
for mune,feel for fule. C/i at the beginning of words is softened 
into s, or sh ; as, surch for church ; shapel for chapel. Th at the 
beginning of words is often omitted. She, her, and hers are almost 
invariably used for it and its. This seems a Gaelic idiom ; and the 
tendency to pronounce s and ch, as sh, seems a relic of Gaelic 
pronunciation. . 

Habits.— At all seasons of the year, whisky is drunk m consider- 
able quantities, but during the fishing season enormous potations are 
indulged in. It may seem incredible, but it has been ascertamed, 



WICK. 



145 



that, during the six weeks of a successful fishing, not less than 
500 gallons a day were consumed. Let it be remembered, how- 
ever, that at that period 10,000 strangers, as boatmen, gutters, 
&amp;c. were crowded into the town of Wick. Of late years, the 
people have been more temperate. Snuffing is almost universal 
among the men, and both it and smoking are very common among 
the women. About L.3j500 a-year are spent in the parish of 
Wick on tobacco. 

Character. — The parishioners of Wick are shrewd and atten- 
tive to their own interest. Their shrewdness, however, sometimes 
degenerates into cunning. Unchastity, both in man and woman, 
is lamentably frequent, which appears from the records of the kirk- 
session to have been always the case. They possess, notwithstand- 
ing, many most estimable qualities. They are remarkable for 
natural affection, and show much kindness to their poorer neigh- 
bours. No small respect is evinced by the commonalty for the 
ordinances of religion ; family warship is prevalent among them ; 
the Sabbath is much regarded; and their attendance on the 
preaching of the Gospel is most laudable. 

Smuggling is all but unknown, excepting between the fishers 
and the French fishing-boats during the season of the herring- 
fishery. Poaching is not frequent ; and there is not a pawnbroker 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The state of agriculture in the parish of Wick, previously to 1790, 
was extremely curious, and its arrangements as hostile as they pos- 
sibly could be to all improvement. Each property was divided into 
townlands. In every townland there were what was called " the 
mains," which consisted of a farm, on which were a barn and a 
stack-yard. The proprietor retained the mains in his own hand. 
The remainder of the townland was divided into what were called 
penny-lands, halfpenny-lands, farthing-lands, and octos. These 
were measured out by shrewd countrymen, called land-riders, or 
more properly land-redders, for they did not ride. In accomplish- 
ing their work, they spaced six spaces as the breadth of a rig of corn- 
land, and 240 as the length. This they denominated a firlot-sowing 
of oats. This multiplied by four, he number of firlots in a boll, gave 
5760 square spaces, being precisely the number of Scotch ells in a 
statute Scotch acre. The land-redders knew nothing about survey- 
ing, nor had over heard of a chain, or of an acre ; yet it must be

14G 



CATTHNESS-SHIUE. 



plain, that, long before the memory of man, their measurement 
must have been founded on actual mensuration by the chain. 

The grass-land, outfield, or in arable, was assigned in fixed 
proportions to these different divisions ; and a certain rent, vary- 
ing in different townlands, was laid on the grass-land, and a cer- 
tain quantity of grain to be paid for the corn-land of these various 
penny, halfpenny, farthing, and octo lands. The townland of 
Papigoe, for instance, in the neighbourhood of the town of Wick, 
was divided into fifteen penny-lands, one halfpenny-land, and half 
an octo. Every penny-land paid eleven bolls of corn, or farm as 
it was called, and no money. The townland of Kilminister was 
red into thirty-six penny-lands, each one of which paid four bolls 
of farm, and L.5, 6s. 8d. Scots as rent of the grass-land. To 
render the state of matters still more opposed to all improvement, 
the custom of run-rig was common. This roost barbarous cus- 
tom was said to have originated in times of universal and inces- 
sant feuds, as a preservative against one neighbour's setting fire 
to the field of another, and to make the whole townland equally 
anxious to resist an enemy in case of invasion. 

These penny-lands, &amp;c., were let to small tenants, who, be- 
sides the rent already specified, yielded an infinite variety of 
minute services to the landlord. The tenants of each penny- 
land, for instance, had to bring out their own plough, fully equip- 
ped, early in spring, and plough half an acre of oat-land in the mains, 
_to send a man to sow the seed,— to send their harrows and har- 
row the ground,— to send two persons to carry on the horses' 
backs, for there was not a cart in all the parish, the manure in 
straw baskets, called caizies, for the bear-land,— to lay the manure 
on,— to send a plough and till the bear-land,— to sow the seed,— 
to harrow it with their own harrows : in summer, to mow the na- 
tural grass,— to make it into hay,— to cart it,— to carry it to the 
yard with their own carts,— to build it into stacks,— to send a per- 
son to weed the corn,— to cast 400 feal for building houses, and 
300 divots for thatching them : in harvest, to cut down a certam 
quantity of corn,— to carry it, and build it in the stack-yard,— to 
furnish a certain number of winlins to thatch the mains' stacks, a 
certain quantity of drawn straw to thatch the mains' houses, and 
a certain quantity of simmiJis, that is, plaited straw-ropes, to buid 
down the thatch,— to thrash a certain quantity of corn m the 
barn —to dry it in the kiln,— to carry it to the mill,— to carry the 
meal' thence to the girnel, and to ship, it on board for exportation.

— to carry one letter iii rotation to any person in Caithness, — to 
give a certain portion of peats, — to dress a certain quantity of lint, 
— to winter a certain number of cattle — to pay one fat lamb, two 
geese, hens, chickens, eggs, &amp;c. &amp;c. The land-redders laid off to 
each penny-land such a proportion of arable land as they thought 
would sow twelve bolls of small oats, or eight bolls of bear. Of 
the natural grass-land assigned to each penny-land the tenant hai 
exclusive possession only till the corn was off the ground, when 
the whole again became common till the next spring. Instead of 
being encouraged to take in and improve any part of the outfield - 
land, the tenants were expressly debarred from doing so, or, in the 
country phrase, corrupting the leases, and were prohibited from 
cultivating any more than the portion of corn-land which had been 
ridden of to them. 

The state of agriculture was what might have been expected 
from such wretched arrangements. There was not a cart in the 
whole county. Not a potato, nor a turnip, nor sown grass was 
known. No rotation of cropping was observed, except that the 
arable land was always alternately in oats and bear, the manure 
being invariably put to the bear-crop. Not a drain was dug; and 
not a fence was to be seen except about a field or two round the 
proprietors' houses. 

This extraordinary mode of farming went on without any change 
till 1790. In 1782, Sir Benjamin Dunbar, the present Lord 
Duffus, succeeded his father. He found all the townlands on the 
whole of his extensive estates in Wick, comprising the half of the 
parish, under lease to middle-men, who paid him only the money 
rent payable by the small tenant for the grass-land, and 6s. 8d. 
for each boll of eight stone and a half, paid by thena for the corn- 
land. Thus the middle-men had the mains of each townland, and 
the services of the subtenantry free. Sir Benjamin, aware of what 
was passing in other countries, determined to put an end to this 
wretched system, which had immemorially prevailed. Having as- 
certained on what principles the land-redders divided and appor- 
tioned the land, he had the whole of his numerous townlands 
measured with the chain, abolished the middlemen, converted all 
the services of the tenants into money, and granted them leases 
at a fixed rent. The result of this enlightened procedure was 
most advantageous. Tillage was extended, better modes of culr- 
tivation were introduced, land was improved, the rental of the pro- 
prietor increased, while the tenantry were delivered from their

former degrading vassalage, and their comfort and respectability 
greatly promoted. When Sir Benjamin Dunbar came into pos- 
session of his estate, there were but a very few farm-houses on it 
built with stone ; now, there are very few, if indeed any, built of turf. 

The great improvement of land within the parish of Wick may 
be seen from the following statement. In 1666, the valued rent 
oT the parish was L.6977, 6s. 8d. Scots. In the corrected rental 
of last century, it stood thus:

In 1792, the rent of the best land ranged from lOs. to 15s. per 
acre. In all the parish at that period, there were of sown grass 
only 12 or 14 acres at Hempriggs, 8 in possession ofthe minister, 
and a few patches between Wick and Staxigoe. There was not a 
cart in the parish, the ploughs were of the very rudest description, 
drawn by three or four worthless horses, with, perhaps, a couple 
of cows to assist, a lad tugging them on before, and a man holding 
the single stilt behind. Such a phenomenon may yet indeed be 
seen, even in 1841. The commenced improvement of the dis- 
trict, however, had already beneficially affected the wages of la- 
bour and the price of provisions. In 1792, ploughmen, who had, 
some years before, had no more than from 13s. 4d. to 18s. the 
half year, got from L.l to L.l, 8s. ; women-servants, who had, for 
the half year, had from 6s. 8d. got from L.l, to L. 1, 4s. j day-

labourers got from 6d. to lOd. a day ; women were hired for the 
harvest at 6d. a day and a bannock ; and domestic servants had 
raised their half-yearly wages from 6s. 8d. to 13s. Provisions 
brought the following prices : those which had sold at Id. per pound 
rose to 2d. ; hens fetched 3d. a piece ; cocks 3d. ; and chickens 
ld. ; eggs were Id. per dozen; geese, which had sold at 8d a 
piece, brought Is. 6d. ; and corn, which, in 1762, had sold at from 
5s. to 8s. a boll, brought in 1792, from 10s. to 18s. 

In 1840, the average rent of arable land was from L. 1, 5s. to 
L, 1, 10s. an acre. A ploughman got for the half year L. 4, 10s. 
and victuals ; a woman for the same term L. 1, 10s. and victuals ; 
day-labourers earned in summer from Is. 6d. a day, to 2s. ; in 
winter, about 2s. ; women in summer, 8d. a day ; in winter, 6d. ; 
men got as harvest fee, L. I, 10s., with a weekly allowance of four- 
teen pounds of meal ; and women L.l, with a weekly allowance of 
twelve pounds. Wool brought from L. 1, 4s. to L.l, 6s. a stone. 
The price of mason-work from L.l, 15s. to L.2 per rood; and of 
three feet dikes from Is. 2d. to Is. 3d. a yard. A good cart 
brought from L.10 to L.ll ; and an iron plough, L. 3, 10s. Bear, 
on an average of the last five years, brought L.l, 4s. per quarter; 
and oats, L.l, Is. ; potatoes were 12s. per boll ; turnips, L. 5 per 
acre ; and hay was about 6d. per stone. In 1 840, the price of oat- 
meal was 15s. per boll; of bear-meal, 12s. per boil; of beef per 
pound, 4d. ; of fowls, from 6d. to 9d. a piece ; and of eggs pef 
dozen, about 4d. 

The average rent of grazing for the year is at the rate of L.6 
per ox or cow; and of L.l per sheep on inland, and of 8s. on 
moory patsure. 

Live-Stock. — Of cattle there are two breeds. In the jrs place, 
the pure Highland, which has been much improved of late years 
by the introduction of bulls and breeding cows, selected from the 
best Highland stocks in Scotland. Secondhj, crosses from the 
short-horned bull and Highland cows have been introduced, and 
answer well, especially for feeding, as they are brought at an early 
age to a great size and weight ; and, since the introduction of steam 
conveyance, can be conveniently sent to the southern or metropo- 
litan markets. The common breed of sheep is the Cheviot. This 
is crossed by the Leicester tup ; and the cross thrives remarkably 
well. These sorts of stock are the most profitable, taken together 
with the present improved system of agriculture and rotation of 
crops. Both sheep and cattle, indeed, are in such a forward state 
of improvement, as to be capable of being brought into competition

with those of the southern districts, and of late years have carried 
off several premiums at the Highland Society's shows. 

In 1833, there were 12,375 acres under the plough. Very 
great additions have since been made to this amount. Extensive 
inroads are made upon the waste lands every year. In reclaiming 
waste land, it is ploughed and fallowed for one or more years, as 
the soil may require, in order to pulverize it. Then lime is laid 
on the ground at the rate of from thirty to forty bolls, or marl from 
eighty to 100 bolls an acre. The ground having been thus pre- 
pared, is sown with white crop, and afterwards with turnips, oats, 
and grass, each year in succession. A vast extent of waste land 
has been reclaimed under this system. 

Thorough draining is indispensable to the improvement of land 
in the parish of Wick. Furrow-draining has lately been intro- 
duced, but has not yet been extensively practised. The most ad- 
vantageous rotation of crops is the six-shift. This is chiefly followed 
on the larger farms. On these, also, the fields are generally en- 
closed either with ditches, stone walls, or quickset hedges, which, 
in many places, with pains bestowed on them, thrive very well. 

The value of the whole produce from agriculture in 1833 was 
L. 37,120, of which about L. 34,418 were for grain, &amp;c. There 
is no account of the value of the live-stock at any period. 

Of the smaller farmers, the younger and more active follow the 
larger as closely as their limited means will allow : but still it 
must be confessed, that a considerable number lag behind, and, from 
want of skill, capital, or activity, plod on in very nearly the system 
observed by their forefathers. It would appear, indeed, that a very 
great number of the farms are much too small. They do not 
afford employment all the year round to the farmer and his gar- 
rons. He thus is obliged to drive peats into Wick, or at times to 
work at day's-wages to the larger farmers, or at any other kind 
of employment that he can fall in with. Many of them betake 
themselves to the sea in the fishing-season. Their means are 
scanty; their education is therefore often very limited; then- 
houses are bad ; and their children grow up and have their habits 
formed in total ignorance of what, in the southern parts of Scot- 
land, are reckoned necessaries of life ; and this state of matters, 
without any desire of improvement, is thus, in numerous instances, 
perpetuated from father to son. It might, perhaps, ultimately be 
well for the population of this district, if those nuinerous insignifi- 
cant patches of land were laid together, and formed into farms 



WICK. 



151 



of from L.30 to L.IOO of annual ront, taking care tliat there should 
be the greater number at the smaller rent between L.30 and L.60. 
The state of capital and the physical character of the district appa- 
rently point out this as a desirable arrangement. In effectingit, how- 
ever, very much tenderness ought to be shown. All great changes 
ought to be gradual. The violent and extensive ejection of small 
tenants, not having the means of supporting themselves and fami- 
lies till other sources of support are discovered and made available, 
always occasions an amount of suffering, that can neither be com- 
pensated nor atoned for by any consequent agricultural improve- 
ments. 

Leases. — At present, leases are given, varying from fourteen to 
twenty years in duration. If leases are not taken too high, they 
plainly form a great encouragement to the tenant. But they like- 
wise are as evidently beneficial to the landlord. The tenant is 
induced to lay out both capital and labour in improving his farm, 
by which means the landlord's estate is improved. The relation, 
indeed, of landlord and tenant involves many reciprocal advantages, 
obliffations, and duties. The comfort of the landlord and his 
prosperity will be deeply involved in the character, comfort, and 
prosperity of his tenantry. He should, therefore, endeavour to 
store his estates not only with the best cattle, but with the best 
men. It is as much his interest as his duty to promote, both by 
precept and example, Christianity on his estates. This would be 
the parent of all improvement. God has placed the heritors of 
Scotland in most responsible situations. A Christian landlord is 
an unspeakable blessing to all under his influence, and, next to an 
unchristian minister, an unchristian heritorship is about the great- 
est curse that can befall a parish. 

Fisheries. — There is a small salmon-fishery in the Bay and 
River of Wick. Probably about 150 men are engaged all the 
year round in the white-fishery, on the coasts of the parish. 

This, however, is of very trifling importance indeed, in compari- 
son of the herring-fishery, which is carried on to a great extent in 
this district. From time immemorial vast shoals of herrings have 
frequented the coast. They were, however, in ancient days, almost 
completely neglected. For nearly 200 years the people contented 
themselves with catching a few fish on rude iron hooks, and proceed- 
ing with that excellent bait to the cod-fishing. About the beginning 
of the eighteenth century, nets began to be used. Some lime after- 
wards, the attention of Government was directed to the fishery, and 



152 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



bounties were offered for its encouragement. In 1767, John Suth- 
erland of Wester, John Anderson of Wick, and Alexander Mil- 
ler of Slaxigoe, fitted out two sloops on the bounty, which, how- 
ever, by some informality, they lost. Next year, they fitted out one 
sloop again, fished successfully, and, though with some difficulty, 
recovered the bounty. This adventure not having been very en- 
couraging, their ardour abated for some years ; but the place of 
rendezvous having been at last altered, the herring-fishery there- 
after annually increased. Adventurers came from Aberdeen, and 
from the Orkneys, and established the fishing at Staxigoe, and 
took leases of 99 years' duration, for the purpose of building stores 
and houses for the curing of red-herring. Those enterprising fish- 
curers employed boats and crews from Avoch and the neighbouring 
towns, on the southern side of the Moray Frith ; but these fisher- 
men never went farther from the shore in search of fish than a 
mile or two, when, if they did not find any, they concluded that 
none were on the coast. In 1786, the British Society for extend- 
ing the Fisheries, and improving the sea-coasts of the Kingdom, 
was incorporated by Act of Parliament. This incorporation great- 
ly promoted the fishery. A great number of boats and crews from 
the Frith of Forth began to come northwards to the fishing, and 
the crews, being more adventurous, sought for the fish at the dis- 
tance of ten or twelve miles from the shore, with most encourag- 
ing success. In 1782, 363 barrels of white herring were export- 
ed. In 1790, there were at Wick 32 boats, measuring 1610 tons, 
on the bounty.. That year, there were 10,514 barrels of white, 
and above 2000 of red-herrings exported, besides about 700, es- 
timated to have been consumed in the county. In 1808, the British 
Fishing Society, incorporated, as has been mentioned, in 1786j 
commenced their establishment of Pulteneytown, by making a 
harbour for the accommodation of boats and shipping, and by 
granting feus in perpetuity for building on liberal terms. In 1809, 
.commissioners were appointed by Act of Parliament, for the pur- 
pose of promoting and regulating this branch of national industry. 

Under improved methods of curing, introduced by the commis- 
sioners, and an additional bounty granted by Parliament in 1815, 
the fishery increased so rapidly, that, in 1824, the British Fishery 
Society commenced the construction of an outer harbour, which, 
having been fini.shed, rendered the port both safe and commodious. 
This measure consolidated the prosperity of the Wick herring- 



WICK. 



153 



fishery. It now could afford to lose the Parliamentary bounties, 
which, in 1 830, were withdrawn. 

The shoals of herrings appear on the coast about the middle 
of July, when the fishing- is immediately begun. It is continued 
for eight or ten weeks. The fishing stations within the parish 
are at Keiss, Staxigoe, Broadhaven, Wick, and Sarclet. The 
average annual number of boats employed for the last ten years is 
about 900 ; and the average annual quantity of fish taken for the 
last twenty years is 88,.'j00 barrels. The price of a boat with its 
fleet of nets and everything complete, is from L.140 to L.150 
Sterling. Each boat on an average generally fishes from 100 to 
150 crans, at a price of from 10s. to l'2s. per cran. A barrel of 
cured herrings costs L.l.

The herring-fishery has in a very rapid manner increased the 
population, and augmented the rental of the parish, and the pe- 
cuniary resources of many of the parishioners ; but whether it has 
added to the happiness and comfort of the people at large, may 
well be questioned. If it has increased the wealth, it has also 
increased the wickedness of the district ; and any one acquaint- 
ed with the sources of happiness well knows that " a man's 
life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he pos- 
sesseth." Very great care was taken to promote the numbers 
and success of the fishers of herrings, but little or no care to pro- 
mote either the number or success of the fishers of men. The 



CAITIINESS-SIIIRF.. 



result which invariably follows such conduct has ensued. The 
lopulation rapidlj- increased; rents, wages, and prices rose; build- 
ings were erected, and all things seemed prosperous. But there 
was a worm in this blossom of happiness. The means of grace 
and of pastoral superintendence were not extended. Multitudes 
escaped altogether beyond their blissful influence. No care was 
taken of the 10,000 young strangers of both sexes who were 
crowded together with the inhabitants within the narrow limits of 
Wick during the six principal weeks of the fishing, exposed to 
drink and numerous other temptations. The consequences have 
been such, as any one acquainted with the propensities of fallen 
humanity might easily have foreseen ; and results have verified 
the declaration of the prophet, that " the ungodly who earneth 
wages, earneth wages to put them into a bag full of holes." A 
people cannot be exalted without righteousness, and with right- 
eousness they cannot be degraded ; but morality cannot be com- 
municated nor upheld without the full and abundant administra- 
tion of the Gospel. When will legislators, heritors, and merchants 
be convinced of this  

Manufactures. — There are in Wick and Pulteneytown four 
rope-works, which employ, besides the masters, 75 men, with 
occasional hands. The first of these commenced in 1820. All 
the rope which they produce is consumed in this port. There is 
one distillery and brewery, which employs 12 men ; one meal and 
barley-mill, which employs 5 ; four saw-mills, three of which are 
driven by steam and one by water, employ 26 hands. A manu- 
factory of pavement for exportation employs from 60 to 80 work- 
men. There is a ship-building yard, commenced in 1815, with 
always one or two vessels on the stocks, employing about 50 ship- 
wrights. Twelve boat-building yards employ from 70 to 80, who 
launch from 80 to 100 boats annually. There has lately been 
established in Pulteneytown an iron-foundery, which gives em- 
ployment to from 6 to 8 men, and promises to be prosperous. 
A Gas Company was" formed in 1840, whose works are in the 
course of being erected ; and it is to be hoped, that, by another 
winter, both Wick and Pulteneytown will be lighted with gas. 
There are 265 coopers in the parish. The principal, almost, in- 
deed, the sole occupation of females in and about the towns, is the 
spinning of yarn and making it into nets for the herring-fishing. 
At this they can earn the miserable pittance of only 2yd. or 3d. 
a day. 



WICK.

Naviyation. — A little trade has been carried on from the port 
of Wick from very early times. In 1588, Alexander Earl of 
Sutherland burnt the town of Wick, and spoiled the ship and 
plundered the goods of Andrew Wardlaw, a merchant. 

In 1840, twenty-one ships were registered at the port of Wick, 
amounting to 1154 tons. The tonnage of the ships which have 
entered this port for the last twenty years may have been about 
30,000 tons annually ; and the yearly number of sailors about 
3000. 

A steam-boat began to run from Wick to Leith in 1833, once 
a fortnight. The Sovereign steam-boat of 200 horse-power, which 
commences for the season in March, and is laid up in November, 
makes a voyage, once a week, between Lerwick, Kirkwall, Wick, 
Aberdeen and Leith. It carries passengers, stock, and goods ; 
and has been of the greatest advantage, not to Wick only, but to 
Caithness, Orkney, and Shetland. Two smacks ply, each once 
a fortnioht, between and Leith. There is at Wick a Chamber of 
Commerce. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — Wick is the market-town of this parish. It is 
a place of great antiquity ; and was at the request of the Earl of 
Caithness, of whose earldom it formed a part, erected into a royal 
burgh on the 25th of September 1589. The superiority of it has 
been bought and sold by the Sinclairs of Caithness, the Glenor- 
chys, the Sinclairs of Ulbster, and the Sutherlands ; but the Re- 
form Bill has reduced this once potential privilege to feebleness. 
It is, therefore, now little valued. The set of the burgh con- 
sists of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and 
seven councillors. There are no corporations or crafts in this 
burgh. At Michaelmas 1755, the number of burgesses amount- 
ed to 53; at the same term in 1801, to 29; and in 1832, when 
the roll was last made up, to 66. About 15 have since been ad- 
ded. The dues payable on the admission of a burgess amount to 
L.4, 4s. 

In 1660, the customs were let at L,53 Scots; in 1686, at 
L.63, 10s. The ordinary revenue for 1840, was, 

Rent of customs, ... 1.30 l 0

CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



This may be considered as a fair average of the ordinary burghal 
revenues of Wick, for several years by-past. The expenditure is 
about L.70 a year. There is no debt. 

The records begin, " In the name of the Father, the Sone, and 
the Holy Ghoste. At the burgh of Weick, the sext day of 
Januarii, 1660 yeares." They are not voluminous, and are oc- 
cupied with ordinary burghal business. 

In 1840, the population of Wick was, 

Males, 561 ; Females, 693; Total, 1254. 
The number of families was 300. 

There is no police. 

The land-tax of the royal burgh, recoverable from feuars and 
traders, is L.ll, 14s. The rental amounts to L.2600. 

The church and parish school, the town and county buildings, 
and the jail, are within the royal burgh. 

The trade of Wick consists in the export of herring, and of live- 
stock and grain, and of the import of such articles as the wants of 
the district require. 

Wick is the county town. The sheriff has held his ordinary 
court here since 1828, when the Court of Session decided in fa- 
vour of Wick, in the process of removal of the court from Thurso, 
where they had previously been held from time immemorial. 
The Custom-house establishment has also been removed hither 
from Thurso. The customs in 1839 amounted to L.2083. A 
weekly market, well frequented, is held in Wick on Friday. 

Parliamentary Burgh. — The royal burgh of Wick, from the 
date of its erection to the Union, sent a commissioner to the Scot- 
tish Parliament. At the Union, it was associated with Kirkwall, 
Dornock, Tain, and Dingwall, in the return of one member to 
the British House of Commons. By the Reform Act, Cromarty 
was united to this batch, the bounds of Wick as a Parliamen- 
tary burgh were enlarged, and it was constituted the returning 
burgh. 

The village of Louisburgh, built on leases of 99 years, from 
Lord DulTus, lies contiguously to the royal burgh of Wick, on the 
northern side ; and that of Pulteneytown, commenced in 1808, by 
the British Fishery Society, is separated from the latter on the 
south by the bay, and united to it by a bridge of three arches, 
over the River of Wick. Wick, Louisburgh, and Pulteneytown, 
with the manse and lower glebe, Bankhead, and a few more other 
places included within the boundary, compose t-he Parliamentary

and upwards in the Parliamentary burgh is 181 ; of L.IO house- 
holders, 233 ; and of voters, 257, of whom 88 are enrolled on pre- 
mises within the royal burgh. The rental of the Parliamentary 
burgh is L. 4770.

Villages. — The village of Broad Haven, which is a fishing station 
with 170 inhabitants, is about a mile along the northern shore 
from Wick, A mile farther on, is that of Sta.\igoe, not far from 
Castle Girnigoe, containing 261 inhabitants. It is a place of 
some antiquity. Two store-houses of the Earls of Caithness, built 
250 years ago, are still standing there and in good order. They 
contain 4 meal-girnels, each girnel capable of holding 1000 boils 
of meal; and 4 lofts, each capable of containing 1000 bolls of bear. 
These were necessary when rents were paid in kind. Stasigoe is 
another fishing station, with a tolerably good natural harbour for 
boats. The village of Sarclet, on the estate of Thrumster, lies 
about five miles to the south of Wick. It is situated on the top 
of a small bank overhanging a small cove, which, at considerable 
expense, has been converted into a pretty good harbour for fish- 
ing-boats. 

Means of Communication. — Wick is a post-town. In 1829 the 
revenue of the post-office amounted to L.1200 a-year. A daily 
mail-coach from Thurso passes through the town to the south 
in the morning, and another from the south through the town to 
Thurso at night. The mail-coach commenced to run on the 
15th of July 1819. A daily post-gig runs between Wick and 
Huna, from which latter place the letters for Orkney are dis- 
patched twice a-week. A steam-boat of 200 horse-power plies 
once a-week, from March till November, between Lerwick, Kirk- 
wall, Wick, Aberdeen, and Lcith. 

The Huna road, entering the parish from the north at Nybster, 



158 



CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 



passes tliroiigh Keiss, aiu'i close to the lower end of the Loch of 
Wester, near which it is joined by the new line from Bower. 
Crossing the Water of Wester by a bridge of two arches, this 
road joins the one from Castleton, at a short distance to the west of 
the House of Keiss. Its length within the parish is seven miles, and 
that of the new Bower road nearly four; the road from Castleton, in 
the parish of Olrig, enters the parish of Wick at Kirk, and, cross- 
ing the Moss of Kilminister, where there are two or three trifling 
bridges, continues in a pretty straight line till it approaches the 
town, where it bends to the south, and, passing the manse and the 
church, joins the main.-street of Wick, at a distance from Kirk of 
eio-ht miles. Before it reaches the manse, it is joined from the west 
by the road from Wattin through Sibster-Wick. This road mea- 
sures seven miles, and is not yet completed through the townland of 
Winless. From the Castleton road a branch is sent through 
Louisburgh along the coast by Papigoe and Broad Haven to 
Staxigoe, a distance of about two miles. The Parliamentary 
road from Thurso enters the parish of Wick three-quarters of a 
mile to the west of Bilbster House, and runs in a tolerably straight 
line down the south side of the River of Wick, till it joins the south 
road at Rosebank, a distance of six miles and a half. The south 
road, on passing from the town, crosses the river of Wick on a 
plain stone bridge of three arches, which cost L.1700, and runs 
in a winding direction through the estates of Herapriggs, Thrum- 
ster, and Ulbster, till it leaves the parish at the Mission House of 
Bruan, a distance of about eight miles. A new county road leaves the 
north Parliamentary road at Stirkoke, and, passing through Tan- 
nach, joins the south Parliamentary road at Thrumster, a distance 
of about four miles and a half. A road runs from the south Parlia- 
mentary road to Sarclet, a distance of about two miles. All these 
roads are of the very best description. The whole extent of road 
in the parish is very nearly fifty miles, of which the Parliamentiry 
line measures fourteen. 

Harbours.— The harbourets of Sarclet, Broad Haven, and 
Staxigoe, have already been mentioned. A small harbour has 
been made at Keiss. The only harbour originally on the coast of 
this parish, was the mouth of the River of Wick, into which the 
M'Farlan MS. says, that vessels of between thirty and forty lasts 
burden could enter. In 1810, the British Fishery .Society com- 
pleted a harbour in the Bay of Wick, at an expense of L. 14,000, 
of which L.8500 were defrayed by Government, capable of con- 

4 



WICK. 



159 



mining 100 decked vessels. From the great increase of trade 
consequent on the prosperity of the herring-fishery, this harbour 
soon became quite inadequate, and a new one was planned, and 
in 1831 completed, at an e.xpense of L. 40,000. It is unhappily 
exposed to the swell of the sea, which rolls in from the mouth of 
the bay. 

The best place, it is said, for a harbour on the eastern coast of 
Caithness, is at Sinclair's Bay, which is a part of the Bay of 
Keiss between Ackergill and Castle Girnigoe. 

Ecclesiastical State. — We learn from Tertullian that, before his 
time, Christianity was planted in parts of Britain which had been 
inaccessible to the Roman arms. There is good reason for be- 
lieving that, before this period, the Romans had a settlement to the 
north of the Grampians, of which Pteroton, hodiernally Inverness, 
was the capital. The Christian churches to which Tertullian alludes 
were collected from among the Celtic tribes, who seem to have 
occupied, in these ancient days, the whole of modern Scotland, up 
to the Pentland Frith. Their ministers were styled Culdees, fr.om 
Cuildich, chuellers in remote or sequestered places : and it was al- 
ways asserted by them, that their church had been planted by the 
immediate disciples of the Apostle John. The Pechts, who had 
invaded and subjugated the Celts, were heathens. The seat of 
their king was near Inverness, and their kingdom stretched north- 
wards to the Pentland Frith. In 566, the Pechtish sovereign, 
Brudy II. was converted and baptized by Colum, Abbot or Presi- 
dent of the Presbyterian College of lona. At the Pechtish court 
Colum met an Orcadian prince, to whose protection, at the 
Culdee's request, Brudy recommended certain missionaries in 
Orkney. Presbyterian ministers, or Culdees from lona, styled 
also I-colum-killi, the Island of Colum of the Cells, in allusion 
to the numerous churches which he planted, and from others 
of their colleges, were speedily settled over all the west and north 
of Scotland. The places of their residence are generally denot- 
ed by the prefix kil, which evidently signified a Culdean church ; 
as Kilmarnock, Kildonan, &amp;c. One of them had probably his re- 
.sidence within the parish of Wick, at a place called Kilminister, 
which, in pronunciation, is often shortened into Kilminster, Kiiim- 
ster, and Kilmster. In the very middle of the Moss of Kilminister 
are the ruins of a building, called unto this day the Kirk o' Moss. A 
causeway, the traces of which are yet distinctly visible, led through 
the deep and otherwise impassable bog to this ancient place of

worship, which stood on a little knoll. This situation correspond- 
ed exactly with the predilection of the Culdees, who loved, in those 
ferocious times, remote and sequestered residences, whence, ui- 
deed, they had their distinctive appellation. 

Presbyterianism, derived from the scriptures and Apostolic days, 
continued for ages the form of ecclesiastical government in the 
Scottish Church, unmixed with Prelacy till 909, when Constantine 
the Third appointed Kellach bishop of St Andrews. At this pe- 
riod, the Norwegians established themselves in Caithness, and pa- 
tronized the heathen deities. About 100 years afterwards, how- 
ever, the Scandinavian idolatry gave place to the Romish ; the 
Norsemen of Caithness and Orkney having been converted by 
certain papal ecclesiastics, backed by the sword of Olaf King of 
Norway. Malcolm Canmore, who began to reign m 1066, found- 
ed the prelature of Caithness, comprehending Caithness and Su- 
therland, and made Dar, one of his favourites, the prelate. Po- 
pery flourished apace within the diocese. Besides the Kirk of 
Wick, there were within the bounds of the parish, the Kirk of 
Ulbster, dedicated to St Martin; the Kirk of Thrumster ; the Kirk 
of Plauster, dedicated to St Cuthbert ; the Kirk of St Ninian, at the 
Head of Wick ; St Mary's Kirk at Sibster ; the Kirk of St Tears, 
dedicated to the Holy Innocents, near Ackergill; the Kirk of 
Moss, latterly dedicated to St Duthoc ; the Kirk of Keiss ; and 
the Kirk of Strubster. The Kirk of Ulbster is yet entire, and 
has been converted into a family tomb. Several of the burial- 
places attached to the other kirks are yet in use. Around the 
ruins of the Kirk of Moss, there are about twelve acres, said to 
have been under tillage so late as 1689. 

In Caithness, the progress of the Reformation was very slow. 
Only Wick and Thurso had ministers in 1567 ; the rest of the pa- 
rishes of the county were supplied by readers and exhorters. In 
1576, Dunnet, Halkirk, and Wick had each a mmister and a 
reader. The other parishes appear to have been entirely desti- 
tute of teachers. Wick, apparently, was visited soon afterwards 
with a long vacancy. The people, in these circumstances, con- 
tinued attached to popish su]3erstition. They were accustomed to 
visit the chapels with which the parish abounded, and pay then- 
devotions to the stone images of their tutelary saints and saintesses. 
Dr Richard Mercheston, minister of Bower in 1613, exerted him- 
self to suppress this atrocious and debasing sin, and procured the 
demolition of the stone images. On his return homewards, he was 
drowned by the blind and infuriated idolaters. It was given out,

however, that it was the saints who did it ; and that a lapideous 
saintess, whom he had cast down and broken to pieces, the day be- 
fore, was seen a-top of him in the water. 

The minister, however, and kirk-session were anxious to put an 
end to such humiliating superstitions, and the sessional records 
bear evidence of their zeal. But, notwithstanding all their exer- 
tions, hagiolatry still lurked in the parish of Wick. Within the 
memory of persons yet living, it was customary for people to visit 
the Chapel of St Tears on Innocents' day, and leave in it bread 
and cheese, as an offering to the souls of the children slain by 
Herod : but which the dog-keeper of a neighbouring gentleman 
used to take out and give to the hounds. Till within a few years, 
it was customary for all the inhabitants of Mirelandorn to visit 
the Kirk of Moss every Christmas before sunrise, placing on a 
stone, bread and cheese and a silver coin, which, as they alleged, 
disappeared in some mysterious way. There are still several holy 
lochs, especially one at Dunnet, to which people go from Wick, 
and, indeed, from all parts of Caithness, to be cured of their dis- 
eases. They cast a enny into the water, walk or are carried 
withershins around the loch, and return home. If they recover, 
their cure is ascribed to the mystic virtues of the Halie Loch ; 
and if they do not, their want of faith gets all the blame. 

The Kirk of Wick was in Popish 'times dedicated to St Fergus. 
It probably stood before the Reformation at Mount Hellie, or 
Halie, near the eastern end of the town. We have no account 
of the erection of the edifice in the present church-yard, of which 
the Sinclair Aisle and Dunbar Tomb are the only remnants ; but 
it must have been built before 1576. It was repaired in 1728, 
and again in 1752. A new church was erected at the close of 
the last century. This was found, soon after it was finished, to 
be very insecure. A new one became indispensable, which, after 
various delays, having been commenced, was at length finished in 
1830, at an expense of L.4780, 13s. lOd.

Parish Church. — Standing at the west end of the burgh, the 
parish church is very conveniently situated for the great body of 
the parishioners. Excellent roads lead towards it in all directions. 
It is nine miles from Nybster, on the north ; seven from Bruan, 
on the south ; seven and a-half from Mirelandorn, on the west; 
and about a mile from the Moray Frith, on the cast. It is not 
inconveniently situated for the great bulk of the parishioners; but

those of Mirelandorn, Wiiiless, and Bilbster, amounting to 369 
souls, while about seven miles from the church of "Wick, are 
within two miles of that of Wattin. This mal-arrangement ought 
to be remedied. 

Allowing eighteen inches to a sitting, the church will contain 
1981 sitters. It is seated, however, to contain only 1835. All 
the seats are said to be free. The church is well attended. 

Though much too large for the comfort either of the' minister 
or of the congregation, the church of Wick does not afford nearly 
sufficient accommodation for the population of the parish. This 
deficiency is in part supplied by the mission of Bruan, and the 
quoad sacra parish of Keiss. 

Mission of Bruan. — At first, this mission comprehended Ber- 
ridale and Bruan, at which places divine worship was celebrated 
alternately. Since a parliamentary church was erected at the foiv- 
mer place in 1826, the labours of the missionary have been con- 
fined to Bruan. 

The mission-house is situated in the parish of Wick, but just 
within the boundary which divides it from the parish of Latheron. 
The principal part of it was built in 1798, to which an aisle was 
subsequently added. It is a very plain thatched building, capable 
of accommodating 585 sitters. The manse, on which is a debt 
of L.50, and glebe of four acres, are within the parish of Latheron. 
The ground was generously given by the family of Ulbster. The 
missionary district comprehends the extremity of the parish of 
Latheron in the southern extremity of the parish of Wick. " In 
1840, the population of the Latheron portion was 770 ; that of 
the Wick portion as follows : —

Independents, 10 14 24 

Total.liT 542 1028 

Almost all the inhabitants engage in fishing. 

The endowments of the mission consist of the manse and glebe, 
and L.25 Sterling annually, given by the Society in Scotland for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge. Seat-rents make up the mis- 
sionary's stipend to nearly L.lOO a-year. But the district is very 
poor, and this latter source of income varies considerably. An 
additional endowment, even of L.50 a-year, would be an unspeak- 
able blessing to this important mission.

Parish of Keiss, quoad sacra. — The quoad sacra parish of Keiss 
was erected 1833, by authority of the General Assembly of the 
Church of Scotland. It is composed of the northern extremity of 
Wick and of the southern extremity of Canisbay. The boundaries 
have not yet been settled. It is understood, however, that the 
portion which belongs to Wick is bounded on the north and north- 
east by Canisbay ; on the north-west by Bower ; on the south by 
the southern ridge of the valley of Wester ; on the east by the 
sea. The Wick portion is five miles in length, and three miles 
and a-half in average breadth. 

The church and manse were built by Government in 1827, at 
a cost of L. 1500. They are situated on a rising ground at the 
northern side of the bay of Keiss. Fronting the west, they com- 
mand an extensive view of the surrounding country. On the op- 
posite side of Keiss-bay, to the left, are seen the gloomy ruins of 
castles Sinclair and Girnigoe, with the bold and rugged promon- 
tory of Noss-Head. The view is bounded in the distance, by the 
mighty hills which separate Caithness from Sutherland, called 
Morven, Skerubin, and Maiden-Paps. 

The population of that part of the parish of Keiss which is si- 
tuated within the civil parish of Canisbay is about 200 souls. The 
part within the civil parish of Wick contains, of males, 362 ; fe- 
males, 447 ; total, 809 ; of these, 2 are Original Seceders, 12 Ana- 
baptists, ] is a Reformed Presbyterian, and 1 a Methodist. 

The church of Keiss, which is situated within the civil parish of 
Wick, is capable of holding about 350 sitters. Were galleries 
erected, it would accommodate 200 more. There is an endow- 
ment of L.120 granted by Government. No glebe is attached to 
the livinsf. 

There is a register of births and marriages kept by the; session- 
clerk, which commenced after the passing of an act of the Gene- 
ral Assembly in 1833, constituting the Government churches pa- 
rishes quoad sacra.

Ministers of Keiss— 1827, Thomas Jolly, now minister of 
Bowden ; 1829, Thomas Gun, present incumbent. 

New Church at Pulteneytown. — It is proposed still farther to 
increase church-accommodation for the parish of Wick, by the 
building of an Extension church in Pulteneytown, capable of ac- 
commodating 950 persons. Subscriptions amounting to L. 662, 
13s. 6d. have been obtained for this most desirable object. The 
foundation stone was laid on March 17, 1841. 

Missionary. — The Rev. David Mitchell has laboured assidu- 
ously, as missionary under the Church of Scotland in Pulteney- 
town, for about two years. He is supported by subscriptions. 

Notwithstanding the accommodation provided at Keiss and Bru- 
an, and that which is proposed to be provided at Pulteneytown, the 
parish church of Wick, though large, is altogether insufficient for 
the population. After deducting the 809 included in the parish 
of Keiss, and the 1028 within the mission of Bruan, there are at 
present within the parish of Wick, quoad sacra, 1842 households, 
comprising, of males, 3482 ; of females, 4032 ; total 7514. Tak- 
ing the number of those who ought to have church-accommoda- 
tion at the proportion of 55 to the 100, there , ought to be 
church -accommodation for 4132; but the parish church can ac- 
commodate only 1835; thus leaving unaccommodated 2297 : Or 
if Pulteneytown ultimately shall be erected into a parish, then there 
will remain a population in the parish of Wick quoad sacra of 
6505 souls. Of these there ought to be accommodated 3577 ; but 
the church accommodates only 1835, leaving unaccommodated 
1742 : Or, making a liberal allowance for Dissenters of all de- 
scriptions, and stating their numbers at 2100, which will reduce 
the number of churchmen to 5414, of whom there ought to be 
accommodated 2977; but the church accommodates only 1835; 
thus leaving without accommodation 1142 souls. 

But the great deficiency lies in pastoral superintendence. It 
' is altogether impossible for one single minister to superintend ef- 
fectively 7514 persons, or, making allowance for Dissenters, 
5414. This will appear still more evident, when the prodigious 
influx of strangers, amounting to near 10,000, during the fishing 
season, is taken into consideration. There is not a parish in 
all broad Scotland, whence issues a more urgent call for help. 
We are numerous and we are poor; and, from the fisheries 
and other causes, are exposed to many and .great temptations,

which nothing bnt the full, unfettered, and frequent ministrations 
of the glorious Gospel of the grace of God, carried home on the 
heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, can effectively counteract. 

On December 6, 1840, the number of persons on the Commu- 
nion. Roll was, of males, 132 ; of females, 355 ; total, 487. The 
Lord's Supper is dispensed twice a-year in this parish ; and the 
dispensation of it is attended by immense crowds of people from 
the neighbouring parishes. It is, indeed, a high solemnity. 

Manse. — In 1702, the manse was not habitable. In 1709, it 
was a heap of rubbish. In 1710, a house in the burgh was bought 
for a manse. In 1728, a manse was ordered to be built on the 
site of the original one, near the church-yard. The present manse, 
which stands in the glebe, a little to the west of the town, was 
erected in 1786. It is a plain but substantial building, and is 
capable, with some repairs, of being made a very comfortable re- 
sidence. The office-houses, which are thatched, are ruinous. 
It is expected that they will speedily be rebuilt. 

Glebe.— The glebe consists of two parts; the lower, of about 
9 acres, in which the manse stands, and the upper, a mile to the 
west, on the north side of the River of Wick, about 30 acres. 
In 1836, the glebe was valued by the Commissioners of Religious 
Instruction at L. 50 a-year. 

Stipend.— In 1792, the stipend was L. 97, 13s. 4d. ; in 1810, 
it was L. 50, and 160 bolls of victual. At present it consists of 
17 chalders, half oatmeal, half bear, payable at the fiar prices, 
and L. 1 0 of money. 

Teinds. — The teinds of this parish belong to the Crown. In 
1836, the value of the unappropriated teind was L. 340, 9s. 4d. 

Ministers of Wick since the Reformation. — Andro Philp, be- 
fore 1567; Thomas Keir, before 1576; Alexander Merns, 
Reader at Wick ; Thomas Pruntoch ; John Annand, before 
16.36; 16.38, David Allardice ; 1638, John Smart, ejected in 
1650, and afterwards minister of Dunnet ; 1659, William Ged- 
des, ejected in 1675; 1676, Patrick Clunis, died in 1691 ; 1692, 
William Geddes, restored; 1701, Charles Keith, died in 1705; 
•1707, James Oliphant, died in 1726; 1727, James Ferme, died 
in 1760; 1762, James Scobie, died in 1764; 1765, William 
Sutherland, died in 1816; 1813, Robert Phin, died in 1840; 
1840, Charles Thomson, the present incumbent. 

United Associate Sccedcrs. — The congregation of these Dis- 
senters was established in 1770. On the 21st of September 1836, 
according to their minister, the Rev. William Stewart, it amounted 



1G6 



OAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



to 1000, of whom 810 were resident within the parish of Wick 
quoad sacra. According to the Rev, Robert Phin, minister of 
Wick, their numbers within the parish amounted at that date to 
700. 

The chapel, which stands in Pulteneytown, was built in 1815, 
and a manse in 1825. There was, in 1836, a debt of L. 130 on 
the property. Allowing sixteen inches to the sitting, the chapel 
will contain 658 sitters. In 1836, the number of communicants 
was upwards of 200. The minister's stipend is L. 100 a-year, 
derived from seat- rents and collections, with a house and about 
half an acre of ground. 

Independents. — This congregation was established in 1790, in 
which year the chapel, which stands near Wick, was built. At six- 
teen inches each sitting, the chapel will hold 666 sitters. In 1836, 
there was a debt of L. 1 10 affecting the property. On the 21st of 
September 1836, the number of Independents resident in Wick 
quoad sacra was, according to the Rev. John Wiseman, then 
minister, at least 1000 ; according to the Rev. Robert Phin, 
minister of Wick, the number was 620. According to Mr Wise- 
man, the communicants were 129 ; according to Mr Phin, they 
were about 100. 

Anabaptists. — The congregation was established in 1808. In 
1836, the parishioners in the habit of attending were about 90: 
the number of communicants was then 29. They have no minister. 

Separatists. — The congregation was established in 1824. In 
1836 their number amounted to 28; and the number of commu- 
nicants to 13. They have neither chapel nor minister. 

Papists.— congregation was established in 1832. It does 
not exist but in the fishing-season. A chapel, capable of holduig, 
at eighteen inches a sitting, 306 sitters, was built, in 1836, in Pul- 
teneytown. It is closed, and there is no priest, except during the 
fishing-season,— when a priest comes, the chapel is opened, and 
service is performed for those of the Romish persuasion, who, 
during that period, come to Wick from Ireland and the Pligh- 
lands. 

Original Seceders.— We congregation was established in 1835. 
In 1836, from 60 to 80 persons were in the habit of attending 
worship. They have neither chapel nor minister. 

Reformed Preshytcrians.—T\m congregation was established 
in 183i. The numbers in the parish amount to about 200; the 
communicants to 45. Their chapel in Pulteneytown was built 



WICK, 



167 



in 1839. It is capable of holding, on the ground-lloor, about 
380 sitters. The galleries are not yet erected. They have 
no minister. 

Wesleijan Methodists.— This congregation was established in 
1837. Their numbers are not great. 

Education.— It was a favourite maxim with the Scottish Reform- 
ers, that there should be throughout the land a kirk and a minister 
for every 1000 inhabitants, and a school beside every kirk. The 
nobles and gentry, however, voted this a pious imagination, pil- 
laged the church," expended the plunder on their own pleasures, 
and left the poor to perish for lack of knowledge. But the mi- 
nisters of the Scottish church were Christians. They were not to 
be daunted by the hostility both of the land-owners and of the go- 
vernment, and by their unceasing exertions and untiring perse- 
verance, schools as well as churches were gradually planted and 
endowed in all the parishes, of Scotland. 

Caithness, however, was long behind the rest of the country. 
In 1567, only Wick and Thurso had ministers ; the rest of the 
parishes were supplied with readers or exhorters. In 157i, Dun- 
net, Halkirk, and Wick had each a minister and a reader. The 
other parishes appear to have been altogether vacant. The dis- 
turbances and distresses caused in the seventeenth century by the 
Episcopalian intruders and persecutors, threw the country back 
into the Popish darkness and disorder out of which it had been 
rapidly emerging. In 1697, when the Presbytery of Caithness 
was, after the Persecution, reconstituted by the Commission of the 
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, only Thurso, Dun- 
net, and Reay had ministers of the Presbyterian Church. Most of 
the parishes were vacant, amongst which was Wick. In one or two, 
there were Episcopalian incumbents, a sample of the men who 
had been intruded in the times of Episcopacy, scandalous in their 
lives, and opposed, or at least indifferent to the promotion of 
either the religion or education of the people. The people were, 
in consequence, ill-educated. In 1701, when a call by the parish 
of Wick was moderated in to Charles Keith, the second minister 
of this parish after the Persecution, it is stated by the records of 
the session, that the call " was unanimously subscrived by the heri- 
tors and elders present, and consented to by a greater number who 
could not subscrive." 

The Presbytery were incessant and unwearied in their endea- 
vours to remedy this enormous evil, by the planting of schools ; 



168 



CAITHNESS-SHIRE. 



but their benevolent exertions were counteracted by the culpable 
opposition of the heritors. These Christian men, however, though 
discouraged, were not in despair. They persevered, and in 1706 
Wick and Thurso were legally provided with schools. In the 
course of the next twenty years, the legal accommodations had 
been obtained for Canisbay, Dunnet, Wattin, and Bower. The 
remaining parishes were not provided for a long time afterwards ; 
and even so late as 177"2, Reay was without a statutory school. 
The Presbytery, while they continued to urge upon the heritors 
the fulfilment of their duty, did not rest satisfied with shuffling and 
idle excuses, but did what in them lay to secure for their people 
the blessings of education, by inviting into their parishes qualified 
teachers, and affording them every encouragement, by bestowing on 
them the office and emoluments of session-clerk, and by constant- 
ly urging on the people the necessity of contributing to their sup- 
port: nor did they desist till they had procured from the heritors 
a legal salary and accommodation for all the schoolmasters within 
their bounds. In 1759, the parish school of Wick had an income 
of 20 bolls of meal. It has now the maximum endowment. 

But those enlightened and indefatigable Christians vvere not 
content with securing for each parish a statutory school ; in ex- 
tensive parishes, they planted charity schools. Several were es- 
tablished in the parish of Wick as early as 1728. In April 12th 
1763, there is presented to the kirk-session, a list'of several heads 
of families in Ulbster, who, for the purpose of obtaining a school, 
oblige themselves to keep a certain number of scholars at it ; to 
pay regularly their quarterly fees, and what meal they bind them- 
selves for; whereupon the session declare their willingness to give 
what assistance they can to a proper schoolmaster in that place, 
namely, L. 1, 3s. Sterling a-year, to make up for those scholars 
whose parents are unable to pay the quarterly fees. In 1792, five 
chaiity schools were in operation in the parish, but they have long 
ago been altogether discontinued. 

In 1765, the Rev. William Hallawall, who, for several years had 
been employed as an itinerant minister in Caithness, by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge, but had latterly been 
chaplain to the Charity Workhouse of Edinburgh, and overseer 
of the children's education for more than twenty years, having " a 
peculiar regard for the inhabitants of that large and populous pa- 
rish of Wick, where I spent," says he, " a good part of my time 
in my younger years, with great satisfaction," mortified, in the

hands of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, cer- 
tain property, from which L.21 were annually to be paid for en- 
dowing, with L. 7 a-year, a school at Keiss ; another at Noss ; 
and a third at Ulbster. The heritors are to build school-houses 
and uphold them, and the Presbytery of Caithness to judge of the 
qualifications of the teachers. These schools were directed to be 
called " Flallawall's Schools," by which name, however, they do not 
seem ever to have been known in the parish. Each of the schools 
receives from Hallawall's mortification, L.7, 10s. annually, and 
the same sum from the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, which makes up their endowment to L. 15. a-year. A fe- 
male teacher at Ulbster is allowed L. 6 a-year by this society. 
She teaches girls to read and sew. 

Besides these schools, there is one at Thrumster and another 
at Stirkoke on the General Assembly's scheme. The proprietors 
of these estates have built houses, and allow so much land as an 
endowment, and the General Assembly grants L. 25 a-year. 

There are at present 18 unendowed schools in the parish, of 
which 14 are in the town, and 5 in the country. Of these, there 
are two kept by school -mistresses within the quoad sacra parish 
of Keiss, one at Reiss, and another at Janetstown, both of which 
are kept by schoolmasters. Between the school at Reiss, and the 
Society's school at Keiss, the Kirk-session divides, in equal sums, 
L.3 a year, arising from a small mortification. 

Of the 14 unendowed schools in the town, seven are in Wick 
and Louisburgh, and seven in Pulteneytown. Of the seven in Wick, 
one is kept by a master, and six by schoolmistresses. Of the seven 
in Pulteneytown, three are kept by schoolmistresses, and four by 
schoolmasters. 

Besides all these, there is in Pulteneytown the Academy, an ex- 
cellent building, raised at a cost of L. 1700, by the British So- 
ciety for Promoting the Fisheries, who likewise contribute to the 
support of the two teachers.

A Female School of Industry is supported at Stirkoke by Mrs 
Home of Scouthel, where sewing is taught in all its branches. 

The school at Reiss, on which is dependent a large and poor 
district, ought to be endowed ; and a school should be planted m 
the populous district of Hempriggs. 

It is impossible to state the fees in the various unendowed schools. 
It may be said, however, that, in general, they are very low. In 
the Society's schools, the fees for reading are Is. 6d. a quarter. 
In the parish school, the fees per quarter are, for reading, 2s. ; for 
reading and writing, 3s. ; for reading, writing, and arithmetic, 4s. ; 
with addition of geography, 4s. 6d. ; and for all these with the 
classics, 6s. 

A great number of the children are very imperfectly educated. 
Many do not get to school above a quarter or two. Poverty is 
partly the cause of this; but it must be confessed, that there is not 
so deep a conviction of the benefits of education as every Christ- 
ian must desire to see. • u ■ 

Sabbath Sc/iook— Of . these there are, connected with the 
Church of Scotland, one in Wick, attended by about 250 scholars, 
and one in Pulteneytown, attended by about 320; and m the 
country, one at Keiss, one at Staxigoe, one at Reiss, one at Stir- 
koke, one at Thrumster, and one at Ulbster, which are attended by 
about the same number of scholars by which the schools at each ot 
these places are attended during the week. Sabbath schools are 
also kept by several of the Dissenting bodies. 

Literature.— Ki Wick there is a library, containing about 1620 
volumes. It was instituted in March 1826, and is the property of 
the subscribers. 

There are two reading-rooms, one at Pulteneytown, and the 
other at Wick; the former established in 1829, and the latter in 
1 840. Each of them receives about four daily London, and about 
thP same number of provincial newspapers. 

The John o' Groat Journal, published at Wick, commenced .n 
February 1836, and has had a uniform weekly circulation, up to the 



WICK. 



171 



present time, of 800 copies. About one-half of these is circulated 
throughout the four northern counties, and the other throughout 
Britain, and abroad. This Journal advocates what are usually 
called Liberal principles. 

The Northern Star, a fortnightly newspaper, commenced in 
November 1836, and was discontinued in May 1839. It advocat- 
ed what are usually .called Conservative principles. 

About fifteen years ago, the parish was supplied by a flying-sta- 
tioner, who paid periodical visits to Wick. Now, there are two 
booksellers in the place, both of whom have a considerable busi- 
ness. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — The Caithness Agricultural 
Society, which was instituted about fifteen years ago, holds its an- 
nual meeting at Wick. This Society is respectably supported, 
and has been of the greatest advantage to those objects which are 
indicated by its naine. 

There is at Wick a Chamber of Commerce, established about 
five years ago, which has conferred important benefits on the 
trade of the place. 

The Wick and Pulteneytown Total Abstinence Society was in- 
stituted in January 1840. It numbers about 700 members, and 
has been the means, it is reported, of reclaiming to sobriety several 
drunkards. 

Savings' Bank. — A savings' bank was opened at Wick in No- 
vember 1840. It is established for the benefit of Caithness, and 
is the only one in the whole county. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The earliest notice of the poor of 
this parish is in the sessional records, in which it is recorded that, 
on the 22d of September 1701, the poor of the parish were con- 
vened, when seven males and ten females received amongst them 
L.6, 7s. 6d. Scots. In 1752, L.95, 18s. 6d. Scots were distri- 
buted to 34 males and 60 females. 

In 1820, there were on the permanent roll of paupers, 36 males 
and 96 females, in all 132, who received from the sessional funds 
L.62, 14s. : besides this sum, there was distributed in occasional 
relief, the farther sum of L.9, 14s., making in all the sum of 
L.72, 8s. Sterling, distributed to the parochial poor in 1820. 

In 1830, there were 41 males and 124 females, in all 165 per- 
sons, on the permanent roll. The sum distributed in permanent 
relief was L.74, 9s., and 'that in occasional, L.ll, 6s., making to- 
gether the sum of L.85, 15., distributed in 1880. 



172 CAITHNESS-SHIUE. 

In 1840, there were on the permanent roll, 21 males and 76 
females. Among them was distributed in permanent relief, 
L.32, 3s. : the sum of L.21, Os. 31d. was distributed occasional- 
ly ; in all L.53, 3s. 3|d. 

But these statements by no means give a correct view of the 
extent of pauperism in this parish. Many are extremely poor. 
Public begging is common both in town and country. There has 
been put into the hands of the compiler of this report, a list drawn 
up by William Bruce, Esq. provost of Wick, of the poor who go 
round the shops and houses every Saturday " seeking their piece. 
It contains the names of 8 males and 53 females. At the request 
of the compiler, a committee, composed of the heritors, ministers, 
householders, and tenants, examined, in December 1840 into the 
state of pauperism within the parish, and reported that there were 
of persons utterly destitute, —

There is no legal assessment for the poor in this parish. By far 
the largest portion of the funds available for thei"|;«f /" 
collections at the church-door. The interest 0 L 300, which has 
been mortified for the poor, is applied to their rehef ; for which pur- 
pose, also, small donations are occasionally received. 

The poor are by no means clamant in seeking parochial rehef. 
It is still considered as degrading; and there are numerous m- 
slnc of persons suffering great destitution, -therthan ma e 
application for relief; and of individuals in but indigent cu- 
cumstances themselves, taking destitute persons, who have no 
•claTm upon them, into their houses, and supporting them without 
asking or receiving sessional assistance. But it must appear evi- 
dent, on consideration of the preceding particulars, that unless the 
fund of the session are more plentifully supplied, this state of 
things will not continue much longer. These means of relief are, 
at present, altogether inadequate to meet even with the veriest pit- 
t 1 ce he numerous demands made upon them ; and symp oms are 
lea ing, that necessity is more and more overcommg the lavui-

weekly penny which immemorially they have spontaneously bestow- 
ed on each of the numerous poor who go round on the Saturdays 
to collect it. Let this be done, and they are threatening to do it, 
and a compulsory poor-rate, with its innumerable train of econo- 
mic and moral evils, will come on the parish in half-a-year. All 
parties will then find out, but when too late, that it would have 
been their wisdom to have supported, with greater attention and 
liberality, the good old system of the Church of Scotland. No- 
thing can arrest the progress of a country such as this to pauper- 
ism, but evangelical churches, pastoral superintendence, and scrip- 
tural schools. But these in sufficient abundance would, under 
the blessing of God, which is sure to be conferred on the preach- 
ing and teaching of the Truth as it is in Jesns, accomplish this. 

The kirk-session is composed of the minister and six elders, of 
whom one is above eighty years of age, and another is in bad 
health. The elders do what they can for the spiritual and eco- 
nomic good of the people ; but what are they among so many  

Police and Crime, SjX. — The Earls of Caithness enjoyed, from an 
early date, the heritable jurisdiction of Caithness and Sutherland. 
In 1503, James IV. erected Caithness into a separate sheriffdom, 
and appointed Wick as the place where the courts were to be held. 
From this arrangement Caithness was, anciently, sometimes deno- 
minated the county of Wick, or Wickshire. In 1674, the heri- 
table jurisdictions of Caithness were sold by the Earl to John 
Campbell of Glenorchy, who sold them in 1718, by anction, to 
John Sinclair of Ulbster for L.2000 Sterling. When the heritable 
jurisdictions were abolished in 1748, Ulbster claimed L.5000 as 
compensation for the sheriffship, L.3000 as Justiciary, and L.IOOO 
as Constable of Scrabster Castle and bailie of the Bishop's lands. 
The demand was considered extravagant, and he ultimately got 
only L.3000 for the whole. 

Justice in the hands of these heritable sheriffs, in general, failed 
through their weakness, or was perverted by their wickedness. 
But, during the seventeenth and the former part of the eighteenth 
centuries, the courts of the Church, with firmness and impartiality, 
grappled with this exceeding evil, and often accomplished what the 
civil magistrates either could not, or, what is, perhaps, nearer"the 
truth, would not attempt. In 1709, we find the presbytery of 
Caillmess informing Queen Anne, that, in consequence of its dis- 
tance Irom the scat of government, " this county has for a long 
time been a stage on which many atrocious villainies have been 



174 CAITHNESS-SHIKE. 

acted; particularly, many barbarous and inhuman murders and 
assassinations of persons of innocence and integrity." The kirk- 
session of Wick was vigilant and energetic in repressing wicked- 
ness of all kinds. Amongst its elders were generally several ma- 
gistrates, and it exercised a mixture of civil and ecclesiastical 
authority. On August 31, 1701, " the session taking into their 
consideration that there are a great many abuses committed, in and 
about the town of Wick, on the Sabbath day, did and hereby do, 
for the preveriting of which, appoint and ordain that two elders 
do search the town in time of Divine service and after the same, 
and make report of irregular persons to the session." Similar 
appointments are often recorded ; and the most imremitting vigi- 
lance was exercised. In September 1701, two women are charged 
" for gathering pease in time of sermon ;" a man for " beating 
his wife ;" and, John Naughty " for entertaining persons drink- 
ing in time of sermon." The session direct the town of Wick 
" to put up ane cock-stool." " Alexander Larnoch and his wife 
are appointed to stand pubhcly, and to pay 20 shillings Scots for 
the crime of cursing;" and unto John Johnston the session " offer 
the alternative either to find surety to pay 8 punds, or otherwise 
to be liable to corporal punishment." The latter, " afterwards pro- 
duced John Sinclair, joiner, who hereby enacts himself cautioner 
that he shall pay 8 pundsat three terms, namely, 4 merks at Can- 
delmas; 4 merks at Whitsunday ; and 4 mwks at Lammas 1702. 
May 25th, 1702, Donald M'Curchie, shoemaker in Wick, who 
had been guilty both of gross and of contumelious conduct, was 
ordained by the session " to be carried from the kirk of Wick 
to the cross, with a paper-hood bearing the inscription of his 
crime, and to sit there' two hours in the stocks with the hood on 
his head, and thereafter" to give security that he shall pay his 
mulct, and submit to the customary discipline of the church. The 
pernicious and most reprehensible practice of levying " mulcts" 
upon delinquents, by sessional authority, continued till of late 
years. The people came to regard these fines as just the price of 
sin ; and this feeling is not even yet altogether extinct. 

Wick is the county town. The sheriff and other customary 
courts are held here. The sheriff-court was held at Thurso for 
a long period previously to 1828 ; but in that year. Wick, after a 
nrotracted litigation, obtained a decision of the Court of Session, 
declarino- Wick to be the head-burgh of the shire of Caithness, 
and ordaining that the stated sheriff-courts must be held and the

Sheriff-clerk's office kept there. There is a county but not a 
burghal police. 

Crime. — During the year from September 1st 1827 to Sep- 
tember Jst 1828, there were confined within the jail of Wick, 36 
male and 8 female culprits ; and during the same period, ending 
September 1st 1829, there were 21 males and 4 females. 

In the course of the four years subsequent to August 18.S0, the 
number of cases of crime within the county brought to trial, was 
62, of which 65 were tried before the Sheriff, and 7 before the 
circuit-court at Inverness. This was little more than 15 for each 
year, or in the proportion of 1 for every 2297 of the population ; 
while for all Scotland the proportion was 1 in 1130. The crimes 
were, of

several of the cases a number of persons were concerned. 

Prisons. — In 1840, there were committed to Wick jail, 29 men 
and 2 women. The following table will point out a variety of parti- 
culars ; such as the profession, age, aod crime of the culprits. It 
will also show, that the season of the herring-fishery is most pro- 
ductive of crime, and that of a particular kind.

The jail was built in 1828, at an expense of L. 1200, the greater 
part of which was defrayed by the burgh. It is sufficient for the 
county. Attention is paid to the health of the prisoners. It is 
governed according to act of Parliament. The Rev. David Mit- 
chell, Missionary in Pulteneytown, has been appointed chaplain, 
with a salary of L. 20 a-year. 

Pairs. The following fairs are held within this parish ; Skitten 

Market, at Kilminister, on the first Tuesday of March ; Wick 
Market, on the first Tuesday after Palm Sunday ; Fair of Wick 
in June. All these are for cattle. Margaretmas, at Hill of 
Wick, on the Tuesday after the 20th of July, for cattle, and the 
hiring of persons for the harvest ; and Fergusmas, at Wick, in 
the end of November, for cattle. 

Inns and Public- Houses.— Of these there are in Wick and Louis- 
burgh, 22; Pulteneytown, 23; the landward part of the pari.sh, 
9 ; total, 54. 

Instead of this appalling number, every person acquainted with 
the circumstances of the parish must admit, that a dozen were 
more than enough for all the necessities of the district. An ex- 
cess of public-houses is one of the most frightful curses which can 
befall a community. Their effect upon the morals and comfort 

• The frequent use of the lerrainntion mas, in the names of fairs and term d.iys in 
Caithness, shews the deep hold which Popery had taken of the district. Besides 
Marsaretmas and Fergusmas, mentioned above, there arc in the counly Cohnsmas, 
ihn term on the 20th of June ; Petermas, 29th June, O. S. ; Georgenins 1 Jtli July , 
O S • Marvmas, 15th August, O. S. ; I.ukcsmas, first Tuesday 1 October O. S. ; 
Mansmas or Magnusmas, first Tuesday of December, C. S. ; Tustuuas, fourth Tues- 
day of November, O. S. ; and a number more masses.

of the people is most disastrous. Multitudes can trace their ruin 
in hody, soul, and outward estate, to such seminaries of Satan and 
Belial, as the lower public-houses generally are. Those to whom 
it belongs to license such places in the parish of Wick have in- 
curred an awful responsibility. 

Fuel. — The fuel made use of in this parish, is peats and coals. 
The latter are brought from the Wear and Tyne, and cost about 
1 8s. a ton. Peats, which form the greater part of the fuel con- 
sumed by the commonalty, are dug in the mosses of the parish, 
and sold in the town for 2s. a cart. 



The compiler of this report must apologise for its manifold 
imperfections. He became a resident in the parish, to which 
he was previously an utter stranger, only on the 24th of Octo- 
ber last. He was requested in December to draw up the re- 
port, which he would not have attempted could another person 
have been found to undertake it. In the midst of the numerous 
vocations and avocations of a most burdensome charge, he has 
had to search about for information, and arrange and put it to- 
gether at short intervals of ministerial labour. To those who have 
furnished him with materials he desires to tender his grateful ac- 
knowledgements, and more especially to the Right Honourable 
Lord Duffus, and to John Henderson, Esq. Pulteneytown, W. S. 
From the former he received a great deal of curious arfd import- 
ant information respecting the mineralogy, sea-coasts, antiquities, 
and progressive agricultural changes of the parish ; and to the 
latter he stands indebted for the free use of extensive and most ac- 
curate collections made by his learned and godly brother, the late 
Dr Patrick Brodie Henderson, illustrative of the history and sta- 
tistics of Caithness. These valuable collections ought either to 
be published, or lodged in some public library.

Addenda. — About the middle of the tenth century, Arnfin, Ha- 
vard, Liot, Sculy, and Lodvir, sons of Thorfin Earl of Orkney, 
contended on the decease of their father for the sovereignty. Arn- 
fin was assassinated by the contrivance of Regnhilda, his wife, who

married Havard, of whom she hkewise speedily procured the mur- 
der, that she might marry Liot, the third brother, of whom she had 
become enamoured. Sculy determined to dispute his brother's 
authority. To secure success, he made apphcation to Malcolm L 
King of Scotland, who readily agreed to give him assistance, 
hoping by means of him to wrest the northern counties from the 
sovereignty of Norway. He created Sculy Earl of Caithness, 
which was declared a part of the kingdom of Scotland, and sup- 
plied him with ships and troops. 

Liot was in Orkney when his brother reached the coast of 
Caithness, and his absence enabled Sculy to overrun the country. 
He next attacked the islands, but was repulsed, and many of his 
followers slain. He immediately withdrew to Caithness, whi- 
ther he was followed by Liot. Meantime Sculy secured the aid 
of Magbrag, chieftain of Sutherland, and the confederates were 
encamped in an advantageous position in the Bogs of Skitten, {pa- 
ludihus Skidensibus, a name by which the Moss of Kilminster was 
anciently called. Liot advanced against them, and was assaulted 
with vigour. His men stood firm ; and their enemies, after a vain 
attempt to break his line, were seized with a sudden panic and fled. 
The rout. soon became complete, and Sculy was slain in attempt- 
ing to rally the fugitives. Liot having been wounded in the pur- 
suit, died soon after. From him the clan Macleod are said to be 
descended. Lodvir, the last of these ill-fated brothers, succeeded 
to the vacant earldom of Orkney.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864668">CAITHNESS</name>.</p> 
<p>


Caithness is the most northern county on the mainland of 
Scotland. It is divided from the county of Sutherland by a range 
of mountains and moory hills, extending from the Ord of Caith- 
ness to the North Sea, and is bounded otherwise by the sea ; the 
Pentland Frith dividing it from the Isles of Orkney. It extends 
from north to south about 40 miles, and from east to west about 
30 miles. Its area is 618 square miles, or 395,680 acres, of 
which about 100,000 are cultivated and in pasture, and the rest 
are uncultivated moor and hills. The valued rent is L. 39,256 
Scots, and tTie real value of the land may now be L. 35,000 Ster- 
ling. The population in 1831 was 36,529. The Parliamentary 
constituency in 1840 was 487. 

Topography. — The general appearance of the county is flat and 
uninteresting ; the only hills of any eminence forming the boun- 
dary with Sutherland. A great proportion of the ground consist- 
ing of flat moor and heath, and there being no extent of trees, the 
interior has a dreary appearance. Along the sea coast, which is 
generally bold and rocky, the appearance improves ; and, from 
the improvements now going on in various quarters, a more cheer- 
ful and pleasant aspect is given to it, especially along the high 
road from the south towards Thurso. There are a few sheets 
of water, but none of any extent or peculiar beauty of appearance, 
and there arc no navigable rivers. 

Geology. — There is no coal formation so far as known. Sand- 
stone of good quality prevails in some places ; but the general 
formation is a black, bituminous, slaty sandstone. Mr Traill of

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



Ratter has an extensive and profitable quarry of flagstones for 
pavement, &amp;c. which he works ; and there are one or two others 
in the county. The stones are principally shipped for London and 
Newcastle. 

Ar/ricultiire.' — The science of agriculture and husbandry, in all 
its branches, has made much progress of late years. The late 
Sir John Sinclair, who was a native of the county, and held large 
estates therein, gave a considerable impetus to the spirit of im- 
provement; but it has only been within the last twenty years, that, 
through the efforts mainly of Mr Traill of Ratter, Mr Home of 
Scouthel, and one or two other gentlemen, these improvements 
have taken the practical shape they have done. The soil of the 
county, where cultivated, is generally a strong clay mixed with 
earth, producing green crops of all kinds, of the best quality and 
luxuriance. Farms are now to be seen of as great extent, and 
cultivated with equal skill and success, as in any part of Scotland. 
A great number of cattle of the best description are annually 
reared and sold in the south ; and it was found at a late show of 
the Highland Society at Inverness, that a great proportion of the 
prizes were carried off by competitors from Caithness. A large 
number of sheep is also kept; and one gentleman from Caith- 
ness, Mr Paterson of Borlum, it is believed, annually obtains, at 
the Falkirk Tryst, the highest prices given for sheep and lambs. 
A considerable part of this county is, of course, still in the posses- 
sion of small farmers, paying from L. 10 to L. 50 of yearly rent ; but 
their condition is improving, and many of them raise green crops, 
and pursue a system of rotation. Along the sea coast, the fishermen 
generally hold small farms, which they cultivate when at home. 
These, of course, are not in the best order ; but it does not seem 
possible, while the fisheries continue, to alter this system. Marl 
is found in considerable abundance, and of good quality ; and the 
refuse of the herrings, when properly amalgamated with some 
other substances, is much and advantageously used in bringing the 
waste lands into a proper system for cropping. 

Manufactures. — There are few manufactures in the county. 
Two or three rope-works; some straw plaiting; and a few distil- 
leries. 

Fisheries. — The herring-fishing has been for a number of years 
the principal trade and business of the county. The herrings are 
got all around the coast; but Wick and the surrounding fishing 
villages are the principal places of resort. The fishing commences 



ON THE COUNTY OF CAITHNESS. 



181 



early in July, and continues nearly two months. There is con- 
siderable uncertainty as to the quantity, and of course risk, — so that 
the profits are frequently small to the curer, and often a loss is 
sustained. The fishermen are paid a price of so much per cran, 
which is generally fixed at the commencement of the season ; and, 
if the quantity got be tolerably large, he is sure of a fair remune- 
ration. In consequence of this, he pays a high rent for his house 
and land, and his condition generally is improved. The quantity 
caught and the number of people employed, vary each year con- 
siderably. On an average, it may be stated that the quantity 
caught, during the season, may be from 100,000 to 120,000 barrels 
or crans, and the number of people partially or wholly employed, 
including fishermen, coopers, packers, &amp;c. about 12,000. The 
fishermen are paid from 9s. to 10s. per cran ; and the barrel when 
cured is worth about 21s. The number of boats employed may 
be about 1000, of which 700 are owned in the county, and the 
rest .come from the Frith of Forth and various places in the Mur- 
ray Frith. Each boat is manned by five men. These state- 
ments will show the immense importance of this fishery to the 
county, and that it is of considerable value in a national point 
of view. The salmon-fisheries in the rivers of Thurso, Berriedale, 
and one or two others, are also of some value. 

Gaelic is spoken only in the higher parts of the county ; in 
the other parts, the inhabitants, comprising three-fourths of the 
population, speak the ordinary language of the country, and their 
manners and habits are those of the lowland Scots. There has 
been during the last twenty years, considerable improvement in the 
manners and social habits of the inhabitants : upon the whole, less 
inebriety — riots and fighting at fairs have almost ceased — and the 
standard of comfort has been raised amongst all classes. Edu- 
cation is advancing; but it is to be regretted that its importance' 
is not sufficiently appreciated by the mass of the people. The 
means of communication with the south by steam are everv year 
improving. In the county itself, the roads are both good and nu- 
merous.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM LOGIE,  M,,rcTPR « 
THE REV. PETER PETRIE, | ii J- 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, SC. — The royal burgh of Kirkwall is situat- 
ed in latitude 58° 59' N., and longitude 3° 23' W., and is sur- 
rounded by a landward district called St Ola, which forms nearly 
a square, intersected by several bays, the side of the square mea- 
suring about 5 miles. Buchanan considers the name of the town 
as a corruption of Cracoviaca or Kirkvaa, the ancient Danish name; 
but it is more probably derived from the extensive walls of the 
principal and most ancient building, the kirk or cathedral of St 
Magnus, to be afterwards noticed. The name of the parish is bor- 
rowed from Olaus or Olave, the first Christian king of Norway, to 
which country the Orkney Islands anciently belonged. The town 
consists principally of one street, in many parts very narrow, run- 
ning the whole length ; parallel to which, however, a new street, 
called King Street, has been commenced within the last twenty 
years, and contains several neat and commodious houses. 

The principal bays in the parish are those of Kirkwall, Inganess, 
and Scapa ; the two former affording safe and capacious anchorage 
for ships of the largest size, and the latter being the common place 
of landing for boats and small craft, from Caithness and the islands 
south of Kirkwall. 

The surface of the parish is, on the whole, not very elevated, 
the only considerable hill being that of Wideford, rising about 
500 feet above the level of the sea, and covered with heath, 
the soil being chiefly mossy. Towards Gait-nip on the east 
side of Scapa bay, are the highest crags, and in thein there are 
several excavations formed by the action of the sea, one running 
in the form of a narrow winding passage, upwards of 100 yards

from the sea edge, being in height apparently from 12 to 20 feet, 
and adorned with beautiful stalactites of lime. 

Hydrography. — la. the parish, are several ponds, rivulets, and 
springs of excellent water ; and about two miles south of the town 
there is a pretty strong chalybeate spring, called Blakely's well, to 
which invalids formerly resorted. 

Geology. — The prevailing rock is argillaceous schistus, frequent- 
ly alternating with a coarse sandstone, in some instances of a white 
and in others of a red colour, sometimes containing veins of hmestone 
with iron pyrites. The clay-slate is frequently traversed by small 
veins of lime, and occasionally by heavy spar, containing small crys- 
tals of galena. It is also often found highly impregnated with bitumi- 
nous matter, which gives it a black colour, and when recently brok- 
en, a tarry smell. The subsoil is, for the most part, a very reten- 
tive clay, as might be inferred from the great prevalence of clayey 
strata. There are considerable extents of peat moss. The soil 
in the arable grounds is chiefly a good black loam, with either a 
clay or gravelly bottom. 

Botany.— T\\Q botany of the parish presents nothing rare or pe- 
culiar. Gardening is, for the climate, practised pretty successfully. 
Besides currants, gooseberries, and strawberries, which attain agood 
size and ripen well, apples, pears, and cherries thrive well ; and 
in one garden, grapes are produced by the aid of artificial heat. 
Forest trees, except under shelter, do not succeed, partly, no doubt, 
owing to the sea air, but probably more to the strength of the tree 
being spent in repeated germinations during the winter, arismg 
from" the prevalence of open weather alternating with slight frosts. 

Of animals the parish contains no rare species. Rabbits 
are not numerous, alid till about twelve years ago, there were no hares, 
but a few pairs havingbeen then introduced, they have rapidly multi- 
plied, to the no small annoyance and damage of the farmers. The 
commons abound with plovers, grouse, snipe, and other species of 
game. Sea birds in great variety frequent the rocks and bays of 
the parish. Of the domestic animals, the cows and horses are ge- 
nerally rather small in size, but considerably larger than those of 
the Shetland Isles. Sheep, pigs, geese, ducks, turkeys, and fowls, 
are reared in considerable numbers, and many are exported, as well 
as horses and black.-cattle, especially since the commencement of 
steam navigation. . 

Fisheries.— On the coast, fish of all the kinds common in bcot- 
land, and of excellent quality, abound. The cole-fish, in all its

gradations of size, here distinguislied by the names ofsilloch, cuith, 
cuthine, and saithe, is by far the most useful, constituting a prin- 
cipal part of the food of the poorer classes. 

Sea trout are taken in considerable numbers in the bays and 
small brooks or burns, which they ascend in October and Novem- 
ber for the purpose of spawning, returning in the spring months. 
Salmon are very rarely met with, though now and then a stray fish 
is caught. 

II. — Civil History. 

Kirkwall was erected into a royal burgh by a charter from James 
III. of Scotland, dated 31st March a. d. 1486, and is governed by 
a provost, four bailies, dean of guild, treasurer, and council- 
lors. It is also the seat of the Sheriff- Court, Justice of Peace 
Court, presbytery, and synod. 

Eminent Men — Of eminent characters connected with the pa- 
rish, those most worthy of notice are. Sir Robert Strange, the emi- 
nent engraver ; Malcolm Laing, Esq. the well-known historian of 
Scotland, over whose remains, in the cathedral, is erected a hand- 
some marble tablet, bearing a very elegant inscription in Latin ; 
and Dr Traill, the present accomplished Professor of Medical Ju- 
risprudence in the University of Edinburgh; all of whom were 
born in Kirkwall. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are the Earl of Zet- 
land ; Mr Baikie of Tankerness ; Mr Balfour of Trenaby ; Mr 
Pollexfen of Cairston ; Mr Laing of Papdale ; and Mr Graeme of 
Grseme's Hall. 

Public Buildings.— T\\e chief public buildings are, the Cathe- 
dral of St Magnus, the Earl's and Bishop's palaces, and King's 
castle, the town house, and grammar school.  

Of these edifices, the most deserving of notice is the Cathedral, 
founded A. d. 1138, by Rognvald or Ronald, Count of Orkney, 
and dedicated to the memory of his uncle, Magnus, also Earl of 
Orkney, and canonized for his piety, real or reputed. This state- 
ly building still remains in a condition of wonderful entireness and 
preservation, considering its great antiquity. Its choir having 
been immemorially used in lieu of a parish church, the cathedral 
was, for a long period, upheld and repaired, solely by a small fund 
ansmg from seat-rents, which, however, being very inadequate for 
the purpose, the building would speedily have fallen into decay, 
had not a wealthy native of the county, Mr Meason of Moredun, 
about thirty years ago, mortified a sum, amounting, after deduction

ORKNEY. 



of legacy duty, to L.nOO, for the purpose of repairing and beautify- 
ing it, by the annual application of the interest ; and this liberal 
gift has since contributed very much to its preservation. The 
cathedral is the property of " the provost, bailies, council, and 
inhabitants of the burgh," to whom it was gifted by the above 
cited charter of James III., confirmed by a new charter from 
James V., dated 1536; and a third, by Charles II. in 1661, ra- 
tifying the former two. Upon this charter infeftment followed in 

1669, and all these titles were confirmed by Act of Parliament, 

1670, cap. 4'2. These charters also conveyed to the magistrates 
and corporation, the patronage of the two benefices in Kirkwall, 
which, however, the crown-officers, about twelve years ago, claimed 
for the crown : but the question being carried to the Court of Ses- 
sion, and by appeal to the House of Lords, the right of the corpo- 
ration to the patronages, and, consequently, to the property of the 
cathedral, conveyed by the same titles, was found to be valid and 
impregnable. 

The cathedral is built in that style of mixed Gothic and Saxon 
architecture common in the age of its erection. Its length outside 
is 226 feet; breadth, 56 ; height of the main roof, 71 ; and from 
the floor to the top of the steeple, 133. The main roof of the 
choir and part of the nave is elegantly arched, and is supported 
by 32 pillars, faced with freestone. The side aisles, behind the 
pillars, are finished above by a series of groined arches, and the 
whole is limited by 103 windows, including those in the steeple, 
.ome of them in the Gothic style, and of great size. The steeple 
contains an excellent chime of three large bells, rung by ropes at- 
tached to the clappers, so as to produce a kind of melody, m the 
ancient cathedral fashion. _ 

The Earl's Palace, the ruins of which, still pretty entire, stand 
near the cathedral to the south-east, was erected, a. d. 1660, by 
Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, whose father, Robert, was a 
natural son of James V. The bishop's palace, whose rums are 
also situated very near the cathedral, is of much greater antiquity 
and in a much more dilapidated state. It was honoured by the 
residence in it at difTerent periods of two royal guests, Haco, King 
of Norway, who died in this building, and James V. of Scotland, 
who, in the course of a progress through his dominions, lodged 
there for a short time and partook of the bishop's hospitality Ot

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, in the custody of 
the kirk-session, consist of five volumes of register of baptisms, ex- 
tending from 1657 to the present time, without interruption ; three 
volumes of register of marriages, from 1657 to the current year; 
and five volumes of the minutes of session, containing the res gesta;, 
from 1626 to 1840, with the exception of ten years, from 1659 to 
1669, the records of which appear to have been lost. No regular 
or continuous register of deaths or burials was kept till within the 
last fifty years.

It appears from a comparison of successive censuses taken since 
the commencement of the present century, that the population of 
Kirkwall was, for many years, progressively on the increase. It is, 
however, the general belief that, since 1831, the population, if not 
decreasing", has been at least stationary. This, indeed, is evident 
from the fact, that house building, which in former years went on 
very briskly, has of late been almost at a stand, and many habita- 
tions in the town are at present untenanted. This arrest on the 
increase of population is mainly to be ascribed to the failure of the 
kelp trade, formerly the staple of these islands, the large profits of 
which gave a stimulus to industry and trade; and though the 
fisheries have been greatly extended since that manufactiu'e was 
given up, or nearly so, yet the emolument arising from the former 
source has passed into other hands. Those who profit by the 
fishing are chiefly boatmen and labourers, who lay out their little 
capital, not in trade in the towns, but in farming or an extension 
of their fishing speculations. 

The average number of marriages, births, and deaths for the 
five years ending with 1839, appears from the parish registers to 
be,— marriages, 26; births, 41; deaths, 59. 

The mhabitants of the town consistchiefly of shopkeepers, trades- 
men of the different crafts, sailors, boatmen, and laboiu-ers. Uc- 
sides these, there are a few resident proprietors, officers of customs 
and excise, three medical practitioners, two bankers, six gentlemen

of the law, and ministers of four communionsj five in number; to- 
gether with several teachers of youth, male and female. 

The shopkeepers are very numerous, almost every alternate 
house, in most parts of the town, containing a shop. The princi- 
pal shops are well stocked with goods of every description, imported 
from Edinburgh, London, and other markets ; and which are sold 
on very moderate profits, considering the distance of the markets 
and the great expense of carriage. 

Many of the mechanics execute their work well, but they are 
generally complained of as dilatory, seldom executing their orders 
within the stipulated time ; though the undoubted fact was pro- 
bably an extreme case, of a gentleman sending a nursery-fender 
to be painted, which was not returned till after the boys, for whose 
safety it was intended, returned, grown men, from college  

The sailors and boatmen, for skill, hardihood, and dexterity in 
their profession, are not surpassed by their brethren in any part'of 
the world. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — As few of the estates in St Ola have been sur- 
veyed or measured, the extent in acres of the cultivated ground 
cannot be accurately given ; but by "good judges, it is thought, that 
the arable ground does not exceed 1200 or 1500 acres, which, on 
an average, is rented at about 16s. per acre. Considerable im- 
provement in the modes of farming has taken place, of late years; 
several proprietors, and tenants, having introduced the improved 
modes of agriculture practised in the south, by rotation of crops, 
draining, and enclosing. Oats, barley, and bear, potatoes, turnips 
and artificial grasses, are cultivated with success. Mr Pollexfen 
of Cairston, besides setting an example of general good farming, 
on a part of his property in his own occupation, has made such 
improvements in the production of grass and turnip seeds, as to 
have attracted the approving notice of the Agricultural Associa- 
tions ; and the seeds raised by him are in considerable request, 
even in the south of Scotland. 

There is a considerable extent of pasture lands in the parish. 
The common charge for pasturage of an ox or cow is L. 1, 10s. 
The wages of ploughmen are L.7, 7s. per annum in money, with 
allowances of meal, milk, and potatoes ; making the whole fee, 
L. 14 or L. 15. Female domestic servants receive, at an average, 
l 3 per annum, with their maintenance. Price of labour, Is. to 
Is. 3d. per day.

The sheep pastured on the commons, which are undivided, are 
less numerous than formerly, but in their breed, as well as that of 
cattle and horses, a gradual improvement is taking place. 

Prices of Produce, Sfc. — A horse, L. 12 to L.16; a milch cow, 
L. 5 to L.G ; a good sheep, L. 1 ; a goose, 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; poultry, 
8d. each ; beef, 5d. to 6d. per lb. ; oatmeal, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per 
stone ; potatoes, 2s. per barrel. 

Manufactures. — Since the demand for kelp has so greatly di- 
minished, the only kind of industry in the parish, properly falling 
under this denomination, is the plaiting of straw for hats and bon- 
nets, which, more or less, occupies three-fourths of the female 
population. This manufacture has been carried on for forty years, 
and has proved a very seasonable source of emolument to the 
poorer classes. The raw material is either Tuscan straw imported 
from Leghorn, or rye-straw raised in Orkney, which is more 
durable, and very little inferior in appearance. This kind of labour, 
cis at present conducted by the agents giving out the straw to the 
women to be manufactured in their own dwellings, is not liable to 
the objection of injuring the morals, as in he case of manufactures 
which assemble multitudes of the young in one place. In this 
manufacture, a woman earns from 3d. to 9d. per day, according to 
her skill and diligence or the time which she devotes to the em- 
ployment. There are two licensed distilleries in the parish, which 
export a considerable quantity of whisky, besides what is sold in 
the place. 

Navigation. — The town is provided with a safe and commodious 
harbour, constructed thirty years ago, and well frequented both 
by coasting and other vessels, including some from Norway and 
the Baltic. 

There are, at present, sixty-eight vessels which sail from this 
port, as registered in the custom-house books ; but as forty-seven 
of these belong to Stromness, and other harbours through the 
islands, the number strictly belonging to the town of Kirkwall and 
trading from it, is twenty-one, the tonnage of which is 1593, and 
the number of men and boys employed in them, 106. 

Considerable quantities of grain, fish cured in the islands, cattle, 
and other produce, are annually exported, both coastwise and to 
foreign ports. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — Kirkwall was formerly entitled to 
only three mails per week; but about a year ago 1839, through 



8 



ORKNEY. 



the exertions of the county and burgh Members, a daily post was 
established ; in other words, the mail-boat is bound, on every law- 
ful day, when weather permits, to cross the Pentland Frith. 

A good sailing vessel, for conveyance of goods and passengers, 
plies all the year between this town and Leith ; and within the 
last few years, the place has obtained the great advantage of a 
weekly visit from an excellent and powerful steamer, which ac- 
complishes the voyage to Leith, including several long stoppages, 
in from 34 to 40 hours. 

The roads through the parish have of late years been greatly 
improved, which has led to the introduction of gigs and phaetons 
for hire. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish is a collegiate charge, the 
two ministers officiating in the cathedral alternately. Their sti- 
pends were modified, each to L. 150 ; but, being partly paid in 
kind, have for many years fallen short of that sum. The first 
minister has a glebe consisting of about 50 acres arable, with 
pasturage; and its annual value has, for some years, been somewhat 
upwards of L. 40. He has also a manse, erected 140 years ago, 
but which at present is let by the heritors, who pay the present 
incumbent an annuity in lieu of it. The second minister has nei- 
ther manse nor glebe ; but, under a late act of Parliament, draws 
from the Exchequer L. 50 in lieu of both. 

The only place of worship in connection with the Establish- 
ment, which the inhabitants have ever enjoyed, is the choir or 
chancel of the cathedral, which is seated to accommodate from 
830 to 870 sitters; but so awkwardly, that it has been ascertained 
by measurement, that a better arrangement of the seats and po- 
sition of the pulpit would give at least an addition of 150 avail- 
able seats. The cathedral is placed in the centre of the parish, 
and there is no dwelling, more than two and a-half or three miles 
from the place of worship, while five-sixths of the population are 
within half a mile of it. The accommodation in the cathedral 
was probably sufficient for all the church-going population at a 
former period ; but as the number of inhabitants increased, the 
want of more church room was severely felt, and a portion of the 
inhabitants, who could not procure seats, or such as they wished, 
accepted the offer of the Antiburgher Seceders to establish a 
cono-regation there. A chapel in that connection was accordingly 
erectecf forty-four years ago, and afterwards rebuilt on a larger 
scale. Shortly after, an Independent meeting-house was erected.

and more recently, one in connection with the Original or Asso- 
ciate Secession Synod. Thus a majority of the inhabitants are 
Dissenters, and from the great length of time that they have been 
so, and their strong attachment to their respective persuasions, 
there is no probability that, in any circumstances, many of them 
will return to the Established Church. While the churchman 
must regret this state of matters, yet, if a Christian, he will re- 
joice that not one individual in this parish, except through his 
own fault, is deprived of an opportunity of attending divine ordi- 
nances in a Protestant, or even a Presbyterian place of worship, 
and under pastors of good character, and preaching the Gospel 
in its purity. Of how many cities or burghs in Scotland can the 
same be said  

The cathedral, which is used as the parish church, though never 
designated or legally divided as such, nor upheld by the heritors 
of town or country, is well attended, notwithstanding that it is 
damp, and, like all such ancient buildings, inconvenient as a place 
of worship. While the population was rapidly increasing, all its 
seats were let, and for the most part occupied. At present, how- 
ever, and for a few years past, from 60 to 100 seats are unoccu- 
pied in the ordinary diets of worship, and 320 are unlet, besides a 
few free seats held as heritable, and a considerable number assigned 
gratuitously to the poor. The rents, rendered necessary for paying 
beadles, repairing seats, firing, and lighting, are extremely mode- 
rate, varying from 6d. to 3s. per sitter, which is the highest charge 
excepting one seat, containing eleven sitters, which rents at 4s. 

About four years ago, a few individuals in the parish proposed 
erecting a new church by subscription, as they thought that, from 
the circumstance of a great number of the burgh heritors being Dis- 
senters, there was no hope of obtaining a parish church without a 
law-suit. Many of the congregation, understanding that it was to 
be used instead of the cathedral, contributed small sums to the 
undertaking; but by far the greater part of the subscriptions were 
obtained throughout Scotland and England. The chapel, situat- 
ed close to the cathedral, and large enough to contain all the 
church population, man, woman, and child, is now nearly finished, 
and if It were to be occupied as a substitute for the old and incon- 
venient cathedral, would prove a great benefit to the place. Such, 
however, does not seem to be the intention of its proprietors. 
They applied for a grant from the General Assembly's Extension 
Committee, to aid in its erection, as an additional and separate place 



10

of worship, to be served by one of the colleague ministers. The Ex- 
tension Committee granted L.200 towards its erection Four mana- 
gers of the chapel have since presented a petition, which lies on the 
table of the Presbytery, praying them to divide the parish, uncolle- 
giate the ministers, placing one of them in the chapel as minister of 
one-half the parish, but reserving to him his civil rights and emo- 
luments as a minister of the whole or quoad civilia parish. This, 
in the circumstances of the parish, would be just to convert one 
of the charges into a sinecure, so far as preaching is concerned ; 
as it is certain, and the petitioners calculate upon it, that when 
the comparison comes to be between the old and incommodious 
cathedral, and a comfortable chapel just next door, the whole 
audience will evacuate the cathedral, while, by the proposal, one 
of the ministers must still continue to officiate there. As the 
principal heritors are perfectly willing that the worship should be 
wholly transferred to the chapel, the proper course appears to be, 
to obtain the Presbytery's sanction to its occupation as a preaching 
station, in lieu of the cathedral ; and this is the consummation 
which has all along been desired by the whole community, except- 
ing a few individuals. 

Education. — The antiquity of the principal educational esta-- 
blishment in the parish, called the grammar school, cannot be ac- 
curately ascertained ; but it cannot be much, if at all, short of 500 
years old : for in the fifteenth century, it is referred to in the town's 
charter, as an existing establishment. At that time, and long af- 
ter, it was taught by an ecclesiastic, the prebend of St Peter, con- 
nected with the cathedral ; and even after the teachers were lay- 
men, we find by the records, that they drew and enjoyed the emo- 
luments of that prebendary, November 1652. This goodly 
endowment, however, was, amidst the troubles of these times, 
alienated from the schoolmaster, and became merged either in the 
funds for payment of the clergymen of the different parishes con- 
nected with the prebendary, or in the revenues of the bishopric, 
which passed into the possession of the Crown. He, however, 
retained, and his successors still retain, a payment of thirty meills 
or bolls of malt, — the fruit of a voluntary contribution made by 
the clergy and other gentlemen of Orkney a. d. 1649, amounting 
to QOOO merks, which were mortified in the hands of Lord Mor- 
ton, on condition of said annual payment of malt, out of the feu- 
duties of the earldom, then held by the Earl of Morton, and now 
by the Earl of Zetland. To this there was, twenty years ago, 



KIRKWALL AND ST OLA. 



11 



added a new endowment by John Balfour, Esq. of Trenaby, for- 
merly Member of Parliament for the county, of the interest of 
L.500, very liberally mortified by him in the hands of trustees, for 
which the schoolmaster is taken bound to educate eight poor chil- 
dren, recommended by the donor or his representatives. These 
constitute the sole endowments now possessed by the grammar 
schoolmaster, which, together with the fees paid by the scholars, 
make up but a very moderate living. The school at present, and 
for sixteen years past, taught by a very able and talented teacher, 
Mr James Craig, is attended by from 80 to 100 scholars, male 
and female, who are instructed in the Greek, Latin, French, and 
English languages, mathematics, navigation, arithmetic, and 
the principles of the Christian religion. During the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries, it appears from the records, that 
the school-house was upheld, and the schoolmaster appoint- 
ed, by the kirk-session ; but since that period, the patronage has 
been exercised by the town-council, who also, upwards of twenty 
years ago, erected a new and elegant school-house, in lieu of the 
old one, which had become ruinous; — and while they continue to 
uphold the school-house, as at present, and to present, as they 
have done for some time past, able and respectable masters to the 
school, it is not likely that their right of patronage will be called 
in question. 

Besides the grammar school, there is one endowed by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and attended by from 
50 to 60 scholars, children of the poor; and there are several other 
schools taught on private adventure. There is a private school 
for young ladies taught by an accomplished teacher, and a female 
charity school, supported by benevolent ladies in the town. There 
are likewise three Sabbath schools, numerously attended, and an 
infant school. 

The benefits of education are generally appreciated by parents ; 
and there are scarcely any betwixt the ages of six and sixty who' 
cannot read. 

Libraries.— There are two subscription libraries in the town, the 
oldest of which, called The Orkney Library," is on a pretty ex- 
tensive scale. 

Charitable Institutiovs.— There are three Relief or Friendly So- 
cieties m the town, affording aid to widows, orphans, and, in the 
case of one at least, to sick or reduced members. There are also 



12 



OUKNEY. 



two subscription Societies for the relief of the indigent or destitute 
sick. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — This parish, hke all the rest in the 
county, has been hitherto exempt from the evils of legal assess- 
ment. The poor receive relief from the parochial funds at the dis- 
posal of the kirk-session, from the revenue of an estate in the pa- 
rish, which the Crown, as ultimiis hceres, vested in trustees for cha- 
ritable purposes, and from another fund in the management of the 
town-council. The United Secession Congregation also afford 
relief to their own poor. 

The average number of poor on the kirk-session's permanent roll 
is 81, and the average rate of relief to each per annum is from 
2s. to L.l, 10s. Besides these, an average number of 32 J receive 
occasional relief, amounting to L.7,0s. 3d. per annum, and fromL.5 
to L.7s, 10s. have been expended annually on the education of poor 
children. The funds under the administration of the kirk-session 
arise from church-door collections, averaging L.39, 3s. 8d. per 
annum ; donations, and dues arising from marriages and burials. 

Prisons. — There is one prison connected with the town-house, 
not of the best description ; but a new one is in contemplation un- 
der the late Prison Act. 

jjijis, — Of these there are several, but one only adapted for the 
accommodation of respectable travellers. 

J7airs. — There is one fair, commencing on the iBrst Tuesday 
after the 11th August, and continuing a fortiiight. 

jPuel The principal fuel is English coal ; but peats procured 

in this and the adjacent parishes are much used by the poor.

PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JAMES ANDERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name Orphir, formerly written Orfer, is said to 
be of Norwegian origin, and to signify Jire land, or mossy soil. 

Situation. — The parish lies west of Kirkwall on the mainland; 
and the church and manse are about nine miles distant from 
Kirkwall. 

Boundaries, c. — It is bounded on the west and north, by the 
parishes of Stenness and Firth, from which it is divided by a range 
of high hills ; on the east and south, by the parish of Kirkwall, the 
bay of Scalpa, and the sea that intervenes between it and the pa- 
rish of South Ronaldsay, from which it is distant about twelve miles. 
The average length, by accurate measurement, is 6 miles, 6 fur- 
longs, and 200 yards; average breadth, 2 miles, 5 furlongs, and 
13 vards ; and it contains about 18 square miles. The leno-th alono- 
the coast, from Claistran to Scalpa is 13 miles, 7 furlongs, and 
13 yards; the length, on the land boundary, is 10 miles, 2 fur- 
longs, and 40 yards. The circumference of the whole is 24 miles, 
1 furlong, and .53 yards. 

Topographical Appearances.— Yrom Houton head, the south- 
west point, there is a succession of hills and valleys north-east, 
not only through the whole length of the parish, but to the oppo- 
site shore of the mainland, where the parishes of Kirkwall and 
Firth meet. 

Mountain Ranges.— Yiowton head is about .300 feet above the 
level of the sea. The next hills in succession rise gradually ; and 
the Wart hill, which is the highest of the whole, is about 700 feet. 
From the top of this, when the sky is clear, there is a very exten- 
sive, varied, and delightful view, not only over the greater part of 
the county, but also along the west coast of Caithness, from Dungs- 
bay head to Cape Wrath, and over several of the loftiest hills in 
the interior of Caithness and Sutherland. Tiic scene is also 



14 



ORKNEY. 



agreeably varied by the frequent view of ships passing through the 
Pentland Frith, and vessels belonging to the country, on their 
departure and return. The eagle is frequently seen soaring high 
over the hills, and sometimes darts on the poultry about the far- 
mers' houses. . 

Valleys. — As the parish is bounded on the west by a succession 
of hills and valleys, these valleys began to be cultivated soon after 
the division of the common, which took place in 1818, at the in- 
stance of the late Sir William Honyman, the principal proprietor; 
and twenty-sis small farms have been cultivated in these valleys, 
where there had been no dwelling-house before. In these valleys, 
the soil is in general rich and deep, and yielded rich crops from 
their first cultivation. In different parts of the valleys, the culti- 
vation has not yet been carried to the extent that it admits. 
There are small burns issuing from springs, and running in a south- 
easterly direction. At their sources, the ground is comparatively 
steep, and becomes more level, as they approach the shore. 

Caves. — These are few, and excite no great interest in the mind 
of the spectator. In Houton head, there is a small cave in the 
face of the rock, the mouth of which is about 90 feet above flood 
mark, narrow at the entrance, but widening, and becoming higher 
towards the inner extremity, which extends to the distance of about 
14 feet from the mouth. It acquired some celebrity in 1803, from 
affording a temporary shelter to two young men in the neighbour- 
hood, who endeavoured to escape from being impressed. 

Nearly a mile east from the church, there are three small caves 
in the face of the rock Bernory, which rises to the height of about 
30 feet. One of them may be entered on foot at low water, and 
extends but a small distance under the rock. The other two can 
be approached only by boat, extend ftirther under ground, and at 
the lowest ebb the sea is about two fathoms deep at their mouths, 
becoming more shallow as the caves recede from the shore. The 
sides are"irregular, composed of sandstone ; the roof a coarse spe- 
cies of freestone, and in general flat; the sides converging towards 
the top. On the sides and in the crevices, a few wild pigeons 
build their nests, and lodge at all seasons. 

On the side of Scalpa bay, near the line of boundary between 
this parish and the parish of Kirkwall, there is a cave called the 
Salt Pans, running parallel to the shore to the distance of twenty 
nnces The front has the appearance of freestone pillars at irregu- 
L distances about five feet high. Above and below, and also behmd 



ORPHIR. 



15 



these pillars, there are rocks of harder stone. The name is sup- 
posed to have arisen from the practice of manufacturing salt by 
boiling the salt water; but no such manufacture is now remember- 
ed to have been carried on at the place. 

Coast. — From Houton head, westward to the parish of Strom- 
ness, the coast is nearly level, and for the most part wholly so. 
The banks nowhere rise above ten feet, and consist of thin strata 
of sandstone. Here the strata dip to the east and north. Be- 
low flood-mark, some parts are sandy, others covered with small 
pebbles, and frequently with rugged rocks, on which grows a con- 
siderable quantity of tang, of which kelp is made. 

At Houton head, the strata dip to the west and south. From 
this, eastward, is a succession of small bays, in some degree cor- 
responding to the valleys on the west. The shores of these bays 
are in some cases sandy, but more generally covered with pebbles, 
and in some cases the banks are from 12 to \A feet high. The 
headlands between the bays generally rise to a greater height : the 
highest, however, do not exceed 40 feet, and few of them reach 
30. There is nothing particularly striking in the appearance of 
these bays and headlands. The strata in the headlands, which con- 
sist commonly of grey slate or greywacke, are generally regular, 
though m some cases they have a waving direction, and sometimes 
there is a perpendicular line of junction, where the strata, on each 
side of this line, rise a little, as if compressed by some external 
force during their formation. Here, the strata dip to the west and 
north. In the bay of Swanbister, which is the largest of the whole, 
and nearly two miles broad, there is a sandy shore ; and a consi- 
derable number of cockles and some spouts are obtained durino- 
stream tides. ° 

Island.— Cava, the only island, is about a-mileand a-half south- 
east of Houton head. There are only twenty Scots acres cultivated 
in It, and these lie in the middle on the south side. It contained ' 
twenty-one inhabitants at last census. The cultivated soil is a rich 
black loam, producing excellent crops, both of oats and bear, there 
being abundance of sea-weed for manure. Part of what is unculti- 
vated consists of excellent peat moss. The rocks around the shore 
are chiefly common sandstone, freestone, and some limestone. 
1 he circumference of the island is 3 miles, 1 furlong, and 80 yard.. 

1 ho holm of Houton lies in the bay of Houton, not a quarter 
Ota mile ,n length and less in breadth; it is covered with 
a coarse kind of grass used for pasture. Part of it was cultivat- 



16 



ORKNEY. 



ed, a few years ago, for one season ; but the soil being near ne 
rock, and the summer dry, the crop was poor, and therefore the 
cultivation was discontinued. The channel which separates the 
holm from Houton head becomes dry for about two hours at low 
water. The inlet on the side next to the church adniits sloops 
into the bay, even at low water. For many years past, it has been 
in contemplation to convey the mail from Thurso, by a decked 
vessel, direct to the bay of Houton, from whence runners could 
bring it soon to Kirkwall and Stromness. This bay was lately 
surveyed for the purpose, but the result is not yet known. 

There is a small skerry, about two miles south-east of the church, 
called the barrel of hitter, the origin of which name is said to be, 
that the tenants on the lands of the Bull, which surround the 
church, paid to the proprietor a rent of a barrel of butter for the 
privilege of killing seals on this skerry. It is never completely 
covered by the sea at stream tides. There is a spot of coarse 
grass in the middle. On this, seals are seen to bask on a sunny 
day, but of late, no attempt has been made to disturb their repose. 

Hydrography.— The frith between Houton head and the island 
of Walls," is about four miles broad. By this, all vessels from the 
south and east pass to Stromness, and approach either between 
the island of South Ronaldsay and the islands of Walls and Flotta, 
or by Holm sound. 

Springs.— T\\exe is a great abundance of copious springs of pure 
water. There are also a few chalybeates, which are reckoned salu- 
tary and beneficial in nervous complaints. 

X„Ae5.— There is but one lake ; the lake or loch of Kirbister, 
1 mile, 1 furlong, and 116 yards long; circumference, 2 miles, 3 
furlongs, and 170 yards; surface, 180 Scots acres; the depth va- 
ries from 3 to 9 feet. It is supplied by small burns m various di- 
rections ; and near the south-east, there is an excellent mi 1. It 
abounds in small trouts, which are taken by hooks and flies by the 
people in the neighbourhood : and anglers from Kirkwall occasion- 
ally resort to it in summer. , • , i» 

Geology.— The rocks along the shore are nowhere high, few 
above 30 feet. They are generally of sandstone ; in some 
places, slaty. In the bay at the church, at low water, there 
are several rocks of the schistose kind, running nearly in a 
south and north direction, about six feet in breadth, rising from 
their bed about two feet, sloping on the sides, and exhibit- 
in the middle the appearance of having been pressed to- 



m2 



OliPHIR,

getlieriii their formation, by some very powerful force from beneath. 
The distance between these ridges is from four to five feet. There 
are several of these ridges, and they run parallel to each other. 
On the west side of this bay, there is a rock of this kind of stone, 
from 25 to 30 feet high; and about the middle, there is a perpen- 
dicular line where the junction exhibits signs, on each side, of great 
pressure in the formation. Of the freestone, some is coarse grain- 
ed, and some fine and white. The shores of Swanbister, belong- 
ing to Thomas Sands, Esq. abound in this last, and are carried 
to Kirkwall and Stromness, for various purposes. 

There was lately discovered a quarry of excellent gray slate on 
the side of the hill of Midland next to Houton, at an elevation of 
about 400 feet, bebnging to Hector Moncrieff, Esq. of Houton. 
In summer 1834, 6000 slates were sent to Kirkwall and South 
Ronaldsay; 1835, 12,000 were sent to the same places; and last 
summer, about 12,000. 

Soil. — In the fields, which have been longest in cultivation, the 
soil is generally a rich black loam, yields fair crops of corn, rich natu- 
ral grass ; and ryegrass and clover have been tried with success. In 
some parts, the soil is a cold clay ; but a large proportion is sandy 
and shallow, over rocks of sandstone, and yields light crops. 

Birds.~The chief of these are : hawks Falco, both dark- 
brown and grey. Owls {Strix ulula, dark-grey. The royal eagle 
 Falco fulvus. Crov/s {Corvus comix. The starling Sturnus, 
thrush Turdus, wagtail {Mvtacilla alba, lark {Alauda arven-

very numerous in the warm summer evenings, and often trouble- 
some to those occupied in the open an-. 

Botany. — There is a great variety of plants in the pastvire 
and meadow grounds, and they are general over the whole county ; 
some of which are, mint Mentha, marsh marigold {Caltha palus- 
tris, thyme [Thymus serpyllum, foxglove {Digitalis purpurea, 
scurvy-grass [Cochlearia officinalis, water-cresses Nasturtium 
officinale, cranesbiU Geranium cicutarium, trefoil Lotus corni- 
•culatus, coltsfoot Tussilagofarfara. 

There are no trees except a few in gardens, which become stunted 
when they rise above the walls. The willow Salix repcns, is found 
in low ground along rivulets ; also angustifolia, but this appears to 
have been planted. Hazel-nuts have been, of late, turned up by 
the plough, though none of the trunks have been discovered. 
Whins hex Europceus, are found in some places, and no doubt 
is entertained that they have been raised from seed. Turnips of 
different kinds thrive well, as also carrots and cabbages, i he soil 
and climate seem abundantly favourable for leguminous crops. 
H. — Civil History. 
Earl Paul, the second of that name, who lived towards the close 
of the eleventh century, had a magnificent palace in this parish, 
the ruins of which are still perceptible on the shore of Swanbister. 

Eminent Men.-The late Sir William Honyman, Lord Arma- 
dale, an eminent Judge in the Court of Session, was a native of 
this parish, and the principal landed proprietor in it. The resi- 
dence of his ancestors was in the Hall of Claistran. 

Murdoch Mackenzie, Esq. author of the Charts though a na- 
tive of Kirkwall, was proprietor of Groundwater in this parish, and 
of lands in different parts in this county. Thomas Mackenzie, 
Esq. the present proprietor, is his direct descendant. 

Parochial Register.-The earliest date of baptisms is l/U , ot 
marriages, 1718; of deaths, 1817. This last was begun, in con- 
sequence of the express orders of the General Assembly. 

Antiguities.-Besk\es the ruins of Earl Paul's palace, aheady 
mentioned, there are, in various places along the coast, from Hou- 
ton-head eastward," the ruins of various buildings, which arc sup- 
losed to be the remains of Popish chapels, and have nothing s.rik- 
nTin heir appearance. There are three tumuh which have not 
 nnPncd ione near the church on level ground,-another 
r;ti:r « : ntUe ---e devated ; and both may be seen from 



ORPHIR, 



19 



the third, which is on the top of the highest hill. There is no 
tradition concerning them. 

Buildings. — The Hall of Claistran is a double house of modern 
construction, at present occupied by a tenant. The principal 
landed proprietors have neat comfortable dwellings and commo- 
dious gardens, in which a good deal of taste is displayed. As the 
farms are in general small the dwelling-houses correspond with 
them, being built of stone and clay, and sometimes not plastered 
on the inside, with the fire-place in the middle of the floor, or to- 
wards the inner end of the apartment, where the family usually sit, 
with a stone fence of from four to five feet high, and about the 
same breadth, on the inner side of which the fire is placed. In 
later times, some improvement in these erections has taken place.

■ Character, S,c. of the People.— They are active, industrious, fru- 
gal, cheerful, and contented, quiet and social in their disposition. 
It is rare to hear of any quarrel among them. They have, in ge- 
neral, a deep sense of the principles of religion, and their punctual 
attendance on public worship, their decency of behaviour, and close 
attention while there, are exemplary. It follows that intemperance, 
or petty thefts are rarely heard of, and those who are addicted to 
such habits, are treated with the contempt they deserve. 

The number of artisans is considerable. Many of the young men 
are much occupied in winter, in making shoes for themselves and 
others. Weavers and tailors have abundance of employment. 
There is a great number of masons, and several of them go in sum- 
mer to work in the neighbouring islands. There are several joiners, 



20 



ORKNEY. 



3 smiths, and 1 cooper. Most of the artisans have small farms, but 
not sufficient to maintain their families. Almost all the young 
women have, for many years, been employed in winter in plaiting 

straw for bonnets. 

The habits of the people are gradually improving. There is, 
however, a propensity among the young of both sexes to extrava- 
gance in dress. Umbrellas are in general use. English cloths, 
prints, and merinos are common. 

While kelp was in demand, and brought a high price, a consi- 
derable number of men and young women was employed in the 
manufacture of it ; but now little is done in this way. 

The youno- people are usually prudent enough m entenng nito 
matrimony, and seldom take this step, until they have a tolerable 
prospect of the means of subsistence. An unfortunate habit, 
however, has long prevailed among some of the young men, 
of going in the winter evenings to tippling-houses. This, doubt- 
less operates unfavourably in various ways, and deprives the in- 
dividuals of that respectability of character to which they would 
be entitled, from their industry and economy in other respects. 
Resolutions were issued by the county gentlemen a few years ago, 
to put a stop to such practices, by diminishing the number of licens- 
ed ale-houses. Their resolutions, however, have not yet produced 
the salutary effect intended. •. 

A Sunday school was commenced some time ago, which, it is 
hoped, will have a very beneficial influence. 

IV. — Industry. 
Anriculture and Rural EconomJ.-The greater part of the farms 
.re Lm six to eight Scots acres in extent, and at a rent of from 10s. 
t lt p acre. Lording to the quality of the soil The common 
rotaUon'is oats and bear, with a few potatoes: of these, seldom 
rore are raised than what the family requires. Some also raise a 
L turnips for family use. There are three large farms, paying a 
rent of from L.50 to L.80 each. On these, there is a rotation of 
rve-erass and clover, which are not broken up for two or three 
vears- then oats, next potatoes or turnips, and then bear, with 
lirh the erass and clover are sown. The greater part of the 
t tyM. of sown grass is cut for hay, and the fieUl is aftei- 
7. used for pasture. Wheat has been tried, but with indiffer- 
rtuccet. In Lrne cases, it grew luxuriantly, but was never well 
fiUed or fully ripened. In ordinary seasons, it is common to see 



ORPHIK. 



the fields cleared against the end of September, and a late crop 
is always an inferior one. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The black-catlle are, in general, 
such as are common over the county ; and, as an over-stock 
is frequently kept, they have rather a stunted appearance. A 
few of what are called the Dunrobin breed have been introdu- 
ced, and though they do not grow to a large size, they have a 
sprightly appearance. The price of the latter, compared with 
the former, is usually as L. 5 to L. 3. The native horses are 
generally of a small size. Those on the larger farms are of a 
superior breed, and, compared with the former, may be rated about 
two to one as to price, that is as L.8 to L.16. The native sheep are 
of a small size, live on the common at all seasons, — on the hills in 
summer, and along the shore in winter : they are never housed. At 
Lammas a wedder brings about 5s. A few Cheviots have been tried, 
but have not thriven well, except on the larger farms. These, in 
their best condition, bring L.l, Is. each. 

Husband-/, — The one-stilt plough, drawn by three horses, was 
used on some of the smaller farms, about twenty-five years ago. It 
is now wholly out of use. Though it had a clumsy appearance, it 
had this advantage, that it broke the ground in some soils more 
completely than those now in use. Iron ploughs are coming into 
use, and are expected to prove more economical than those made 
of wood. There are a few leases for nineteen years, but they are 
more generally for shorter periods, fourteen, eleven, or seven years. 
Very few of the farms are inclosed except the larger ones. 

The method of preparing the crop for drying when cut, before 
it is put into the stack, deserves attention. The band of the sheaf 
is made in the ulual way and pulled by the root, except when the 
crop is luxuriant, and then it is cut. The sheaf is made of rather 
a large size. The band is drawn nearer the crop end than the root, 
and when the ends are pulled and crossed, they are then twisted 
and turned with dexterity so as to rest against the sheaf, but the 
ends thus twisted are not turned within the band. The sheaf thus 
formed is set on end by itself, and the root end spread out a little. 
It is so placed, that the root end of the band is on the lee-side, 
from whatever quarter the wind is blowing at the time, and the 
crop of the sheaf gets a gentle pressure to the lee-side also. The 
sheaf thus placed is not apt to fall, and after having stood five or 
SIX days in this position, in favourable weather, it is fit for leing 
screwed, that is, for being built into ricks on the field. These 



22 



ORKNEY. 



ricks consist of twenty-four sheaves, which when put together re- 
ceive the name of threave. The two last sheaves of the rick are 
put across each other, and so tied together by portions of them- 
selves, that they are not apt to fall even when the wind is high. 
The ricks, after standing for a week, in favourable weather, are fit 
for the stack. It is obvious, that, in rainy harvests, which are 
frequent in this climate, this method of placing the sheaves and 
ricks is most favourable for preserving the grain from being in- 
jured by the heavy falls of rain. The consequence is, that the 
crop is rarely injured, in harvest, to any great degree, in the most 
unfavourable weather. 

Fisheries. — The principal fishing, of late years, has been of herring. 
About thirty years ago, herrings were got in Scalpa Bay for a few 
days in a season ; but more lately, they have not been sought for 
there, nor are thev ever found on this coast. There are, however, 
eight boats, with four men each thus employed. They repair to the 
island of Stronsay toward the end of July, and about two weeks 
after go to South Ronaldsay, where they remain about a month, 
or till the herrings leave the coast of that island. Vessels from 
Rothesay and from Ireland attend to receive the herrings, as soon 
they are barreled. The price for some years past has varied from 
9s. to 12s. per cran or barrel. The average, for each boat this 
season, has been fifty-five crans. About eighteen years ago, when 
the spirit of enterprise in this employment became prevalent, a 
boat completely rigged, with a set of nets, cost L. 90. The price 
has now fallen to L.70. This fishing has been found to be a pre- 
carious concern, and less lucrative than was expected. 

Lobster Fishing. — This fishing has been continued for many 
years on a small scale, on this coast and the shore of Cava. For 
a few years past, there has been but one boat with two men thus 
employed. During the fishing season, they carry the lobsters, 
weekly, to Stromness for the London smacks. Each night's catch- 
ing is kept in a chest, which floats in the Bay of Houton. The 
number taken annually is by no means considerable. A few small 
cod are occasionally got at no great distance from the shore, so 
are some haddocks and skate. Sillocks and kewths, being the 
coal-fish of one and two years old, abound along our shores, and 
in winter most of the men, near the shore, are employed in catch- 
incr them. They are delicate and wholesome food at this age. 
Produce. It would be difficult to ascertain, with any degree of

precision, the quantity of grain raised. Suffice it to say, tluxt, be- 
sides supplying the demands of the parish, there are upwards of 
240 bolls of meal and grain frequently sent, annually, to Kirkwall 
and Stromness; andin plentiful years, the tenants of the large 
forms send grain to the Leith market. The average price of oat- 
meal is 2s. per stone of 17 lbs. Avoirdupois, and of bear meal, Is. 6d. 
Both sometimes sell for less ; but after bad crops, both kinds of 
meal are imported, commonly from Leith, to Kirkwall and Strom- 
ness, to which supplies even some of the farmers are obliged to 
have recourse. 

When there is an extraordinary demand for black-cattle, from 
sixty to seventy head are sold, early in the summer, chiefly to far- 
mers from Caithness, at a price from L.2, 10s. to L. .3. A few 
horses are sold at the Lammas market at Kirkwall, commonly to 
Caithness people, at from L.8 to L. 10; and some, in rare cases, 
bring double this price. 

Kelp Manufacture. — When kelp was in demand, there were 
about seventy tons manufactured annually. The tang, on the same 
part of the shore, was cut only once in the two years. Only 
about twenty tons have been manufactured annually for some 
years past, as the price has been small, being only L. 5 per ton 
at market, whereas it used to be from L. 10 to L. 12. This is 
a great loss to the proprietors, and also to the tenants who were 
employed in the manufacture. This loss is on the increase, as the 
tang, which is not cut once in two years, is apt to be so completely 
torn from the rocks by the winter storms, that it does not vegetate 
again. 

Navigation There is no sloop belonging to the parish. Be- 
sides the eight Herring boats, and one lobster boat, there are 43 em- 
ployed in taking sillocks, kewths, and other fish ; 52 in all ; they 
are also employed in carrying farm produce to Stromness. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Commvnication, — The post crosses from Huna, in 
Caithness, to South Ronaldsay, where there is a post-office, and 
proceeds by a runner to Kirkwall and Stromness. There was no 
public road, by which a cart could pass, until about twenty years 
ago. Since that period, the statute labour has been employed 
m forming a public road; and this 'has for some time past been 
formed, and the greater part kept in a good state of repair. There 
IS only one harbour, and it is situated in the Bay of llouton.

where sloops and larger vessels lie in safety, and are protected by 
the Holm from south and south-east gales. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands on a bay, on the 
eastern shore, upwards of a mile east of Houton Head. The 
manse is delightfully situated on a rising ground, about half a 
mile west of the church, and well sheltered by hills on the west 
and north. The church was built in 1829, and contains 574 sit- 
tings, the accommodation allowed by law, and is every way com- 
fortable. The sittings are all free. The manse was built in 1789, 
and is in a good state of repair. The glebe, with hill pasture, 
would bring L. 15 of rent annually. The stipend is L. 150, of 
which L. 34, 3s. 8d. is paid by Government annually. The num- 
ber of Dissenters is considerable, being, by a late census, 107 
above fifteen years of age, and 142 below this age. They belong 
to the United Associate Synod. Part attend at Kirkwall, and 
part at Stromness. There is also one Baptist. 

The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed once a-year, 
in summer. The number of communicants is about 300, and 
about 100 attend on this occasion from neighbouring parishes. 
Collections are occasionally made for various purposes, and amount 
annually to from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2.f 

Education There are three schools ; one parochial, and two 

maintained by mortifications. The salary of the parochial school 
was, at the last augmentation, raised to L. 26. The fees, though 
fixed, are not demanded ; the master accepting, in place thereof, 
the gratuities, which may amount to from L. 5 to L. 6. The com- 
mon branches of education are taught, and the master has the 
legal accommodation. The Mortification schools were founded 
by natives. The first by Magnus Twatt, who lived and died in 
the service of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company. He ap- 
pointed by his will the heritors and kirk-session patrons. This 
school has been in operation upwards of thirty years, and has a 
fund of L. 700 laid out on landed security. The other has been 
only two years in operation, and was founded by James Tait, who, 
after having been many years in Hudson's Bay, died in Strom- 
ness, soon after instituting the school. The sum left by him for 
this purpose is L. 100, and he appointed the kirk-session patrons. 

 The Dissenters Iiavc incrc.iscd in llio s.ime proportion ns the rest of the popu- 
lation, and arc still about one-fourth of the population, 1841. 

+ In 1840 L..1 were collected for the five schemes of the General Assembly, and 
L.4 were collected by subscription for cases of destitution.

Tliis sum is lent on landed security, and the teaclier receives the' 
interest as salary. He is bound to teach for only one-half of the 
year, from October to April. He continues, however, teachino- 
the whole year, in consequence of the liberality of the people. 
James Tait also left L. 100 to the parish of Stromness, for the 
same purpose. 

Till of late, there were a few elderly people who could not 
read ; but, strange as it may appear, some of them could answer 
the questions of the Shorter Catechism correctly. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of the poor receiving 
supplies is 15, and distributions are made twice a-year, in March 
and August. As their circumstances are nearly equal, they re- 
ceive 4s. or 5s. each at each distribution. The weekly collections 
amount annually to from L. 9 to L. 10. There is a fund of about 
L. 50 at interest, which arose from savings from the collections, 
when the number of the poor on the list was less; and a donation 
of L. 10 from Lieutenant James Robertson, a native. The poor 
are not forward in applying for parochial relief, unless when their 
case is urgent. 

Inns.—Theve are three licensed inns, two of which retail ale 
only, and the other ale and whisky. The last is sufficient for the 
accommodation of travellers. The others are rather tippling- 
houses, and do not contribute to the improvement of morals. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

The progress of improvement since the publication of the last 
Statistical Account has been considerable. Green crops have in- 
creased a little, and will be more abundant when inclosing becomes 
more general. Much of the pasture grass around the old cultivated 
fields might be broken up to great advantage ; but this cannot be 
done, till green crops are more extensively raised. Some improve- 
ment in this respect may be expected, as the fiirmers' attention is 
now m a great measure withdrawn from the manufacture of kelp. 
Every tenant lias the privilege of hill pasture. 

The whole extent of the parish, exclusive of the Island of Cava, 
IS 1250 Scots acres in cultivation ; pasture, 1960 ; common, 6394 ': 
in all, 9604 Scots acres. The rental was ascertained, a few years 
ago, to be L. 575. 

It was long the practice of many of the young men to go to 
Hudson's Bay as labourers and mechanics, as carpenters, black- 
suntl.s, and brick layers. Few have gone in later limes, though 
tl'c wages have been raised. A labourer receives L. IG a-yoar

annually, for the first three years, with maintenance, while em- 
ployed at the factories. A mechanic. L. 25 a-year. The en- 
gagement is now for five years, and at the end of three years every 
one is advanced according to his merit. The great object was to 
save as much as might render his future days at home, easy and 
comfortable. 

Many of the young men also used to engage at Stromness for 
Greenland and Davis's Straits. There are only ten thus em- 
ployed, this season. 

The forming of the public road has been a great improvement, 
so that carts are now in general use ; whereas, formerly, loads were 
carried on the backs of horses. The lately built cottages are much 
neater than the old ones. The division of the common is also an 
improvement, and has induced a few families to come from neigh- 
bouring parishes to settle where the ground may be cultivated. 

It is°also pleasant to observe the importance given to education, 
which will give the rising generation and their succeeding race a 
very great advantage over their forefathers.

of Hoy, with the green island of Graemsay, which lies to the south, 
imparts a beauty to the scene, which, in clear weather, is often 
enhanced by the lofty mountains of Sutherland which appear in 
the distance. 

Extent, 8j-c. — The length of the parish is, about 5 miles : its 
breadth, 3f : and the square miles it contains, 12|. The south - 
most point is in 58° 56' 50" north latitude; northmost point, 
59° r 10' north latitude. It is of an irregular figure, and is 
bounded by the Sound of Hoy on the south ; by the parish 
of Sandwick, on the north ; by the lake of Stenness and an 
arm of the sea, on the east ; and by the Atlantic, on the west. 
The hills are situated on the north-west ; are naked and barren, 
being destitute of plantations. Still, they have their beauty. They 
rise above the level of the sea, to the height of from 100 to 400 
or 500 feet, — forming, at some places, a bold and elevated coast, 
on which the winds beat with tremendous fury, and often dash frail 
barks to pieces. There are various valleys, well cultivated ; and, 
being interspersed with meadow, they furnish hay for cattle in win- 
ter, and often compensate the deficiency of a scanty crop. 

There are no caves of any consequence, except one ; which has 
been rendered memorable from being the place where a ship- 
wrecked seaman was wonderfully preserved, during four days in 
the spring of 1834. This cave lies at the western extremity op- 
posite to Hoy Head, and is often visited by strangers since" that 
event. It is called Johnson's cave, from the name of the seaman 
who was saved in it. Adjoining to it, and on the same line of coast 
towards Sandwick, the rock scenery is bold and romantic, afford- 
ing shelter and a safe brooding place for the numerous sea fowl 
which abound here. The only headland, called the Black Craig, 
is directly opposite to Hoy head, and is of great use to seamen in 
directing them to the sound of Hoy, which lies between them— the 
only approach to the harbour of Stromness from the west. As this 

sound isofgreatimportancetovessels,affbrding them asafeapproach 
from the Atlantic to the harbour, to which, in stress of weather, 
they are frequently compelled to have recourse for shelter,— it may 
be proper to give a brief description of it. This cannot be more 
correctly done, than in the language employed by my predecessor, 
in his mmute and interesting Statistical Account of this parish : 
" Along the west coast of Stromness, at one league's distance from 
the shore, there is 40 or 50 fathoms deptl, of water. Tliere are 
no shoals in the channel of Hoy sound, on the side next this pa- 



28 



ORKNEY. 



rish, but two, which may be avoided by keeping two cable lengths 
from the shore ; one of these shoals is visible at two hours' ebb. 
As the coast can be seen at a great distance, and there are no 
shoals but these two, which are not dangerous, there are conse- 
quently few vessels wrecked on this coast. The velocity of the 
spring-tides in Hoy sound, is seven miles in the hour, that of neap- 
tides, three miles. It is high or slack water in Hoy sound at ten 
o'clock on the days of new and full moon, and in the harbour of 
Stromness at nine o'clock. The flood sets from the north-west. 
An hour before flood is perceived in the channel of Hoy sound, a 
stream sets from the north, along the west coast, keeping this side 
of the sound, and continues in this direction ; at half-ebb, another 
stream sets from the south, along the south side of the sound, and 
continues till high water. These streams, when known and at- 
tended to, facilitate the entrance of shipping into the harbour of 
Stromness." 

Since the date of the Old Account, it appears that the increase 
of wrecks has been considerable. A light-house is greatly need- 
ed for the guidance of vessels through the Sound of Hoy : and we 
are happy to learn that this has attracted the attention of Her Ma- 
jesty's Commissioners. 

n. — Civil History. 

Itmay be mentioned, that the greater number of vessels which our 
enlightened nation has sent out to explore the world, and extend the 
knowledge of geography and the boundaries of science, have, in ge- 
neral, remained some days in the harbour of Stromness. The Dis- 
covery ships which were commanded by Captain Cook, on their 
return from that memorable expedition which proved fatal to that 
illustrious navigator, lay here two weeks ; and the officers presented 
some of the inhabitants with various curiosities, which they fondly 
preserve as precious mementos of friendship. Sir John Franklin, 
distincruished alike for his piety and heroism, both ingoing out and 
returningfrom his northern expedition, remained here for some time. 
This parish was also the first place where Sir John Ross planted jus 
foot on British earth, on returning from his last northern voyage, 
when it was thought by the nation at large, that that gallant officer 
had perished in the expedition. 

Land-oioners.— The principal land-owners are, Thomas I ollex- 
fen Esq of Cairston ; William G. Watt, Esq. of Breckness. 
There arc also Crown lands. The number of heritors altogether, 
is 78.

Parochial Refjistcrs. — The parochial registers extend back to 
the year 1695; but they are neither voluminous, nor have they 
been regularly kept, — except under the former incumbent. 

Antiquities. — In the burial-place, there is the ruin of an old 
church, which probably was erected when Popery prevailed, or 
perhaps at a later period. Near it, there are the remains of a build- 
ing, which originally occupied a considerable space of ground, 
and is generally supposed to have been an establishment of monks, 
hence called Monk's House. About three-quarters of a mile to 
the west, stands a venerable building, which was erected by Bishop 
Graham, one of the last Bishops of Orkney under Episcopacy. 
Above the door, the bishop's initials, G. G., with the Episcopal 
arms, and the year of its erection, 1633, are inscribed. There 
are still tumuli to be seen in the parish. 

III. — Population. 
According to the Old Statistical Account, "in the year 1754, 
there were 1000 persons in the town of Stromness. In the year 
1794, there were 1344 souls, and yet the whole population is 
about the same as that given in 1754; from which, it appears 
that the population of the country has decreased, in proportion as 
that of the town had increased. By an accurate census taken in 
June 1794, the population is as follows:" 

No. of Houses. No. of Families. Males. Females. Total. 
Stromness parish, 184 184 346 449 793 

town, 222 342 493 851 1344 

Total, 406 526 839 1300 2139 

Persons to a family in the parish of Stromness, nearly 4. In 
the town of Stromness, nearly 4 to a family and 6 to a house. 
Proportion of males to females, parish of Stromness, nearly as 3 
males to 4 females. Town, nearly 12 males to 21 females. The 
great disproportion of males to females in the town of Stromness 
is occasioned by the young men going abroad to various parts of 
the world; to the Greenland fishery, Hudson's Bay, the coal 
trade ; and many are to be found in his Majesty's navy." 

In 1831, the Government census gave the following results : —

Notwithstanding the pecuhar temptations to which the peo- 
ple of this parish are exposed, from the great influx of shipping 
and other circumstances, they are, upon the whole, a moral peo- 
ple. They are most regular in their attendance in the house of 
God ; and, though they come far short of that standard which 
the word of God prescribes, and many of them are indifferent to 
their eternal interests, there are still not a few who are aHve to the 
great realities of eternity ; appreciate highly their precious privi- 
\ees, and studv to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all 
thtngs, by maintaining a life and conversation becoming the Gospel. 

At a former period, smuggling existed to some extent, with its 
demoralizing effects ; but now it is rare.

The undivided common is capable of very little improvement, 
being mostly hill and moss ; and there is much of it, that has been 
rendered incapable of cultivation, by the surface being removed 
from it for fuel and litter,— a practice which still prevails. 

Rent of Land—The average rent of arable land per acre is 
10s. Near the town, the inhabitants pay L. 2 for grazing a m.lk

bourers and country artisans. Price of an iron iiloiigli, L.'2, 2s.;

Comparatively little attention has been paid to agricultural im- 
provement : the land is constantly cropped alternately with oats 
and bear, with only as much in potatoes as supplies the family. 
This must necessarily tend to impoverish the soil, and render it less 
productive. The leases being, in many cases, only from year 
to year, — the smallness of the farms, the wretched steadings, and 
the want of enclosures, — all combine to operate against the occu- 
pier as well as the proprietor. Indeed, there are many farmers 
who do not entirely depend upon the produce of their crops for 
paying their rent ; for they are often obliged to seek in the pro- 
lific sea, that subsistence which the earth would yield, were great- 
er care taken of it, and a better system of culture practised. 

Qiiai-ries. — There is a slate quarry on the west side of the parish, 
from which, it is observed, in the former Account, that from 30,000 
to 40,000 slates were annually sold. " They are strong, thick, last 
long, and are the best in the county." Slates are still taken from 
this quarry ; but, though they are better adapted to the climate than 
Easdale slates, hey are in general not so much used, forming 
rather a weighty roof. There are no proper stone quarries. The 
stones which are used in the erection of houses are quarried from 
the shore, and conveyed to the town in large boats. Some years ago, 
a Company commenced working a granite quarry near the town, 
with the intention of shipping for a proper market; but, though 
the granite was thought of a superior kind, the company, from want 
of capital, did not proceed with the undertaking. 

A lead mine was wrought, eighty years ago ; but the ore was not 
in sufficient quantity to defray the expense, and remunerate the 
worker. , 

Fisheries.— D\xrmgi\\e three last years, a few enterprising indi- 
viduals have endeavoured to establish a lierring-fishing station at 
Stromness ; and, though they have not been so successful as could 
have been wished, they are still resolved to persevere. Should 
they succeed, their undertaking will tend greatly to promote the 
prosperity of the town, and be of essential service to the fisher- 
men, as It will enable them to remain at home, instead of going 
to other stations in the islands,— which must be attended with 
considerable expense. Tn the months of May and June 1837, 
there were about 2000 crans taken. 

There are, also, some boats employed every season, in the 



3g ORKNEY. 

months of May and June, in fishing lobsters. At an average, for 
the last twelve years, there have been 11,622 lobsters shipped 
annually for the London market, by Gravesend smacks, which call 
here twice a week during the fishing season. 

Some sloops engage in the cod fishing,-though this fishmg is 
not carried on, nearly to the same extent as in some of the other

Mmufactures.-'Qdove the duty was taken off barilla, there 
was a considerable quantity of kelp manufactured ; but since the 
price has fallen so greatly, it scarcely remunerates the proprietor; 
and the consequence is, that very little is now done in the manu- 
facturing of that article. Whether this will ultimately be advan- 
taceous or disadvantageous to the country, isa question upon which 
a diversity of opinion prevails. We only remark that proprietors 
evidently placed more reliance than they ought to have done upon 
the manufLuring of that precarious article and thereby.. 
the improvement of their lands, which would have afforded them a 
more permanent benefit. 

There are a few straw plait manufacturers, who employ a num- 
ber of women inthe town as well as in the country This manu- 
facture has been, for some time past, upon the decline ; and being 
atl times dependent upon the caprice of fashion has lately af- 
forded a scanty subsistence to the many young females who totally 
dtnd on it for their support. They are now dlowed o plait 
• th ir own homes, which has been found more conducive to heir 

being superseded by the perfect machinery now in use. 

Naviffation.-TL shipping belonging to Stromness has o la 
vears greatly increased, and is at present in a very prosperous 
nnditin The kind of vessel which is preferred is the schooner, 
i feund best suited for the trade in which it ,s employed

The Honourable Hudson's Bay Company's ships call here on 
their outward passage in the month of June, and take with them 
a number of men to be employed as labourers, artisans, &amp;c 
The average number of men who have here been hired yearly 
to go out fo I heir settlements in North America, for the last four 
years, is from 35 to 40. Under the sanction of this Company 
missionaries are sent out by the Church of England, and Wes- 
leyan Methodists. It would be of great consequence could a mis- 
sionary or two be sent out by the General Assembly of our church, 
as there are so many men there who belong to Orkney, by whom 
the boon would be greatly prized.

have been engaged, for the last seven years, on an average, 292 
men annually. The number at one time was much greater. 

V Parochial Economy. 

The only town in the parish is Stromness. At the begmnmg 
of last century, it is observed in the former Statistical Account, 
" it was an inconsiderable village, consisting only of halt a-dozen 
houses with slated roofs, and a few scattered huts, the first mha- 
bited by two gentlemen of landed property, and two or three small 
traders, the last by a few fishermen and mechanics." In 1719, it 
v.as assessed by the burgh of Kirkwall, and continued tributary 
thereto till May 1743, when it sought to effect its freedom, and 
happily succeeded; for, by a decision of the Court of Session 
confirmed by the House of Lords, it was fully emancipated and 
thus became instrumental in obtaining freedom for the other villages 
in Scotland which had formerly been tributary to royal burghs. 

It has since rapidly increased in population and in trade, which 
is to be traced in a great measure to the safety and commodious- 
ness of the harbour,-on the west of which the town is si uated. 
There are few places which afford a better or more beautiful site 
for the erection of a town. It is composed chiefly of one street, 
which extends three-quarters of a mile on the side of the harbour ; 
but the houses have been erected without any regular plan, i he 
only obiect which the first proprietors appear to have had in view, 
in the erection of their houses, was to secure access to the harbour. 
Till very lately, the street was not sufficiently wide to admit ot a 
passage for carts and other vehicles. Some improvements, how- 
ever, have lately been made upon the town, and especially upon 
Z Street. It still admits of many, and never can possess that 
regular appearance which its fine situation so well deserves. 
Tn the year 1815, Stromness was constituted a Burgh o barony, 
.nd two magistrates, with nine councillors, have since held audio- 
rity L it; b'ut having no funds, and there being no jail nearer than 
Kirkwall, their power is greatly curtailed. 

MeaJ of Communication.-There is regular communication 
between this parish and Kirkwall three times a-week, by a g.g 
w kh conveys the mail. Last June, a mail-coach commenced 
Tu nL, daily, in place of the gig. It was an interestii as we 
Is a no el scene, to see a regular mail-coach in uHma Tkule. I 
 ' n matter of regret, that such encouragement was noc 
irairenl prop'riet'ors to continue running the coach 

during winter. 



STROMNESS. 35 

• 

The distance betwixt Stromness and Kirkwall, the only towns 
in the county, is about 15 miles; and of late the road has been 
considerably improved. There is a post-office in town, and a 
south mail via Kirkwall arrive Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, 
when not detained at the Pentland Frith, which is often the case, 
especially in winter. 

Enclosures are comparatively rare ; which, to a great extent, re- 
tards agricultural improvement. Cattle, horses, and swine, which 
are numerous, being allowed to go at large after the crop is ga- 
thered in, greatly injure the fields in a climate subject to rains 
during so many months in the year. It also prevents the regular 
rotation of crops, which is so indispensable to proper farming. 

The estate of Cairston is, however, an exception. There is a 
considerable part of it well inclosed : it is also farmed on the 
most improved system, by the proprietor, Mr Pollexfen. It pos- 
sesses many beautiful fields, which yield hay, potatoes, bear, and 
oats, of a superior quality. In the vicinity of the town, a few pro- 
prietors have made some inclosures, which have increased the value 
of their property. 

Harbour.— T\\e harbour is one of the most commodious in the 
north of Scotland, and forms a safe retreat to all sorts of vessels. 
It is frequented during the winter and .spring months by many ves- 
sels in the coasting-trade, as well as foreign vessels, which find in it 
a safe anchorage, and are well sheltered from the west wind, which 
generally is most boisterous, by a hill above the town. It lies on 
the east side of the parish, and is approached by the south, i.s about 
a mile in length, and somewhat less than half a mile in breadth. 

There are two beautiful little holms or small islands which 
bound the harbour on the east, and render the anchorage still more 
safe and secure. 

Upon the south side of the harbour, on the property of Ness, a 
patent slip, with the necessary apparatus, has been lately erected, 
capable of receiving a vessel of 400 or 500 tons. This was greatly 
needed, from the number of vessels which pass through the Pent- 
land Frith, and are often compelled to take refuge in the harbour, 
and to obtain the repairs which their disabled state requires. This 
shp was . erected in April 1836 : and in the course of the three 
succeeding years, thirty vessels were received upon it and repaired, 
—their tonnage, ,'3368 tons. 

Ecclesiastical Statc.-The parish church is situate in the town,

the most convenient site for the mass of the population. The 
greatest distance from the extremity of the parish, is about five miles. 
It was erected in the year 1814. It is in a tolerable state of re- 
pair ; but, being much exposed to violent storms, the roof almost 
every year requires repair. It has accommodation for 1200. There 
are forty free sittings, and two long seats, which extend along 
the greater part of the middle passage. The manse was erected 
in the year 1 780. It underwent repair during the incumbency ot 
my predecessor, and before I entered it in the spring of 1833. 

The glebe, including what is occupied by house, garden, and a 
meadow, is about ten acres in extent ; if let, its rent would amount 
to about L.6 per annum. 

The stipend is the minimum, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion 



Thee is no other church in the parish, except a small Secession 
church. The minister receives L. 120 per annum, and L. 12 lor 

communion elements. , i- u j ru i 

. Divine worship is well attended both in the Established Church 

and in the Dissenting Chapel. it . n- i 

There are 1000 persons in communion with the Established 
Church Of that number, about 900 communicate each time at 
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which is dispensed twice in 
the year. About 400 are in communion with the becession. 

/here is in connection with" the Established Church, a Bible 
and Missionary Society; average amount of yearly contributions 
bout L.20. There is also a Society of a similar nature in con- 
'nection with the Dissenters. Of the amount of its contributions I 

'''"i:gre::i; we have three or four collections during the y.ar for

fem in the parish. Eight of these schools are in the urgh

scliools depend upon the fees received. The five female scliools are 
in the town, and the fees afford very inadequate support to the teach- 
ers. In the parish school the branches taught are, reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. In the subscription schools, in addition to these 
branches, Latin, Greek, French, and mathematics are taught. 
The teacher of the other school in town has a class for Navigation, 
which is greatly required here. In the female schools, the com- 
mon branches, viz. English, writing, arithmetic, and sewing are 
taught; and, in one or two of the most respectable, music and 
drawing. 

The parochial teacher has the minimum salary. The subscrip- 
tion school teachers receive about L.50 per annum. 

We believe there are few betwixt the years of six and fifteen 
who cannot read. In general, the parents, however poor, make 
every effort to send their children to school for a short time, to be 
instructed in the elementary branches of education, especially 
reading. With respect to the fatherless, in most cases which 
have come under our notice, some benevolent person is found 
willing to get them instructed in reading. 

We feel called upon to say, that there are few places in Scot- 
land, with such a population as Stromness, where there is such need 
of an efficient endowed school. There being no endowed school 
in the town, and the fees of the subscription ones being hiah, the 
poor are precluded from the benefit of proper instruction ; and when 
It is known that there are numerous widows whose husbands have 
perished at sea, left with their large families helpless and de- 
pendent, unable to provide for their sustenance, far less to afford 
them a good education, it must be evident, that, were a proper 
school with an endowment established, it would confer an invalu- 
able blessing upon an interesting but long-neglected community 
It IS hoped that something may be done for this place by the Ge- 
neral Assembly's Education Committee. The Sabbath school 
connected with the Established Church was instituted in the spring 
ot 1830; and was attended at first by betwixt 200 and 300 It

Library.— k public library was established, nearly twenty years 
ago. It consists of a number of valuable books, and the leading 
reviews of the day. For some years past, novels have been ex- 
cluded, and works of a more solid character substituted in their 
place. The annual subscription is 7s. 

There is a Sabbath school library in connection with the Esta- 
blished Church, and also one in connection with the Dissentmg 
congregation. 

Friendly Society .—T\\\ very lately, a Friendly Society existed 
in the town, but it was some years ago dissolved. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— average number of poor per- 
sons upon the roll who receive quarterly allotments, is 85. The 
highest allowance is 4s. per quarter : but in general 2s. or 2s. 6d. 
is the sum allotted quarterly. It. addition to this, however, some 
allowance is made during winter for fuel ; and in case of sickness or 
old ae, the elder of the district where the pauper resides is em- 
powered to give something additional. Our sole dependence for 
supporting the poor, is on the amount of collections made at the 
church doors on Sabbath, and the fees for proclamation of banns, 
and the use of mortcloth. The ordinary collections for the last 
eight years amount at an average to about L. 50 annually; and 
extraordinary, to about L.20. In general the people are so very 
poor, that they evince no reluctance to seek parochial re let. 

There is no prison in Stromness. This greatly weakens the 
authority of the magistrates, and is unfavourable to the morals of 
this populous district. Were an efficient jail erected, it would in- 
timidate the lawless, and be an effectual means of preventing crime, 
and the lesser delinquencies.

form a museum, and to collect specimens of the islands produc- 
tions, birds, fishes, shells, &amp;c. Considerable success has already 
crowned the laudable undertaking. A number o .curiosities, do- 
mestic and foreign, have already been placed in the museum. A

Fuel. — Peat is the fuel most generally used, and is procured 
from a moss in the parish. The inhabitants of the town are sup- 
plied in a great measure from the islands, where the peats are of a 
superior quality. The more wealthy and respectable families use 
coals, which are brought from Newcastle and Sunderland. 

MiSCELLANEOTTS OBSERVATIONS. 

Since the former Statistical Account was published, many im- 
provements have taken place ; for instance, the increase of carts 
from 12 to 140, and of ploughs in the same proportion, demon- 
strates that there must have been some advancement made in agri- 
cultural improvement. Still, much remains to be done ; and un- 
less a better system of farming, and a regular rotation of crops, be 
adopted, more substantial and comfortable farm-steadings erected, 
and the lands to a certain extent enclosed, agriculture must remain 
stationary, and the peasantry cannot be raised to that respectabi- 
lity which is so desirable, and so conducive to the interest of the 
proprietor, and comfort of the tenant. The number of horses in 
the parish is 204; of ploughs, 91. 

The burgh has greatly increased in wealth and prosperity, dur- 
ing the last forty years, from the regular increase of the shipping, 
If the herring-fishing succeed, and a station be established, it will 
tend still further to promote the prosperity of the place.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Situation and Extent.— The parish is of a triangular form, 
bounded by the parish of Walls on the south side; the parishes of 
Orphir, Stennis, and Stromness upon the east and north sides; and 
the Atlantic Ocean to the westward. The parish from north-west 
to south-east is about 9 or 10 miles long, and in general is about 
6 miles broad. It may be called a very hilly or mountamous dis- 
trict. One of the hills in particular is so steep in many places as 
to be almost inaccessible. 

The land or arable ground in this place is generally wet and 
spongy ; the soil hght, and better calculated for grass than for grain. 

Grserasay is a very small island,— a mile and a half in length, 
and a mile in breadth. Its population in 1831 amounted to 225.

PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. CHARLES CLOUSTON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name Sandwick is no doubt derived from the sandy 
bay, which is the principal one on the west coast between Strom- 
ness and Birsay, wich signifying a bay. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The extreme length of the parish is 
fully 6 miles : but various calculations and measurements convince 
me that its mean length is about 41 miles, and its mean breadth 
about 3|. It is bounded by Birsay on the north ; by Harray and 
the loch of Stenness on the east ; by the same loch and Stromness 
on the south ; and by the Atlantic on the west. 

Hills, Sfc. — This parish cannot be denominated mountainous, 
nor even hilly, when compared with the neighbouring ones, being 
more Qat and cultivated than any of them ; but a range of hills 
forms its west boundary except at tiie bay ; and from these the 



42 



ORKNEY. 



hills of Gyran and Lingafiold stretch eastward near its south side, 
and those of Vestrafiold and Yonbell at its north boundary. These, 
as well as the lower lands and valleys remote from the sea, slope 
gently eastward towards the loch of Stenness, forming part of that 
extensive amphitheatre in the centre of the west mainland, the 
area of which is little elevated above the loch. Vestrafiold, or the 
west hill, is the highest, and may be about 300 or 400 feet above 
the level of the sea, A httle east of the Sandy bay are eminences 
or low sandy hills, called Sandfiold and Kierfiold, which seem to 
be formed in a great measure of the sand blown from the bay by 
the west wind, which is prevalent and violent. The latter of these 
hills was formerly considered beautiful for its verdure, as it was 
covered with grass to the summit, but for some years it has been 
forced to submit to the plough, and I suppose it is more profitable, 
though less pleasing to the eye than formerly. 

Coast, Caves, c. — The west coast extends about four miles and 
a half, and is precipitous at all places except the bay, the highest 
part being between 200 and 300 feet perpendicular. There are 
many caves on the coast that form the favourite retreat of pigeons. 
The softer portions of rock being washed away much more quickly 
than the harder, there are many deep indentations, or " geoes," as 
they are called, where the soft parts have given way, and in some 
cases the hard portions still remain as insulated pillars, within a stone 
throw of the precipice, forming very picturesque objects ; hut the 
most remarkable thing produced in this manner is the Hole of Row, 
which is a high natural arch through the peninsular crag forming 
the south side of the bay, caused by two whin dikes, occurring so 
near each other, that the intervening strata have been pulverised 
and washed out by the sea, as high as its waves had power to do 
so. Immediately south of the arch, the stones on the top of the 
precipice are arranged like those on a beach by the force of the 
waves, and, on the top of one of these crags, I once picked up a 
lump of India-rubber covered with barnacles. Not far from Row, 
on the nearest part of the coast, is an immense rock, which is well 
known to have been carried a considerable distance by the sea ; it 
is 16 feet long, 6 broad, and 3 thick, and weighs, according to my 
calculation, about 24 tons. 

Meteorology.— I have kept a register of the weather for the last 
twelve years ; the latter half only in this parish, and the former 



yiold means liill.

in the manse of Stromness, where there is no great difference in 
the chmate. As the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, 
the direction and force of the wind, with the state of the weather, 
were noted twice a-day, at ten a. m. and ten p. m., during all 
that period ; it would occupy too much space to insert the whole of 
that register here ; but the following tables, showing the mean state 
of the barometer and thermometer for each month and year, may 
be interesting, as applicable to Orkney in general, and must be 
pretty accurate, being formed from extensive data.

Of meteors, the polar lights are the most remarkable here, 
being often extremely brilliant and beautiful. 

The west or south-west wind is understood to be the strongest, 
and the stone and lime on that side of a house most exposed to it, 
are generally the first to give way. A gale from that quarter is 
frequently prognosticated by the great swell of the sea, which rages 
even during a perfect calm. On this subject, 1 take the liberty of 
repeating an observation, which I have made elsewhere. " This 
great swell, or ' sea,' as it is here called, generally indicates a storm 
in a distant part of the ocean, which may reach Orkney a day pr 
two afterwards ; hence, on the west coast, this great swell is con- 
sidered a prognostic of west wind. From this we infer, 1st, that 
the agitation caused by the wind on the surface of the ocean tra- 
vels faster than the wind itself ; and, '2d, that the breeze begins 
to windward, and takes some time to reach the point towards 
which it proceeds to leeward, which tends to overturn the usually 
received theory as to the cause of winds. Sometimes, however, 
the distant storm which causes this agitation does not reach these 
islands at all." In proof of this, I may mention, that, in August 
1831, from the 9th to the 13th inclusive, the great swell of the sea 
is remarked in my register, every day being also marked calm, with 
the barometer high and steady. Afterwards, however, I learnt that 
on the 7th and 8th of that month, there was a gale in latitude 57° 
21' north, longitude 13° 15' west, which damaged a vessel that 
put back to Stromne-ss to repair; and on the 1 1th it began at Bar-

badoes, and devastated that and other West India islands; but the 
gale never reached Orkney, though its effects on the sea were so 
conspicuous. 

Climate. — Our insular situation prevents the extremes of tem- 
perature that are felt in continents of such a high latitude, the 
surrounding ocean tempering the heat of summer, and the cold of 
winter ; so that for more than twelve years, the thermometer has 
only once fallen so low as 18° of Fahrenheit, and the snow does not 
lie so long here, as in the more inland parts of the south of Scot- 
land, or, I believe, the north of England. Indeed, the mean tem- 
perature of every month was above the freezing point, except that 
of February 1838. Our mean annual temperature is 46° 25', and 
the mean height of the barometer 29.640, as will be seen from the 
annexed tables ; but the nature of our climate will be more cor- 
rectly understood by comparing the mean temperature of each 
month, as there stated, with that of other places. The highest hill 
commands an extensive view, not only of the west mainland, but 
of part of the north and south isles, and from it, and other 
elevated grounds, may be seen the. hills of Hoy, terminat- 
ing in stupendous precipices ; and, in calm and clear weather, 
those of Sutherland in the distance, stretching out towards 
Cape Wrath, add much to the beauty of the scene; but during a 
storm from the west it is awfully grand. The huge accumulations 
of water that then roll after each other, foaming with terrible vio- 
lence to the shore, impress the mind with their irresistible power, 
and might well give a stranger a feeling of insecurity; and, when 
they dash themselves against the precipice, it seems half sunk, for 
a time, like a wrecked vessel amid the waves ; sheets of spray are 
thrown far up into the air, and carried over all the country, makino- 
springs a mile from the coast brackish, for some days, and encrustt 
ing every thing with salt, even fifteen or twenty miles off. I am 
told by those living a few hundred yards from the spot, that the 
floors of their cottages are shaken by the violence with which 
the waves strike the crags; and I have seen innumerable sea insects 
alive oh their summits, and even a limpet adhering to them after 
such a storm ; also numerous fragments of the slaty stone, some 
of them a foot long, which had been whirled into the air, and had 
penetrated six inches into the soil in falling. 

Our chmate, in short, is more remarkable for dampness and 
storms, than for cold ; the atmosphere being often loaded with 
sea spray in winter, and moistened with the constant evaporation 
m summer. Pulmonary and rheumatic complaints seem to be pre-

valent, owing to this peculiarity of t'lie climate, and our sudden 
and frequent changes of weather. Some cases of cramp may also 
be ascribed to the dampness; and a neighbouring clergyman, who 
is afflicted with loss of voice, has, more than once, been immedi- 
ately cured by the air of Edinburgh. Dyspeptic complaints are 
very common among the peasantry, but they are probably caused 
by poor diet. 

Hydrography. — The Atlantic flows up into the bay on the west 
side, for about half a mile, and the Loch of Stenness, about a mile 
on the east, leaving little more than two miles at one place, be- 
tween these two great waters. The Loch of Skaill or Aith, which 
is nearly a mile long, and half that breadth, lies nearly in this 
space ; and the Loch of Glumly, which is more than half of these 
dimensions, is a little south of that hne. These lochs are of no 
great depth or importance, and contain no fish except eels ; but 
the two latter turn mills, on their passage to the sea and Loch of 
Stenness, and they relieve the tameness of the scenery, — their 
surface, when smooth as a mirror, forming a striking contrast to 
the troubled ocean hard by ; and the sunset in fine summer even- 
ings is most splendid, as seen from the manse, when the rays 
are reflected from the sea, and also from one of the lochs. 

Geology and Mineralogy— Having been requested by neigh- 
bouring clergymen to include their parishes in the description of 
the natural history of my own, some branches of it will be found 
more general in their application to other parishes, than would 
otherwise have been necessary or proper. This is particularly 
the case with the following remarks on geology. 

The rocks of this parish and the adjoining district, I shall de- 
scribe under the four following heads, viz. L Granite ; IL Slates 
or flagstones; III. Sandstone; IV. Trap rocks. 

1. Granite.— The district where this rock occurs has been 
lately ascertained to be much more extensive than it was for- 
merly thought to be; for I have traced it, in company with the 
Messrs Anderson of Inverness, from Graemsay to this parish. 
The town of Stromness occupies the southern end of this tract, 
which is about one mile broad, and extends from the Island of 
Graemsay, which is the southern boundary, in a northerly direction, 
for about six miles, till it passes out at a precipice in this parish, 
on the west coast, where the Atlantic washes its base, and veils 
it from the eye of the geologist. The sound which separates

At 



Graemsay from the mainland, and is less than a mile broad, in- 
terrupts the examination of this rock ; but there can be no doubt 
of its being continued under water. In some places, it has no 
appearance of a slaty structure ; in others, it has so distinctly, 
though not regularly stratified, and is properly gneiss ; and at one 
place, discovered by Professor Jameson, it passes into mica slate, 
containing garnets. Hornblende rock is also found in this tract, 
but there is no extensive exposure of it. In general, it consists 
of a grey granite or gneiss, which is traversed by veins of quartz 
or felspar, but more frequently the latter, and exhibits the usual 
phenomena of such a district, in the interruption and shifting of 
the veins. A few years ago, L. 300 were laid out in quarrying 
some of this gneiss, and cutting it into paving-stones for the Lon- 
don market, but it did not succeed. In one place, the workmen 
came in contact with a rock containing a little galena and pyrites, 
but, with this trifling exception, it contains no ores nor useful mi- ' 
nerals. Between this rock and the schist, there is a belt of con- 
glomerate, at such places as are exposed, of 50 or 100 yards 
broad, containing pieces of gneiss, quartz, and felspar, imbedded, 
from a microscopic size to that of a turnip. This belt contains 
nothing worth remarking, except small veins of galena at one 
place, which are of no value. It gradually loses the conglomerated 
structure ; and the succeeding strata, though they sometimes al- 
ternate, generally assume more of the character of those that rest 
on them, till at last they pass into 

II. Sandstone Flag, or Secondary Slate or Schist. — This rests upon 
the conglomerate, and dips from it wherever I have been able to find 
it in contact. The best exposures on the west side of the granite 
are on the north shore of Graemsay, point of Ness, in Stromness, 
and south-west coast of this parish, where the strata slope west. 
On the east side of the granite, it is only the strata in immediate ' 
contact with it that dip east; for, in the course of 100 yards, they 
gradually dip more in conformity with the general dip of the coun- 
try ; but they may be seen dipping east on the shore of Graemsay, 
and at the point of Garson, in Stromness ; and again they dip 
north-east, at the Burn of Cairston, and at the north-east boundary 
of the granite in this parish. 

Of this slate, almost all the Orkney Islands are composed, or 
at least most of the low land and shelving shores, while many of 
the surrounding hills and precipices are formed of the superimposed 
sandstone. It forms a great part of Stromness, and almost all Sand- 
wick and Birsay. It can hardly be described as one rock, as it is

in fact a succession of argillaceous, siliceous and calcareous slates or 
schists of different thickness, hardness, colour, and composition ; 
but the most common, and that which is most esteemed for building, 
is when recently quarried, of a dark blue colour, like a hard slate 
clay, and breaks at determinate angles, diamond-shaped, thus giv- 
ingthe builders easy work; and some quarries afford excellent paving 
stones of four or five feet square, perfectly smooth.  By exposure, 
however, they acquire a rusty reddish or yellowish colour, from the 
decomposition of the iron with which most of these rocksare impreg- 
nated. These strata may be found at all inclinations, from hori- 
zontal to perpendicular, but in general they dip to the west, at an 
angle about 20°. They are generally in thin strata, and in one 
place are quarried pretty extensively for roofing slate, which is not 
good enough to export. In part of this quarry the slates are 
beautifully marked by dendritic iron pyrites. The texture is ap- 
parently homogeneous, but when exposed long to the action, of the 
weather the softer parts are worn away, and the harder portions 
project much, thus demonstrating its compound nature. This is 
particularly the case along several of the precipices that bound 
the west coast, where the effect of the weather is increased by the 
exposed situation, sea-spray, &amp;c. and forms the figured stones 
which have been considered so curious by many ; and indeed the 
forms that they assume are sometimes exceedingly fantastic, being 
in the shape of concentric circles, ovals, squares, or triangles, ac- 
cording to the original mixture of the stones in the different stra- 
ta, but most frequently the figures are spread irregularly on the 
surface like hieroglyphics. In some places they alternate with strata 
of a hard, dark limestone, which is nearly the colour of the strata be- 
tween which it lies, and is burnt for lime, but not extensively, as the 
distance we have to bring our coals renders it expensive. In other 
places, the strata have a bituminous appearance on the surface, or 
little cavities which are filled up with a soft bitumen or petroleum, 
occasionally glance coal  This has excited some hope of dis- 
covering coal in this county, which would be an mcalculable 
benefit to all the north of Scotland; but the whole county is so 
intersected by the sea, and there are such plain and beautiful ex- 
posures of all the strata along our shores, that it is hardly possi-

ble for coal lo be present in any quantity, without its croppino-s or 
outgoings being perceived somewhere. 

Fossil fish and vegetables occur in several places, even among the 
strata within half a-mile of the granite. All the species of these ich- 
thyolites are far from being completely collected and known yet; 
butitis believed that they prove these strata to be identical with the 
slates of Caithness, and of the southern shores of the Moray 
Frith. Flinty slate and chert, passing into lydian stone, abound 
in these slates. Sandstone, some hundred yards thick, lies in im- 
mediate contact with the conglomerate on the north end of the 
primitive district on the west coast of the parish. It has that dia- 
gonal arrangement of the layers called false stratification. It is 
much more hard and crystalline than the new red sandstone, of a 
dark grey or brown colour, and is the only good quarry for mill- 
stones in this county. 

Vems of galena are not uncommon, and one near the manse of 
Stromness has been worked for about 100 yards, but long since 
forsaken, as a speculation which would not pay. It is here asso- 
ciated with common heavy spar, and a mineral is found in small 
quantity along side of it, composed of carbonate of strontia, and 
sulphate of barytes, which has been described by Professor Traill 
as an entirely new mineral, and named Stromnite, or Barystrontia- 
nite. The other minerals that this part of the formation-contains 
are of no consequence, viz. quartz or rock crystal in veins, calca- 
reous spar in veins. Iron and copper pyrites, the former, most 
commonly in veins or nodules and heavy spar, occur sometimes of 
considerable thickness. 

111. Sandstone.— Th\s rock lies upon the slates, and is bymost geo- 
logists considered the old red sandstone. It occurs neither in this pa- 
rish, Stromness, nor Birsay, to which my observations on the slates 
refer ; but to understand the position of these rocks, it is necessary 
to trace them to Hoy, south of Stromness, where this sandstone 
rests on the slates. There it rises to the height of 1600 feet 
above the level of the sea, in the Ward Hill. It varies much in 
colour, but IS generally gray, red, or brown ; and is disposed in 
strata, which are often so soft that it is not much used for building. 
Wrnment, however, employed it for erecting martello towers, 
which are fast crumbling away. This sandstone is easily decom- 
posed by the action of the sea, and forms numerous caves and fan- 
tastic forms along the precipices where it occurs, of which the in- 
sulatea rock, called the Old Man of Hoy, that is so conspicuous

is formed of the same strata as the precipice from which it is dis- 
joined ; and as this is nearly 1000 feet perpendicular, it affords a 
magnificent exhibition of the strata. The top is red sandstone, 
and the base on which it i-ests amygdaloid. In this precipice, I 
found, about twenty years ago, a fine vein of manganese ore, from 
which beautiful specimens maybe procured, and in the other side 
of the island, that species of iron ore called brown hematite, is 
found in such quantity, that it was at one time worked. 

IV. Trap Bocks. — These occur as greenstone, basalt, porphyry, 
and amygdaloid. All the rocks formerly noticedare frequently inter- 
sected with whin dikes, from one to ten feet thick, which are some- 
times shifted and contorted, but generally run directly west by com- 
pass, the flag having a seam in that direction, till they disappear 
under the bed of the ocean. In the space of eight miles along 
the precipices on the west coast of Stromness and this parish, I 
have counted eighteen separate dikes of this kind, and, including 
Birsay, I have no doubt there are more than two dozen. The 
strata of the slate in contact with these dikes are generally con- 
torted and pulverized, and easily washed away, leaving narrow 
inlets or " geoes." One of these, nine feet thick, cuts through 
the north-west extremity of the granite, and another bounds on its 
south-east side a mass of amygdaloid, containing zeolite, calcare- 
ous spar, green earth, &amp;c. in Walls. The only place where I 
know of its overflovring the secondary rocks is one which I disco- 
vered about twelve years ago in the west side of Hoy, where there 
is a bed of it fully 100 feet thick, and, I believe, several miles in • 
extent, in the middle of the sandstone. Near the same bed, on 
the sea shore of Rackwick, I also found a fine vein of fibrous gyp- 
sum, an inch and a-half thick. Porphyry also occurs ; and Dr Hib- 
bert observed an interesting spot of it near the granite in Cairston. 

V. Alluvial Rocks. — The alluvial formation of Orkney is not par- 
ticularly interesting ; but we have plenty of clay, in most places abun- 
dance of peat, though there is little in Sandwick, and, in many dis- 
tricts, marl. Bog -iron ore is very common on some of our hills ; and 
along our sandy bays, nature frequently erects a barrier of a sort of 
indurated sand, apparently formed by the mixture of siliceous parti- 
cles with fragments of shells, which serve for cement. In our peat- 
mosses, roots of large trees are often dug up, and they have also 
been found in Sandwick Bay, where they are generally covered by 
the ocean. Hazel-nuts, deers' iiorns, &amp;c. have likewise repeatedly 
been found imbedded in our peat,— and this makes it probable 



SANDWICK. 51 

that forests have formerly grown in these islands, where there is 
nothing now that deserves to be called a tree, except in gardens. 

Soil. — The soil of Sandwick is of very different kinds in different 
places. Immediately east of the bay, it is nothing but sand, which 
blows about with the wind. In other places, there is a poor yellow 
clay, formed by the wasting of the clay flag ; and our best soil is 
a rich black clayish loam. These are mixed together in infinite 
proportions ; but there is no depth of mossy soil or gravel. The 
clays particularly rest on a retentive rocky subsoil, many parts of 
which would be much improved by draining. 

Zooloffy.— The rarer species of animals only being wanted for 
the Statistical Account, I would not be justified in inserting a 
complete list, for which I must refer to Anderson's " Guide to the 
Highlands and Islands," where one will be found, embracing those 
of Mr Low, Drs Barry, Traill, Neill, and Mr Forbes, to which I 
have nothing important to add. I may, however, mention, that 
rabbits are very numerous in the sandy parts of this parish, and 
hares, which were only introduced into Orkney a few years ago, 
are now beginning to show themselves. Thousands of gulls, of 
different species, with scarfs and other sea birds, as well as com- 
mon pigeons, build on the shelves of our precipices, and some hun- 
dreds of the pewit, or black-headed gull, on a little artificial holm 
n the Loch of Skaill. A few pairs of wild swans remain some 
months in winter in the Lochs of Stenness and Glumly. Wild 
geese visit us every spring, and several .species of duck are found 
in all our lochs ,n considerable numbers. There are no trout or 
other fish of any importance in our lochs ; but in the Loch of 
btenness, trout, flounders, and various other species are ffot • and 
there is great variety in the Atlantic, on our west shores ; however 
■ t IS only when the sea is smooth that boats can get out to fish' 
Lobsters are caught in the bay for the London market 

Botany.-The plants in this parish are not very different from 
sid°er.l '''Shhoun.g ones, except Hoy, where there is a con- 
siderable number of alpine plants on the Ward Hill. The Scotch 

abundantly in this, and most parishes of the county, with some 
nore plants that are rather rare in the south of ScoUand. But 
tor a catalogue of these, I must refer the botanist to the works of 
Drs Barry and Neill, and my own contribution of 83 new species to 
the Orkney Flora in Anderson's - Guide," which would occupy too 
mu h space to republish here, as they contain altogether 545 specie.

is particularly rich ; and we have the pleasure of adding several to 
the Flora of Scotland, besides the Cliara aspera, new to that of 
Britain, Dr PoUexfen has paid particular attention to the sea-weeds ; 
and the addition which I am now enabled to make to former lists 
of these, prove his diligence in collecting, and acuteness in dis- 
criminating, — for though I have also picked up a few of these 
when accidentally at the sea shore, yet, for the majority of them, 
I am indebted to him. "Without deducting a few that might be 
subtracted from former lists, but, taking Barry's at 11, Neill's at 
13, and mine at 44, there are still 65 new species to be added to 
the sea-weeds, making the Orkney algae amount to 133 species, 
and its flora to 610; and yet much remains to be done, particu- 
larly in cryptogamous botany. It is deemed proper to publish 
the complete list of algae, including the old and new, on account 
of the rarity of some, alterations in nomenclature, &amp;c.

There are no forests in this parish; but some trees have been 
planted within the last fifteen years, and the kinds that seem to 
succeed best are, the plane, ash, mountain-ash, elm, and willow,

The only plans or surveys of this parish of any importance, in ad- 
dition to those of the county in general, are those of the townships, 
in which the Crown holds property, made by Messrs Granger and 
Miller, and lodged in the sheriff-clerk's office. 

Laud-owners.-The property is divided into very small portions 
here, as in the neighbouring parishes. William Graham Watt, 
iisq. of Breckness, holds about a third, and resides on it, cultivat- 
ing a considerable part. The Crown holds about a fifth ; and the 
remainder IS held by nearly seventy other proprietors, most of 
whom cultivate their own little farms.

fiftieth plate of the Encyclopsedia Britannica, published in 1797, 
might pass for a representation of this monument before the dis- 
placing of its pillars. 

On the hill north of Quoyloo there is a standing stone, and also 
a curious collection of large and ancient stones, to which the name 
Haly Kirk is still applied ; and a gentleman residing in that 
neighbourhood informs me, that he recollects one of these, now 
prostrate, supported by those that are still perpendicular, thus 
completing that resemblance to an altar, which its name seems to 
indicate. Not far from the same spot, about 200 yards north- 
east of North Dike, and about 500 east of the summit of Ves- 
trafiold, are the remains of an enclosure, 800 yards in circumfe- 
rence, and, I believe, of great antiquity, many of the stones be- 
ing large, and set upon edge, particularly five or six on the north 
side. 

About sixty yards nearer the summit, is a quarry, with enor- 
mous blocks of stone detached, so similar to the standing stones of 
Stenness in size and shape, that I suppose this to be the bed from 
which they were taken, as I know of no other quarry from which 
they could be procured, and no other purpose for which people 
would detach such blocks as these, from 13 to 18 feet long. 
The nearest circle of the standing stones is about six miles from 
this spot; but, though they might be considered geographically in 
this parish, they are ecclesiastically within the boundaries of Sten- 
ness. I may, however, mention, that numerous remains of anti- 
quity, probably connected with them, may be seen at the adjoin- 
ing boundary of this parish, and more particularly about a mile 
north of them ; and within the west corner of the dike of Was- 
bister is a circle, which seems a miniature of that in Stenness, with- 
out the stones, surrounded by a ditch about 12 feet broad, and 6 
feet deep, 219 yards in circumference outside of the ditch. 

There are in the parish at least five broughs, which their name 
and situation prove to have been, of old, places of defence. Two 
of these are on promontories at the precipice in Yeskenaby, 
one jutting out in the Loch of Glumly, and two in the Loch of 
Stenness; each of these, not an island, or surrounded by water, 

• The slab of Via is 1 foot thick, 5 feet 1 0 long, and 4 feet 9 broad. The four pil- 
lars .mder it .ire each about 3 feet long; and the head stone 3 feet 9 by 2 feet 9 on 
he surface, and 1 foot 4 thick. It is placed nearly in the centre of an old circular 
enclosure, 275 paces in circumference, with small tumulus on the south s.de of .t, 
whici vas lately opened, but nothing found .n .t except a parcel of large stones.

I have observed at several places vitrified cairns, similar to 
those in Sanday, &amp;c. which Dr Hibbert supposes to have been 
produced by beacon fires. I know not that ours have the same 
origin ; for since that celebrated antiquarian called my attention 
to the subject, I have, in several cases, seen similar vitrified matter 
produced by burning a whole stack of sandy peats in the open air, 
during a strong breeze, which is sometimes done to obtain the 
ashes for manure. 

During last summer, a man, who built a habitation for himself on 
the common between this and Isbister, in Birsay, found what seems 
to have been a Pict's house, in a knowe from which he took the 
stones. It consisted of a chain of four circular cells, connected 
together by passages too narrow and low ever to have formed aa 
abode for men. It seems more probable that the rubbish above 
the cells was the ruins of their residence, and that these were used 
as cellars or places of security. 

Barrows or tumuli are particularly numerous in Sandwick. I 
believe there are more than one hundred, though it would be 
neither easy. nor useful to count them. Eight of these, situated 
on the common, have been opened during the last year. A mi- 
nute description of each would be tedious; but a brief account 
of the most important, which I opened in company with most of 
the other office-bearers of the Orkney Natural History Socie- 
ty, must be interesting to the antiquarian. The first, which was 
the largest of a numerous cluster between Voy and Lyking, was 50 
yards in circumference, and about 7 feet high. It was formed of a 
wet adhesive clay. On reaching the centre, we found a large flag 
which formed the cover; and on raising it up, the grave appeared 
as free from injury, and the pieces of bone as white and clean, as 
if formed only the preceding day. At its end, which lay north-east 
by east, was an urn inverted, shaped like an inverted flower-pot • 
and at its other end, about a hat-full of bones, unmixed with ashes,' 
which had been burnt and broken small, none being more than 
two inches long and one broad, covered by a stone of an irregular

shape, about one foot across. It was sprinkled with a peculiar 
mossy-looking substance, of a brown colour, and white ashes, 
which seemed, from the smell when burnt, to be animal matter. 
The surface of the urn is dark, not unlike burnt cork, and seems 
to be rude earthen-ware, into the composition of which, bits of 
stone enter liberally. It contained nothing that we could per- 
ceive, and soon fell to pieces ; but I put them together with Ro- 
man cement; and it is now in the Society's museum, with part of 
the bones. 

The next, in size, of the group of tumuli, was 34 yards in circum- 
ference, about 6 feet high, and contained six separate graves. 
The two nearest the centre seemed the principal ones. A large 
flag rested against the covers of these on the east side, jutting up 
about a foot above them, -f- The space under this flag was quite 
empty. On removing it and the two horizontal covers on which 
it rested, the two principal graves were exposed to view. The 
first was formed of a double row of upright flags, on all sides ex- 
cept the south, next to the second, where there was only a single 
row, and small pieces substituted at the corners,J the space inside 
was filled for 9 inches with clay, and the corners of this and the 
second were also cemented with it. Between the cover and clay 
flooring, was a vacant space, about a foot deep, into which some 
fine sand had penetrated or fallen from the cover in wasting, and 
sprinkled the floor. On removing this, we found a small stone, 
which covered a cavity in the clay, 1 foot in diameter, and 9 inches 
deep, containing the bones burnt and broken, as in the first tumu- 
lus, and some little pieces of charcoal. It is worthy of remark, 
that in a tumulus lately opened in Circassla, Mr Spencer disco- 
vered a few fragments of unglazed terra cotta vases, containing 
charcoal also.§ 

The second grave || was nearly one foot south of the former, and 
consisted of four flags, set up on a floor of flag, with a heap of 

• The cover was 5 feet 7 in lenglli, 3 feet 2 lroad, and 34 inches thick. The bot- 
tom of the grave was on tlic level of the surface of the earth, and it measured 8 feet 
long, 2 feet broad, and 1 foot 10 deep. The part of the urn that bore to be lifted up 
measured 1 foot in diameter at its mouth, 5 inches inside and outside of bottom, and 
9 inches high ; the bottom 1 inch thick, and the sides barely J. 

f It measured 5 feet long, 4 feet 2 inches broad, and 3 inches thick. 

••• The first grave was 1 foot 8 inches square inside, the outside flags were 6 inches 
higher than the inside ones, and those on the west and east sides very thick. Out- 
side they were supported by some lumpy stones and the clay.

bones, simikr to those in the first. The third was at the soiilh 
side, close by the west corner of the second, and was very simple, 
being merely a cavity in the earth, covered by a stone on which 
we were treading, and being so low, without any upright flags 
about it, it escaped observation till we were about to leave the tu- 
mulus. It contained pieces of bone of a larger size than the for- 
mer two, and a few pieces of a vitrified substance, like a parcel of 
peas, with a vesicular internal structure, and of a whitish appear- 
ance, as if it were vitrified bone. The other three resembled the 
more common graves that are generally found in the lesser tumu- 
li, differing from each other in size and structure, but all more or 
less filled with ashes, of a reddish colour, apparently of peat, in- 
terspersed with very small bits of bone. 

All of these graves lay with one end north north-east, except 
the sixth, which was directed north-east. This resemblance be- 
tween the fourth and first is worthy of notice, — that it also'consist- 
ed of a double row of flags on all sides except the south, next to 
the fifth, where it was single. 

I do not think that it would be either interesting or useful to 
describe minutely the graves in all the tumuli that I have .seen 
opened during the last year, or heard of being opened previously ; 
for though they vary a little in size, shape, and direction, there is 
a strong similarity between them, the largest being 2 feet 9 inches 
by 2 feet, and the smallest 1 foot 2 inches by 10 inches ; and 
the direction of those that I have had an opportunity of observino-, 
varies only two points of the compass from nojth by east, to north' 
east by north, and they all contained peat ashes mixed with bits 
of bone. I leave it to those more competent to the task, to specu- 
late on these facts. One thing, however, seems evident, that these 
tumuh are the burying-places of a people who burned their dead, 
and It seems probable that the rich were buried in the larger and 
more costly tumuli, and that their bodies were burnt in such a way 
as to prevent their remains from being mingled with peat ashes : 
and the bits of charcoal found in one of the graves seem to indi- 
cate that this was used as the fuel, at least on some occasions,

while the poor were interred in the smaller tumuli, along with the 
ashes of the peats, which consumed their remains. 

An ancient and interesting grave was also found last year, on the 
farm of Downby, by the proprietor, from the plough accidentally 
coming in contact with its cover stone. It contained a human 
skeleton, which could not be got out entire, but which seemed to 
have been buried in a sitting posture, and at the right hand lay a 
mallet head of gneiss, finely marked with dark and light layers, 
and beautifully polished, now in the museum in Stromness. The 
head lay north-west by north. 

III. — Population. 

The amount of the population at each census, taken at the 
four last periods, was 970, 922, 930, and 973, or, including 46 
seamen, 10J9 ; but when I took an account of my parishioners in 
1833, visiting every cottage, I found it amounted to 1088, and, 
according to the present return for this Account, it is 1056.

Gaelic has never been spoken here ; and I know of no customs,

• This grave was 4 feet 24 inches, by 2 feet 11 inches, and 2 feet 9 inches deep, 
formed of Hag only about an inch thick. The cover was 6 feet long, 4 feet 2 inches 
broad, and 04 inches thick. The mallet is 3 inches long, about 6 in circumference 
at the' thickest end, and has a hole quite through, apparently for a handle, about 
seven-tenths of an inch in diameter. , 

+ The marriages registered last seven years are 56, but 18 females and 4 males 
belonged to other parishes : deducting the latter, who would probably take their 
wives to their own homes with them, we obtain the above number.

jiumber of families appear greater.

ment in this respect, but it must be very limited, till they have 
houses that are clean, in which it would be possible to keep their 
persons so. At present, most of them are wretched hovels, with 
holes in the roof instead of chimneys, which permit that part of 
the smoke to escape, that is knowing enough to find it ; but most 
of the soot attaches itself to the roof and rafters, whence it de- 
scends again on the inmates. 

Another hole in the roof, about six inches square, and often 
without glass, is the substitute for a window ; and cows, calves, 
pigs, geese, and fowls, share the benefit of the peat fire, placed on 
the middle of the floor for the accommodation of aU. Their 
food is as simple as can be imagined. Oat and bear-meal, with 
milk in various forms, potatoes, cabbage, and sometimes fish, is 
their ordinary diet ; and most indulge in a little flesh and ale at 
Christmas, or other holidays. Of their poor cots, many are only 
tenants at will, and on this account, as well as others connected 
with their state of vassalage, though many have peace and plenty, 
I cannot say that all enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts of 
society and civilization, as so much depends on their landlord. 

The general character of the people, intellectual, moral, and 
religious, is, 1 believe, much like that of their neighbours, who 
have been placed in the same unfavourable circumstances, living 
in a parish united to another, with public worship only once a 
fortnight, and no resident clergyman. I have the gratification of 
noticing in the sequel their late improvement, in these respects. 

I V. — Industry. 

AffricuUiire.— Much of the information required under this 
branch of inquiry, I expected to have procured from the tenants ; 
but It is proper to explain, that many of them having been prohi- 
bited from divulging the secret of their real rent, and quantity of 
land, I have been under the necessity of extracting the truth from 
other sources. More than half of this parish has lately been di- 
vided under a process of division of run-rig, and of this part, the 
number of acres of arable and pasture land, with the comparative 
value of each, has been exactly ascertained ; and knowing the 
proportion between the valued rent of this part, and that which 
remains undivided, I am furnished with materials from which to 
calculate the number of acres of arable and pasture land in the 
whole parish, with more precision than formerly; and the know- 
ledge of the real rent of a part, amounting to more than L. COO, 
gives me also materials for calculating the real rent of the whole.

which I believe to be nearly L. 1600, but which I shall at present 
calculate at L. 1500; and I have pleasure in acknowledging the 
politeness of Mr Graham, the Crown Chamberlain, and the sur- 
veyor, in procuring most of the documents. The valuation of 
the parish, more than twenty years ago, is far below the present 
value, some tenants paying more than double of the rent then 
stated.

which never have been cultivated, and which remain con- 
stantly waste, or in pasture, is . . . 3224 
in a state of undivided common, or water, . 3202 
under planted wood, about .... 1 

What portion of this might, with a profitable application of ca- 
pital, be added to the cultivated land, is a matter on which there 
must be a great variety of opinions ; but the practicability of doing 
so is yearly proved, by the cultivation of some part of it. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre is 
10s , and the average rent of pasture land about 2s. per acre. 

Bate of Wages. — The following is the rate of wages. A plough- 
man per year, L. 7} or more if he acts as grieve, with board, or 
equivalent in meal, &amp;c. ; a male day labourer gets Is. and a fe- 
male 6d. without fare ; female servants in gentlemen's families 
have L. 3 a-year. For harvest, men get L. 1, 10s. and females 
L. 1. Masons may be got to build dikes at Is. 3d. a-day, and 
1 Id. a fathom for building and quarrying a dry stone dike, 3g feet 
high, with coping. More perfect masons obtain 2s. a-day for the 
best kind of work ; carpenters get 2s. a-day and food. 

Prices. — The prices of different articles of raw produce, or 
country manufacture, are, fowls, 8d. each ; eggs, 3d. per dozen ; 
beef and mutton, about Martinmas, 2d. per lb., but dearer at 
other seasons ; butter, 6d. per lb.; potatoes, the dearest, 3s. per 
barrel ; an iron plough, L. 2 ; a wooden one, L. 1, 10s. ; a cart, 
L. 4, 4s.; a pair of harrows, L4s. or 15s. The common breeds 
of cattle are the small ones of the county, and little attention has 
been paid to their improvement. The general character of the 
husbandry is still exceedingly defective, most of the ground having 
been alternately in oats and bear for generations, without the be- 
nefit of green crop, grass, or fallow, except a rig or two on each 
farm, for the potatoes. The soil is, in consequence, full of a great 
variety of weeds, and exhausted ; and I deem it of the utmost im- 
portance, that a regular rotation of crops should be introduced, 
suiting the course and kind of crop, to the soil and climate ; but

liitherto there has been a greater desire to increase the quantity of 
arable ground, by reclaiming waste land, than to increase the pro- 
ductive power of that which is already arable, by rotation and 
draining. In general there are no leases, and in the few cases 
where they exist, their duration is only, about seven years, so that 
they afford no adequate encouragement for improvements by the 
tenants. The state of the farm-buildings is as bad as that of the 
dwelling-house which I mentioned before, and there are no in- 
closures among the peasantry, except those of their " kale yards." 

The principal improvements which have recently been intro- 
duced among the tenants, are better horses, and implements of agri- 
culture, and those in my neighbourhood are also trying turnips on 
a small scale. 

The single-stilted plough, used here at the beginning of this 
century, is now completely abolished, with all its cumbrous ma- 
chinery, and the common two-stilted mould- board one substituted 
m its place, and a pair of good small horses, instead of three or four 
with their leaders. Harrows with teeth of iron instead of wood, and 
carts are now universally used. The public road from Stromness 
is made as far as the Loch of Aith, and in tolerable repair. 

Mr Watt is by far the most extensive farmer in the parish, and 
has for many years carried on an improved system of husbandry ; 
enclosing and reclaiming waste land on a large scale,— his last in- 
closureofiF the common, a few years since, including about 100 acres. 
Mr Robertson in Lyking deserves next to be noticed with appro- 
bation, for his success in raising the best crops, and acting on an 
improved system. Mr Heddle of Glumly, who purchased that 
property about five years ago, has already inclosed the whole of it, 
and brought most of its waste land into cultivation. 

The glebe has also, during the last four years, been inclosed 
and drained ; and this is the only farm in the parish, or, in a much 
wider district, that is under a regular rotation of crops. The 
course adopted is that of six years, viz. green crop, bear, two 
years grass, and two years oats; but it would be premature to af- 
firm that this is the rotation best adapted to the county, or most 
worthy of general imitation. This experiment, however, has 
shown that the crops are vastly improved by the rotation, and that 
the first years are attended with more expense than profit. 

All the obstacles to improvement, noticed in the " heads of 
mquiry," operate here in their full force, viz. want of capital, he 
want ol encouragement by proprielors, erroneous management of

land, defective leases, and insufficient accommodation in building 
and inclosing. 

The only quarries are those of the common clay stone, which are 
found in most places fit for building, and in a few places adapted 
for paving and roofing ; and the milestone quarry noticed under 
Geology. 

. We have no mines, and no fisheries of any importance, though 
when the sea is smooth, those near the bay catch some fish for 
their own use, and a few lobsters for the London market. 

Produce.— The average gross amount of raw produce cannot be 
stated with precision, as the people could not tell it; but the prm- 
ciple on which valuators generally calculate, is, that the produce 
should be three times the value of the rent, which makes the total 
amount of the raw produce raised in this parish L. 4500, and this is 
almost exclusively in grain, and a few potatoes for their own use. 
The only crop cultivated for the arts is rye, for making bonnets, 
nine acres of which are raised by Mr Watt, at what appears a liberal 
rent of L. 6, lOs. per acre, but he has to manure and work the land, 
and furnish carts whenever they are required, for carrying the pro- 
duce to the boiler, thence to the bleaching-field, and thence to 
Kirkwall, or Stromness. 

Manufactures. — The principal branch of manufacture carried 
on here, is straw plaiting, which occupies almost all our younger 
females; or, in summer, reaping and preparing the nine acres 
of rye that furnish the materials. The seeds are sown thick, 
that the straw may be long and fine. The stems are cut down 
hefore the grain ripens, tied near the lower end into very small 
bundles, steeped in boiling water for an hour, spread on the 
ground to bleach, and carted to the manufacturer's house, where 
the upper part between the highest joint and the grain, which 
only in general is used, is pulled out ; cut to a proper length, silt- 
ed or sorted to different degrees of fineness, and made up into 
small bundles, which are distributed to the girls who take them to 
their own houses to be plaited ; they are paid according to the 
fineness of the straw, and excellence of the work. The plaiters can 
earn 6d. a day at the present rate of wages. The plaits are next 
washed, smoked, milled, and, lastly, put into the hands of other 
girls who sew them together into bonnets. At one time, this 
manufacture was conducted in a very objectionable manner, by 
collecting numbers of young people in confined apartments, where, 
as « evil communications corrupt good manners," and « one sinner 



SANDWICK,

destroyeth much good," it is to be feared the contaminated atmo- 
sphere was not only destructive to their bodily health, but to their 
moral purity. The same objections, however, do not apply to it 
as conducted at present in their own houses, where it has a ten- 
dency to introduce neatness and cleanliness; but it is a serious ob- 
jection, that the whim of a London lady may render it unfashion- 
able to appear under a thatch of straw, and thus at once throw 
destitute 3000 Orcadian damsels. 

The manufacture of kelp is not of great importance here now, 
only about eight tons are made,— and it neither affords much em- 
ployment nor profit. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no town or village in the parish, but the centre is only 
about five miles from Stromness, and about fifteen from Kirkwall. 

Our letters pass through the Stromness post-office; and the 
length of made-road from the centre of this, to join that in Strom- 
ness parish, is two miles. 

Ecclesiastical State.—The parish church is placed about 100 
yards from the bay at the west side, and about five miles from the 
other extremity,— a situation which is most inconvenient for all the 
population, except the few in that neighbourhood, the nearest cot- 
tage being nearly a mile distant. As this church was built so late- 
ly as 183R, partly on the foundation of the former one— it is my 
duty to relieve the presbytery of the bounds, and the minister of 
the awful responsibility of approving of such a site : for after the 
principal heritors had petitioned the presbytery for a removal of 
the church to a central situation, and that court had cordially ap- 
proved of a measure so eminently calculated to promote the glory 
of God, and salvation of souls, the opposition of the very person who 
had written, and been most prominent in promoting that petition, 
effectually defeated the arrangement. 

From this it is evident that presbyteries should be vested with 
authority to fix on the proper sites for churches. 

Though so recently built, I cannot say that its present state of 
repair is good, for being founded partly on the foundation of the 
old church and partly on soft sand, the wall cracked so far, that 
the arch of a wmdowcame down, and that being rebuilt, it has again 
cracked m such a manner, that it gives little prospect of durabili- 
ty. It contains 534 sittings, which are not yet divided. The 
manse was built in 1 833. The glebe consists of 43 acres, near- 
y nal. ot which used to be arable ground, and the rest poor pas- 
ture, or waste land, which was let altogether for about L. 12.

have leisure. One of these is the parochial school, and all the rest 
are unendowed. The branches of education taught at the best of 
these, are, Latin, French, grammar, writing, arithmetic, music out- 
Imesof civil and natural history, geography, geometry, and a 'little 
astronomy; but several taught by females, are limited to reading 
and sewmg. The salary of the parochial teacher is L. 34, 4s 
4id., but both at this, and the other schools, the school fees do' 
not amount to much. The parochial teacher has the legal accom- 
modation. The expense of education per quarter at it" is Is. for 
reading, with grammar, writing and arithmetic, and 6d. for each 
important branch in addition, but 9d. and even 6d. per quarter 
are the fees at some of the female schools. I believe all between 
SIX and 6fteen years of age can read, and a great part of them 
write. 1 do not know of more than two or three old people who 
cannot read. The people, in general, are alive to the benefits of 
education. Notwithstanding the great number of our schools, 
another endowed and permanent one is much wanted at the north 
side of the pansh, where there is a population of about 500, most 
of whom are three miles from the parochial school, which in this 
climate is sufficient to prevent attendance in the winter season, 
when they have most time. 

• v improvement in the conduct of the people 

smce the facilities of education have increased. In a printed le  
ter of the principal resident heritor, dated 1821, he says, "This 
par,sh has been, time out of mind, so ill supplied inegaid to 
church and school, owing, in a great measure; to the resid ce f 
the clergyman being placed at the farthest extremity of the other 
parish. It IS wonderful to me that they are not more sa age and 
unprmcipled than they are. They are a half century behbd most 
of the other parishes on the mainland, in civilization." 

Supposing this to be a correct description of their condition at 
he t. had the best opportunities of knowing I cln now 

e t fy from n.y own observation, as well as that of' t iers thaT

chai-e, with a resident pastor, &amp;c. The careless observance 
of the Sabbath is often remarked in double charges, where the 
people are deprived of the public ordinances of religion every al- 
ternate Sabbath, and I lament that some of this carelessness st.U 
adheres to a few of the old : yet 1 have cause to rejoice m the evi- 
dent improvement of the young, who are generally regular in at- 
tending public worship, and a Sabbath school,-the more advanced 
bein- Taucxht in church, immediately after public worship, and the 
veryyoung in district schools. A portion of these meet in the 

Secession chapel. 

In short, the improvement effected here affords every encourage- 
. ment for disjoining the other united parishes. j. , , 

Library.- k parochial library was instituted immediately a ter 
I came to reside here, for the use of which each family pays 6d. a 
year It now contains 164 works, chiefly on religious subjects, be- 
sides religious periodicals. There are 74 subscribers. 

Poor and Parochial FuncU.-'V\ie average number on the poor s 
roll for three years is 20, and the average sum allotted to each 9s. 
4d a year. The average amount of annual contributions for their 
lef during the same period, is L.ll, 9s. 7d., which rs all derived 
from church collections, and marriage dues, except 8s which is the 
ent of a bit of ground devoted to the poor Out of this sum, 
however, there are several salaries to be paid. have never ob- 
served any reluctance to accept of parochial reliet. 

Fairs, Inns, and Fuel-There is one cattle fair held near the 
e.st boundary in June. There are four alehouses, which are too 
m y, nd h ve very bad effects on the morals of the people, in- 
uring habits of intemperance. Sandwick is worse provided w, h

Miscellaneous Observations. 
• Since the time of the last Statistical Account, the greatest .m- 
...nt. thit have been introduced in agriculture are, better 
the I n plough instead of the single-stilted, the ge- 
'"::n;t "d "n of a good made road to Stromness, the

trebled, but those of tradesmen and labourers are scarcely height- 
ened. The price of malt and eggs is doubled, while that of other 
provisions is not raised so much ; but a good cow, that formerly 
sold for L 2, now costs L.4 or more. The disjunction of this pa- 
rish from Stromness, and the building of two Dissenting chapels, are 
the most important changes in ecclesiastical affairs. The improve- 
ments of which the parish is susceptible, must be evident from the 
previous observations ; but, again, I briefly state, that proper leases, 
better houses, a rotation of crops, and encouragement by proprie- 
tors, seem calculated to promote the progress of industry, and the 
happiness and comfort of the labouring classes, as well as the in- 
terests of the landlords.

Maiision-House.— The only one in the parish is the house of 
Burness, belonging to Mrs Stewart. 

Antiquities— In the parish of Stenness, are several large erect 
stones, some standing single, but the greater number arranged in 
a circular form and surrounded with a pretty wide and deep ditch, 
of considerable circumference. 

Close by a circle of stones, are several tumuli, evidently 
artificial, some of them raised pretty high, of a conical form, and 
somewhat hollow upon the top. About half a mile from the semi- 
circular range of stones, is another beautiful tumulus, considerably 
larger than the former, around which has been a large ditch. 
This last is distinguished by the name of Mesow or Mese-howe.f 
" In the neighbourhood of Garmiston, in the parish of Stenness, 
in the side of a peat moss, are several heaps of earth, said to be 
the graves of those who fell in a skirmish, at what is called the 
battle of Summersdale, or Bigswell. The following is reported 
to have been the occasion of this action. Upon the 18th of May 
1529, in the reign of James V. John Earl of Caithness, pretend- 
ing some right to Orkney, came over with troops to seize it, land- 
ed at Howt°on, and proceeded to Summersdale in Stenness, where 
they were beat back by the Orkney and Shetland people into a 
place called the Moss of Bigswald, where the Earl and most of the 
people were killed, and the rest taken prisoners. Numbers of then- 
bones, and part of their clothing have been dug up, which was black 
when first got, but soon fell into dust. The Orkney men were com- 
manded by a Sir James Sinclair, natural son to Robert, Earl ol 
Orkney."t 

III. — Population. 
The population of Firth amounts to 584; and that of Sten-

During the last three years, there have been two illegitimate 

births in the parish.

The amount of stipend is L. 150; L. 115, 4s. '2d. being de- 
rived from the parishes, and L. 34, 15s. lOd. paid by the Exche- 
quer. The glebe in Stenness contains 5 acres, that of Firth 
about 16 or 17 acres. The value of that of Stenness would be L. 3

and is in good repair. 

Education. — There is one parochial school for both parishes, 
and one in each parish, supported by the Society in Scotland for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge. The teacher's salary is L. 26.

amount to L. 4, 10s. per annum.

PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. WALTER WEIR, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, §-"c.— These parishes consist of three, or more properly 
speaking, of four inhabited islands. Walls comprehends the 
greater part of the island of Hoy, which, in the group of the Ork- 
neys, is considered to rank next to Pomona, or the Mainland, m 
point of extent. It is probable that Walls derives its name from 
« Voes," which signifies a bay or inlet of the sea. It was ancient- 
ly called « Valis," " Waes," or " Waas." The last mentioned 
is still retained in pronunciation, although Walls is the name by 
which it is designated in all written documents. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish is about Ik miles in length 
from north to south, and about 6 miles in breadth from east to 
west. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Hoy ; on the 
east, by Scalpa Flow; and on the south and west, by the Pentland 
Frith. The parish is nearly divided into two portions by the bay 
of Longhope, which extends about five miles from east to west. 
At one part, on the south side of the bay, the waters of Longhope 
almost meet those of the Pentland Frith, which at that place 
extend through a bay, and are only separated by a very narrow 
strip of land, generally not exceeding 200 feet, even at low water, 
while at spring tides it is for several days overflowed at high water, 
so as often to be impassable except by a boat. Hence Walls is 
sometimes spoken of as a separate island from Hoy; and certain- 
ly so far as regards the convenience of the inhabitants, the facili- 
ties of communication are not greater than if they formed two dis- 
tinct islands. This narrow strip of land, which is covered with 
stones and constantly exposed to the waves of the Pentland Frith, 
seems to retain the same form which it did nearly three centuries 
a.o, as Buchanan, in his History of Scotland, describes these islands 



WALLS AND FLOTTA. 



71 



thus : — " Hoy and Valis, or Waes, which some make two and 
others but one island, because about both equinoxes, at which time 
the sea doth most tempestuously foam and rage, the tide fall- 
ing back, and the lands being bared, they stick together, and are 
joined by a very narrow neck of land, and so make one island ; 
but upon the return of the tide, and the sea coming afresh between 
them, they again represent the form of two." 

Hoy may be termed the highlands of Orkney ; and although the 
south part, where this parish is situated, does not contain hills of 
equal height with those in the parish of Hoy, a great proportion of 
the island may be considered as mountainous. The headland of the 
Berry rock is a magnificent promontory, corresponding in some re- 
spects to that of Dunnet-head, on the Caithness coast; and these 
rocks appear like two vast pillars forming the mouth of the Pentland 
Frith, through which the waters of the Atlantic rush with awful 
impetuosity. It is not improbable that, at some distant period, 
these islands were torn from Scotland by some convulsion of na- 
ture, and that the hills which bound the western coast of Scot- 
land, and those of Hoy, formed one range. In proof of this sup- 
position, it may be mentioned, that Dunnet-head and the Berry 
nearly correspond in their geological properties; and that the 
same position of the western hills is carried forward from the Berry 
head along the west coast of Hoy, and from thence in the same 
position through Pomona. Besides the Berry, there are other 
headlands which present their bold fronts to the waves of the Pent- 
land Frith. The extent of coast bounded by the frith is about 
twelve miles, nearly the whole of which is precipitous, and in which 
have been formed several caverns by the action of the waters. 

Hydrography. — There is a great extent of excellent anchorage- 
ground in the various bays or harbours of this island, all of which 
afford a safe retreat to shipping of almost any size. The princi- 
pal of these is the harbour of Longhope, which has been already 
mentioned as being about five miles long, and which is, in some 
places, one and a half broad. This harbour is land-locked by the 
Island of Flotta; and perhaps, there is not in the kingdom a better 
place of safety for shipping. During the last war, it was a ren- 
dezvous for vessels waiting for convoy. At that time 40, 50, or 
even 100 sail might be seen in the bay. In the spring of 1840, 
there were congregated between 60 and 70 vessels, the greater 
number of which were of a large description, bound for various 
parts of the world. 



72 OIIKNEY. 

The Pentland Frith, to which allusion has been made as bound- 
ing the south and west of the parish, yields to none in the rapi- 
dity and strength of its stream. At spring tides, it runs at the rate 
of nine miles an hour; and has been known even to exceed that 
rate. On these occasions, it is impossible for ordinary vessels to 
withstand the force of the current. The depth is generally from 
50 to 65 fathoms, and the waters flow from north-west to south- 
east. The navigation of the frith is not so dangerous as is general- 
ly supposed. There are three islands, viz. Stroma, Swona, and the 
Pentland Skerries, and these contribute to lessen the danger, as the 
tide, impetuously rushing against the islands, rebounds, and thus 
produces eddies, and causes the stream to run in different directions 
at the same time. The pilots, being well acquainted with this cir- 
cumstance, are thus enabled to guide their charge in safety. In 
fact, the very danger to be apprehended in so formidable a sea, 
constitutes its safety, as the seamen, aware of the hazard they 
would run if overtaken by improper tides, study their time so well 
that accidents rarely happen. As an instance of this, it may be 
mentioned, that, although the post-boat has crossed between Huna 
and South Ronaldshaw three times a week, and now daily, I be- 
lieve that only one boat has been lost during a century. Were it 
not that the pilots are excellent judges of the weather, and at- 
tend to the circumstance which we have stated, the accidents 
would be numerous, as the sea is frequently so tremendous, espe- 
cially when the wind blows against the tide, that no boat can Hve. 

The parish is plentifully supplied with water, which is obtained 
from springs, and from the quantity of rain water which descends 
in streamlets from the rising grounds. There are two small lakes 
beautifully situated among the hills. 

Climate.— The cold in winter and the heat in summer are more 
moderate here than at three degrees further south. The frost 
does not continue long, and the snow remains but a short time on 
the ground. This equability of climate may be accounted for by 
the proximity to the sea. The easterly wind is the coldest, the 
south and westwinds,'particularly the latter, the most boisterous, and 
the north wind generally brings dry weather. To the state of the 
atmosphere, so purified by strong winds, may in some degree be 
attributed the absence of epidemic diseases, which seldom prevail 
to any extent, the good health generally enjoyed, and also the 
longevity of the inhabitants. 

QeoloffT/.—Aision has already been made to the magnificent 



WALLS AND FLOTTA. 73 

rock-scenery with which this parish abounds. Some of the pre- 
cipices on the west side are of sandstone, intersected by amygda- 
loid, and these again are in one place intersected by a whin dike 
ahnost straight and perpendicular. Sandstone succeeds, with ar- 
gillaceous schist, together with strata containing hme. Round 
the west and part of the north banks of the Longhope, the shore 
IS composed of the schist and sandstone ; when, after two or three 
miles, the former recommences, and is supposed to extend almost 
to the north-east extremity of the parish. Lime is to be found; 
but It is not thought that its manufacture would be profitable ; and 
there are distinct traces of iron and lead. The article of most 
value to the inhabitants is the inexhaustible store of excellent peat 
fuel on the north side of the Longhope, which all are allowed to 
cut and convey to their homes without cost, excepting their la- 
bour, and the expense of carriage. 

ooloc/ij.— There are no animals of prey in this parish, nor are 
there any poisonous reptiles. There is a considerable number of 
sheep reared on the island. They are allowed to roam at large 
over the hill pasture, and each proprietor has a particular mark by 
which his property is known. The black-cattle are also numerous. 
. 1 hey are generally of a small size,-both they and the sheep be- 
•ng of the Highland breed. The horses are numerous; and, 
thoiigh larger than those of Shetland, they are smaller than those 
01 the south. 

Ornithology.--Thre is a very great variety in the feathered tribe. 
1 he domestic fowls are the same as on the mainland of Scotland 
Grouse are abundant; and the birds of song are somewhat simi 
lar to those further south. Hawks are common ; and a beautiful 
spec.es of falcon is found, bold and fierce in the extreme, and of 
a large size There are several kinds of eagles, which frequent 
he lofty rocks towards the west. These commit great depreda- 
tions upon the grouse, which would be much more numerous but 
for such formidable enemies. It is alleged that the number of the 
eagles has never been known to increase or diminish. 

Ihe sea-fowl are very numerous. The ember-goose is often 

nrctnll 7""u '' '-i- their subsiftence 

puncipally from the sea. When the winter is severe, white swans ' 
are occasional visitors. 

dntf''-f ~r" nothing does the kindness of Divine Provi- 
dence towards the inhabitants appear more than in the great sup-

ply of the finest fish with which the waters around the parish 
abound. The cod-fish taken in the Pentland Frith are not sur- 
passed by any found elsewhere in Britain, and are so much prized, 
that a number of Well-smacks are sometimes here fishing for the 
London market. Lobsters are also taken and sent to the same 
mart. Cockles and spout-fish are abundant. 

The herring-fishery is carried on to a considerable extent. The 
fish are not cured on the island ; but the fishermen, at the proper 
season, proceed to the different stations, where they are always 
sure to find purchasers. This fishery now promises to be more 
lucrative, as some time ago the fish came almost to the edge of the 
shore at the east point. 

The cuthes or sillocks are abundant at all seasons, and afford 
excellent food, besides yielding oil from the livers ; and thus may 
the people generally procure a plentiful supply of what furnishes 
both food and light. 

Botany. — There are no large treesiu the parish, though, among 
the hills, shrubs and plants abound, which afford much scope for 
the researches of the botanist. In others of the Orkney Islands, 
there are found the remains of large trees, which would lead to 
the conclusion,' that, if proper care were taken in selecting those 
trees best fitted for the soil, and planting them in sufficient num- 
bers, the Orkney scenery would, ere long, be greatly improved. 

The garden fruits are various, viz. apples, pears, and plums, 
also gooseberries, currants, and strawberries. 

11. — Civil History. 

Considering the warhke transactions which took place in Ork- 
ney during many centuries, when these islands were governed by 
earls, and subject to the kings of Denmark, we are surprised to 
find in this island so few remains of fortification, especially when 
we consider its proximity to Caithness, and the continued hostdi- 
ties which were maintained between the inhabitants of that part of 
Scotland and the Orcadians. There are, however, remains of se- 
veral ancient buildings. Near Snelsetter House, formerly called 
the House of Walls, is a very large rock, separated from those on 
the land which bound the Pentland Frith, there are several traces 
of ancient fortifications. There are also the remains of what ap- 
pear to have been chapels. One of these is curiously situated on 
a peninsular rock. There are a few tumuli ; but I am not aware 
that any of them have been explored. 

Mansion-Hoiises.—i:\\e House of Snelsetter, before-mentioned, 



WALLS AND FLOTTA. 75 

W-as, for several centuries, the seat of the family of Moodie, and 
bears the marks of strength and antiquity. The mansion-house of 
Melsetter, formerly occupied by the late Major Moodie, the last pro- 
prietor of the name, and now by his son-in-law, Robert Heddle, 
Esq. of Melsetter, is beautifully situated at the farther extremity of 
Longhope Bay, and commands a view of the entrances of the 
Pentland Frith, the coast of Caithness, and the high lands of the 
west coast of Sutherland. 

Land-owners. — The whole parish of Walls, with a small excep- 
tion, belongs to the Crown and Mr Heddle, — the latter being the 
proprietor of fully two-thirds of the property. 

Parochial Registers. — Unfortunately, there are few records in 
the parish, and these do not extend to a remote date. It appears 
that there have been five incumbents of Walls and Flotta, besides 
the present minister, since 1688. The dates of the two first in- 
ductions previous to 1707 are not given; their names, however, 
are mentioned,— Mr Dalgarnock and Mr Andrew Kerr. Mr John 
Keith was inducted in April 1707, Mr Edward Irving in Auo-ust 
1747, Mr James Bremner in March 1772, and the present minis- 
ter in July 1837.

gistered. 

With few exceptions, the employments of the people consist of 
farming and fishing, the same individuals generally pursuino- both 
occupations. Straw-plaiting is also carried on to a considerable 
extent by the women. 



76 



ORKNEY. 



The farms are almost all small, and the farmers tenants at will. 
The people are shrewd and intelligent, but strangers cannot fail 
to remark a want of in-door comforts, which might be attained by 
better habits of domestic economy. 

IV. — Industry, 
Agriculture. — It is impossible to state, with any degree of correct- 
ness, the number of acres contained in the parish of Walls. Almost 
none of the farms are let by the acre, but are taken at so much for 
the whole steading and ground. There may be about 700 acres 
of arable and 1000 of pasture, besides a great extent of undivided 
common. How much of this land might be redeemed from waste, 
we cannot say ; but that it is practicable, may be inferred from 
what has been already accomplished by the spirited exertion of 
Mr Heddle, who is carrying on improvements on a large scale and 
at great expense, in the immediate vicinity of his farm of Mel- 
setter. 

Wages.— The value of labour may be stated as Is. 6d. per diem 
in summer, and Js. in winter, without food. 

The grain produced in this parish is bear and oats. In quali- 
ty it is equal to any, and superior to most, in Orkney. We cannot 
state the quantity raised, as the small farmers generally consume 
the most of what they grow, and no account is kept of it. The 
crop of potatoes is sufficient for the consumpt of the inhabitants. 

There is no village, properly so called, in this parish, although 
the different farms go by the name of towns, and may consist of 
two or three steadings at a little distance from each other. 

The post is conveyed by a boat, which crosses from St Mar- 
garet's Hope, in South Ronaldshay, once a week. This convey- 
ance was established, some years ago, for the convenience of the 
numerous shipping resorting to the well-known harbour of Long- 
hope. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.-i:he church of Walls is a neat and comfort- 
able building, erected in 1832, and capable of containing upwards 
of 500 people. The church of Flotta is a much older building, and 
tolerably comfortable, but too small for the population, containing 
only about 180. The people of both parishes attend the church 

''There is an excellent manse. It is situated in he south of 
Walls, about a quarter of a mile from the church. 

The stipend is paid partly in grain, baiter, and oil, which is 



WALLS AND FLOTTA. 



77 



commuted into money at the fiar prices, and partly in money by 
the heritors of Walls. Flotta is held cum decimis inclusis. The 
deficiency is made up by the Exchequer to L.15S, 6s. 8d, 

The glebe consists of 8 acres of arable, besides pasture land, 
and is furnished with a complete steading for a farm of that size. 

Education. — There are two parochial schoolmasters, in Walls, 
who are entitled to the legal salary due to schoolmasters in a pa- 
rish divided by an arm of the sea. There is also a subscription 
school, supported by the inhabitants in a district of the parish re- 
mote from any of the other schools; but the advantages enjoyed 
by the people, notwithstanding the number of schools, are hmit- 
ed, owing to the distances at which they are situated, and their 
being often separated by morasses or water. Notwithstanding 
these difficulties, there are few to be met with who cannot both 
read and write. 

Flotta being more compact is more advantageously situated. 
The teacher in this parish is supported by the Society for Propa- 
gating Christian Knowledge. The school fees in both parishes 
are moderate. Pharay has no school. 

Parish of Flotta 
Is bounded on the north and east, by Scalpa Flow ; on the west, 
by Longhope ; and on the south, by the Pentland Frith. It is 
similar, in situation and climate, to Walls. The land, however, is 
much more level. The soil is considered good. It is between two and 
three miles long, and in some places nearly two broad. The rocks 
are chiefly composed of sandstone, but are not so precipitous as 
those in Walls. There is an excellent harbour, called the Panhope, 
from a salt-pan which was at one time worked at this place. 

It is said, that there was formerly a long house or church on the 
island, where the surrounding clergy were wont to assemble. 

What has been said of Walls, in regard to the variety and plen- 
tifid supply of fish to be procured at all seasons, and the abun- 
dance of peat fuel, applies to Flotta. This island is particularly 
well situated for fishing; and the inhabitants, who are very enter- 
prising, have excellent boats, and yield to no seamen in managing 
them. They are industrious, and when not detained at home by 
their farming operations, they are engaged in fishing, which is 
to them a more pleasing and profitable employment. The her- 
ring-fishery has of late years been vigorously prosecuted by tlie 
people of Flotta, as well as the fishing of cod, of wliich they cure 



78 



ORKNEY. 



a considerable qiuintity. On the success of their fishing, both 
here and in Walls, the people depend in a great measure for their 
ability to discharge their engagements for the year. 

The number of inhabitants by a census in 1838 was 351. In 
1841, there were 493 persons"; forming 81 families. The Earl of 
Zetland is the sole proprietor of this parish. 

Pharay is an island to the north of Flotta, about two miles long, 
and nearly one broad ; regarding it there are no peculiarities to 
be noticed. The population in 1838 was 49. In 1841, there 
were 55 persons, forming ten families. The island is the property 
of Robert Heddle, Esq. of Melsetter. These are the inhabited 
islands, besides which there are three which belong to the parish, 
and which are uninhabited, but afford pasture for cattle and sheep ; 
these are Rysay Little, to the north of Pharay, and Switha, to the 
south, and Flotta Calf, to the east of Flotta. The first of these 
also belongs to Mr Heddle, the other two are the property of the 
Earl of Zetland. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There was formerly Divine service in Walls two successive Sab- 
baths, and in Flotta every third Sabbath. It is almost unnecessary 
to remark that in a double parish, where there is a distance of 
nearly five miles between the two churches, and that space inter- 
sected by rapid tides, and the passage often dangerous, this order 
of things must be frequently broken in upon; and no minister but 
one who has been actually so circumstanced, can imagine the 
distressing state of affairs caused by this arrangement, by which, 
of necessity, one church is left vacant every Sabbath; besides, the 
minister cannot possibly maintain pastoral superintendence over a 
people removed at such a distance, and that by water. So con- 
vinced was the present incumbent of this, that, after his induction 
four years ago, his first attention was directed to remedy an evil 
which had been the cause of much demoralization in these parishes. 
After considerable exertion, he succeeded in obtaining an ordained 
missionary, under the auspices of the venerable Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge, who, along with the Right Ho- 
nourable the Earl of Zetland and ourselves, contribute to his sup- 
port. 

An invaluable blessing is thus conferred, not only upon the people 
of Flotta and Pharay, but upon the 1150 inhabitants of Walls, 
who now enjoy Divine service every Sabbath. All the ordinances 
of religion are now regularly maintained in Flotta ; and we have

had much gratification in witnessing the Lord's Supper dispensed 
on two successive summers in a place where it was never before 
known to be within the memory of man. 

Mr Macintosh, who is ordained as the minister, has done much 
for the rehgious instruction of the young, and promoting a desire 
for reading amongst the people. The happy termination of these 
efforts calls for much gratitude, as the effects are already visible 
in inducing a much more regular attendance upon ordinances in 
both the parishes than when Divine service was so much inter- 
rupted as under the former system. There are five licensed pub- 
lic-houses in Walls, principally intended for the use of the ship- 
ping which frequent the Longhope ; but I am happy to say, that 
the sin of drunkenness, as well as of swearing, is now greatly redu- 
ced, and we have good reasons for hoping, that there are indica- 
tions of a very considerable improvement not only in morals, but in 
religious feeling.

PRESBYTERY OF NORTH ISLES, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JOHN BARRY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Extent, Sfc. — To the north of the east part of the 
mainland, from which it is distant about one mile, this island 
extends almost in the form of a cross, from Stromberry to Ness, 
near 7 miles, and from the Gait to the foot of Shapinshay, more 
than 5. The body of the cross stretches from south-west to 
north-east, and the arms from south-east to north-west. Al- 
most around the whole island, the shores are low, pretty level, 
and, to a considerable distance inland, covered with rich fields of 
grass and corn. Towards the middle, the land rises considerably 
higher; and as the hand of industry has never disturbed its repose 
since the creation, it exhibits the appearance of a barren waste, 
fit only for sheep pasture. 

Harbour — The harbour of Eiswick, the only one in the island, 
IS as capacious almost as any in this country. There, it is high

water at three- quarters of an hour after nine o'clock, whenthemoon 
is new and full. It has from four to six fathom water, over a bot- 
tom of hard clay covered with sand. On the west side of it, is a 
fine beach, with abundance of excellent fresh water ; and as it opens 
to the south-west, it is extremely convenient for ships bound to the 
southward. In ancient times, it seems to have been called Elidar- 
wick ; for we are informed by an Icelandic manuscript, that Haco, 
King of Norway, 1263, lay with his fleet in a harbour of that name, 
near Kirkwall, in his way to the Hebrides or west of Scotland. 
He had planned an expedition against Alexander III., King of 
Scotland, and after he had lain in this harbour till St Olave's Wake, 
he sailed south before the Mull of Ronaldsha, with all his navy. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — These are the following : No. 1 of mar- 
riages and baptisms; marriages from 13th November 1632, to 
21st July 1702; baptisms from 3d November 1632, to 19th No- 
vember 1669. No. 2, of marriages and baptisms ; marriages from 
1st November 1758, to 6th August 1793; baptisms from 1st No- 
vember 1758, to 12th August 1793. No. 3, of marriages, bap- 
tisms, and deaths, from 12th September 1793, to the present pe-

Mansion- Houses.— G\\Ma\e, the property of Captain Balfour of 
Elwick ; How, an old ruinous building, the property of S. Laing, 
Esq. of Papdale. 

Antiquities.— \n Elhardholm, a place belonging to this parish, 
there are the remains of a small chapel, which does not call for 
any particular notice. On the highest ground, and near the cen- 
tre of the parish, there is, as in most of the other islands, a wart or 
ward -hill, which commands an accurate and extensive view, not 
only of this, but of fifteen surrounding parishes. To me this ap- 
pears plainly to be artificial, and though one of the largest, it is 
certainly one of those tumiili which are so frequently to be met 
with in these islands. To the eastward of this little wart or ward- 
hillock, about an English mile, is a high stone, called ihc Stand- 
inn Stone of Shapinshny. Above the level of the ground it is 12 
feet high, and perhaps 5 or 6 below it ; its breadth is between

SHAPINSHAY. gj 

4 and 5 feet; its thickness a foot and a half; and from ils beino- 
clothed in moss or scurf, it has a VQry venerable majestic aspect" 
and seems to have weathered many ages. In form and dimen 
sions, it very much resembles stones that are found standing in 
many of the other islands, particularly, the circle and semicir- 
cle in the parish of Stenness ; and it has perhaps been erected 
either as a place of worship, or sacrifice, or to be a monument of 
some signal battle or victory, or to preserve the memory of some 
celebrated hero who had fallen in the field of battle. Towards 
the north side of the island, and by the sea side, is another large 
stone, called the Black Stone of Odin. Instead of standing erect, 
like the one above mentioned, it rests its huge side on the sand, 
and raises its back high above the surrounding stones, from which 
It seems to be altogether different in quality. How it has come 
thither, for what purpose, and what relation it has borne to the 
bcandinavian god with whose name it has been honoured, not 
only history, but tradition is silent. On the west shore, oppo- 
site nearly to the rock or skerry of Vasa, where the tides are 
rapid and the sea is shallow, we meet with a place known by 
the name of Grucula or Agricola. Thither, tradition reports, 
one of Agricolas ships, in his celebrated voyage round the is- 
land ot Britain, was driven by violence of weather, and strand- 
ed. But the most remarkable pieces of antiquity in this, and in- 
deed m the other islands, are those large ruins denomina ed Picts

THE REV. GEORGE RITCHIE, MINISTER. 



I- TOPCGRAPHV AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

This parish consists of the four islands, Rousay, Eagleshay, 
Weil-, and Enhallow, besides two small holms or uninhabited 
islands. These islands are situate about nine miles north-west of 
Kirkwall. 

 Rousmj, the largest, is one of a range of hills. It abounds 
with game, and contains many springs of excellent water. The 
soil is good. There are the remains of a small church about five 
miles from the manse. 

Eauleshay.—T\\\s is a pleasant, low-lying island, with a small 
Gothic church in the west part of it, which was dedicated to 
St Magnus, the tutelar saint of Orkney. It has a pyramidical 
steeple at the west end, and a vaulted choir at the east end, which 
joins to the body of the church. In Eagleshay, there is a small 
lake of fresh water; and the soil is very good, and fit for culture; 
but it is poorly cultivated. There is a small bay of shell sand, of 
the best kind, on the west side of this island, and a large track of 
sand on the north side, with much bent, and many rabbits. 

JFezV.— Weir Island is a small low-lying island, not so large 

as Eagleshay. The soil is the same, and the culture very poor. 

There are the ruins of a church here, and a choir, but no steeple; 

and the vestiges of a fortification on a rising ground, a little from' 

the place where the church stands. 

2'J«aZW.— Enhallow Island is very small, but very pleasantly 

situated, being overlooked by the hills and headlands of mainland 

on the south, and of Rousay on the north. The soil is good, but 

not skdfully managed.

UNITED PARISHES OF 
<name ref="NA">CROSS</name> AND <name ref="NA">BURNESS</name>.</head> 
<p>
PRESBYTERY OF NORTH ISLES, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM GRANT, MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation and Extent.— Tn united parishes of Cross and Bur- 
ness include about one-half of the extent of the Island of Sanday, 
—forming the one the south-west and the other the north-west 
limbs of that island, which is very much cut up by indentations of 
the sea. The extreme length of the two parishes from Spurness, in 
Cross, to Whitemill Point, in Burness, is Qi statute miles; but the 
breadth varies from half a mile to three miles. Cross parish is consi- 
derably diversified by rising ground ; but Burness, like Lady pa- 
rish, composing the rest of the island, is almost a dead flat, very 
httle raised above the level of the sea. Burness, anciently called 
bt Lolm s, extends to about 2.500 imperial acres, and, beino- al- 
most surrounded by the sea, it has, on all its shores, a most plen- 
titul supply of sea-weed, both for manure and for the manufacture 
ol kelp. It IS bounded on its west and north sides by the Atlantic- 
Ocean and the dangerous frith, here about seven miles wide, which 
divides It from the Island of North Ronaldshay ; but it is sheltered 
U-om the full force of the Atlantic surge by the holms of Ire and 
the half-fde rocks or skerries of Rive; east and south, it stretches 
along and forms one side of, the Bay of Otterswick, anciently 
called Odinswick, in which is safe anchorage for vessels of any 
se, while, at the top of this bay on the Burness side, a sort of 
inner harbour is formed by the point of Lambiness, on the soft 
sand ot which small vessels may be beached at any time with per- 
lect safety. The shores of Burness are generally flat, and the 
appearance of the parish is green, fertile, and" lively, exceptino- 
"ear its junction with Cross parish, where there is a moor of about 
uu acres ol a most barren and forbidding appearance. There

are several ponds, and one fresh- water loch of considerable extent 
and depth,— a favourite resort of ducks and other aquatic fowl 
during the winter and spring; and both this loch and the more 
extensive one of Bea, in Cross parish, are occasionally visited by 
flocks of wild swans, as they pass north or south in their vernal and 
autumnal migrations. The mansion-houses of Scar and Savdle 
are situated about a mile apart,— the former on the west and the 
latter on the east shores of the parish, surrounded by rich corn 
fields and pleasant grassy links; and, in the garden at Saville, 
apples and small fruit are produced. 

The parish of Cross extends to about 4600 acres, of which fully 
a fourth part is moorland, and another fourth part sandy downs 
and links. The general appearance of this parish with all defe- 
rence to the recorded opinion of a fair traveller who lately, from a 
midnight view on the deck of a steamer, at the distance of sixteen 
or eighteen miles, condemned the whole island to hopeless ugli- 
ness, we must be allowed to say is very beautiful. It is well shel- 
tered from the west and north by the Island of Eday, separated 
from it by a narrow sound varying from li to 3 miles wide, through 
which the tides are constantly pouring with a velocity of not less 
than eight miles an hour. This sound has much the appearance 
of a noble river, and the resemblance is increased during the ebb- 
tide by the foaming rapids, as they may be called, of Lashy- Roost 
runnincr nearly across the channel from side to side; and it is cu- 
rious to observe with what dexterity the islanders gmde their hand- 
some-looking and neatly-rigged yawls through the breakers of the 
■Roost. On the east of Cross parish, Sanday Sound, dividing 
Sanday from Stronsay and the adjacent holms, runs along, until it 
leads into the Bay of Kettletoft, at the head of which Cross and 
t,ady parishes march. 

The land in Cross rises at two points to more than 300 feet 
above the sea, and the surrounding islands, sounds, friths, and 
bays, with the green and generally fertile plains of Sanday itsell, 
present, from these points, one of the most delightful views the 
eve can rest upon. One of these heights, called the Brae of Iea, 
falls only a very little distance towards the west, when it terminates 
in a precipice washed at bottom by the sea, and perforated by cu- 
ius caverns; while on the east side the slope is gent e and co- 

"d V h ri h pasture grass, enamelled with the field-gent.n 
1 bird's-eye plimrose, the squill, and other flowers until it 

aches the Ldy edge of Bea Loch on the property of How. 



CROSS AND BIJRNESS. glT 

Geolojy. — The whole island of Sanday is composed of secon- 
dary rocks, sandstone, sandstone flag, and a little limestone. Near 
the house of Saville, in Burness, there is an isolated mass of pri- 
mary rock, supposed gneiss, about fourteen tons weight, resting on 
the surface of the ground, and considered by Dr Neill to be " one 
of the most uncommon mineralogical appearances in Orkney, the 
nearest primary rocks being at Stromness, which is above thirty 
miles distant, and several rapid friths intervening." Opposite to 
Eday, on the west shore of the farm of Stove, in Cross parish, 
there is a curious rock called Heclabir, which Dr Neill says is 
a breccia, " most of the component parts of which are rounded 
and water-worn nodules of sandstone. The pieces are of diffe- 
rent sizes, from balls of three, 6ve, and ten pounds weight, to such 
as are of the size of sparrow eggs. A few quartz and calcareous 
nodules are interspersed." 

The bays of Stove, Backaskail, and Otterswick produce enor- 
mous quantities of shell-fish, principally cockles and the spout or 
razor fish. The accumulated shells of these fish ground to pow- 
der, and heaped up upon the beaches by the action of the sea, 
and blown inland by the wind, seem to form a very considerable 
portion of the soil in Cross and Burness; and in some districts it 
IS evident that the dry sandy downs, now inhabited by numerous 
colonies of rabbits, have at one time been fresh water lochs, or 
lagoons communicating with the sea. The writer of this article 
in draining lands of the description referred to, has found, at I 
depth m some places of six or seven feet, but always on reachino- 
a certain level, a bottom of mud and gravel containing manv rem 
nants of reeds and other aquatic plants; and throughout thedepth 
of the ditch, it was easy to mark the different layers of sand which 
had been blown over the ground at different periods, by the black 
l.ne of mossy earth or decayed vegetable matter running alone, 
where each successive surface had been. I„ immediate connect 
.on, however, with such sandy downs throughout both parishes 
an :i °J clay, of gravelly, orof deep loamy

and the sea-reed are plentiful near the sandy beaches ; and the 
sea banks themselves are often ornamented by the cowslip, thrift, 
and sea-pink, epilobium and cranesbill. 

Zooloffi/.—Fevf places present more encouragement to the sports- 
man than the parishes of Cross and Burness, for though there are 
no grouse or hares, as on Eday or on the mainland of Orkney, 
there are great numbers of lapwing, snipe, and landrail ; while 
rabbits are not counted by hundreds, but by thousands. On more 
than one farm 3000 rabbits are taken yearly  The rocks are te- 
nanted by large flocks of the wild pigeon ; and the lakes, sounds, 
and bays are filled with almost every variety of water-fowl About 
the 20th of June, or later, as the season has been favourable or 
otherwise, literally clouds of the golden plover arrive from the 
north ; and with vast numbers of the sandpiper tribe, of the cur- 
lews, herons, and whimbrels, they are to be found on the moors 
and flat shores of the island, until early spring calls them off to 
their breeding places in less populous regions. Very many varie- 
ties both of water and land birds remain on the island, all the sea- 
son, and breed there. Of these the oyster -catcher, the redshank, 
the dunlin, the dotterel, the turnstone, the tern, and several va- 
rieties of the gull tribe,-the eider-duck, the common wild duck, 
the teal, the shield drake, and others of the duck tribe, with larks, 
buntings, and starlings, are the most numerous. Of the last nam- 
ed birds, the starlings, the writer took from his dovecot in one 
morning no less than twenty-two dozen. 

The fish caught round the island are, cod, ling, skate, holibut, 
flounder, and the young of the coal-fish, here called sillocks and 
cuiths. These last are caught on the fly, either from the rocks, or 
from the stern of a small boat ; and in addition to the supply ot 
food which they form at all seasons of the year, and the quantity 
of oil for household use produced from their livers, the catching 
of them is no despicable sport, and would be preferred to the fin- 
est river fishing by those who would rather fill their basket in one 
hour, than exercise their patience by waiting all day for even " a 
glorious nibble." Lobsters are caught in great numbers by boats 
from the shore, and bought up and conveyed to the London 
market, direct from Sanday, by smacks. Seals are pretty nu- 
merous; but, as there are no resident sportsmen, they are not 
often shot. The otter frequents the rocks and caverns on the 
west side, and is occasionally seen stealing his way to Bea 
loch. But the most exciting of all fishings, if fishing it can

be called, is that of the bottle-nosed or ca'-ing vvhales, the Del- 
phiviis dediictor of zoologists. Large shoals of these animals, 
varying from 50 to 500 in number, and from 5 to 25 feet each in 
length, get occasionally embayed ; and upon this happening, all 
boats are launched, all hands active, every tool which can be con- 
verted into a weapon of offence to the strangers, from the roasting 
spit of the principal tenant, to the ware-fork of the cottar, is put 
into requisition. The shoal is surrounded, driven like a flock of 
timid sheep to shallow water on a sandy shore, and then the at- 
tack is made in earnest. The boats push in, stabbing and wound- 
ing in all directions. The tails of the wounded fish lash the sea, 
which is dyed red with their blood, sometimes dashing a boat to 
pieces. The vvhales in dying emit shrill and plaintive cries, ac- 
companied with loud snorting, and a humming noise easily mis- 
taken at a distance for fifes and drums; so that the whole scene 
has been not inaptly compared to a battle-field. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — There are or rather were two parochial 
registers, — a register of births and baptisms, and a register of mar- 
riages commencing in 1711, and kept, apparently with great regu- 
larity, until 1793, since which time a great majority of the births 
have not been registered, and no register of marriages has been 
kept. There have been no illegitimate births in either of the pa- 
rishes, during the last three years. 

Rents of Land and Proprietors.— It may be curious to observe the 
difference in the yearly value of the lands in Orkney, since the va- 
luation made for assessing the land tax in 1053. The names of the 
then proprietors of Cross and Burness were, Magnus Fea of Grin- 
dilla; James Fea of Stove; John Scollay of Leta ; John Smith 
of Seater; John Elphinstone; John Miller of Skelbuster; John 
Irvine of Isgairth ; John Henryson ; James Traill of Houbister; 
John Groat of Elsness ; Malcolm Sinclair of Papness ; James 
Cock of Westove ; Thomas Abercrombie ; Richard Fothering- 
hame ; Brandy Thurland ; Walter Thomson ; John Above-the- 
Riggs; John Scott of Langskeal ; Edward Cock; Robert Stew- 
art of Brough and the Earl of Morton; and the whole lands arc 
rated m the same valuation at L. 1090, Os. 5d. Scots, or L. 140, 
16s. 8d. Sterling; to which add feu and scat and tcind-ihitios pay- 
able to the Earl of Morton as Donatory of the Crown, viz. 1 bar- 
rel butter at L. 20 ; 70 lispunds butter at L. 2 ; 050 mcils, 1 set- 
tnig, and 6 marks of bear at L. 1, 13s. 4d. ; 10 mcils, 5 scttinTs

gross land-rent of both parishes, at that remote period, L. 260, 
18s. 5d. Sterling. 

In the last Statistical Account of Sanday and North Ronald- 
shay, 1793, prepared with great intelligence, care, and accuracy, 
by the late Rev. William Clouston, then minister of Cross and Bur- 
ness, the gross rent of the two islands is stated at L.1064, 3s. Od. 
Sterling, and calculating at his conversion of rents in kind, which 
would now be just about half-price, the then gross land rent of 
the parishes of Cross and Burness alone amounted to only L. 413, 
Us. Id. Sterling.

The gross rents stated above being L. 1564, lis. ll:;d. Ster- 
ling, after making allowance for lands farmed by proprietors 
themselves, which it is probable Mr Clouston did not include in 
his rental, as also for the difference in the relative value of money 
and farm produce, the rents being then mostly paid in kind, it 
will be seen that the gross rents of these two parishes have been 
more than doubled since 1793; and this, notwithstanding that not 
only kelp but rabbit skins, upon which he counts for part of the 
farmer's profit, have become unsaleable. But the most casual ob- 
server will see at a glance, that, from whatever cause the value of 
grain and cattle now yearly exported, is proportionally increased. 

When the manufacture of kelp was a source of profit to the 
proprietors, and when almost everything else was neglected in 
order to increase its quantity, the produce of the manufacture 
from Cross and Burness was as follows : 

Mr I.aing from Stove anti the Spurness holms, . . 47 tons

Say 480 tons of marketable kelp, which, from its very superior 
quality, always met with a ready sale at Dumbarton and Newcas- 
tle, and so lately as the years 1825-26, and 27, it having been 
much higher priced previous to that time, left a clear average re- 
turn to the proprietor of L.9 per ton, making L.4:320. This 
source of revenue is now almost wholly cut off. The use of kelp 
in the manufacture of glass has been superseded by Spanish 
barilla, brought in at a low duty, and still more, it is said, by new 
chemical discoveries in the art of glass making. The only de- 
mand now for kelp comes from chemical works on the Frith of 
Forth, and Lord Normanby's alum works near Whitby ; but the 
prices offered are such as will do little more than cover the ex- 
pense of manufacture and the freight. 

It may be easily supposed that the abstraction of so large an 
amount of revenue from the proprietors of these parishes, in com- 
mon with the other proprietors of Orkney, must have been severe- 
ly felt, not only by themselves, but also by the farmers, peasantry, 
and trades-people dependent upon them ; and this the more, that 
formerly in Orkney every consideration was sacrificed to kelp. Agri- 
culture was much neglected, and even the fisheries, for which the 
county is so well adapted, were unattended to. So long ago as 1804 
Dr Patrick Neill of Edinburgh warned the proprietors, of what has 
actually happened, in these words : " Should a cheap process for 
extracting the soda from sea water happen to be discovered, or 
should the market for kelp on any other account unexpectedly fail, 
the landholders of Orkney will find, when too late, the great im- 
prudence of thus neglecting the cultivation and improvement of 
their lands." The consequence has been, that several extensive 
properties have been forced into the market, and partly from an 
absurd notion that the failure in the manufacture of kelp would 
have the effect of lowering the land rents, and making their reco- 
very uncertain,— partly from the want of tenants of sufficient skill 
and capital to take the manor farms, and follow out the very ex- 
tensive and, in many cases, highly judicious improvements which 
had been begun by the proprietors; but, above all, from the entire 
• Tour through Orkney and Shetland, by Patrick Neill. Edinburgh, 1806.

and inexcusable ignorance of south country capitalists, as to every- 
thing connected with this remote but highly interesting and valu- 
able county, no sales could be effected, and these properties have 
been left not in the best possible situation for the comfort of the 
people, nor for their own improvement, viz. under trust for the 
payment of creditors. With every disadvantage, however, the 
peasantry of the country have done wonders for themselves. 

Most fortunately, before the entire fall of kelp, Mr Laing of Pap- 
dale and others, had, by liberal encourageoient and large advan- 
ces, induced their small tenants and cottars to fit out boats, nets, and 
lines, and to attempt the prosecuting of the herring and cod fisheries. 
Taking warning from the bad effects of compulsory labour on the 
kelp manufacture, these gentlemen did not enthral- their tenants, 
by any interference with the produce of their fisheries, but left 
them at liberty to dispose of their fish to the highest bidder, and 
to lay out their gains as they thought fit. The inhabitants of the 
parishes of Cross and Burness, as, indeed, of the whole Island of 
Sanday, were rather behind their neighbours in starting to this 
new scene of industry ; but they can now boast of many crews of 
excellent fishermen and of well-rigged and powerful boats, to whose 
numbers every year is adding ; while the rising spirit of independ- 
ence, which successful exertion and unfettered industry is sure to 
produce in any people, leads them yearly to pay more and more at- 
tention to improving the management of their small farms, of their 
stock of cattle and horses, and to raising the scale of their per- 
sonal comforts in clothing and lodging ; so that, considering the 
enormous quantity of land in those parishes, lying comparatively 
waste and unproductive, the proprietors, with a little well-timed 
direction and encouragement, may not only secure their present 
land rents, but look forward to making up, from the same source, 
great part, if not all, of their heavy loss by kelp,

The cottar system, which formerly prevailed universally, and 
still does prevail to a small extent, is perhaps the most degrading 
to the labouring class, the most discouraging to industry and exer- 
tion, and consequently the most injurious to morals, which can be 
conceived. A youngster, when he has hardly attained to man- 
hood, and before he can have saved as much as will purchase a 
bed and blankets, makes an improvident marriage, and only then 
thinks of looking for a hut to shelter him and bis fast-increasing 
family. Having got the hut and a small piece of land, he has to 
go in debt for the purchase of a wretched cow and a still more 
wretched pony, and, paying his rent in small but never-ending and 
ill-defined personal services, or, as it is expressively called in the 
country language, " on-ca-work," he becomes the slave of the 
principal tenant, who is so blind to his own interests, as to prefer 
the slovenly half-executed work of this hopeless, ill-fed, and inert 
being to the willing and active services of a well-paid and well-fed 
farm-servant. The tenants of Sanday are, in general, very kind 
to their cottars, and seldom a day passes without their having to 
grant some little entreated favour or other, which the circumstan- 
ces of the cottar makes necessary for his support; but they do not 
seem to calculate the value in money of the property thus given 
away. Often, in the course of the year, it will amount to as much 
as the wages of a good ploughman ; but then, being an uncertain 
bounty, and, moreover, the product of beggary, it does the receiver 
little good beyond the immediate relief to his family, and destroys 
in him all habits of self-dependence and of foresight. 

The tenants complain that, from the inducement held out to 
young men by the fisheries, it is nearly impossible to get farm-ser- 
vantst While the tenant was paid a high price for the manufac- 
ture of kelp, he kept his farm-servants all the year round, employ- 
ino- them profitably during the summer season in the kelp ; but, not 
halving yet gone into the system of raising extensive green crops, he 
does not conceive that he needs servants during the four months 
betwixt plough-casting and harvest; consequently, he pays off his 
servants at the former period, and they are thus forced to become 
fishermen. He cannot, therefore, expect that they will return lo 
him exactly at the time which suits his convenience, nor that a 
man, who may be making L.l a-week, with the chance sometimes 



CROSS AND BUR.VESS. 



95 



of as much in a day and night, will leave this exciting employment 
for farm work at as much per month. The remedy of all this is 
evident. Let the cottar's house and land be rented in money, 
which rent let him make out in any line his genius may lead him 
to. If the tenant requires his services, he ought to be hired by 
the day or hour at fair money wages, and if he requires any farm 
produce he ought to pay for it in cash. In regard to farm-servants, 
the tenant would find his interest in employing only those who have 
nothing to do with boating or fishing, — managing his farm so as to 
give them work all the year round, and paying them such wages 
as shall give him a right to insist for close, constant, and active 
service. 

The most approved make of carts, ploughs, rollers, and other 
farming implements are in general use ; and some of the plough- 
men would obtain prizes at a competition even in the south country. 

The society of Sanday is equal to that of any of the islands, 
and the clergy and principal farmers are exceedingly hospitable 
and obliging to each other, as well as to strangers. There are few 
or no games, or public amusements of any kind. The common 
people used to be fond of dancing and foot-ball playing, but of 
late years, it is to be regretted, that, while there is less hilarity and 
social enjoyment among the young, there is more of quiet tippling 
in the public-house. Relaxation and amusement are necessary ; 
and when the innocent recreations of music and dancing are dis- 
couraged, there is a risk that something worse may be had re- 
course to. 

The language spoken, as through all the islands, is English. 
Among the peasantry a good many words are peculiar to the north 
isles, and some of them are evidently of Scandinavian origin. A 
few are given in alphabetical order. Anything like a complete 
list would encroach too much on our space.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Strangers still find much to condemn in the ma- 
nagement of the land in these parishes; but to those who recollect 
what it was forty years ago, a very great improvement, indeed, is 
perceptible ; and now that the slavery of the kelp manufacture has 
been removed, and the free and unfettered energies of the farmers 
begin to be applied to their proper business, it may be hoped that 
twenty years hence, they will in this respect stand exposed to 
less objection on the part of their more fortunate southern neigh- 
bours. 

Great part of the lands have been placed in a state of severalty, 
and the marches betwixt different farms, as well as betwixt estates 
ascertained ; and, in many cases, good division-fences erected.

CROSS AND BUItNESS.

feu-duties formerly payable in grain, and butter, and meal, to the 
Earl of Zetland, though made at far too high a price, has set 
them at liberty to occupy their lands in the raising of cattle and 
sheep, to which, in this mild but variable climate, with' a low 
mean temperature, they are more suited than to the production 
of grain. And farther, by the landlords fixing a money rent with 
the tenants, neither are exposed to the uncertainty and fluctuation 
of grain fiars, and the postponement of regular termly settlements. 
It is not the fault of the soil nor of the climate, however unftivour- 
able, nor of the industry, intelligence, or enterprise of the inha- 
bitants, that this country is so far behind the rest of Scotland. 
The excessive feu -duties, most grossly unjust in their origin,' 
which were payable in kind to the donatory of the Crown, cramp- 
ed the energies of both landlord and tenant. These duties went 
out of the country like a tax making no return, and from their na- 
ture, could not even induce the great man, who received them, to 
take a patrimonial interest in it. It has often been a matter of 
wonder how little of favour or encouragement these islands have 
received at any time from the Government, when it is considered 
that the population of Orkney and Zetland exceeds that of Ber- 
wickshire, East Lothian, Roxburghshire, Dumfries-shire, and 
other counties of note and consideration ; and that there are only 
thirteen counties in Scotland which exceed these islands in popu- 
lation, and only eight which exceed them in extent of surface 
But to return to rents in kind, they keep back improvement, and 
yet well-informed landlords are still found giving in to them, just 
to meet the scruples and prejudices of tenants. Under this' sys- 
tem, the tenant will hardly ever progress ; he must remain sta 
tionary, and can derive nothing from his farm, beyond a subsist- 
ence. In good years, his surplus payments in kind, inferior in 
quality, because he forces all his land to carry grain, do not leave 
him a remunerating price for his labour, and in bad years he is 
charged a high price for what the overwrought soil did not nro- 
duce to him. '■ 

The middleman system of letting farms, with a multitude of 
cottars or small tenants placed at the mercy of the principal te- 
nant, ,s fast breaking up. Mr Laing of Papdale gave the first 
blow to this cottar system on his farm of Stove. When he beaan 
he improvement of this farm, he allotted to the cottars, in a dis- 
trict by themselves, three Scotch acres of arable land each, with 
oarNE'"" ''''' e'"" '-" tli's possession, with

their house and yard, tliey paid a rent of L. 5, 5s., and were left 
wholly at liherty, the only condition of their holding being the re- 
gular payment of the rent. At sanie time, he offered, if they 
chose to work kelp, to give them the same price for their labour, 
L.3 to L.4 per ton, which had been formerly paid to the principal 
tenant ; and such was the effect of this free system, that men con- 
sidered notoriously slothful were converted into willing and in- 
dustrious labourers, and not only was the quantity of kelp greatly 
increased, but he never wanted good and efficient workmen to hire 
at fair wages for his farming improvements. Mr Laing's example 
has been followed with success in the parish of Burness, where, by 
doing away with all services, by a moderate allowance for improve- 
ments, a little nursing, and care in helping the small tenants, 
to dispose of their produce to advantage, an addition to the land 
rents, and a most evident improvement in the condition and ha- 
bits of the occupiers, has been effected. 

Crops.— By far the greater part of the arable lands in these pa- 
rishes are still cropped alternately with bear and oats, the enormous 
supply of sea-weed for manure keeping up the fertility of the land 
under this scourging system. Potatoes are, however, more exten- 
sively cultivated than formerly, and on some farms, turnips and 
sown grasses are introduced into the rotation. The bear is thin- 
coated, and meals well, being white in the flour. The weight 
does not average more than 42 lbs. per bushel, unless where com- 
post has been applied, when it has reached 48 lbs. per bushel. 
Turnip and rye-grass seeds are raised, and are found to give great 
satisfaction, when sown in the southern counties. The soil is ad- 
mirably adapted to turnip husbandry, and most splendid crops of 
this valuable esculent may now be seen growing, wliere a short time 
since, rabbits alone had possession of the soil. In many places 
throughout the island, where steadings have been of old, large 
heaps of rich mould are to be found. These seem to have been the 
accumulations of the farm manure of many a year, durmg times 
when the people were too indolent or too prejudiced to apply it to 
the soil ; and it is even in the recollection of the writer, that a te- 
nant of a large farm held his cottars bound, as a service once a 
Year, to clean his dung court, and convey the manure as a nuisance, 
to the sea-beach, and he has witnessed the wilful burning of the 
straw, from which forty bolls of grain had been thrashed. 

in 'improving the sand links or rabbit warrens, these accumula- 
tions become a must important auxiliary, for, being trenched and

exposed to the frost and the vivifying effects of the air, and after- 
wards mixed with small kelp and a sufficient quantity of fresh sea- 
weed to melt it, they form compost, by means of which a great ex- 
tent of the most unpromising rabbit links is converted into a flou- 
rishing turnip-field, where properly selected grass seeds are sure to 
thrive with the next crop. The grass seeds found to suit best for 
such land, are two bushels of perennial ryegrass ; one bushel of 
mixed timothy and cocksfoot; six pounds of ribgrass ; and six 
pounds of white clover per acre. The Rev. Walter Traill of Wes- 
tove, has cultivated lucerne in such land with success. Cabbages 
manured with the sea-weed are also raised to great size ; the com- 
mon Scotch grey reaching a weight of fourteen pounds each plant. 

Stock.— The horses used for carriage and draught are good har- 
dy pomes of from 14 to 15 hands high : many oxen are employed 
m cartmg sea-weed ; and the cattle generally are improving in 
weight and quality. The Neapolitan, the Berkshire, and otheHm- 
proved breeds of swine have been introduced, and considerable num- 
bers are yearly exported alive to Aberdeen and Peterhead, The 
native breed of sheep, which are kept on tether during the summer, 
and roam at large over the fields and round the shores, where they 
eat sea-weed in winter, are not yet extinct, but their numbers are 
much thinned. They are the short-tailed sheep of Iceland, Shet- 
land, and the Hebrides. In 1808, Malcolm Laing of Papdale 
introduced the Merino breed on his property of Stove, and pur- 
chased rams at high prices from some of the best flocks in the 
kingdom. They were crossed with Cheviots, and they succeeded 
most satisfactorily. Mr Laing, one year, it is said, received 7s 
6d. per pound for some of his wool. The wool of clip 1811 of the' 
lambs of some Orkney ewes by a Merino ram, was considered by 
a wool stapler froir. Yorkshire, better worth 2s. 8d. per pound, than 
the wool of the Orkney dams of these lambs was worth 8d. ■ and 
the quantity being about double, made a difference of 9s' 4d 
between the fleece of our Orkney ewe and that of her lamb by a 
Merino tup at shearing time ; a sum equal to the value of the 
ewe fleece and carcass altogether. Mr Laing found the Orkney 
cross assimilated faster in fleece than the Cheviot did; but the 
crosswith the Orkney was inferior in carcass to that with the Che- 
Poultry of all kinds thrive well, and are numerous and cheap.

Wages. — The wages of a good ploughman are L. 7, 7s. of money, 
with six bolls of meal, and milk and rabbits. But the greater num- 
ber of farm-servants are employed on the farms for the winter half- 
year only, for which their wages are from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3, and 
they are fed and lodged in the family. Women-servants receive 
from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 per annum ; but as they are much engag- 
ed at home in the plaiting of rye-straw for bonnets, they are un- 
willing to work in the field, and are generally employed only in 
the care of cattle or as house-servants. Day-labourers are paid 
from Is. to Is. 3d. per day, but, as already observed, very few are 
thus engaged for money wages, and, as a labourer cannot obtain 
employment on day's wages throughout the year, there is found to 
be a scarcity of them when a job occurs for which they are re- 
quired. 

Fisheries There are in Cross and Burness fourteen boats en- 
gaged in fishing lobsters ; and fifteen boats and sloops fishing cod 
and herrings, besides numerous small boats. It has been observ- 
ed that the inhabitants of Sanday are only beginning to devote at- 
tention to the fisheries ; but it may not be out of place here to state 
the quantity of cod caught, cured, and dried in the north isles of 
Orkney, during the present season, 1840.

When to this is added the value of herrings caught and delivered 
to curers at Stronsay by North Isles boats, which the writer of this 
article has no means at hand of correctly ascertaining, but which 
could hardly be less than an equal sum, he thinks that it will be 
allowed that the inhabitants of these islands bid fair to do away 
with the character for supineness and indolence in regard to fish- 
ing, which has been liberally bestowed upon them by those who 
were either unacquainted with them, or made no sufficient allowance 
for their peculiar circumstances. As the cure of cod was almost 
unknown in Orkney previous to the appointment of fishery-officers 
to oversee and direct it, the Orkney men had no bad habits, in

tliis respect, to get rid of, and they have so closely followed the 
excellent directions which have been given them, that their fish 
are acknowledged equal, if not superior, to any that come to mar- 
ket. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.~0{ the population, there are adherents of 
the Established church, of all ages, in both parishes, 81 0. Of these 
447 are communicants. 

The adherents of Dissenters of all ages are ISl; of these, 96 
communicate with the United Associate Seceders, who have their 
meeting-house in Lady parish, and 3 are Anabaptists. There is 
one parish church in Cross and another in Burness, and divine 
service is performed in each on the alternate Sundays. 'J'his is a 
source of great inconvenience both to minister and people. There 
are in both parishes 102 families further than two miles; 64 families 
further than four miles; and 28fimilies further thansixmiles distant 
from one of the churches ; and this tends much to prevent, on the 
part of the people, a regular Sabbatical attendance at either place 
of worship. But supposing the people were in general able, as 
they are very willing, to give a regular weekly attendance, tliere 
would still be the serious and palpable want of church accommo- 
dation, for the church of Cross has dnly 248 sittings, and that of 
Burness, including those of the passage, 262. To accommodate, 
therefore, two-thirds of the church adherents, 292 more sittings 
are awanting in Cross church, and in Burness, 278. Indeed 
neither of the churches can accommodate even the communicants 
of the establishment. The remedy for this evil would be either 
the erection of one convenient church for both parishes in a cen- 
tral situation or dividing the parishes quoad sacra, and appointing a 
pastor to each.  

The manse is rather an old house, but kept in good repair by 
the heritors. It ,s situated in Cross parish, and there is a glebe 
o about twenty acre.s, with garden and offices attached. The 
other glebe in Burness parish, which is rented for L.10 or L 12 
has been already noticed. The stipend, payable almost enti'i-eW 
in money, including L.66, 7s. 4d. drawn from the Island of North 
Ronaldshay, formerly united with these parishes, amounts, with 
allowance tor communion element.s, to L.210. 

Education.-Thexo is only one parochial school in the island, 
situated at tl.e junction of the three j,arishes, and there is no othei' 
school ,n Cross or Burness, though female schools are much 



102 



OllKNEY. 



wanted. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L.46, 14s. 4|d.,,. 
and the average yearly amount of school fees received is L.10. 
The average number of scholars attending the parochial school is 53. 

Poor. — The number of poor persons receiving aid from the 
session in Cross is 13, and in Burness, 11; and the sum dis- 
tributed to each has been 2s. 6d. The amount of collections 
for the poor at the churches has been L. 5, 10s. yearly, which, 
with a donation of L.l, Is. from Mr Balfour of Trenaby, has 
formed the amount of the provision for the poor, excepting 
that there is, on Mr Laing's property of Stove, a mortification 
by the proprietor of four small cotts or farms, worth now L 5, 
5s. each of yearly rent, for supporting four superannuated ser- 
vants, who spend thirty years in constant service on the princi- 
pal farms ; failing whom, the session are empowered to draw the 
rent for behoof of the poor upon the farm of Stove in the first in- 
stance, and, in lack of them, for the general poor of the parish. 
The charity has not latterly been well administered, and hardly 
any one of the persons now in possession of the farms are paupers 
of the description contemplated by Mr Fea, the benevolent mort- 
gager, nor are they entitled to hold them. 

Fuel. There are no peat-mosses in the Island of Sanday, and 

the inhabitants of Cross and Burness are consequently ill supplied 
with fuel. Each family endeavours to procure a boat or more of 
peats from the neighbouring Island of Eday, to which the cottar 
adds prepared cow and horse dung, and the larger tenants coals 
from the Frith of Forth or Newcastle. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is evident that these parishes are still capable of very great 
improvement. Steam- navigation, which has now reached Kirk- 
wall, were it also brought through the islands, would do much, by 
making the transit of grain, cattle, and other produce free from 
the uncertainty attending sailing-vessels. But perhaps the most 
hopeful prospect of improvement would be from the sale of some 
of the estates now in the market to men of capital and enterprise. 
A few tenants from improved districts are also wanted, not theo- 
rising speculative gentlemen farmers, who might cavil and carp 
at things as they are, without knowing how to mend them ; but 
hard-working sure-going men, with sufficient capital, and with 
common sense enough to make their plans conform to soil, cli- 
mate, and circumstances; in fact, just such ciiaracters as are 
usually described to be the most suitable for emigrating to the

colonies ; and it has often struck the writer as wonderful, that 
young farmers, as well as men of capital, should attempt the 
back woods of Canada, or expose themselves to the privations of 
dry and scorching seasons in Australia, when such good opportu- 
nities for turning their skill to account, and for investing their ca- 
pital, were to be found so much nearer home, in a comparatively 
mild climate, and among a people proverbially kind to strangers, 
and generally as well-informed and as companionable as any in 
Scotland. 



North Ronaldsha. — The Rev. Adam White, Minister. 

Extent, §-c. — The island of North Ronaldsha, the most nor- 
therly of the Orkney group, is separated from the island of San- 
day by a frith of about three miles broad where narrowest ; and lies 
upwards of thirty miles from Kirkwall, nearly in the direction of 
north-east. In form, the island is very irregular, but never ex- 
ceeds two miles in breadth, and, in length, measures about five 
miles from the two extreme points, though there are scarcely four 
between the two most remote dwelling-houses. It is calculated 
to contain about four square miles. On the south and east sides 
of the island, where the beach is for the most part low, shelving 
and sandy, the shape is probably much altered from what it ori- 
ginally was, as a considerable extent of ground seems to have 
been gained from the sea by the gradual accumulation of sand, 
which is every winter drifted up from the beach, and spreads over 
the grounds above. The west and north-west sides are rocky and 
abrupt, though not very elevated, and there is often such a heavy 
surf breaking upon the rocks, that the spray renders the land, to 
the distance of some hundred yards, quite black and sterile. To- 
wards the north-east, the shores of the island are, in some measure, 
protected by two reefs of rocks, called the altars of Lina and the 
Shelky Skerry. 

Topographical Appea j'cince, — The general surface of the island 
is rather flat, having only a gentle rise toward the middle. It is 
much above the average of the other islands in point of dryness, 
and, with the exception of a small strip about the middle, and an 
edging round the shore, kept as a lair for sheep, it is all in a state 
oi cultivation. Its superior dryness it owes very much to the large

mixture of shell-sand found in its soil, and partly also to there 
being proper declivities for the water discharging itself into the 
sea. 

There are but three bays ; the South bay, Ness bay on the 
south-east side, and Linket bay on the east. None of these 
are safe anchorages, and, excepting in mild weather, no vessel can 
remain upon the coast. The chief headlands are Twingas, Strom- 
ness. Brides -ness, and Dennis-ness. 

Zoology. — The fish which are found on the shores or in the neigh- 
bouring seas, are such as are common to all Orkney. Those which 
are most frequently caught for home consumption, are siliks and 
cuthes, — the coal-fish, I believe, in the first and second years of their 
existence; and those which are caught for the market, are lobsters 
and cod. The Shelky Skerry mentioned above is much frequented 
by the great seal or Phoca major. There are always some about it ; 
but in winter, great numbers occasionally arrive from the north seas, 
and sometimes bring forth their young upon the rock. The islanders 
are on the watch, and often secure the strangers by going out in 
a midnight expedition with clubs, on which occasions they have 
been known to kill as many as three score. A successful expedi- 
tion of this kind is a matter of no small rejoicing, as a good sup- 
ply of oil is obtained from the seal. 

A great variety of birds frequent the island, but none of them are 
of a rare description, unless perhaps the red-necked phalarope 
 Tringa hyperborea J, which visits North Ronaldsha in consider- 
able numbers about the middle of June, and departs early in Sep- 
tember. It makes its nest among the reeds about the lochs, and 
lays four eggs of a dingy olive colour with brown spots. It is pretty 
tame, and allows its motions, which are very graceful, to be observed 
at a small distance. After north-east gales of some continuance, 
many strange birds are occasionally found, such as the goatsucker, 
the golden-crested wren, the cuckoo, and the snowy owl. 
II. — Civil History. 

The island is wholly the property of William Traill, Esq. 
of Woodwick, who, however, does not reside upon it. It appears 
anciently to have been divided into three nearly equal parts, — the 
mounds which formed the division, and which are of a considerable 
height and breadth, being still almost uninjured. The only other 
things which bear the appearance of antiquity, are the remains 
all under ground of an old castle, called still Burrion Castle, and 
a large erect flat stone, rising ten or twelve feet perpendicular 



CROSS AND 13URNESS. ]05 

above the ground, much the same in size and appearance as tliose 
found in other parts of Orkney, especially in the parish of Firth 
and Stenness. Concerning the one here, there is no tradition either 
as to its original use or the period of its erection. 

III. — Population. 

Habits of the People. — Tlie customs of the people are much 
the same as those prevalent in other parts of Orkney. One only 
seems to be quite peculiar, and is almost uniformly observed at 
funerals, — the nearest of kin present being always expected to throw 
upon the coffin the first spadeful of earth. In the case of near re- 
latives, this comes to be a very painful service ; but it is regarded 
as a sacred duty, and is not declined even by the most afflicted 
widow. What may have been the origin of the practice, it is per- 
haps impossible to ascertain ; but now, it is evidently considered as 
a proper mark of tenderness and respect towards the deceased. 

It is reported in the former Statistical Account, that the popu- 
lation was then 1791 4'20,— 211 males and 209 females. By 
the census taken in 1831, the population was 522, — 247 males 
and 275 females ; exhibiting an increase in forty years of 102 in- 
habitants. The amount in April 1836 did not exceed 480, which 
IS owing to a new division of the lands having been made in 1832, 
when the number of houses was reduced, and about eighty persons 
left the island. ,

These facts will be found to speak very highly for the general 
healthfulness and prosperity of the population of the island. There 
is not a single person at the age of fifty, who has not felt himself 
able, or at least thought he was so, to support a wife and family, 
all who have reached that ago being married ; and what is perhaps 
still more extraordinary, out of the whole number, three only are 
widowers, and these very old men, while there are but five females, 
who may be said to be without hope of marriage. Then look to the 
small number of deaths as compared with the number of births, the 
one being little more than one-third of the other; and wiiat is most 
extraordinary of all, the small number of deaths in proportion to the 
whole population. The rate of mortality, judging from the last 



106 ORKNEY. 

five years, is only 1 in 77. The average number of the popula- 
tion in each year has been, as nearly as possible, 495 ; and even 
taking 7 as the average number of deaths, it makes the rate of 
mortality 70 f. This almost exceeds credibility ; but there is one 
thing to be mentioned in explanation of it, which is, that there are 
some persons, almost every year, leaving the island in quest of em- 
ployment, who seldom return to reside in it, while there are none 
coming from other places to reside here. Consequently, the num- 
ber of deaths in the island will scarcely give a correct representa- 
tion of the deaths of those who belong to it. This, however, could 
not affect the rate of mortality very much ; and by employing a 
different method for ascertaining the rate, taking the average age 
of the persons who have died during the period in question, it is 
still brought up to 62. The facts will fully substantiate this pro- 
portion. The people are uncommonly healthy and robust. Ex- 
cepting a very few who die in infancy, — and these seldom exceed- 
ing one in the twelvemonth,— deaths among the young are exceed- 
ingly rare. By far the greatest number of deaths take place on 
those who have reached sixty-five or upwards ; and yet compara- 
tively few outlive eighty. Occasional instances of very great lon- 
gevity will be found no test of the general healthfulness of the po- 
pulation, or of the average term of life ; and it is precisely among 
a population like that of this island, that these attain their maxi- 
mum, where all are accustomed to laborious occupations and ex- 
posure to every kind of weather, which tend, in the first instance, 
to render the bodily frame hardy and robust, and, at the same time, 
prevent it from reaching an extreme old age. 

There is a great deal of native politeness and much kindness 
of heart among the people ; but in domestic comforts, they are 
certainly far behind the general run of peasantry in the southern 
districts ;— not that they are generally more deficient in the ma- 
terials o'f comfort,— for every house almost has two or more 
cows, a pig, several sheep, and abundance of poultry. But there 
is a great" want of neatness and cleanliness in the management 
of household matters, so that their condition has nothing of 
the tidy and comfortable appearance of what is now to be met 
with in houses of a like description in the south. And for any ef- 
fectual improvement in this respect, there are two formidable bar- 
riers in the way, which are not likely soon to be overcome. The 
women have much work to do out of doors, a species of work, too, 
which peculiarly unfits them for the neat management of house- 



CUOSS AND BUUNESS. 



1C7 



hold concerns, such as cutting sea-weed for kelp, carrying up ware 
for manure on their backs, and spreading it on the land; and be- 
sides, the construction of their houses is very unfavourable, which 
are not only not plastered but not even built with lime, and seldom 
have any semblance of a chimney even upon the roof, — while, for 
the sake of having each part of the house supplied with an equal 
share of heat, the fire-place is most commonly planted in the mid- 
dle of the floor. The smoke consequently finds its way in every 
direction, and to keep either the walls or the utensils in a state of 
proper cleanliness, is next to impossible. Yet the present form of 
houses is much superior to what was possessed by the last genera- 
tion ; and this form may soon perhaps give way to another in a 
higher state of improvement. 

The greatest natural discomfort, however, under which the in- 
habitants of this island labour, is the scarcity of fuel. There are 
no peats in it, nor any to be found nearer than the Island of Eday, 
which is fifteen miles distant. Of course, very few are able to sup- 
ply themselves with fuel of that description ; a considerable num- 
ber get a partial supply ; making up the deficiency with cow-dung 
converted into what are called scons, and the stronger kind of sea- 
weed. Many can afford nothing but the two last, and in cold 
weather they are often in a very comfortless condition. This is 
an evil beyond remedy, as there is not the least chance of the 
bulk of the population ever being able to lay in a sufficient provi- 
sion either of coals or of peats. 

There are no blind, deaf, or dumb in the island, and but two 
idiots, and one fatuous person. 

IV. — Industry. 
The island is altogether of an agricultural character. With 
the exception of two weavers and one tailor, there are none who 
do not spend the chief part of their time in the labours of the field. 
The subdivision of labour is here only in its infancy. Most of the 
men are able to sew, and at leisure hours make or repair their 
every-day clothes. The wool, out of which these are made, is all 
carded and spun on the little wheel by the women, who are for 
the most part exceedingly industrious. And besides the three re- 
gular men of handicraft above-mentioned, there are a good many 
who work occasionally as smiths, carpenters, and boat-builders; 
but they have all farms or shares in farms, to which they chiefly 
look for their subsistence ; and even the three who are the most 
exclusive in their employments, always shear in harvest and go 



108 



ORKNEY. 



out to some of the fisheries in summer. This mixture of employ- 
ments is not favourable either to great skill or to much profit in 
any particular department ; but with such a limited field, and es- 
pecially surrounded with so many who have both the leisure and 
the inclination iu most things to help themselves, it is scarcely 
possible for any one to gain a sufficient livelihood by confining 
himself to any single occupation. 

In the last Statistical Account, ninety-four persons were stated to 
be engaged in agriculture, and nineteen in fishing. This division, 
however, was formed, not because there was a complete distinction 
between the two classes of persons, but because their principal sup- 
port was derived from these respective occupations. Judging by 
the outlay of time, all of them might be designated as agricultu- 
rists, — as, during eight months in the year, their main employment 
is connected with husbandry. But in this, younger brothers and 
sometimes other relatives give their work for their food, while for 
every thing besides they must be indebted to the lobster and her- 
ring-fisheries ; and these, therefore, may with propriety be named 
from the occupation which yields them most advantage. There 
are also about a dozen employed as farm- servants, and two men 
who are called millers, though a large part of their time is spent 
otherwise, the one as a smith, the other as a carpenter. 

These are the only divisions that subsist among the inhabitants 
of this island. There is no merchant, no baker, no shoemaker, 
no innkeeper ; and the consolation of being without the last, is al- 
most enough to reconcile one to the inconvenience arising from the 
absence of the rest. This is an inconvenience felt only by the 
few, who are in the habit of using things, which the island itself 
does not furnish, and a little care and experience soon teaches them 
how to provide against it. 

Agriculture. — The cultivated part of the island has never been 
exactly measured ; but about a fourth only of the whole surface 
is waste, the greater part of which is the portion along the west 
and north-west side, which is rendered sterile by the spray. This 
portion may therefore be regarded as hopelessly sterile. But the 
small tract in the interior, which is still unreclaimed, is now divided 
off, and promises in a few years to be all in a slate of cultivation. 

Rental— T\Q whole rental of the island is nearly L. 500. 

The sort of farms and the style of farming which prevail here, 
arc rather of a primitive nature. With the exception of one farm, 
which pays a rent of about L. 80, there is none that exceeds L.25, 



CROSS AND BUllNESS. 



109 



and the greater part are much below this. It was the policy 
of the landlords in this country to subdivide the land, and encou- 
rage the increase of population as much as possible, for the pur- 
pose of obtaining a sufficient number of labourers to manufac- 
ture the kelp ; and now when they would fain adopt an opposite 
policy, and enlarge the size of their farms, the excess of popula- 
tion meets them with an insuparable difficulty. Until a few years 
ago, indeed, there was no such thing as a separate and distinct farm 
in this island; it was divided into five townships or districts, each 
containing a considerable number of houses scattered up and down, 
amongst which the land, both pasture and arable, was equally di- 
vided ; and that none might have the advantage of another, not only 
was every plot of arable ground divided, but an exchange made 
every year, — so that improvement was impossible, and the indus- 
trious had no encouragement for their industry. In 1832, this 
system was wisely broken up, and the whole island squared offinto 
little fa rms, lying contiguous to the several houses. A new and 
higher scale of rents was, at the same time, agreed upon, which ren- 
dered the measure unpopular; but considerable allowances were for 
some years to be made for improvements in drains and enclo- 
sures, of which the more industrious have so far availed themselves, 
as both greatly to improve their farms, and to pay their rent with- 
out much difficulty. But excepting on the larger farm, and par- 
tially on one or two others, there is no regular rotalion kept up. 
The land is alternately cropped with bear and oals— a mode of 
cultivation wliich is not likely to be soon abandoned, as it is much 
favoured by the large quantities of sea-weed drifted to the shore, 
and almost rendered necessary by the demand for winter oddev 
to then- cattle. They can consequently grow nothing but the in- 
ferior kinds of grain, bear, or bigg, and the small grey or black 
oat. About 1.500 bolls of the former are raised, and 1200 of the 
latter; and of these quantities nearly one-third is exported. The 
bear commonly weighs 44 lbs. per bushel ; after turnips it has been 
found to weigh as high as 48 lbs.; and the oats are generally from 
25 to 28 lbs. 

Although, however, the old system of alternate cropping is still 
prevalent, great improvements in farming have taken place during 
the last twelve years, chicdy owing to the good example and jut 
c icious management of the gentleman, Mr Robert Scarlh, who, 
dunng that period, has been acting as factor on the property. 
Ihere was then but one cart in the island, which was never used. 



no

as the horse showed some disinclination to go into it ; only 
one two stilted plough, no inclosures, and both horses and cattle 
were exceedingly small and trifling. The latter have been much 
improAred by crosses from Dunrobin bulls, and are now equal to 
the average show of cattle in Orkney. The horses are also greatly 
improved in size and strength. Enclosures are to be seen on every 
side, completed or in progress. Every house is furnished with a 
neat and well-made plough, commonly of wood, but sometimes 
also of iron — a valuable substitute, indeed, for the old one-stilted 
shapeless thing they used before, which rather broke up the ground 
than turned it over. And a still greater advantage is derived from 
the introduction of carts, with one or more of which every house 
is now supplied. Before, every thing had to be carried on horse- 
back, either in sacks or in a sort of wooden creels, which they 
used for bringing up their ware to the land, and such other articles 
as could not be put into sacks. In this way an immense deal of 
time was lost, which they can now save and turn to good ac- 
count. So that, in an agricultural point of view, the island at 
present stands upon a far better footing, than it did twelve years 
ago. 

The only other thing to be noticed under this head is the con- 
dition of the sheep, which is just as bad as can well be conceived. 
With the exception of a very few kept on the largest farm for 
killing, they are all shut outby a high dike, which encompasses 
the whole island to the mere shores, and a little bit of waste ground 
left for them here and there. Their sole food almost, is the sea- 
weed that happens, to be drifted ashore, and as this comes most 
plentifully during winter, that is their fattening season, especially 
before the cold weather of the new year sets in. They are chiefly 
kept for the wool, from which all that is worn in every-day cloth- 
ing is manufactured ; but every house has a practice of killing one 
on yule or Christmas eve, which goes by the name of the yule 
sheep. And on the forenoon of that day, there is a great gather- 
ino-, at a certain place, of all the men and sheep in the island, for 
the selection of the several victims. 

Fisheries.— The only fisheries that are carried on with a view 
to the market, are those of lobster, herring, and cod. In the 
first six boats, each having two men, are engaged every year from 
about the beginning of May to the middle of June. The fish are 
sold to a London Company, whose welled smacks call for them 
recrularly once a week, at a place about ten miles distant, in the 



CROSS AND BURNESS. 



Ill 



adjoining island of Sanday. The price given varies from 3d. to 
3id per fish : and it is reckoned a fair fishing, when each boat catch- 
es about 600 fish. 

To the herring-fishing fourteen boats are furnished by the 
island, all above 24 and some of, them 28 feet keel. They 
have been built by two workmen in the island, who are in a great 
measure self-taught; and they are considered thestrongest and finest 
boats in Orkney. They are all held in shares, each the property 
of four men, who man them ; and sometimes a young person is 
hired in as a fifth hand. As boatmen, they are not deficient either 
in skill or boldness ; but they have never been very successful in 
the fishery, and the last two years have been so unfavourable, that 
many have not gained as much as is sufficient to cover their out- 
lay. The station they frequent is in Stronsay, the only one for 
the cure of herrings in the north Isles of Orkney. 

Until the summer of the year 1836, the cod-fishing had scarcely 
ever been tried here ; the people having usually been employed in 
making kelp, during the part of the season most suitable for that. 

The greatest drawback the island has to contend with, in carry- 
ing on any fishery that requires large boats, is the want of a safe 
anchorage. The men are obliged to draw up their boats in the pro- 
spect of bad weather, or shift them from one side of the island to 
another, — both of which are the cause of great trouble and in- 
convenience. 

Manufactures. — The only kind of manufacture carried on in the 
island, is kelp. As many as 120 tons have been made in one year, 
though the average would not exceed 100. To get even that 
quantity requires considerable pushing on the part of the land- 
lord ; and now that he has no inducement to do so, the average 
will be still less. The kelp from this island had always a high 
character in the market, and has commanded a sale every year 
as yet, though latterly at very low prices. But as long as it can 
be sold without any actual loss, it will still be an object for the 
landlord to get it made ; as nearly one-third of the rental is made 
up by the allowances given for the manufacture of this article, 
which, but for this, would remain unpaid. The allowance given 
is at the rate of L. 2, 2s. per ton. A man with his family will 
make a ton and a-half in ordinary seasons. It has been lately dis- 
covered that the kelp made of drift sea-weed, is valuable for the 
iodme it contains, and for that purpose is worth L. 4 per ton. 



112 ORKNEY. 

But it is only about a sixth part of the whole kelp of this island, that 
is made of drift sea-weed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
This island had always been a separate parish, until lately com- 
bined with other two, Cross and Burness, in the neighbouring island 
of Sanday, under one charge. The clergymen having to travel a dis- 
tance of not less than four miles by land and six by sea, it was impos- 
sible there could be regular ministrations in the island, or any pro- 
per pastoral superintendence established. Indeed, as to all the be- 
nefits of a regular ministry, the people might be said to be total 
strangers; and being besides nearly all on a level among themselves, 
no one, from his superior wealth or station in society, to command 
an influence over the rest, they afforded an example of a people in 
the common ranks of life, very much left to their own discretion. 
There were a few things, however, to temper and modify the na- 
tural result of such a state of things. Each district had its elder, 
who was commonly a person of respectability and worth, and was 
allowed a considerable weight in the settlement of disputes. Then, 
proudly elevated above these stood the haUie, the acknowledged 
head of all the natives, and looked up to with no small respect ; 
who was appointed to the honourable distinction by the landlord, 
and was generally chosen with impartiality. The last one, who 
died only two years ago, and with whom the office also expired, 
was a person of great reading for one in his rank of life, and was 
in the habit pretty regularly of reading a sermon to the people on 
Sunday, and conducting a Sabbath school. This certainly was 
productive of some good, though not so much as might be suppos- 
ed,— the authority being still wanting, which was necessary to 
enforce, on the part of the people, a proper attention. Besides 
these authorities, the factor occasionally resided on the island, and 
an annual visit was paid by the landlord ; but their stay was too 
short and irregular to have much influence in moulding the habits 
and characters of the people. 

In 1829, a manse was erected on the island, under the Commis- 
sioners for Planting New Churches in the Islands and Highlands, 
and in the following year a clergyman was ordained. The island 
was then virtually erected into a separate parochial charge, though 
it was not constituted such till the summer of 1833. Great joy 
was testified by the people at the settlement of a minister among 
them. 

There used to be a good deal of pilfenng, when a shipwreck 



CROSS AND BURNESS. 



113 



took place, — which was not looked upon as proper stealing. Many 
persons thought themselves at liberty to appropriate goods of that 
description, who were never known to steal an article from their 
neighbours. A good deal had been done to check the evil by the 
vigorous measures of Mr Scarth ; but the discipline of the church 
was required to put an effectual stop to it. A very different feel- 
ing now prevails upon the subject. Shipwrecked property has 
come to be regarded as personal property ; and people who were 
once in the habit of taking it without shame or remorse, express 
openly the change that has taken place in their views. At the 
last two or thi-ee wrecks, scarcely any thing was stolen. 

During the winter season, it was customary to carry on a perpe- 
tual succession of merry-makings, called balls. Every marriage, 
was the occasion of two — the bride's friends being at the expense 
of the wedding-feast, and the best-man feeling himself called upon 
to give the hack-feast, which occurred a month or two after the 
wedding, and in which he was assisted by contributions from some 
of the other young men in the immediate neighbourhood. Be- 
sides these regular meetings, a great many more were added to fill 
up the void. Their moral effect was decidedly pernicious in va- 
rious ways ; but the kirk-session having interfered, little or no ex- 
cess of this kind takes place. 

By the same interference smuggling may now be said to be al- 
most, if not completely abohshed. 

In genefel habits, the people are, now at least, remarkably de- 
cent and sober. 

Education. — There is a school in the island supported by the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge.

PllESBYTERY OF NOETH ISLES, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JOHN ARMIT, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Westray obviously derives its name from the place 
it holds among the group of islands which lie to the north of the 
mainland of Orkney, called North Isles. It is situated in the 
north-west extremity of the country, and is the isle farthest west 
of the group. 

Extent. — Its superficial contents may amount to about 25 square 
miles. But, owing to its very irregular form, its numerous inlets, 
and projecting points, its precise dimensions cannot be ascertained 
but by an experienced surveyor. In the centre, and towards the 
eastern parts, the surface, with few exceptions, is low and flat ; 
but in the Rapness district, which forms the southern extremity, 
the ground on the north or north-east suddenly rises, which makes 
the shore in that quarter bold and lofty. The precipices there 
may be from 140 to 150 feet above the level of the sea. 

Topographical Appearances. — In the western extremity, there is 
a range of hills called Skea, Fitty, and Gallo, &amp;c. extending from 
south to north, to the distance of four miles and upwards. On Fitty, 
the highest of these, the trigonometrical surveyors, in the autumn 
of 1821, pitched their tents, and erected a temporary building, 
which remains nearly entire. The height of this hill, as then ascer- 
tained, was, to the best of my recollection, 652 feet above the level 
of the sea. The island on the western extremity, to the distance 
of more than four miles, is bounded by a shore of perpendicular 
rock, washed by the floods of the Atlantic. At its base, from which 
the sea never recedes, a few places only excepted, the depth is 
from eight to twenty fathoms. All along the lofty and rugged 
clilTs of this shore, an immense variety of sea fowl nestle and bring 
forth their young ; and numbers of the young and old birds, dur- 
ing the season of incubation, are taken by the inhabitants, both 
for food and their feathers, which they turn to good account.

Caverns. — Here, besides many curious excavations in the appa- 
rently solid rock, are to be seen subterraneous caverns, formed by 
the influx and reflux of the sea. In some of these, the water at 
high tide, and in tempestuous weather, is forced up through nar- 
row crevices of the rock to the distance of nearly a quarter of a 
mile landward, and bursting out at the surface from orifices of its 
own formation, springs up in the air to a surprizing height. 

Among the natural curiosities of the kind here to be met with, 
that called the Fort, evidently formed by the action of the sea, 
may not be deemed unworthy of notice. This remarkable place 
is situated in the northern boundary of that ]art of the island 
called Akerness, the property of Dr George Traill of Skail. 
Here, standing upon a lofty precipice, you see, underneath, an- 
immense caldron in perpetual agitation, from which a hideous 
and gorging noise ever and anon ascends, stunning the ear. You 
can walk nearly half-way round this mighty caldron, on high 
pillars of solid rock, arched over with the same solid material. 
One or two broken or separated columns, standing out furthest in 
the circle, from which the arches seem to have been swept away 
by the agitated element, heightens very much the grandeur of the 
scene, and gives to it an appearance truly picturesque. It is said 
to bear a strong resemblance to the Bailers of Buchan, on the 
Aberdeen coast. 

Baijs. — Besides numerous small creeks and inlets, which indent 
the shores of Westray, there are at least three or four which come 
under the description of bays, namely, the Bay of Tookquoy, Pi- 
crowall, Noop, and Rapness. The Bay of Tookquoy is broad 
and long, the distance between the headlands being between " 
four and five miles,— and long, penetrating about five miles into 
the bosom of the island, and gradually narrowing as it ascends, 
until it terminates in a shore of about one mile, or three-quarters 
of a mile broad. It is all over a sandy bottom, and is esteemed 
good anchoring ground; but the depth of water is too shallow for 
admitting, to the safe and proper station, vessels of a large size. 
It is, moreover, quite unsafe for a road-stead, as it lies expos- 
ed to gales from the south and south west, which cause a heavy 
sea over the whole bay to its inmost extremity. Only boats and 
craft of the smallest size can harbour safely here, and that, too, 
not until they get round at the head of the bay into a small basin, 
called by the inhabitants the Use, and defended from the sea beach 
by a bank of sand and stones. 



116 



ORKNEY. 



The Bay of Picrowall is quite of a different description. It is 
a remarkably fine basin, not above three-quarters of a mile broad 
at the entrance, but within wide and spacious, and nearly of a 
circular form. The bottom is sand, and excellent anchoring 
ground. The place being completely land-locked, any vessel 
moored in it is quite safe from every point of wind. But it is also 
too ebb for admitting vessels of a very large size. It may be 
deemed safe for all below 200 tons burden, but not above that 
size. 

The Bay of Noop, which faces the north, lies quite open and 
exposed to the fury of the Atlantic. With a gale blowing on shore, 
there is no safety for any vessel entering this bay ; and not a few 
have met their sad fate from a reef of rocks that lie quite across 
the bay, called the Bow of Rackwick. 

The Bay of Rapness, at the opposite extremity of the island, 
looks to the south, and is also an open bay, and therefore far from 
being a safe one, especially when the wind blows from any point 
touching the south or south-east. 

Headlands. — The principal headlands around this isle are the 
Noop-head, or the stack of Noop, on the north ; the flag of Inno- 
val on the west ; the Knowe of Skae on the south-west ; the Neve 
or Ness of Ackerness on the north-east ; the Point of Rapness on 
the south-east ; and Weatherness on the north-east, in the south- 
ern extremity of the island. In the Island of Papay, as there are 
no bays, there may be said to be no headlands of any note. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of Westray may be said to be 
much on a par with that of the other islands or the country at 
large. The medium heat will be found to amount to 45° ; the 
range of the thermometer, between the extremes of cold in winter 
and heat in summer, from 25° to 75°; and that of the barometer, 
three inches. 

Hydroffraphi/.— This island is bounded on the south by a frith 
rapid and broad, which separates it from the Island of Rousay and 
Eglishay by a distance of about eight miles. It is called Westray 
Frith, and has its strength of current from the Atlantic rolling into 
it from the west, and the German Ocean from the east. One 
part of it is peculiarly dangerous, as, at a certain time of the 
tide, the last of the ebb, contrary currents meet, and rolling up 

' There being originally a small pier erected at the head of the bay for boats the 
adjacent district' is called Wall,-hence Pier-o'-wall.

into tremendous breakers, render it a fearful gulf. Tlie tideway 
in this frith is reckoned the same with that of the Pentland, which, 
in spring-tides, runs at the rate of eight knots an hour. The depth 
of water is from 20 to 50 fathoms. On the west, this island is 
bounded by the Atlantic ; on the east, by a small portion of sea 
called a sound, which separates it from the Islands of Ferey and 
Eday ; and on the north and north-east, by another sound, sepa- 
rating it from that portion of the parish called Papa-Westray. 
The breadth of the proper ferry between the two islands may be 
reckoned from three to four miles. 

Papay-Westray. — This island forms another constituent part of 
the parochial charge. Whence it derives its name can only be 
matter of conjecture. It is of an oval form, and is exactly one 
mile broad, and about three and a half long, making its superficial 
contents three and a half square miles. In the middle, it rises in 
the form of a ridge, and gently declines on both sides, until it 
reaches the sea shore. In this shape, it runs nearly the whole 
length of the island. But, on the north extremity, it terminates 
in a headland, bold and lofty, called the Mull of Papay. At this 
headland, is a cave, deemed one of the greatest natural curiosities 
of the kind to be met with, perhaps, in all the country. Its inte- 
rior presents the appearance of an immense amphitheatre. The 
roof, upwards of 70 feet in height, is somewhat like a regular builb 
arch, — the beds of rock on every side rising the one above the 
other in the form of steps in a stair. The entrance is about 50 
feet in width, the breadth of the middle part about 60, and the 
most interior, 48. The floor has a little inclination outwards, but 
its surface is smooth and even to the foot of the traveller. It is 
well worth being seen by strangers visiting the island. It is called 
the How of Habrahelia. The southern extremity of this island is 
also somewhat elevated, but not nearly so much as that of its op- 
posite. In this quarter, there is a beautiful fresh-water lake, which 
extends nearly across the whole island, from the one side of it to 
the other ; and in one part of this lake, there is a kind of islet, and 
on that a ruin of a chapel, said to have been dedicated to a female 
saint of the name of Tredwall ; and such was the veneration enter- 
tained by the inhabitants for this ancient Saint, that it was with 
difficulty that the first Presbyterian minister of the parish could 
restram them, of a Sunday morning, from paying their devotions 
at this ruin, previous to their attendance on public worship in the 



118 



ORKNEY. 



reformed church. Wonders, in the way of cure of bodily disease, 
are said to have been wrought by this Saint, whose fame is now 
passed away, and name almost forgotten. 

A small glebe excepted, this island belongs exclusively to one 
proprietor, who, with his family, constantly resides in it; and, for 
a length of time, was the only residing heritor in the parish, and 
Justice of the Peace. A large proportion of this island is under 
culture, and enclosed with stone dikes. It is deemed among the 
most fertile of the islands in Orkney, both for pasture and arable 
land. Here clover, white and red, grows spontaneously, and of a 
rich quality. Here turnips are raised, of a more extraordinary size 
and weight than in warmer climes and apparently richer soils. 
The proprietor of Papa Westray has, within these eight or ten 
years, erected a garden, which promises to do very well as a kit- 
chen garden. Though currant and gooseberry have not succeeded 
to expectation, yet apple-trees supported on the wall have been 
wonderfully productive. 

Lakes. — In Westray there are four considerable lakes, viz. the 
Loch of Swartmill, in the Skailwick district; the Loch of Took- 
quay, in the south-west district ; and the Lochs of Saintear and 
Burness, in the north part of the parish. All these lakes are much 
ahont one size, measuring nearly half a mile in length to a quarter 
in breadth, — Burness excepted, which is not so large. The water 
in the lake of Swartmill is peculiarly dark and muddy, owing to 
its lying in the centre of a large peat-moss. There are no fishes 
in this lake, except common eel. The water in the lake of Took- 
quay is soft and clear, and answers well all the purposes of wash- 
ing and bleaching; but there are no fish in it, owing to its want 
of communication with the sea. The water in the lakes of Sain- 
tear and Burness are also transparent, and answer equally well the 
purposes above-mentioned. Burness, the upper lake, empties 

• It may not, perhaps, be out of place hereto mcniion, that Papa Westray is 
notable in history for being the scene of a cruel murder. Ronald, one of the Earls 
of Orkney, who is represented as an amiable and accomplished nobleman, and much 
beloved by his subjects, happening to come to this island direct from his palace at 
Kirkwall, attended by a small retinue, on a domestic concern, and, towards the ap- 
proach of the Christmas season, was, in the course of the night or late in the even- 
ins while sitting by the fireside indulging himself in mirth and conversation with 
his companions, suddenly surprised by Thorsin Earl of Caithness, and his armed fol- 
lowers investing the house and seUing fire to it ; and though, by superior strength .ind 
a-rilUv, he escaped the conflagration, yet his place of retreat was soon afterwards dis- 
covered by the barking of his own dog, whence he was taken, and, together with his 
companions, inhumanly butchered. His remains arc said to have been earned over 
to Westray, und interred amidst the lamentations of the people.

itself into Saintear, the lower, and that again in the Bay of Picro- 
wall. There are trout in both these lakes, and their season of 
spawning is in September and October. In these months, they 
are often caught in their way up the stream from the sea. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The strata of rock round this and 
the other island consist of limestone of the mixed and impure kind, 
and of the trap formation, twisted and scattered in all directions 
on the coast. There are also here two kinds of flagstone, distin- 
guished by the colour, blue and grey. The blue, like the rock of 
that colour, is hard, and accounted the most durable of the two. 
It is chiefly found by the sea shore, and considerably down from the 
high-water mark. The greystone flag is found in abundance, all 
over the Island of Westray, and of various thickness, from half an 
inch to three or four inches. Several quarries of it have, within 
these six or eight years, been opened for the purpose of making 
slate for houses. But the common people roof their houses with 
both kinds, just as they happen to be within their reach, and put 
them on in the same state in which they raise them, measuring 
sometimes from eight to ten feet square. This makes roofing 
here as easy as building. Pure limestone is also found in Westray. 
About thirty-eight years ago, a good deal was quarried on one 
estate, the estate of Cleat, and, being burnt, was found of good 
quality. 

In this island, organic remains are found imbedded in peat-moss, 
belonging both to the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In one 
large moss, great quantities of birch and birch-bark are annually 
dug up, in the operation of cutting peats ; and report says, that 
horns of deer have frequently been discovered in different parts of 
the moss. These fossils would indicate that forest wood, at some 
early period, existed in the island, and that deer had then been an 
inhabitant of the place. The wonder is, that no forest or growing 
wood of any extent is now to be seen either in this or in any other 
island in the country, though similar fossils abound. And it is a 
matter no less surprising, that every attempt to raise forest wood 
in the open fields, even in the most sheltered spots, has hitherto 
proved abortive. 

The only ore discovered in this island is manganese. The dark- 
brown colour on the scum of water springs, in many places, plainly 
shows its plentiful existence. 

1 he alluvial deposits which cover sandstone and limestone consist, 



120

for the most part, of sand, peat, gravel, clay, marl, and sometimes 
loam. Rolled blocks are not unfrequently found in valleys and 
meadows, where, in all probability, some mighty flood has swept 
them down from the higher grounds in their vicinity, to their pre- 
sent state of imbedment. No remains of animals, except of the 
marine kind, are found here in the alluvial deposits, and of these only 
cockle and mussel, and shell of the razor-fish, are seen and in great 
plenty imbedded in sandy soil, at considerable distance from and 
above the level of the sea. 

There is almost every species of soil in Westray. In the north 
part of the island, the soil most prevalent is sand ; but there are 
also to be seen in different parts of the same district, clay, gravel, 
and loam. The last -mentioned chiefly consists of small spots of 
ground, which have been long under culture, and improved too by 
the transportation of earths in a composite state. This, I think, will 
be found invariably the case where loam in any quarter of the 
island is seen. In the south west district, which comprehends 
Frebbay, Midbay, and Outo'-town, the soil in general is sandy, in 
some places gravelly, especially on the farm of Tookquoy ; and 
small spots of loam occur in most of the little farms in that neigh- 
bourhood. In the east and south-east districts, comprehending 
Cleat, Skailwick, and Rapness, the soil is alternate clay and peat- 
moss, with partial exceptions of gravel. The clay in all these 
quarters is, for the most part, of a very cold and wet nature, by 
reason of its proximity to the rock. Hitherto, we have taken no- 
tice of such soils only as are under culture, and it may be said 
with truth, that these in any quarter scarcely go beyond the skirts 
of the island, and do not constitute above one-tenth of its superfi- 
cial contents. The interior consists of an immense tract of common 
hill and dale lying in a state of nature, and separated everywhere 
from the cultivated lands by a turf dike, within which all the flocks 
and most of the bestial of the island, milk cows only excepted, 
are shut, during the summer and autumn, until the crops are 
removed from the ground and lodged in the barn-yards, when the 
styles are again laid open and the flocks left to range at pleasure. 
In many places of this extensive common, the soil is excellent, being 
in general of a rich whitish clay, and capable of being cultivated 
to advantage. But there are also large tracks, where the soil is ex- 
tremely poor and wet, upon which little improvement could be . 
made, to repay the trouble and expense of the cultivator. 



WESTRAV.

The soil in Papa-Westray is generally of a deep loam, where 
it has been long cultivated. In some parts, it is gravelly, in others 
clayey, and in some places a poor and insipid sand. 

Zoology. — There is not, to my knowledge, in this island, any 
animal that can properly be called rare, if we except a mouse 
of large size, nearly twice that of the common black mouse, 
and of light-brown colour. It is called by the inhabitants the 
vole- mouse. It is seldom or ever seen in a barn-yard or about 
houses. It commonly keeps by the sea shore, and burrows in the 
ground, especially in old feal dikes and among stones. There 
is a peculiarity in regard to this island, which may be mentioned, 
and which, 1 understand, holds in regard to some other islands in 
this county, namely, that no rat can live in it. It is asserted that, 
though this quadruped has often been imported by ships, it never 
survives for any length of time ; whereas, in the other and less fre- 
quented isle, it abounds, and is extremely destructive. There it 
was imported by a wrecked vessel. 

~ It is well known that the grey eagle, which now visits the island 
only occasionally, was wont to nestle in the lofty precipices of the 
shores on the north, but that the bird-catchers, year after year, seiz- 
ing upon their brood, drove them away to seek a safer retreat from the 
hand of the spoiler. Hence, they are seldom seen here, except when 
hovering about in quest of their prey, or on their passage to the 
other and more inaccessible parts of the country, such as the Hoy 
hills and Heads of Eday. 

It is only the smallest kind of sheep that thrives in Westray, 
and the same observation holds in regard to cows. The laro-er 
cows do not take well with the bare pastures of Westray. In a 
few years, they degenerate into little more than the common breed 
of the place. This is no doubt owing, in a great measure, to the 
backward state of agriculture; the want of green crops, or the re- 
quisite pasture for their feeding. In Papay, where the pastures 
are better, the larger breed of cattle and horses do pretty well. 

The haddock taken here is of the largest size, and very black 
on the back parts. Turbot is seldom got in our seas. The dog- 
fish is eagerly sought after, both for oil and family use. It is often 
got in great plenty towards the end of July, and during August 
and September, following the shoals of herrings which in these 
months frequent our shores. But among all the marine tribes, the 
most serviceable for food to the common people, and for light, from 



122

the oil they produce, is the fry of the coal-fish, which is taken here 
in immense quantities by the people, standing upon the rocks by 
the water's edge, with nets made in the form of a parachute or um- 
brella suspended from the top of a long pole, and thereby let down 
into the sea. 

Botany. — There is, at least, one rare plant of the floral kind 
that grows here. It is the bird's-eye primrose. It shoots up its 
gentle form in the most barren and naked spots. Indeed, it is 
never seen here in any other soil but the barren and the waste. 
The common primrose is also seen plentiful in its season, growing 
by the mountain side or by the brink of the streamlet. On our 
shores, the sea-pink abounds, and the cowslip covers as with a mantle 
of yellow the declivities of the elevated and rocky grounds, in al- 
most every quarter of the island. The queen-of-the-meadow, too, 
appears in our fens, and copiously impregnates the surrounding air 
with its delicious odour; and the daisy enamels our plains and pas- 
ture grounds as richly, perhaps, as in any other part of the world. 
In this brief catalogue, the craw-flower and blue violet also 
merit a place, being seen plentifully here, interspersed among nu- 
merous other indigenous plants. The following are a few that 
are deemed medical, viz. tussilago, marsh-mallow, poppy, scurvy- 
grass, foxglove, nightshade, with a great variety of the wort kind. 
II. — Civil History. 
Only one ancient author, Jo Ben, touches a little on this island. 
As his account is succinct and interesting, it may not, perhaps, be 
improper to give it a place here. " Of all the islands in Orkney, 
Westray is the most fertile. Here the better sort of people {ge- 
nera nobil'ium make their residence. Here is an excellent fort, 
meaning Noltland Castle, not yet finished. Here the peasants 
or country people, {agricolce, had of old a terrible battle with the 
Hybernians or Lewismen, which being routed, were all put to the 
sword. One individual, however, more gallant and robust, emi- 
nently distinguished himself, fighting after the rest of his compa- 
nions were destroyed. Having had botli his legs cut ofl" below the 
hams, he was seen in the affray, upon his stumps, bravely defend- 
ing himself." And tradition adds, that in this posture, with his 
back supported by a huge rock, to this day called the Highland- 
man's hammer, he did no little execution about him, until, over- 
powered by numbers, he was forced with violence against the rock 
and slain.

Memorable Occurrences. — The only occurrences of note or in- 
terest that have taken place in this and the other isle within the 
memorv of the oldest inhabitant, consist chiefly of dismal ship- 
wrecks. About nine or ten in number have happened within these 
thirty years, in which five of the crews perished ; and as many more 
perhaps during the same period, may have met their fate on the 
lofty precipices of our northern shore, under the cloud of night, and 
in the wintry tempest, when no eye witnessed the disasters. For 
the detached pieces of broken ships and their contents, occasion- 
ally scattered upon our shores, we cannot well account, but from 
this cause. 

Eminent Men. — As connected with this parish by birth or resi- 
dence in his early life, we have to mention one respectable charac- 
ter, namely, John Balfour, Esq. of Trenaby, late Member of Par- 
liament for the county of Orkney and Zetland, and who has in this 
island a property of considerable extent, from whence he takes his 
title. From liistory, it appears that Papa Westray was the residence 
of one Kolus, who married the daughter of Erlend, one of the 
Orkney Earls, and who had that island and other lands conferred 
upon him for merited services. 

Land-uivncrs. — The principal land-owners in the parish are, — 
the Right Honourable Lord Dundas; George Traill, Esq. of 
Holland ; John Balfour, Esq. of Trenaby ; James Stewart, Esq. 
of Brugh ; Ur Thomas Stewart Traill of Tirlet ; Dr George 
Traill of Skail ; Thomas Mackenzie, Esq. of Ground Water ; and 
Messrs Smith of Breckowali. 

Parochial Registers. — There are only two parochial registers 
kept in this parish, viz. a register of baptisms and another of mar- 
riages. The baptism register commences with the year 1733, and 
the marriage register reaches no farther back than the year 1784; 
and both have been brought down, with very few omissions, to the 
present time. 

Antiquilies. — The castle of Noltland, in this island, forms a ve- 
nerable monument of antiquity. It is both an ancient and noble 
structure, and bears every mark of an intended place of defence 
similar to many of the kind throughout the kingdom, erected in 
feudal times. Its walls are of great thickness, and it is surounded at 
all points with loop-holes, so that no enemy could approach without 
being exposed to a shower of deadly missiles. Its plan is rather that 
of an oblong than a square, and a court within. The entry to it still 



124 



ORKNEY. 



remaining is an arched portal of ornamented hewn work. Within 
the court, the entry to the main building is also of ornamented 
hewn work, and on the top part a coat of arms, which an ignorant 
rustic had the presumption to take down and destroy. A broad 
and elegant staircase presents itself as you enter, leading to the 
apartments above. But, before you reach the stair to ascend, a 
door on the right hand attracts your eye, conducting into an im- 
mense apartment on the ground flat, and nearly in the centre of 
the main building. Its dimensions are 62 feet long by 24 broad, 
and covered overhead by a strong stone arch 20 feet in height. 
An arch-built fire-place of great dimension, from 9 to 10 feet 
wide, is seen in one end, and a spring well at the other, nearly filled 
with stones. In one of the side walls is a narrow stone stair, lead- 
ing, by a flight of steep steps, up through the vaulted roof, evident- 
ly to serve as a private communication to the upper flat and its 
several divisions. The whole fabric demonstrates the original de- 
sign : the great hall below for the accommodation of military or 
fighting men, and the upper apartments for family accommodation. 
Had the intended structure been finished, in pursuance of the plan, 
it would have been not only a superb dwelling, but an impregnable 
fortress for the time of its erection. With the adjoining lands, 
which are of considerable extent, it belongs to John Balfour, Esq. 
of Trenaby ; and the coat of arms alluded to as removed, but which 
have been replaced anew, are those of the family, put up at first by 
one Gilbert, who in Queen Mary's time, and that of her unfortunate 
husband. Lord Darnley, was master of the royal household, after- 
wards Sheriff of Orkney and Governor of the castle at Kirkwall, 
and for his services had the above lands granted by his royal mas- 
ter. Hence the conjecture, that Noltland Castle had been built 
under the superintendence of that gentleman, to serve as a safe re- 
treat for the profligate Bothwell and Mary, after their disgraceful 
espousals, — but which had been left unfinished, uponthesad reverses 
which speedily overtook that unhappy pair. From whatever cause 
the work was laid aside, the symptoms of its speedy abandonment 
are visible to this day in the plentiful material for building lying 
in different spots around the walls of the edifice, ready prepared for 
the hands of the workmen. But that the above conjecture must 
be erroneous, is evident from the very poor reception which Both- 
well met with from that gentleman who refused him admittance 
into the castle of Kirkwall in the day of his adversity, when, o

escape merited punishment for a crime in which he certainly was 
a principal accomplice, he was forced to take shipping and fly to 
this remote part of the kingdom. Should this circumstance fail 
to convince some who may still feel disposed to give credence to 
the above opinion but too hastily adopted, what Ben, the early 
historian has said, who wrote forty years prior to these occur- 
rences, in the Scottish annals, should serve to set the question, in 
as far as relates to these two individuals, for ever at rest. His 
language is, " In Westray there is an excellent castle,. but not yet 
completed ;" so that, in his day, it was still an unfinished building. 
The most probable thing is, that it was the undertaking of some 
Scandinavian prince or nobleman, who, either from misfortune 
had not been able to finish the work, or who had died during its 
progress, and whose death had put a stop to its completion. We 
would merely say, that it is a pity the proprietors, in after times, 
should have ever allowed one stone of so venerable a fabric to be 
taken down, or any part of it to be demolished. 

As there are, in many parts of the country, obelisks or standing- 
stones, so is there in nearly the centre of this island, one square 
stone, standing not quite upright, but in an inclined posture to- 
wards the south, with the lower part deeply fixed in the ground. 
The part above ground is eleven feet in height. On what occa- 
sion, or for what purpose it was erected, tradition is almost silent. 

There is on the south-west side of this island, close by the sea 
shore,andaboutamilefrom the manse, a ruin of a chapel named Cross 
Kirk, originally a place of Roman Catholic worship, but latterly of 
Presbyterian, until, about sixty -five years ago, it became ruinous, and 
a new church was erected on the other side of the island, in a more 
convenient situation for the people, especially for those in the re- 
mote district of Rapness. However, the burying-ground at the 
old ruin still remains to be the cemetery of the east parish, there 
being nothing of that kind at the new and more recently erected 
place of worship. 

In the island of Papay, besides the chapel of St Tradewell al- 
ready mentioned, there is a ruin of a religious house, distant about 
a quarter of a mile from the one now in use. It is called the 
Kirk of IIow, and was also a \];ice of Rotnan Catholic worship. It 
is situated on a beautiful rising-ground, and the small cemetery, en- 
closed by a low stone dike, and covered over with a green sward, 
seems still to be considered as sacred ground, being allowed to re-

main in its natural state. The parish cemetery is not -here, but 
lies around the present place of worship. 

To the above antiquities is to be added the number of graves 
found in two extensive fields, one in the north and the other in the 
south side of Westray. It is ascertained that these graves were 
not known to the inhabitants, until high gales of wind carried away 
thesurface, — which, in both places being light and sandy, and easi- 
ly transported, exhibited to view the deposits which had been hid 
from the eye of many generations. Most of these graves are 
marked with a stone planted at the head and another at the foot 
of the place of interment : others, again, by flag- stones set on 
edge, arranged in the form of a chest for holding the body toge- 
ther, with such articles as the custom of the time, or the reigning 
superstition, deemed expedient to be interred along with it. When 
opened, they were found to contain not only human bones, but 
warlike implements, especially swords in a most decayed state, 
also articles of dress, with some of a domestic description. Were 
more of them opened, there is little doubt that discoveries might 
be made, highly interesting to the antiquarian. That the fields on 
which these graves are seen, were at some distant period the scene 
of hostile combat, cannot be doubted. The scattered state of the 
graves over these fields, which are of considerable extent, and 
their contents may be said to vouch for the truth of this opinion. 
But, besides these two fields, there is another place unnoticed by 
any author, which also bears evident marks of hostility. The 
place to which we allude, lies in a valley between two of the high- 
est hills, namely, Fitty and Gallow, far distant from any inhabited 
spot, and hard by what is called the Highlandman's hammer, al- 
ready alluded to, as the scene of bloody strife and of individual 
bravery. Here the slain seem to have been collected into two 
spots, the one separated from the other by a distance of 30 or 40 
yards, where the graves in each spot are seen huddled close toge- 
ther, and covered over with earth and stone. These spots are, to 
this day, known by the name of the bloody Tuacks, and it is not 
improbable that the one contains the ashes of the brave who 
fell in the common cause, and the other thoso of the vanquish- 
ed foe. 

Tumuli, or Pict's houses, as they are called, are numerous in 
this parish. They are seen in both islands, and chiefly on the sea 
shores. Some of them are large, and almost every one has 
an original or an appropriate name, transmitted, we nay believe.

from the period when that race of people were the possessors of 
the country. Similar to the ancient graves here scattered over 
the sandy plains, they are naturally a subject of curiosity. But I 
have never heard of any of them having been opened, but one 
which was opened at the request of two strangers, who visited the 
island many years ago. An urn, with one or two domestic utensils, 
— a drinking cup and quern, were discovered. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population of this parish, according to Dr Webster, was, 1290 



1793, according to the last Statistical Account, , 1629 

1811, . . . 162G 

1821, . . 1947 

1831, the number of males was 940, of females 1092, in all, 2032 



The decrease of population between 1793 and 1811 was owing 
to the number of young men impressed, or that volunteered into 
the service of the navy, during the late French revolutionary 
war. 

There are only two families of independent fortunes residing 
in this parish, namely, Mr Traill of Holland, and Mr Stewart of 
Brugh. 



The number of landed proprietors of the yearly value of L.50, is 8 

widows upwards of 50 years, . , J2 

unmarried men upwards of 50, , . 43 

unmarried women upwards of 45, . , 44 

families in the parish, . 425 

Average number of children in each family, . . 3 

The number of inhabited houses in the parish, . . 273 

uninhabited houses, . . 4 



The number of insane persons, 5; of dumb, 2; of deaf, 4; of 
blind, 3 ; and of fatuous description, 3. 

One custom in this parish, and common to Orkney at large, 
is that of allowing the servants four or five days liberty at Christ- 
mas, to enjoy themselves. Only the most necessary part of domes- 
tic work, with due attention to the bestial on the farm, is done on 
these days. The master of the house has, also, to keep up a well- 
furnished table for all his servants at that season. 

Another practice peculiar to this place is, that of observing punc- 
tually those days in the Roman calendar, on which eating and 
drmkmg are practised with more liberality than usual. 

Enjoying iu a moderate degree the necessary comforts of life, 
the people appear, in general, contented with their situation and 
circumstances ; and the little emigration that takes place may be 
deemed a proof of this. They arc naturally shrewd, and many of 
them of quick parts ; and in general, they are very desirous of 
knowledge.

lands in Westray may amount to about . 700 

In Papa, . . .350 

The undivided common in Westray may amount to . 11650 

Mr Traill every year adds to his cultivated property in Papa, 
by allowing his people to enclose what they can, of the waste or un- 
cultivated, and to enjoy what is thus gained rent free, for the 
space of seven years, upon payment of 6d. annually in the way of 
an acknowledgement ; after which period, he exacts a small rent. 

Garden-ground excepted, there are no lands under wood in the 
parish ; and no shrubbery or tree can rise higher than the wall that 
shelters it. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
may be reckoned at 10s. per acre. The rate of grazing an ox or 
cow during summer is 8s., and much about the same for a horse, 
— horses here being in general of the small size. There is no 
fixed rate for the grazing of a sheep, because every one's flock is 
grazed in one great common, in which all claim an equal right. 

Wool per stone costs 7s. 6d., and manufactured into cloth, sold 
at 2s. per yard. Mason-work in house building is L. 1, Is. per 
rood, and in dike building, 6d. per fathom of four feet high. 
Carpenter's work is Is. 6d. per day with meat. 

Live-Stock, §-c. — The breeds of sheep and cattle, in these two 
islands, are almost all of the small kind j the larger breeds of either 
not answering well. Both have been frequently tried j but, from want 
of proper pasture, and perhaps climate, they always degenerate. 
Owing also to the climate, the husbandry is confined almost entire- 
ly to the cultivation of oats and bear or big, the one after the 
other in constant rotation, with the alternation only of a small po- 
tato field in each farm. In some of the principal farms which 
have enclosures, turnip is beginning to have a place in the sys- 
tem ; but scarcely any artificial grass is raised, except on such 
farms as happen to be in the hands of proprietors. 

Very little has been done here towards the cultivation of waste 
lands, — though certainly much might be done in this way, — 
especially by draining. 

The great obstacle to improvement is either the want of leases 



WESTRAY, 



129 



of sufficient duration to encourage the occupiers of land, or want 
of capital to carry on improvements. Till of late years, no leases 
were given ; and now that they are, their duration, except in one 
or two cases, does not exceed eight or ten years. 

The farm-houses, in general, are miserable hovels, being origi- 
nally built by the poor tenants themselves, in which you may see 
cattle in one apartment, and the family or domestics in the other, 
mingled without any apparent distinction. The farmer is obliged 
to leave his tenement as he found it, so that in this way it is trans- 
mitted from one occupier to another, with little or no improve- 
ment. But, we add with pleasure, that the proprietors have 
begun to act upon a more liberal system, as they are giving better 
steadings and dwelling-houses to their tenants. 

Qiiarries. — There is, in this island and in the island of Papay, 
plenty of gray and flag-stone quarries. 

Fisheries. — The fisheries prosecuted in this island are, cod, her- 
ring, lobster, dog-fish, and the fry of the coal-fish. The aggre- 
gate proceeds of the herring, cod, and lobster fisheries, on an ave- 
rage of four or five years, may amount to L.950 or L.1000. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of the produce of the two 
islands, comprehending the different holms therewith connected, 
may be fairly estimated at about L. 2500. 

Manufactures. — Straw-plaiting was, for some years, among the 
females in this parish, a very general manufacture; but the very 
little encouragement now held out has nearly put a stop to this work. 
The same thing may be said of what was the principal manufacture 
and grand staple of the country at large, namely, kelp. The very 
low price it now brings will scarcely remunerate the cost of making 
and sending it to market. The people here, as in all the other 
parishes of Orkney, still persevere in making cloth from the wool 
of their sheep. What they use of it for body clothes, they com- 
monly dye. But woollen cloth is chiefly made for blankets. 

Navigation.— There are seven or eight small craft belonging to 
this island, each from 12 to 35 tons burden, employed in the cod- 
fishing during summer, that is, from the beginning of May to iho 
end of July, or so : after which, the hands employed betake tht-m- 
selves to the herring-fishery. There are about thirty large her- 
ring-boats belonging to this parish.

OllKNEY. 



The only semblance to a village in this parish is Picrowall, con- 
sisting of ten or twelve houses situated along the sea shore. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are very defective, by reason of there being 
as yet no stated or regular conveyance between this and the post- 
lown. There are as yet no highways in the parish ; and no har- 
bours, though one is much wanted at the bay of Tookquoy. 

Ecclesiastical State The two churches in Westray are tole- 
rably well situate for the different populations of the island, south 
and noi lh. The church in the south part of the parish was built 
about sixty-five years ago. When the north church was erected, 
is not known; but both of them are in tolerable repair. The 
church in Papay is also convenient enough for the population, — 
but only in an imperfect state of repair. 

Except Mr Balfour's annual donation to the poor of the north 
parish of Westray, there is no other benefaction on record. 

The church in the north parish of Westray may hold about 900 
persons; that in the east between 600 and 700. The church in 
Papay may accommodate about 220. There are no free sittings 
in any of the churches; and there is rather a want of accommodation 
upon a full attendance of the parishioners. 

The manse and offices were rebuilt in the summer of 1813, and 
completed early in the spring of 1814. The extent of the glebe 
may be computed at 23 or 30 Scotch acres, arable and unarable, 
and the rent, if let to a tenant, might be about L. 10 or L. 12 ; 
' but is of double that value to the possessor. The amount of sti- 
pend is L. 193, 16s., with allowance for communion elements. 
The teinds are exhausted, except a trifle on one small property, 
notjudicially valued whenthoseof otherpropertiesin theparish were. 

There are two Dissenting chapels, an Anabaptist and Secession. 
The Secession minister's stipend is L. 80, paid partly from seat 
rents, partly from Sabbath days' collection, especially by the 
members of his congregation. The Anabaptist minister has no 
fixed salary, except L. 20 from Mr Haldane, for itinerating as a 
missionary among the different islands. 

The number of persons in the two islands in attendance upon 
the Established church may amount to about 750. The number 
in attendance on the two Dissenting meetings, 600. 

Public worship is, upon the whole, well attended, both in the 
churches belonging to the Establishment, and in the Dissenting 
chapels. 



WE STRAY. 



131 



The average number of communicants belongino- to the Esta- 

cj do 

blishment is about 320 ; to the Secession, 200 ; the Anabaptist, 
120. 

The average annual amount of the three church collections in 
the jDarish is L. 13 Sterling. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is five; — one 
parochial school in Westray; one subscription, belonging to the 
Establishment ; two Secession schools ; and one Society school 
in the Island of Papa Westray. 

The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 28; that of the Society 
teacher's is L. 13; of the subscription schoolmaster's, L. 12. The 
Secession teacher's salary is from L. 3 to L. 5. 

There are no young people in this parish between six and fif- 
teen years of age who cannot read a little, and very few between 
seven and eight who cannot also write. The number of persons 
upwards of fifteen years of age, who can neither read nor write, 
is 52 ; but these are for the most part aged people. The people 
in general, are most anxious to give education to their children, 
but averse to be at much expense ; nor can the circumstances 
of by far the greater part of them afford it. 

The district of Rapness is at least five miles from the parochial 
school, and, for the greater part of the year, the road in that quar- 
ter is almost impassable, by reason of an immense tract of peat 
moss intervening. The south-west part of the island is distant 
from the parochial school three miles, and the road in winter very 
bad. The north extremity is also distant from it about three 
miles. A school is needed in the Rapness district, in Skailwick, 
and in the south-west district. 

Library — There is connected with this parish an itinerating 
library, on a small scale, instituted gratuitously by Thomas Bal- 
four, Esq., relative of Mr John Balfour of Trenaby, and oldest 
son of Captain William Balfour, R. N. Cliffdale. Its object is 
the benefit of the poorer classes of the people who are unable to 
purchase books, or get them from any other source. It is allowed 
to go the round of all the North Isles, and is scationary in each 
only for one year. 

Ponr and Parochial Funds.—TXie number of persons receiving 
parochial aid, amounts to about 70 annually, and the average sum 
allotted to each is about 2s. Gd. The rest of the fund goes to pay- 
ing precentor's and kirk officers' fees, and for coffins to the poor. 

There are no annual contributions in this parish to the poor, 



132 



ORKNEY. 



exclusive of the weekly church collections. But there is an an- 
nual donation or bequest to the poor of the North Parish of Wes- 
tray, amounting to L. 4, 12s., by the Balfours of Trenaby. It 
has been paid to that part of the parish, for about forty years. 

Fuel. — Peat is the only fuel used in the parish by the poorer 
classes. This island was wont to supply itself and the other island 
with this most necessary domestic comfort. But since the mosses 
in this island have failed, the inhabitants have been necessitated to 
go to the Island of Eday, where peat moss abounds. There they 
are supplied at considerable expense, the ground being, per square 
fathom, 2s. 6d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Besides the changes noticed in the course of this article, an im- 
portant change, since the date of the old Account, has'taken place 
in the new and improved method of fishing cod, that is, by using 
small sloops of twenty-five to thirty tons burden, instead of open 
boats or yauls, which could not venture far to sea. This great 
improvement has given rise to thirty large herring-boats, belong- 
ing to the parish, averaging, in value, L. 80- each, including all ne- 
cessary outfit, viz. nets and cordage. Hence a degree of wealth 
in the parish, which formerly did not exist. 

In order to a better system of agriculture in this parish, the 
first thing to be recommended, is the abolition of the practice of 
allowing sheep, for nearly eight months in the year, to go at large 
over the whole island. Another essential thing would be, the di- 
vision of an immense track of common, which constitutes by far the 
largest proportion of the island of Westray. In this respect, 
Westray is behind most of the other islands in Orknej', which, in 
general, have made a division of their respective commonties, or, 
what is much the same thing, have enforced winter-herding. And 
the last requisite we shall mention, is the granting of leases for 
such a length of time, as might encourage the expenditure of ca- 
pital on improvements.

L— Topography and Natural History. 
Situation, §"c. — Lady parish is situate on the east side of the 
Island of Sanday, and is about nine miles long by one mile broad. 
It is bounded on the north, east, and south, by the sea; and on the 
west, partly by Cross parish, and partly by the sea, forming the 
large bay and harbour of Otterswick. The parish takes its name 
from the church called Lady Kirk, or the Kirk of our Lady, evi- 
dently dedicated in Catholic times to the Virgin Mary. It con- 
sists of several districts or subdivisions, as follows : Elsness, Over- 
bister, Coligarth, Tressness, Neivark, Selibister, Northwall. 
Each of these districts was probably, in ancient times, a separate 
distinct parish.

On the estate of Elsness, there is an oyce or inlet of the sea, 
from which the water wholly retreats, during the ebb tide— con- 
taining 100 Scotch acres. The entry is narrow, but of suffi- 
cient depth of water for sloops of any size ; and the whole oyce 
might easily be converted into a harbour. At present, there is a 
rock or bar near the mouth, which, with ordinary floods, renders

the passage impossible, excepting to very small vessels. But were 
liiis obstruction removed, which could be done without any great 
expense of time or labour, the passage would be easy to sloops of 
any size. There is a similar oyce or inlet of the sea at Tressness, 
of at least twice the extent, and without any obstruction in the 
entry. Perhaps, both of these places might form proper stations 
for herring or cod fisheries. But should this notion be er- 
roneous, there can be no doubt that the extensive bay of Otters- 
wick, common to Lady parish and Burness, would afford stations 
along its winding shores for one or more fishing-villages. This 
bay may be divided into the outward and inner harbours, the 
former eight, the other two miles in length. As, in storms from 
the north-east, it is difficult for vessels to ride in safetv in the outer 
harbour, on account of the violence of the sea, they usually in 
this case retreat to the inner harbour, where no gale, however 
strong, can do them any injury. In some parts of the outward 
harbour, the water is 12 fathoms deep, with a stiff clay bottom; in 
other parts, from 5 to 10 fathoms deep, bottom clay, with a cover- 
ing of several feet of sand. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — There are in the parish several of those buildings 
called Picts' houses. 

I have received the following communicalion from Dr Wood, an 
ingenious medical gentleman, who practised several years in San- 
day : — " The island of Sanday is first mentioned in the Orkneyinga 
Saga, during the reign of Earl Paul, who having, in 1136, defeat- 
ed Earl Ronald in a sea-fight, and having captured most of his 
fleet, returned in triumph to Orkney, and invited to a splendid 
banquet all the aristrocracy of the islands, with their friends. 
He then resolved that a watch-tower should be erected in Fair 
Isle, on which a fire should be kindled, should an army be observ- 
ed approaching from Shetland. There was another watch-tower 
erected in Ronaldsay, and similar ones in most of the other is- 
land.s, so that the signal might be seen over the whole. He ap- 
pointed Thorstcin, the son of ITavard, the son of Gunna, to take 
chartre of Ronaldsay; and Magnus, his brother, o fake charge of 
Sanday." 

" Sanday is again mentioned in ihc year 1 107, after Earl Ro- 
nald had returned to the islands. ' Ronald sends ambassadors to 
the Bishop, begging he would intercede for him. He afterwards 

' Vido Orkneyinga SiS", PI'- 16- '87. . 



LADY.

adds to the embassy Thorstein, the son of Raiignu, and Thor- 
stein, the son of Havard of Sanday.' Again,— Sanday is men- 
tioned as a fit place for a conference to be held between Swein, 
son of Asleif, and Anakol, a follower of Earl Erlend. ' When 
Gauti met Swein, he sent a messenger to Anakol, and requested 
Swein to betake himself to Sanday, with his followers, that they 
mifht hold a conference there. He therefore promised, he should 
go thither.' 

« In the year 1157, Earl Erlend and Swein left Shetland for 
Orkney; but, ' encountering a severe storm, and a variety of 
whirlpools, in Dennis roost, it happened that Swein was separated 
from the Earl, and driven to Fair Isle, with twelve of their ships. 
He concluded that the Earl had perished. From 1 hence he sail- 
ed south to Sanday, where he found Erlend with three ships. 
There was great joy on both sides at this meeting.' | 

" In the year 1 158, Swein fled to Sanday to escape the wrath of 
Earl Haralld, whose house in Gairsay he had forcibly entered, with 
intent to murder him; but Haralld then happened to be in a neigh- 
bouring island, hunting hares. When Haralld was informed, by his 
domestics, of this outrage of Swein, he immediately set out in search 
of him to Enhallow, whither Swein had fled ; however, he contrived 
to conceal his vessel in a large cavern in one of the cliffs of that 
island, and so eluded the search of his pursuers, although they were 
at one time so close to the mouth of the cavern, that he overheard 
their conversation." " He leaves his ship in the cavern, and seizes 
a merchant vessel which belonged to the monks, sails to Sanday, 
and there lands and sets fire to the ship. Upon landing, he rejjairs 
to a farm called Volunes, occupied by a man named Bardr; he was 
a kinsman of Swein; having privately begged of him to come out, 
he made known to him his wish to remain there."§ 

" The remains of the Scandinavian buildings of Sanday are nu- 
.merous in Lady parish ; but it is to be regretted, that all of them 
are now in so ruinous a state, as to render an accurate description of 
them impossible. They mostly abound on the nesses or headlands, 
which situations appear to have been first settled, both from their 
proximity to the sea, from which the inhabitants would procure 
their chief sustenance, when agriculture was unknown or little at- 
tended to, and from such situations being most easily defended 
against the attacks of neighbouring tribes.

" Toftsness, the nortbermost point of Sanday, appears to liave 
been a well-peopled settlement, from the numerous ruins which are 
still to be seen. The greater part of the Ness has been enclosed 
with a chain of forts, which were connected by a stone-wall. 
Within this wall, the ground has been covered with buildings of 
various sizes : — circles of stones set on edge, with, frequently, 
an upright central stone, are still to be seen, —and numerous graves 
lined with flat stones, and also surrounded by small circles of stones. 
Several of these graves have been opened ; some of them contain 
human bones, — others contain only ashes; in many of them, deers' 
horns have been found. One of the forts, on the wall, was ex- 
amined a few years ago. It measured, inside, 16 feet in length, 
and 6 in width ; the walls were 8 feet in height, and from 4 to 5 
feet in thickness; at the height of 6 feet from the foundation, the 
stones, inside, were laid so as the upper stone overlapped the one 
immediately beneath, thus contracting the opening above, which 
was roofed over with large flat stones. All the stones in this build- 
ing were large flat stones from the beach. The wall was regular 
and firmly built. There was no clay nor cement of any kind. A 
deer's horn was found in this building, and several fragments of 
bones. 

" From the quantity of sand blown over these remains, it is al- 
most, indeed altogether, impossible to give any accurate descrip- 
tion of them ; but, from their extent, it is evident that many 
people, and a great deal of time, must have been occupied in their 
erection. Some account of this place appeared in an Edinburgh 
newspaper, several years ago. 

" Tressness, on the east-side of the island, contains several tu- 
muli, which have never been examined. They are situated close 
by the sea, at convenient landing-places. The largest of them, 
called Wassa, is built of large flat stones ; it is about 15 feet in 
height, and upwards of 180 feet in circumference at the base. 

" Elsness appears to have been an extensive settlement. On 
the northern extremity of this cape, there is a burgh or fort called 
Augmund's Howe. It is now in ruins, and overgrown with grass 
and weeds. It is situated close by the beach, and has been sur- 
rounded to landward, by a circle of upright stones. On the east 
side, where the ground is low, there is a semicircular terrace, the 
outer edge of which is formed also by stones set upright. The 
hoitrht of the fort is about 18 feet. 

" From Augmund's Howe, there may be traced the remains of

a wall thickly studded with circular forts, running to the north- 
west across the Ness, and thus enclosing fully a third of the whole 
Ness. These small forts on the wall are, now, only ruinous cairns. 
They are all, or most of them, placed on the inside of the wall. 
The few on the outside seem to have been so placed for security's 
sake, as they are uniformly on gentle risings. The wall does not 
run in a straight line, but has several curves, to avoid low spots of 
ground which are, in winter, covered with water. The enclosed 
space is literally covered with tumuli and heaps of ruins. None 
of those now remaining are of great size. The largest have been 
levelled and ploughed over. The peaceful husbandman has now 
succeeded the restless and daring sea-king. The sickle and the 
scythe have succeeded the sword and the battle-axe. 

" Most of these tumuli which have been opened, contained 
burned stones, ashes, bones, and sea shells. In some of them, were 
graves lined with flat stones. An axe, said to be of bone, was 
found some years ago, but was destroyed by the ignorant people 
who found it. An arrow or spear-head was also found at the same 
time. It is of stone, three inches long, and lozenge-shaped. The 
point is broken off'. Many such articles might have been disco- 
vered, had proper persons superintended the removal of the tumuli. 

" A number of the smaller heaps within the- walls are formed 
of what the country people call cramp, and are said by them to 
have been used as places of sacrifice. For whatever purpose they 
were used, it is plain they must have been the sites of strong and 
long-continued fires. The cramp resembles the refuse from a 
glass-blower's furnace. It is of a reddish colour, and contains por- 
tions of a coarse glass, stones, and sometimes fragments of earthen 
vessels. The sea-weed, with which the shores abound, must have 
furnished the fuel. This, by long heat, would be reduced to kelp, 
and, by a continuance of the heat, and the admixture of sand and 
stones, would, in process of time, prod uce the cramp. 

" There is another burgh, a little to the westward of Augmund's 
Howe, also built close by the beach, but considerably less than the 
former. On the north-west side, there is a circular enclosure of 
about an acre, which has, at one time, been under cultivation, and 
has given the name of Quoyness to this building. 

" Throughout the Ness, there are several circles of stones, with, 
for the most part, a central stone also set on edge. None of these 
stones are more than two feet above ground, and perhaps about as 
much under. AH the circles measured nearly the same in cir-

cumference, about 36 feet. None of them are to be found above 
a few yards from the beach. The finest specimens are at a creek, 
which forms an excellent harbour called Kettletoft. On each 
side of this creek, are two circles ; the first two are close by the 
beach, the other two at the upper extremity of the creek. The 
only tumuli outside the line of forts are three or four, at a short 
distance from Augmund's Howe. All the rest, burghs, tumuli, 
and circles, are on the west side, that is, within the fortified wall. 

" The ruins here differ in several particulars from those at 
Toftsness. At that place, the forts or watch-towers are of an ob- 
long shape ; here, they appear to have been circular. At Tofts- 
ness I never heard of any cramp having been seen ; here, it abounds. 
Fewer graves have appeared here than at Toftsness, and none 
within circles of stones. Notwithstanding these circumstances, 
they both appear to be the work of the same race of people. The 
apparent differences, for they are not real, may be easily account- 
ed for. May not the taste or style of one architect builder, at 
least, have differed from that of another in the formation of the 
watch-towers Or may not the forts or watch-towers at Elsness 
have originally been of the same shape with those of Toftsness, 
and may they not have attained their present circular form, from 
being reduced to ruins and overgrown with grass  The sand 
blowing off Toftsness, which has buried most of the ruins there, 
has preserved the watch-towers in a comparatively perfect state. 
The absence of cramp at Toftsness may be accounted for by the 
different kind of fuel which may have been used. In that place, 
there is a thin layer of turf or peat under the sand, which, no doubt, 
would be preferred to the sea-weed ; and we are informed, that 
one of the Earls, Torf Einar, taught the inhabitants the use of turf 
or peat some centuries before Christianity was introduced into 
Orkney. Vide Torfasus and Ork. Saga. There is no peat at 
Elsness, nor, indeed, in any part of Sanday, but Toftsness. 

" None of the circles at Elsness have been opened, or graves 
might have been found in them, as well as within the circles at 
Toftsness. 

" At Newark, in the centre of Lady parish, there were lately 
discovered under land, which had been cultivated for generations, 
the ruins of a large circular building. It was built of large flat 
stones, admirably fitted together, but without cement of any kind. 
The wall curved slightly inwards, from the foundation to the height 
of 8 or 9 feet, and then outward, as it rose in height, for about 4

feet, where it had the appearance of having been thrown down. 
It was about 12 feet wide at the bottom inside. The wall was 
fully 6 feet in thickness, and, in some parts, a double wall was per- 
ceptible, with an intermediate space of about 3 feet. This double 
wall went all round ; but, from the great quantity of rubbish, it 
was found impossible to trace it. There was no appearance of 
door nor window, unless in the south and east sides, where two 
small openings communicated with the space between the walls. In 
one of tliose openings, was found a bone pin, three inches long, 
smoothly polished ; in the other opening, part of a very coarsely- 
formed comb, made of the bone of the whale. 

" The interior of the building was fitted up with rubbish, stones, 
and gravel, and above all was a deep layer of red ashes, thickly 
interspersed with the bones of cattle, sheep, swine, rabbits, and 
geese, and with limpets and other shell-fish. The whole of the 
building is now under ground, and must have been so for many 
generations. It has been built on a rising ground. The sea, on 
either side of it, may be distant about half a mile. From the top 
of it, which, in its original state, would have been a few feet higher 
than the ground which now covers it, both sides of the island would 
have been seen, — a great portion of what lies to the southward and 
westward, and all that part of the island lying north-east of it. 
This tower, in all probability, belonged to that description of 
them of which the Castle of Mousa in Shetland is said to be the 
most perfect specimen. See Ivanhoe, last edition. Vol. ii. p. 335, 
where, in a note, the learned author gives a very interesting ac- 
count of such towers, and particularly of that of Mousa. 

" About a quarter of a mile northward of the Newark tower is 
a tumulus, which has never been opened. It is covered with a 
rich swaid. It is called by the country people " Ivar's Knowe." 
The ground slopes gently from this knowe to the beach, which 
forms the south-east side of the Bay of Ottersvvick or Gdenswick. 
Along this beach are the remains of two or three more buildings. 
About a mile south-west of these, in the centre of a marsh on the 
farm of Cleatt, is another small tumulus ; and about half a mile 
farther south, on the same farm, is another, situated on the edge 
of marshy ground, which is covered by the sea in spring-tides. A 
considerable extent of barren uncultivated ground stretches to the 
south-west, along the banks of Otterswick, and is terminated by 
the farm of Coligarth. Many small circular mounds may be seem 
on this moor, all, or most of which, contain masses of cramp.

" The Ness of Coligarth or Colinoss extends a good way across 
the Bay of Otterswick to the north-west. In this ness there is a 
very large artificial mound, which, if examined, would be found 
to contain the largest burgh in Lady Parish, if not in Sanday. 
The surface of this mound has been broken in several places for 
the purpose of taking away large stones, which are found in every 
part of it. About three years ago, while removing some of these 
stones, a spear head was found ; it is of iron, seven inches long, 
rounded and pointed at one extremity, and flattened at the other. 

" On the south-west side of Coligarth, another barren moor 
commences, and runs along the banks of Otterswick almost to the 
bottom of the bay, where this parish is joined by Burness. Along 
this moor, too, are scattered a number of small circular heaps ; 
but the largest and most remarkable are in the immediate vicinity 
of Coligarth. They consist of three pretty large tumuli, partly 
surrounded by a square enclosure. There is also within the enclo- 
sure an excellent spring well, which has been carefully built about 
with large stones. The remains of a wall may be traced, running 
in a southerly direction from these tumuli, a good way across the 
moor. These three tumuli are called by the country people Myr- 
tis's Knowes, or the Knowes of Myrtis. 

" The principal Scandinavian antiquities in this parish have 
now been enumerated. Many more, no doubt, are buried under 
ground, some of which may yet be discovered. What we now 
have, is sufficient proof of the rude state of society in these islands 
at one period. 

" Religious buildings were fornoerly pretty numerous in this 
parish ; in general, they were only small chapels ; at least we 
have not now the remains of any large religious edifice. Nothing 
now is left of them, save their foundations overgrown with 
grass and weeds. They are all surrounded by, or in the imme- 
diate vicinity of, good land, and generally near a well or fresh 
water loch. None of them are to be found on the moor or hill 
ground. Several of them have been built close by the ruins of 
other buildings ; such situations may have been chosen, from the 
ready access to stones which they afforded; or the devout men en- 
gaged in the conversion of the Orcadian heathens, to show their 
utter abhorrence of the ancient superstition, may have erected 
their chapels on the very ruins of the temples of Odin. 

" None of these chapels have exceeded twelve feet in length, 
and from eight to ten feet in breadth. Foundations of them may 



LADY. 



141 



be seen at Nortbwall, Newark, Cleatt, Tressness, Overbister, 
Coliness, and other places. It is Hkely they would all have been 
dedicated to some saint or other holy person ; but tradition, which 
is very scanty here, has only preserved the names of three of them ; 
Peter Kirk, or St Peter's Chapel, which has been of rather lar- 
ger dimensions than the others, on the banks of Otterswick, near 
Newark ; the Chapel of Arstas, close by the round tower lately 
discovered at Newark ; and St Magdalen's Chapel in Overbister. 

" Founts, or holy water basins, have been found at several of 
them. These founts are all formed alike, from rounded pieces 
of red sandstone, roughly hollowed out on one side. 

" On examining the small portions left of the walls of the cha- 
pels, they are found to be cemented with clay ; some of them 
have been plastered inside with lime. 

" In the spring of 1826, while removing some large stones 
which impeded the operations of the plough, near the foundations 
of a chapel in Overbister, a long subterraneous passage was dis- 
covered, which terminated in a circular cavity. The bottom and 
sides of this passage were formed of the solid rock, as well as the 
cavity at its extremity, which has likely been intended for a well ; 
the top or roof of the passage was carefully covered with flagstones, 
and above was the natural soil. The entrance to the passage was 
by two steps cut in the rock. The length of the passage was 
19| feet; height, 3 feet; width, about 1 foot 9 inches; diameter 
of the well, 3 feet ; from the roof to the bottom of the well, 3 feet 
6 inches. Several small pieces of decayed oak were found in the 
passage. The well contained a very little water and mud. 

" At a few feet distance from the entrance to this passage, a 
causeway was discovered, formed of rounded stones from the 
beach, and laid with great care, the stones in the centre being 
set upright, those on each side sloping towards the centre. The 
causeway was 4 feet broad ; it commenced at the chapel, and run 
in a straight line to the westward for 30 or 40 yards ; it then 
turned to the south, and was traced in that direction for about 60 
yards. It most probably, at one time, led to a small loch, which 
is about 200 yards distant from the site of the chapel. 

" Tradition gives no name to this chapel. The small hillock 
was known to the old people by the name of the Carse of Hcnzie 
Hunt. St Magdalen's Chapel stood about 200 yards north of 
this. 

" No graves are to be found near any of these chapels, unless 



142 



ORKNEY. 



at one built on the rnins of the burgh of Coliness. This chapel 
has been built at the south-east corner of the ruii« of the burgh. 
Its length was 12 feet ; breadth little more than 8. A stone, 2 
feet long, 10 inches in thickness, and as many in breadth, was 
found in this chapel. One side of this stone was covered with small 
circular holes, about one inch in depth, and straight lines were 
cut from one hole to another; the holes were not arranged in any 
regular order. The use of this stone must remain unknown. 

" At a very short distance from the west end of the chapel, a 
number of graves were discovered ; all were lined with flagstones. 
None of them were above two feet under the surface of the 
ground. They were close together in rows, forming the divisions 
between the graves. Many of tlie skeletons were pretty entire ; 
they were lying with their heads to the west. All were on their 
right sides, with the knees a good deal bent. One of the sculls 
had a long wound on the upper part of it. A gold ring, rather 
larger than a finger ring, was found in one of the graves; but the 
boy who found it, broke it, to ascertain its composition. I saw 
only a small fragment of it. On the flag which formed the south 
or right side of one of these graves, there was a very rude attempt 
at carving a cross Calvary. The upright portion was 13 inches 
long ; the cross beam, 9 inches. More curious discoveries might 
have been made here ; but the search was discontinued."

Cmtoms. — Formerly, it was customary for companies of men, 
on new year's morning, to go to the houses of the rich, and awake 
the family, by singing the New Year's song, in full chorus. When 
the song was concluded, the family entertained the musicians 
with ale and bread, and gave them a smoked goose or a piece of 
beef 

Laiif/uagc. — Our language is rather a dialect of the English than 
the Scotch, and the pronunciation also resembles the English. 
But several words are evidently borrowed from the French, for 
example, vilipend, to abuse by opprobrious or railing language. 
This word is frequently used by Brantonic, who wrote in the age 
of Mary Queen of Scots. The country people term the blai.-k

window fly, matilot, ibe French term for a sailor. The term has 
been suggested by this insect creeping or climbing on glass. 

There are various customs evidently superstitious. Thus, the 
people never marry, but when the moon is growing. Were they 
to do so, when it is waning, the marriage bed would be barren. 
They observe the same rule in killing cows, firmly believing that, 
if they did otherwise, the beef would dwindle in the pot. Thursday 
is the day generally fixed for marriage. In going to sea, they 
turn the boat in the direction of the sun's course. To move in the 
opposite way, would be considered improper, if not dangerous. 
When the first lamb seen for the season is white, the omen is for- 
tunate : and the appearance of a black lamb is unlucky. 

The people, in general, are peaceful, temperate, and industrious. 
The poverty of the cottage is cheered by the domestic charities 
and social affections. In the faithful discharge of their duties, as 
husbands, wives, parents, and children, they are unrivalled. To 
the indigent poor, the sick, the lame, the blind, the infirm, they 
cheerfully give what they can spare. Any individual deficient in 
those respects, would be viewed by his neighbour with hatred and 
contempt : consequently, cases of this nature seldom or never occur. 

IV. — Industuv, 

JgricuUnre. — Though there is almost every variety of soil in 
Lady Parish, what generally prevails is sand, or a mixture of 
earth and sand. The soil is productive, and, in favoured seasons, 
considerable quantities of bear and meal are exported. The 
precise quantity cannot be ascertained, because no farmer will 
give explicit information on this subject, from an apprehen- 
sion that, if the truth were fully known, his rent might be 
raised. But an approximation to the truth may be obtained. 
Several years ago I procured from the custom-house an account 
of the quantities of bear, meal, and malt exported coastwise from 
Orkney for a course of years. This account it may not be im- 
proper here to insert.

It is supposed that about two-thirds of the parish are in arable 
land and good natural pasture, and the other third waste and co- 
vered with heath. 

For at least thirty or forty years past, there has been an incli- 
nation in every farmer who had the opportunity, to reclaim land 
from the waste. Before that period, it was considered as imprac- 
ticable; but the example of a few individuals who had the forti- 
tude to depart from established custom, showed that the innova- 
tion not only was safe, but might even be attempted with advan- 
tage. In all probability, after a few years, there will be no waste 
ground in the parish ; and in the course of time, every acre may 
be brought into a state of garden cultivation. 

There are two modes of reclaiming the waste, — First, about or 
after Martinmas, when the ground is socked with rain, it is plough- 
ed and exposed to the frosts of winter, and the heat of the suc- 
ceeding summer. In spring of the next year, ware, dung, or other 
manure is laid on ; the ground is broken and made smooth with 
the harrow and roller; and in tlie last place, cross-ploughed and 
sown with oats. In the second plan, or lazy bed, the ground, after 
being spread with horse or cow dung, is planted with potatoes. 
The lazy bed now mentioned is perhaps the most effectual way of 
briiio-ing waste ground to a state of cultivation ; for in the season 
succeeding the crop of potatoes, oats or bear may be sown with 
or without manure, as suits the convenience of the farmer. 

I shall now describe the rural policy of the parish ; and the de- 
scription will, in general, apply 1o the whole island of Sanday, or 

4 



LADY.

more properly speaking, to the portion of Orkney termed the Nortli 
Isles. One very large farm, the people are divided into three classes ; 
first, house-servants dwelling with the farmer, and having a monicd 
fee; sectnul, boll-men; third, cottagers or cottars. Both the second 
and third classes are scattered through the farm, in situations most 
convenient for the farmer. In winter and spring, the boll-man has a 
monthly allowance of grain and oatmeal, both for wages and food. 
He is a daily servant till the end of May, when he works in the 
kelp at a stipulated price per ton, the profit depending on his own 
industry. Both cottagers and boll-men shear in harvest, and arc 
paid by a portion of land termed a harvest fee. Through the 
whole parish, each cottager and boll-man can maintain, summer and 
winter, a milking cow and a horse ; and tliere are instances of se- 
veral keeping four cows and two horses. 

The one- stilted plough was in generivl use, in my recollection ; 
and, though a fertile subject of ridicule, was the ancient plough of 
Rome, Egypt, and even England. Though it did the work with 
sufficient accuracy, still it was an inconvenient instrument, as it 
required four horses and a driver. The rise of fees, and the horse- 
tax in tlie Revolutionary war with France, rendered economy an 
object of imperious necessity with every farmer ; and, therefore, 
the improved mode of ploughing with two horses, without a driver, 
was introduced in an early period of the war, and soon became ge- 
neral. 

Sea-ware or weed, from its abundance, and the ease with which 
it can be carried lo the land, is used as manure, in preference to 
compost dung hills. No manure acts more speedily on the soil, 
or gives a cleaner and more abundant crop. It has been said, that 
compost dung-hills would give bear of a superior quality, — but if 
the quantity was not also greater, we would gain no compensation 
for the additional expense of time and labour. Our crops of bear 
are as clean as those in any county of Scotland. The wild mustard 
prevails in our oats, for it seems to be a hardy weed, which has 
hitherto set the skill of the farmer at defiance, and abounds in 
every county of Scotland and England, and in every province of 
France. Careful cleaning of the seed, and extending the drill 
husbandry to bear and oats, might probably extirpate this and other 
noxious weeds. 

1 he drill husbandry in potatoes and turnips, prevails in every 
soil adapted to these useful vegetables. The manure generally 
used for both, is horse or cow dung; hut in light sandy soils, rot-

ten ware has been found an excellent manure for turnip. Since 
the general use of turnip, our black-cattle liave improved in qua- 
lity ; and farmers have also discovered, that it is better to have an 
under than an over stock, formerly the great error in this country. 

The sea-ware was usually carried to the land in baskets, term- 
ed creels on the backs of horses, to the great injury of the health 
of this noble animal. These creels, pressing on the ribs of the 
horse, created internal and incurable disorders. It was liable also 
to objection in point of econom', as a great number of small 
horses was required ; but the general use of carls has nearly abo- 
lished the practice. 

Until very lately the longest period for which even large farms were 
let, was nineteen years; but the greater number of farmers in our pa- 
rish are, at this moment, tenants at will. While this narrow policy 
prevails, there can be no lasting substantial improvement. For 
what individual, removed a single step from insanity, will risk his 
capital on improvements from which he has no certainty of profit  
It is pleasing, however, to reflect that one heritor has lately granted 
several leases of nineteen years ; and there is every reason to hope, 
that the practice will become general. 

What is termed steelbow once existed ; but the practice is fast 
wearing out. It may be thus described : A certain value in horses, 
ploughs, carts, harrows, and other farming utensils is delivered to 
the tenant, who must, at the end of his lease, leave on the farm the 
same value. The dwelling-houses, cottages, and parks, are also 
valued by men mutually chosen ; — the tenant is paid for all 
ameliorations, and is charged for all deteriorations. The term 
of entry is Martinmas, and the whole crop, fodder, seed, and ser- 
vant's bolls excepted, is the property of the outgoing tenant. 
The incoming tenant is bound, not only to thrash the whole crop, 
with the exceptions already stated, to the outgoing tenant, but 
also to dry his oats, and convert them into meal. This practice, 
founded on wisdom and justice, is beneficial to both parties. 
Were it abolished, the incoming tenant could not lay down the 
crop for want of fodder, nor could the outgoing tenant convert his 
crop into meal, without barn, kiln, and other conveniences in the 
possession of the incoming tenant. 

It has been supposed that steelbow is pernicious, by inducing 
men of no capital to take farms. In an early period, steelbow 
might have been equal, or nearly equal to the value of stocking 
required for the farm. But money has been so much deprcciat- 



LADY. 



147 



ed, that the value of house and farmuig utensils required in steel- 
bow, is so mere a trifle in comparison of the value of the whole 
stocking actually necessary, that it can afford no temptation to 
any farmer to compete. The practice, therefore, does neither good 
nor harm. 

On the mode of farming I have only further to add, that it is 
the practice of our f;irmers to begin sowing as early as possible on 
sandy soils. Accordingly, oat-seed commences about the 1st of 
February, old style, that is the 12th of February, new style. Oats 
are therefore sown from the 1st of February to the middle or end 
of March, — as our fivrmers are of opinion that it cannot be sown too 
early, especially in dry and sandy soils. In such soils, they gene- 
rally sow in furrow, or, in other words, sow first, and plough down 
the seed, to protect it from sand blowing. 

The gross rent of Lady parish is as follows : 

Rent in bear, 1338 meils, at 6s. 8d. per meil, . L.446 0 0 

Do. in oatmeal, 28 bolls, at 16s. per boll, . 22 8 0 

Do. in kelp, 130 tons, at L. 4 per ton, . 520 0 0 

Do. paid in cash, . . 1214 12 0 

L.2203 0 0 

Harvest generally begins in the first or second week of Sep- 
tember, and ends about the middle of October, when the crop is 
carried to the barn-yard. We do not put the sheaves in stooks, 
as in the south country, but in miniature stacks, termed here 
skrews. When the sheaves are large, a threave is generally put 
in each skrew ; but if they are of a moderate size, a threave and a 
half. Our farmers are of opinion that this mode is preferable to 
stocking, by protecting the grain from rain, and exposing it to the 
wind, so that it is thoroughly dried, before it is conveyed to the 
corn-yard. 

The number of carts in Lady parish is 118. It is a remarkable 
fact, that, at the date of the old Statistical Account of Sanday, the 
whole island contained only 36 carts ; there are now, therefore, 
82 more carts in Lady parish than were, at that period, in all the 
three parishes which composed our island. 

The number of ploughs is 83. For each of these, three horses 
may be allowed, two to till, and one to harrow, — making a total of 
249, — an amount rather under, than above the truth. 

V. — Pahochial Economy. 
This parish, as already mentioned, contains a church termed 
Lady Kirk. Some years ago, it was rebuilt, and is now large, and 



148 



ORKNEY. 



in every respect well adapted for the accommodation of a nume- 
rous congregation. 

Poor. — The parish funds for the poor proceed from the follow- 
ing sources : Is, L.5, a yearly donation, from Mr Traill of Hob- 
bister ; 2dly, Marriage money, 2s. 6d. for each marriage, of which 
lOd. goes to the clerk and officer, and Is. 8d. to the poor; dly. 
Is. 2d. for the use of the mortcloth in burying ; Athly and lastly, 
the collections on Sabbath. On an average of three years, the 
total amount does not exceed L.9, 17s. yearly. From this deduct 
fees to the clerk and officer, and there remains for distribution, L.7, 
3s. The precentor, or reader, as he is generally termed, receives 
and has received, from time immemorial, nine meils of bear on the 
bear pundlar, four settings oatmeal, and twelve merks of butter. 

Education. — There is in Sellibister, one of the districts of this 
parish, a school under the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge; salary, L. 15 Sterling; reading, writing, arithmetic, 
and book-keeping are taught. There is also a parochial school 
common to all the three parishes of Sanday, with a commodious 
house, and a salary of L. 46, 10s. The school-house is large, 
well-aired, and well-lighted. Besides reading, writing, arith- 
metic, and book-keeping, the elements of mathematics, land- 
measuring, and Latin, are taught. The situation has hitherto been 
occupied by able and well-qualified teachers. 

Light-house. — A light-house was erected on the Start, in the 
year 1802, and lighted in 1806. It is 100 feet in height, and re- 
volves once in two minutes. 

Since its erection, very few vessels have been either wrecked 
or stranded on our coast. Formerly, three or four vessels were 
yearly wrecked. Our coast is so low, that mariners are entangled, 
before aware of the danger. But the same circumstance which 
is fatal to the vessel, proves, in general, the safety of the crew.

PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. THOMAS BLYTH, MINISTER. 



• Parish of Birsay. 
1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, x. — The modern name of this parish is 
Birsay, a corruption of the ancient one, which, according to Tor- 
fseus the historian, was somewhat different. Birsay, as united 
with the parish of Harray, was anciently known by the name of 
the Province of Bergisherad, which, according to Icelandic his- 
torians, means a hunting territory, — Birgis or Birsay signifying 
hunting, and Harad, now Harray, a territory. If these deriva- 
tions be just, it is probable that these parishes of old composed a 
district principally, if not solely, destined to the amusements 
of hunting ; for before Kirkwall was a place of any great note, 
the Princes, perhaps, and certainly the Nobles and Bishops, had 
their chief residence in Birsay. The western extremity of the 
united parishes is a flat, fertile, and rather narrow track of land, 
which opens gradually towards the east, till it swells at length 
to an immense amphitheatre, bounded by the hills of Sandwick, 
Orphir, and Rendal. Several beautiful lakes, of different sizes, 
are dispersed throughout this district, and some pretty large rivu- 
lets intersect it in various directions ; the former of these con- 
tain plenty of swans, ducks, and other water-fowl ; and both of 
them abound in those kinds of fish that generally frequent fresh 
water. 

The greatest length of the parish, from south-west to north- 
east, IS about 8 miles; its greatest breadth about 5 miles; and it 
is computed to contain about 38 square miles. The form of the 
parish is irregular. It is bounded, on the west and north sides by 
the sea, and part of the parish of Evie ; and on the south and 
east, by the parishes of Sandwick and Harray.

ORKNEY. 



Topographical Appearances and Soil. — This parish presents 
great inequalities of soil, as well as of surface. The coast, which, 
in geni-al, is bold and rocky, extends about eight miles, and, in 
some places, rises with a gradual ascent from the sea, about a mile 
eastward. The soil is very various. The lands forming what 
is called the barony of Birsay, are considered by far the richest 
and most fertile in the parish, or perhaps in Orkney ; the soil, 
in general, is a mixture of clay and sand, and yields most luxuriant 
crops of oats and barley, " without intermission." 

As to the quality of the ground in other parts of the parish, it 
is, in general, a kind of deep black loam, which also yields an abun- 
dant return of oats and barley; it is well adapted to turnips and 
potatoes. 

Hydrogra'pliy. — There are six lakes in the parish. The most 
of them are about a mile in breadth, and upwards of four miles in 
circumference. The streams or rivulets that run through the pa- 
rish are inconsiderable, though they impel the machinery of four 
meal-mills. There is no harbour for vessels on the coast. The 
only harbours we have, are for small boats. The two principal ones 
are called Skibbagoe and Castragoe. 

Mineralogy. — The minerals of the parish consist of limestone, 
and a sort of claystone, which is in great request in the parish, and is 
generally used for pavement and for covering farm and other houses. 
There is, also, great abundance of other kinds of building stones; 
freestone excepted. Marble and alabaster are said to have been 
discovered in the parish. 

II. — Civil History. 

From the want of well authenticated information, little can be 
said of the ancient state of Birsay. Indeed, there are no traces 
of its history prior to the period when it was in the possession of the 
Earls of Orkney ; and even subsequent to that time, little that can 
be depended upon, is known. There can be no doubt, however, of 
the fact, that the first seat of the Earls and Bishops of Orkney was 
in Birsay. The ancient inhabitants of the parish were Norwegians •. 
and the names of many of the places are evidently of Norwegian 
extraction. 

Land'Oioners. — The number of land-owners in the parish, resi- 
dent and non-resident, is 39 ; of whom 10 are non-resident. The 
principal land-owner is the Earl of Zetland, who is also patron of 
the parish. 

Parochial Itcgisters.—The parochial registers go so far back as 



BIRSAY AND IIAURAY. 



151 



1631. They consist of five volumes, and are, upon the whole, in 
tolerably good condition. The register of baptisms and marriages 
commenced under the ministry of the Rev. James Aitken in 1645, 
and has been continued to the present time. 

Antiquities. — Among the antiquities connected with Birsay, 
may be noticed the remains of the sacerdotal palace. It stands 
on a beautiful green near the sea. It was the residence of the 
Earls and Bishops of Orkney. The time of its erection is not 
known with certainty. It is said, that additions have been made to 
it at different times, by the Sinclairs, commonly styled Princes and 
Counts of Orkney. Robert Stuart, natural brother to Queen Mary, 
as also his son, Patrick, made great additions ; but now, only the 
bare walls remain. It was built upon the model of Holyrood- 
house. Above the gate was the ftimous inscription, " Dominus 
Robertus Stuartus, filius Jacobi quinti Rex Scotorum, hoc opus 
instruxit," and above the coat of arms, was the following motto, — 
" Sic fuit, est, et erit." The stone, it is said, is still in the posses- 
sion of the Earl of Morton, to whom the lands were sold : by him 
they were sold to Sir Lawrence Dundas, whose grandson, now 
Earl of Zetland, possesses the greatest part of the parish. 

About half a mile to the westward of the palace is the borough of 
Birsay. It is a small portion of pretty high land, which the force of 
the ocean has broken off from the mainland, and formed into a 
separate island, to which there is access by land only at low water. 
From the remains of a wall yet to be seen on the land-side, and 
the marks of some huts there is reason to believe, that, as the 
name imports, the spot must have formed a rock fortification. At 
a later period, a chapel was erected here, of which only one win- 
dow and part of the wall remain. It is said to have been dedicat- 
ed to St Peter. 

Pict's Houses are also very frequent in the parish, some of which 
confer names on places. Single erect monumental stones are, 
also, not unfrequent in the parish. 

III. — Population. 

In the year 1755, according to Dr Webster's report, as quoted 
in the Old Statistical Account, the number of souls, in Birsay and 
Harray, was 2200 souls; in 1831, it was upwards of 2387, — the 
number belonging to Birsay being 1652, and to Harray, 735. 
Amount in 1841, 1634. 

The great body of the people arc of industrious habits ; and al- 
though, from the pressure of the times, they have not had it in 



152 



ORKNEY. 



their power to enjoy those comforts which ihey did a few years 
ago, it would be injustice to conceal that they have borne their 
privations willi more than ordinary patience ; and that, upon the 
whole, they are contented and happy with their situation and cir- 
cumstances. There are a considerable number of very intelligent 
individuals amongst them, and not a few who are distinguished both 
for religious principle and good moral practice. 

IV. — Industry. 

As there has never been any survey taken of this parish, the 
number of acres, arable and unarable, cannot be accurately stated. 
The extent of the parish, including hills and lochs, is computed 
to be about 38 square miles. 

Rent of Land. — Farm rents are generally paid in money. They 
average about 8s. or 9s. an acre. The usual rent for grazing an 
ox or cow for the season is L.l, and for a ewe or full-grown sheep, 
about 7d. yearly. The valued rent is L.270 1, I .'is. 5d. Scots money. 

Improvements. — It is generally admitted, that there is no place 
in Orkney, where greater improvements in agriculture could be 
made than in Birsay, because the soil in general is good, and, 
above all, in the barony of Birsay, where there is great abundance 
of sea- weed at command for manure. If there was a new system 
of husbandry introduced, and if leases were granted for a reason- 
able time, instead of from year to year, as at present, the tenant 
might have some encouragement to cultivate the soil. The farms 
at present, with the exception of two or three, are very small, con- 
sisting of eight or nine acres each, which pay of yearly rent about 
L.8 or L.9 Sterlinor. 

Manufactures. — At no distant period, the manufacture of linen 
cloth was carried on, to a considerable extent, in this parish; but 
now, there are few, if any, looms employed in this way. The 
chief employment of the females, now, is straw-plaiting; which 
branch of manufacture was introduced into the parish, in the year 
1807, by Mr Robert Berwick, Kirkwall. It still forms the chief 
employment of the females, though their wages are much lower 
than they were, when it was first introduced. The number of 
hands employed in this department may average about 450. Se- 
veral of the manufacturers have agencies in Stromness and Kirk- 
wall. The quantity manufactured is considerable ; but the annual 
value of it cannot be ascertained. It is sent, when plaited, to 
Manchester or Liverpool. The earnings of straw-pkiiters may 
amount, at present, to about Is. 6d. or 2s. weekly.

Fisheries. — The great bulk of the people in this parish are 
fishermen. A considerable number of the young men go yearly 
to Davis's Straits, and also to Hudson's Bay. There are upwards 
of twenty fishing-boats belonging to the parish ; and, when wea- 
ther permits, they are in general very successful. The kinds of 
fish of which they get the greatest numbers, are cod and dog-fish. 
Lobsters in their season are, also, got in great numbers, and her- 
rings. There are five herring-boats belonging to the parish, 
which generally go, at the fishing season, to Stronsay or Wick ; 
and in general they are very successful. Birsay would form an 
excellent herring-fishing station, provided there was a proper har- 
bour. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are few or no made roads in the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is very commodious, 
though far from being a comfortable one, was erected in 1064, 
and was enlarged in the year 1760. It is at present in a state of 
bad repair. Neither is it well situated for the convenience of the 
great bulk of the population. The seats of the church are di- 
vided among the heritors according to their valuations. The manse 
was built in the year 1802, and is in tolerably good repair. The 
glebe consists of between 18 to 20 acres of arable and unarable 
ground, and its yearly rent may be stated at L.9, or thereby. The 
stipend amounts to L.210, exclusive of L.8, 6s. 8d." for furnishing 
communion elements. The average number of persons that at- 
tend church, when the weather is good, may be from 400 to 500. 
The number of male heads of families on communion roll, 131. 

There is only one Dissenting chapel in the parish, — belonging to 
the Antiburghers or Original Seceders. The stipend of the mi- 
nister does not exceed L.70 yearly, if so much. He depends for 
his living upon the seat rents, and the Sabbath days' collection 
made at the church doors. 

Education. — There are six schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial, and five others, which are conducted by persons two of 
them females entirely on their own adventure. The parochial 
teacher's salary is L.'26. He also holds the office of session-clerk 
and precentor, the fees of which amount to L.l, 15s. yearly. He 
has a tolerable dwelling-house and school-room. He has also a 
garden, but not of the extent required by law; neither is the defi- 
ciency supplied by an adequate allowance in money. All the other 
teachers are supported by school-fees alone, with 'the exception of

the Assembly's teacher, who enjoys a salary of L.25, besides a free 
house, school-house, garden, and fuel, together with a piece of 
ground for a cow. The total nunnber of children attending the 
above-mentioned schools varies from 180 to 200. 

Library. — A library, which consists of about 1 70 volumes, 
chiefly on religious and moral subjects, was formed in 1841. The 
readers are pretty numerous. 

There are few or none under fifteen years of age in this parish, 
who cannot read or write. But endowments for the teachers are 
much required. 

Poor and Parochial Funds, — The average number of persons 
who receive aid from the parish funds, is about 40, and the ave- 
rage allowance to each is Is. quarterly. In some cases, however, 
more or less is given, as the members of kirk-session think fit. The 
fund is made up of collections at the church door, mortcloth dues, 
and dues for proclamation of banns, — amounting in all to about 
L.7 or L.8 in the year. 

Inns. — There are no less than six public-houses in the parish. 

Pairs. — There are three annual fairs in the parish for the sale 
of cattle and horses. 

Fuel. — Peats are in great abundance in this parish, and of the 
very best quality, and all that they cost the inhabitants, is the dig- 
ging, drying, and driving home. 

Parish of Harray. 

Extent, c. — The greatest length of the parish is about 6 miles : 
its greatest breadth about 4 miles ; and it is computed to con- 
tain about 22 square miles. The form is irregular. It is bound- 
ed on the west and south-west, by part of the parish of Sandwick ; 
on the east, by Stenness and a small part of Firth ; and on the 
north and north-east by the parish of Kendall and Firth. 

Topographical Appearances, S,-c. — In general, Harray is flat and 
rather swampy, and intersected by a great number of burns, which, 
from want of bridges, interrupt the progress of the traveller. The 
soil varies very much, — being, in some places, tolerably fertile, and 
in others, very unproductive. Nevertheless, the crops in general 
are good. 

Hydrography. — There are two lakes in the parish, one of which 
is of considerable size, and contains an immense number of most 
excellent trout. It is frequented by great numbers of wild ducks, 
and other aquatic birds.

Land-oivners. — The land-owners of this parish are very nume- 
rous. There are about 100 resident and non-resident. Among 
the number of the non-resident, is the Earl of Zetland, who is 
patron of the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest records of the kirk-session 
of this parish go so far back as the year 1796. The earliest re- 
gister of baptisms is dated in the year 1784, and has been continu- 
ed to the present time.

The extent of the parish, including hills and lochs, is comput- 
ed to be about twenty-two square miles. The valued rent, ac- 
cording to the valuation taken in the year 1826 and 1827, is 
L. 346, 5s. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The present church of Harray was built 
in 1836. It is a neat, plain building, and seated for 450 per- 
sons. It cost L. 215 or thereby. Its situation is fully as con- 
venient for the parishioners as any that could have been select- 
ed. The seats are divided among the heritors, according to their 
valuations. There are no pews as yet set apart for the poor ; 
but in the meantime they are accommodated by their friends and 
neighbours. 

There is no manse in the parish, the minister's place of resi- 
dence being at Birsay. The glebe is about 18 acres in extent. 
Its present rent is about L. 9. 

There is only one Dissenting chapel in the parish, — belonging 
to the Independents. The stipend of the minister must be very 
small, if it depends entirely upon the seat rents and Sabbath days' 
collection. 

The number usually attending the Established Church, when 
the weather is good, is not less than 350. The number of male 
heads of families on the communion roll, is 112. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, viz. the So- 
ciety School, and another, which is conducted by a person entirely 
at his own adventure. The total number of children attending 
these schools may average about 130. There are none in the 
parish under fifteen years of age, who cannot read or write.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average numberpf personswho 
receive aid from tlie parochial funds is 12, and the averao-e allow- 
ance to each is 2s. 6d. per quarter. In some cases, hovi'ever, more 
or less is given, as the kirk-session may think fit. The fund is 
made up of collections at the church door, mort-cloth dues, and 
marriage dues, — amounting in all to about L. 5 yearly. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held annually in this parish, at 
which only cattle and horses are sold.

PRESBYTERY OF NORTH ISLES, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JOHN SIMPSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Extent, 8,c. — Stronsay is situated in the south- 
eastern parts of the North Isles of Orkney, having the German 
Ocean on its east side ; the Stronsay Frith, by which it is sepa- 
rated from Shapinshay, on its west side ; and Sanday Sound, se- 
parating it from the Island of Sanday, on the north side. Its ex- 
treme length is 7 British miles, and its extreme breadth 
But, as it is of an irregular shape, being greatly indented with 
bays, it contains, including its adjacent holms, only 14 square 
miles, or 8960 imperial acres. 

Name. — Dr Barry, in his History of Orkney, gives the follow- 
ing account of the etymology of Stronsay. " From an inspection 
of the map, it appears to be not only curiously indented, but al- 
most cut into three distinct islands, which were formerly so many 
separate parishes, and this intersection has probably given rise to 
the name conferred on it by the ancients of the Isle of Strands or 
Stronsay." More probably, the name is derived from the word 
Strom, which signifies a current. And this epithet is not inappli- 
cable, as Stronsay is swept on all sides by peculiarly rapid tides. 

• Urinvn up by the llev. Uavid Rintoiil, Missionary Minister in Kday. 



STRONSAY AND EDAY. 157 

Topograpliy. — Stronsay has eight principal headlands and promon- 
tories. These are the following: Towards themDrth, Linksness and 
Huipness ; towards the east, Griceness, Odness, and Burrowhead ; 
and towards the south, Lambhead, Torness, and Rousholmhead. 
The principal bays are. Mill Bay, on the east side ; Holland's Bay, 
on the south side ; and Evigan Bay, on the west side. All the 
headlands are low, except Burrowhead and Rousholmhead, which 
consist of bold and elevated rocks. The three bays terminate in 
a sandy beach. There are two excellent harbours, each having 
two entrances, namely, Linga Sound, on the west side, protected 
by the small island of Lingholm ; and Papa Sound, on the north- 
east side, protected by the small island of Papa Stronsay. 

Stronsay is of moderate elevation. There is, however, a ridge, 
running almost continuous from north to south, considerably higher 
than the rest. 

There are several small. islands connected with Stronsay. These 
are Papa Stronsay and Lingholm, already mentioned, as also the 
two holms of Huip, near the shore, on the north side, and the 
Holm of Auskerry, about three miles to the south. 

The three last holms contain only pasture grounds, and are 
uninhabited. Lingholm has one family dwelling on it, and a 
small portion of it is under cultivation. Papa Stronsay, by far 
the most valuable of these small islands, is about one mile in 
length, and one-half mile in breadth. It contains several families, 
and is very pleasant and fertile. 

Eday lies about the middle of the North Isles of Orkney, to- 
wards the north-west from Stronsay, and separated from it by the 
frith called Eday Sound, about four miles broad. It is about 
seven and a-lialf miles in length and three in breadth, having an 
area, including Pharey and the holms, of about eleven square 
miles. 

The name of this island has been derived, by some writers, from 
the eddies produced by the rapid tides that wash its shores. 
Others, however, have derived it from the word heath, and in 
proof of this, they refer to records some centuries back, in which 
Eday is written Etha. If this latter derivation be correct, it may 
be observed, that the name is strikingly descriptive of the cha- 
racter of the island, as heath covers the greater proportion of 
its surface. 

The principal headlands in Eday arc, Vcncs.s towards the 
south-east; Warness, towards the south-west ; Fersness, towards 



158 



OUKNEY. 



the west ; and Redhead, a high promontory of red granite, to- 
wards the north. •There are several bays about Eday, in which 
vessels can anchor occasionally ; and there are two excellent har- 
bours, viz. that of Fersness, on tlie west, and Calf Sound, on the 
north, each of which has two entrances. 

Eday, though like Stronsay, of moderate elevation, yet it has 
a ridge considerably higher than Stronsay, running with the 
exception of a short interruption towards the middle, from north 
to south. 

There are six small islands connected with Eday. These are, 
the Island of Pharey, with its holms, which protect the harbour 
of Fersness, on the west, and contains sixty-five inhabitants ; the 
small red holm, between this island and the Redhead ; the Calf 
of Eday, which protects the harbour of Calf Sound ; and the two 
green holms off the south-west of Eday. All these, with the 
exception of Pharey, are pasture holms, and uninhabited. 

There are several fresh-water lakes in each of these parishes, 
particularly one in Stronsay, nearly a circle, and somewhat less 
than a mile in diameter. 

Mineralogy, — The soil, in general, rests upon a bed of grey 
slate, dipping towards the west at an angle of about thirty degrees 
with the horizon. There is some sandstone about the north-west 
shore of Stronsay. And in various parts of Eday, particularly to- 
wards the north-western part of the island, this stone abounds. 
The stone from this quarry has been much used for building in 
Kirkwall ; and it may be observed, that some of it was sent a few 
years ago for this purpose to London. In these parishes, the soil 
which predominates, is that of clay, sand, gravel, loam, and moss, 
the last particularly in the parish of Eday. In Stronsay, marl 
has been found, which has been used as manure. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The principal proprietors of these parishes arc, 
Mr Balfour of Trenaby ; Mr Urquhart of Elsness ; Mr Heddio 
of Melsetter ; Mr M'Kenzie of Groundwater; Mr Stewart of 
Brugh ; and Mr Laing of Papdale, brother and representative of 
the late Malcolm Laing, Esq. Advocate, the author of the His- 
tory of Scotland. It may be noticed, that a large part of that 
work is understood to have been written, while the author was re- 
siding in the mansion-house of Carrick, in Eday. Carrick was 
erected into a burgh of barony during the reign of Charles the 
First. And it may be remarked, that the House of Carrick was 



STRONSAY AND EDAY.

the residence of Mr Fea of Clestran, who, about a century ago, 
dexterously captured the pirate Govv, who had come with his ves- 
sel to Calf Sound, and was thus the means of arresting him in 
his wicked career, and giving him over to merited punishment. 
The late Sir Walter Scott, as is generally believed, has taken 
this incident as the groundwork of his novel, entitled the Pirate. 

Antiquities. — There are several monuments of antiquity in these 
parishes. Towards the north end of Eday, there is a standing- 
stone in the midst of a lonely heath. It is about 17 feet in 
height; and although a remarkable object, tradition says nothing 
as to its origin. There are various remains of ancient places of 
worship, and likewise places for interment, in these islands. Of 
the latter there is one deserving of more particular notice, at 
Housebay, in the south end of Stronsay. In this burying-ground, 
a number of bodies have been laid along side of each other, and 
separated from the rest by stones placed on edge at the foot and 
head, and on each side. It does not appear that wooden coffins 
had been used ; but, by way of substitute, a rude stone box had 
been formed for the head of the corpse, composed of stones set on 
edge, and one laid over them as a lid covering the face. The rest 
of the body, it seems, had been covered only with the bare earth. 

There are various Picts' houses of considerable size in the 
southern parts of Stronsay. One of these is of greater magnitude 
than the rest, situated on the neck of land connecting Lambhead 
with Stronsay. It contains several apartments, which, by their 
smallness and rude construction, show that the inhabitants must 
have made little progress in the arts of civilized life. 

Below this ruin, towards the west, there are the remains of an 
ancient pier, formed, as is supposed by some, for the protection of 
vessels. It is now in such a state of dilapidation, that it is impos- 
sible to say when it was made. Its appearance is that of a mound 
of stones, extending to about 90 feet in breadth, and running into 
the sea in a westerly direction about 800 feet, and then turning 
southward in a direction towards the extreme point of Lambhead 
about the same length,— leaving, however, at the extremity, a suf- 
ficiently capacious entrance for vessels. And although, at this 
part, there is no breakwater, it may have been protected in another 
way, as a strong current runs continually past the head and across 
the entrance, so that the waves would be broken in passing it. 
The lower division of the pier if such it was has suO'ered most 
from the violence of the waves, as it is now covered over at high 



160

tide, while the greater part of the upper division still appears above 
water. 

It may be observed, that this ancient pier has been scarcely, if 
at all, mentioned by former writers. And tradition says nothing 
as to which of the ancient proprietors of these islands it is to be 
referred to. 

III. — Population. 

There are no records of an early date, from which to give any 
account of the ancient population of these parishes. In 1781, 
they contained 1494; and in 1831, 1827 souls. This increase 
is to be ascribed to the more extended cultivation of ground for- 
merly lying in a state of nature, and also to the improvements in 
the fishing of lobsters, cod, and herrings. 

The people in these parishes enjoy a competent share of the 
comforts of life. Besides meal and potatoes, most of them have 
some butcher-meat during the year. But their principal animal 
food is fish, such as cod, especially herrings in their season, as well 
as cooths and sillocks during two- thirds of the year. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — As there is no proper survey of these parishes, it 
is impossible to specify the relative proportions of ground in dif- 
ferent conditions. As to Stronsay, however, it is supposed that 
about one-third is arable, one-third green pasture attached to the 
various farms, and one-third heath, — most of which is undivided 
common. And as to Eday, about 1000 acres are arable, 720 green 
pasture, and the remainder is heath, but not undivided common. 

The kinds of grain commonly raised are bear or bigg, and grey 
or black oats, the latter having awns as well as the bear. Pota- 
toes also are everywhere cultivated. Various farmers have raised 
white oats and pease, as well as turnips and artificial grasses. 
And Mr Laing of Papdale, in addition to these, has raised bar- 
ley with much success. 

From time immemorial, the ordinary mode of cultivation in 
Orkney has been to sow bear and grey oats, alternately in the same 
field. And the ground is enabled to hold out with this severe 
rotation, by the great profusion of sea-weed which is everywhere 
found, and assists in manuring for the bear,— the ground seldom 
receivino' any manure for the oats. 

A great propbrtion of the horses, cattle, and sheep, are of the 
small Orkney breed. But many excellent horses and cattle have 
been introduced from Angus-shire, and other southern counties; 



STRONSAY AND EDAY. 



161 



and Mr Laing of Papdale has shown, on a considerable scale, that 
Cheviot and Merino sheep, or a mixtnre of them, thrive very well. 

The crops of grey oats and bigg, in favourable seasons, have a 
considerable appearance on the ground ; and, considering the mode 
of culture, are fully as good particularly the bigg as can be ex- 
pected. It may be observed, however, that here it is not easy to 
specify the returns from a particular field, as the farmers are not 
in the practice of computing the produce by the acre. When the 
ground is in good condition, the crop of white oats and barley 
has an admirable appearance; and, when the filling season is 
favourable, approaches to the excellency of the same crops in the 
southern parts of Scotland. The soil and climate are extremely 
well adapted for the cult\ire of turnips, potatoes, and artificial 
grasses, such as clover and rye-grass ; and very fine crops, parti- 
cularly of the two first, have been raised in this quarter. 

Of the great farms, renting from L. 100 to L. 200 per annum, 
the leases are generally of nineteen years duration. Of farms of 
more moderate extent, the leases are in some cases shorter. And 
most of the smallest farms were let from year to year, until about 
two years ago, when the proprietor of Eday let these for the same 
period of nineteen years as the rest of his farms. It may be ob- 
served, as a peculiarity of these islands, that the farms are let for 
a gross rent, and not by the acre. Most of the farms have a con- 
siderable proportion of pasture ground attached to the arable. 

Several of the dwelling-houses on the farms are rather unsuit- 
able ; but not a few of them, particularly on the largest farms, are 
comfortable dwellings, consisting of more stories than one. The 
same distinction applies to the offices on the farms, the smaller 
ones being rather mean, while the largest farms have oflSces spa- 
cious and substantial. They are, in general, erected by the pro- 
prietors; and for the most part are in a state of progressive im- 
provement. Three of the farmers in these parishes have thrash- 
ing-machines turned by horses Most of the ground is unenclos- 
ed ; but on several of the largest farms, some substantial stone dikes 
have, within the last few years, been erected. 

The greatest part of Eday being covered with moss, presents a 
great obstacle to agricultural improvement, though it is to be allow- 
ed that this is of the greatest benefit to the inhabitantB for fuel, 
and contributes a considerable share of the s.ime unportmt 
commodity to the inhabitants of several of the adjacent islands.

and some cargoes have been sent to the Frith of Forth within the 
last two years. Ahnost the whole of Stronsay, with the excep- 
tion of about a square mile covered with moss, in the south-western 
partof the island, might, without much difficulty, be brought under 
cultivation. Some parts are fertile and other parts are poor, 
but it is all free of stones and wet, while there are no places so 
steep as to prevent the plough passing along. The desiderata are 
skill, industry, and capital, along with the division of that part 
which is now common. It must be observed, however, that, of late 
years, considerable progress has been made in extending cultivation 
over waste ground in these parishes; and one proprietor, Mr Laing 
of Papdale, stands prominently forward in this species of improve- 
ment, having, in the course of two years, made the plough to pass 
over more than 100 acres of barren moor. It is a curious fact, 
that ground which has been yielding grey oats and bigg alternately, 
for a series of years, refuses to yield white oats, and this, too, even 
though the ground is of excellent quality. The cause of this may 
be, the quantity of shell sand, which mixes more or less with the 
sea-weed, that has been used as manure for centuries, destroying 
the adhesion of the soil. But, whether this be the real cause or 
not, it is certain that white oats grow in contiguous ground that 
has been newly cultivated. 

The ease with which sea-weed can be procured as manure, by 
presenting a temptation to the farmer to have always a grain crop 
upon his ground, may be supposed to have much impeded the in- 
troduction of the improved mode of agriculture. Another obsta- 
cle which may be mentioned, is the manufacture of kelp from sea- 
weed, which, for nearly a century, has occupied a great propor- 
tion of the labouring part of the community, during the summer 
season, and thereby withdrawn the attention of all classes from 
agriculture. The ardour for kelp making is, however, much abat- 
ed, in consequence of the little remuneration which it brings, the 
price having fallen from L.15, or even L.20 per ton, to L.5. 

Fisheries. — The fishing, which is of most importance to the great 
body of the inhabitants of these parishes, is the sillock or cooth. 
Besides furnishing the people with a considerable part of their food 
during three-fourths of the year, the taking of this fish, which is 
both with the bait and fly, afl'ords to old and young a source of 
interesting amusement, more especially during the pleasant even- 
ings in summer. The lobster-fishing has been carried on here. 



STRONSAY AND EDAY. 163 

for about half a century. This fish is caught during the months 
of April, May, and June, a little without the low water-mark, by 
means of small boats with two men in each, employing for this 
purpose small nets with flesh or fish used as bait. The lobsters, 
when caught, are transferred to chests floating in some sheltered 
place, from which they are taken generally every week, and con- 
veyed to London by welled smacks. The cod-fishing for export 
commenced in the year 1828, and is prosecuted in the neighbour- 
ing seas with small sloops, for the most part decked. The herring- 
fishing was begun here by Mr David Drever, farmer at Huip, in the 
year 1814. And soon after, Mr Laing of Papdale, in connection 
with a company in London, afforded such encouragement, that the 
harbour of Papa Sound, admirably fitted for this purpose, and in the 
vicinity of the finest fishing-ground, soon became the great resort 
of boats from the North Isles, and indeed from all Orkney. Mr . 
Laing, the proprietor of the adjacent ground, has built a consider - 
able village for the accommodation of fishermen who have come 
from distant places to reside here, and likewise a commodious pier 
for the curing and loading of the fish. The herring-fishing com- 
mences towards the end of July, and continues for six or eight 
weeks, during which time the number of boats employed has been 
sometimes about 400, and most of these are manned by four, and 
some by five men. There are also anchored in. Papa Sound from 
25 to 35 vessels, sloops and brigs, mostly from the south-west of 
Scotland, attending on the fishing. And in addition to coopers 
and others, there are several hundreds of women employed in 
cleaning and salting the fish. Numbers of persons also resort to 
the station to traffic with the curers and fishers, while visitors come 
to witness the busy scene, so that the fishing-season is a memora- 
ble part of the year in the parish of Stronsay. It may be added, 
that it is difficult to specify the average quantity caught by one 
boat, but it varies from the smallest number of crans to about 200. 
A common number is from 35 to 70. 

It may be added, that shoals of small whales occasionally run 
aground on these islands, or when seen off" the coast are hunted 
ashore by the people with boats. One of these shoals, fifty in 
number, came ashore at Rousholmn, in November 1834, which 
yielded oil to the amount of about L. 100. And in the beginning 
of the present year, another shoal, 287 in number, came ashore 
on the west side of Eday, which yielded a return of L.398. These

fishes, however, are only rare visitors, and their return cannot be 
calculated on.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — There are two parish churches, both in 
central parts in these islands. The one in Stronsay was built in 
182], the other in Eday, in 1816. Besides these, there are two 
places of worship connected with the United Secession. That in 
Stronsay was built in 1800, and that in Eday, in 1829. The pa- 
rish minister in Stronsay, until about a year and a half ago, was 
wont to cross the Sound in breadth four miles every fourth. Sab- 
bath, to preach in Eday. But in the spring of 1834, the Com- 
mittee of the General Assembly for managing the Royal Boimty 
appointed the present missionary minister to officiate in Eday ; 
and since that time, the parish of Eday has enjoyed the same be- 
nefit of public worship, every Sabbath, as Stronsay, which has 
been also benefited by this appointment, as the minister of Stron- 
say can devote all his attention to that parish. Since the appoint- 
ment of a minister to Eday, a manse has been erected for his 
residence, partly by collections and subscriptions in Orkney and in 
the south ; and partly by the assistance of the present incumbent 
in Stronsay. 

Education. — In these parishe.«, there are three principal schools. 
Two in Stronsay, and one in Eday. Of those in Stronsay, one is 
the parochial school, and the other is supported by the Society for 



STRONSAY AND EDAV. 



1G7 



Propagating Christian Knowledge. This school was established 
by the Society in the year 1782. And it may be worthy of being 
noticed, that since that time it has continued in the same family, 
being taught first by the father and afterwards by the present 
teacher, his son, who is also an elder in the parish church. The 
school in the parish of Eday is supported by the Committee 
of the General Assembly for Promoting of Education in the 
Highlands and Islands of Scotland. It was established in the 
year 1827. Previous to this time, there was no regular school in 
the parish'of Eday. Although the people in Eday were thus so 
long without any public school, it should be observed that the 
children were not altogether neglected. They were for the most 
part taught to read the Scriptures by their parents or some of the 
neighbours. The Assembly's school, however, has been of great 
benefit to the parish, as it has spread education among all the fa- 
milies; taught the young to read with more accuracy than former- 
ly, as well as taught them branches to which they could not have 
access before. 

The parish schoolmaster in Stronsay receives a salary of L. 25, 
13s. Sfd. ; add to which the fees of scholars, L.3; total, L.28, 
13s. 3|d. The teacher of the Society's school in Stronsay receives 
a salary of L. 15; add to which, the fees of scholars, L. 1, 10s.; 
total, L. 16, 10s. The teacher of the General Assembly's school 
in Eday receives a salary of L. 25; add to which, the fees of 
scholars, L, 5 ; total, L. 30. 

The average number of children attending these schools in Stron- 
say, during the summer, are 48; during the winter, 65. The ave- 
rage number attending the Assembly's school in Eday, during 
summer, are 24 ; during winter, 36. The fees are from Is. 6d. 
to 3s. per quarter. 

Besides these schools, there are other casual schools, in more 
remote parts of the islands, taught by persons who earn their liveli- 
hood, partly from the fees of the children, and partly from follow- 
ing some other occupation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds, — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid in these parishes, is about 27. They re- 
ceive from Is. to 15s. during the year. The only fund for relief 
of the poor is that which is procured by weekly collections in the 
parish churches on Sabbath, with the exception of a donation of 
L.2, 2s., per annum, from Mr Balfour of Trenaby for the poor 
of Stronsay. The collections amount to about L. 8, 5s. Sterling, 



168 



ORKNEY. 



per annum. It may be observed, that, although there are many 
poor persons hi these parishes, yet they are more able to find sup- 
port for themselves here than in large towns. If they procure 
from their relatives or neighbours some meal and a few fish and 
potatoes, these are sufficient to satisfy their wants. And though 
very poor, they enjoy a measure of health and contentment. It 
may be remarked, that the people in these parishes are very chari- 
table in bestowing help, in the manner referred to, on their poorer 
neighbours. 

InnSf Alehouses, c. — There are seven alehouses or inns in 
these parishes, and the bad effects of these houses are the same 
here as in other parts of the country. 

Fuel. — The fuel in the parish of Eday consists wholly of peats, 
which are dug from the extensive moss that covers the greater 
part of the island. These peats are of the best sort, and when 
piled on the hearth make an excellent fire. The inhabitants of 
Eday, as has been noticed, have right to the free use of peats from 
the mosses, as a pendicle to their tenements. Several of the north 
isles of Orkney receive fuel from Eday. Boats containing parties 
of people to prepare their winter's supply, may be seen sailing from 
various quarters, in the beginning of summer, when the season for 
cutting the peats commences. They pay 6s. per fathom for them 
after they are cut and dried. And the yearly rent accruing to 
the proprietor of Eday, for this commodity alone, is not less than 
L. 139, 16s. per annum. The inhabitants of Stronsay were wont, 
in former times, to dig their peats from the moss of Rothesholmn, 
already referred to. This privilege, however, about fifty years ago, 
was denied them by the proprietor, and the question being brought 
before the Court of Session, it was decided in his favour. Mr 
Anderson, in his Account of these parishes in 1787, anticipated 
that this decision would " soon be found a great cause of diminish- 
ing the inhabitants." The numbers, however, have considerably 
increased since that time, showing that a scarcity of fuel is too 
feeble a barrier to check population. The tenants in Rothesholmn, 
and some other families, receive their peats, as formerly, from the 
moss. But most of the remaining families receive he little fuel 
they use from Eday, and the average expense to one family is 
about L. 1, 5s. yearly, to which may be added the expense of 
coal, as some of them use a considerable quantity. 

 The measure nbovc-mentionctl is of iiuicli greater dimensions, ban that usually 
tnoifn Ijy tlie fitliom. It contains 1'2 feet in lengtli, C in brcndtli, and 6 in bcigbt.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JAMES SMELLIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The present designation of this parish is that by which 
it has, from time immemorial, been known ; and no other, nor more 
satisfactory account of its origin can be obtained, than that it is 
derived from Saini Andreio, the tutelary saint of Scotland. 

Extent, Sj-c. — The parish of St Andrews is situated on the east 
coast of the mainland of Orkney. Its extreme length is about 
6 miles, and its medial breadth 2. Its superficial extent has 
never been ascertained by actual measurement, but may be esti- 
mated at 13 square miles. It is bounded on the north, by Sha- 
pinshay firth ; on the east, by an arm of the sea called Stronsay 
firth ,• on the south-east, by Deersound ; on the south, by the 
German ocean ; on the south-west, by an undivided common 
of some miles in extent, which lies between it and the parish of 
Holm ; on the west, by the parish of St Ola ; and on the north- 
west, by Inganess bay. It is separated from the parish of Deerness, 
with which it was formerly ecclesiastically united, by Deersound, 
and a narrow isthmus called Sunday sand. In consequence of its be- 
ing variously intersected by the sea, its figure cannot be well de- 
scribed; but the principal part lies south-east and north-west, 
while an inferior division projects from the northern ejid, in an 
easterly direction. 

Topoffraphical Appearances.— The face of the parish, though 
generally flat, is diversified by gentle inequalities in the ground. 
But the highest point is not more than 350 feet above the level 
of the sea, with the steepest acclivity only nine degrees ; and the 
least elevated parts are sometimes covered by the rising tide. It 
IS intersected from, east to west, by three ridges or inconsiderable 
rising grounds ; one at the south end, another at the north, and 
a third in the middle, almost equidistant from each of the others. 

The line of sea-coast, extending along the south, east, and north

sides, may be eighteen miles in length. At three places, viz. the 
isthmus connecting this parish with Deerness, a small creek of 
Deersound near the church, and a part of Inganess bay, it is san- 
dy, and at the southern and eastern boundaries, it is rocky and 
precipitous. At the former of these, the face of the rock is nearly 
180 feet of perpendicular height; and at the latter 95, where it 
is not so remarkable for its elevation, asfor its picturesque appear- 
ance; some parts standing in detached columns, and presenting 
a dauntless front to the fury of the ocean. The rest of the sea 
coast, though occasionally varied by projecting cliffs, generally 
consists of a low beach, affording sea-weed for the manufacture 
of kelp. 

One of the chief natural curiosities of this place is a deep cavern, 
which in the neighbouring district is called the gloup It is situated 
a few yards from the precipice on the east coast, is eighty feet deep, 
and fifty-six by thirty wide ; and the water in its bottom commu- 
nicates with the open sea by a passage through which a boat may 
enter, at certain states of the tide and weather. Additional inte- 
rest is given to_this place by the circumstance, that Sir James Sin- 
clair, natural son of Robert Sinclair, Earl of Orkne}', threw him- 
self into it, and perished. He was prompted to this horrid act, by 
fear of the vengeance of his sovereign James V., whose displeasure 
he had incurred, by representing the Islands of Sanday and Eday 
as insignificant holms, and thus fraudulently attempting to obtain 
possession of them, as a reward for his good services in discomfit- 
ing the Earl of Caithness and Lord Sinclair at Summerdale. 

Meteorology. — Though in rare instances, Fahrenheit's thermo- 
meter in the shade has been known to fall to 16° and rise to 74°, 
yet the following may be talen as the average annual and month- 
ly heights calculated from observations made twice every day, for 
seventeen years — from January 1812 to December 1828. Ave- 
rage annual height, 44°.64

each day of a whole year. And though slight frosts are common 
in winter and spring, yet the mercury in the thermometer seldom 
remains so low as the freezing point, for one continued week. The 
character of the climate is rather damp than cold. And though 
instances have occurred, when many successive weeks during sum- 
mer have passed without a single shower, yet such are rare; and 
drought less frequently than wet proves injurious to agricultural 
pursuits. Eight or nine months of the twelve may often, not in- 
aptly, be denominated rainy. The following are the average 
heights of the barometric column, calculated from the same num- 
ber of observations made during the same period as mentioned in 
regard to the thermometer. Annual height, 29.675 inches.

In December 1833, the mercurial column was only 27.7 inches 
in height; and on the 2Gth May 1834, it was 30.67 inches, so 
that the range of the barometer is at least 2.97 inches. But 
atmospherical changes are often very rapid ; a clear and serene sky 
being not unfrequently, in the space of a few hours, entirely hid un- 
der dark and stormy clouds. 

Rain appears at all seasons of the year, in forms varying from 
gentle mist to weighty drops ; but generally falls more gradually 
here than in more southern districts of Britain. Torrents of rain 
are uncommon — the heaviest showers being usually of short dura- 
tion ; and these come from the west when the wind is strong. 
The south-west, however, in consequence of the greater frequen- 
cy of rain from that direction than from any other, may be deno- 
minated the Tainy quarter. But though the climate be damp, yet, 
owing to the gentle precipitation of moisture in general, probably 
no greater quantity of rain falls annually here than in many 
places which have the character of a much drier climate. Ur 
Barry says, " that, from some attempts to obtain a measurement, 
we have reason to conclude, that the annual quantity of rain that 
falls in those islands amounts to twenty-six inches at an average." 
And this may be assumed as the quantity for this parish. 

High winds are frequent. The most furious blasts are from 
the west and north-west. But the longest continuance of wind in 
one direction is generally when it blows from the cast. The fol- 
lowing are the proportions of time during which winds from the 
four cardinal points, or those approaching nearest to them, prevail

in the course of tlie year, also calculated from observations made 
during seventeen years :— North, &amp;c. 75 days; east, &amp;c. 82.14 
days; south, &amp;c. 107.14 days; west, &amp;c. 100.72. 

Hydrography. — Deersound is the best roadstead contiguous 
to this place. Notwithstanding several sinuosities in its shores, it 
may be said to lie nearly north-east and south-west. It is four 
miles long from the point of Ness, which forms one side of its en- 
trance, to its innermost part, and from one to two miles broad. 
Being well defended on all sides, its mouth six or seven fa- 
thoms deep, and its bottom consisting of clean sandy ground mixed 
with clay, it for ms a safe retreat for vessels of all sizes. Good 
anchorage may be found in many parts of it; but perhaps the 
safest place is that behind the point of Kirbister, on the Deerness 
shore. The most common resort for vessels, however, and at all 
times a sufficiently safe situation, is in six fathoms water, about 
three-fourths of a mile from the point of Ness, and towards the 
St Andrews side of the bay, where the pilot'rule for bringing up 
a vessel is, to bring her into a straight line with the Mull-head of 
Deerness and the point of Ness, and then anchor within that line. 
Wallace, in his History of Orkney, says, that " Deersound is 
capable of sheltering the greatest navies." It is not now much 
frequented. Formerly, a few ships bound for Davis's Straits or 
Greenland, "and some engaged in the Iceland fishery, touched here, 
principally for the sake of hiring men. But, since the burning in 
1823 of Mr Scoresby's ship, the Fame of Hull, a name occurring 
in almost all scientific dissertations on the arctic regions, no whale- 
fishing vessel has been seen here ; and, by the Iceland fishermen, 
it has been almost deserted since last French war. 

Inganess Bay, the only other bay falling under our observation 
at present, is still less frequented, being exposed to the open sea 
from the north-east. It lies in the same direction as Deersound, 
but on the north-west side of the parish. It is bounded on the 
west and south by St Ola. Its length is two miles and a half, its 
breadth upwards of one, and its deplh from two and a half to twelve 
fathoms. The best anchorage is about a mile from its inner ex- 
tremity, in six or six one-half fathoms water; and this is quile safe 
in certain directions of the wind. There is no tideway in either 
of these bays, except the little occasioned by the ebb and flow of 
their own waters. 

In the north end of the parish is the only sheet of fresh water 
deserving the name of lake. Its length is one mile ; its breadth, 
three-fourths ; and its greatest depth in winter, eleven feet of wa- 



ST ANDREWS.

ter, with perhaps as many of mud. It falls five feet of perpendi- 
cular height, in dry seasons, and is then only seven feet above the 
level of the sea. In winter, it has been so completely frozen, as 
to be safely crossed on foot. 

From the small extent of territory in this part of the mainland 
of Orkney, running water never attains a magnitude greater than 
a paltry rill. And none of the springs, all of which are inconside- 
rable, possess a temperature above that of the climate, or manifest 
any remarkable chemical properties. 

. Geology and Mineralogy.— The direction of the strata of rocks 
is generally from east-south-east to west-north-west, with the dip 
to north-north-east. Their inclination varies from 5° to 13°, and, 
in some situations, even more. Around the lake, they range al- 
most from east to west ; and, at one part of the precipitous coast 
on the east, they seem completely deranged ; sometimes, contrary 
to the general rule, ranging from south-west to north-east, with the 
dip to the north-west, and, at other times, while ranging in the 
same direction, dipping to the south-east, and indicating the exist- 
ence of subterranean action in their neighbourhood, at some remote 
period. From a remarkable aperture in these rocks, called the 
Hole of Row, northwards for a quarter of a mile, entire disorder 
prevails. The strata lie in all directions ; the beds are undu- 
lated in their form, more inclined than in other places, and 
some of them placed in an almost vertical position. Along the 
sea-coast, on the north, some other traces of derangement appear. 

The prevailing rocks are argillaceous sandstone and sandstone 
flag, apparently belonging to the old red sandstone formation. But 
trap dikes evidently occur at the place where the strata are so 
much deranged. Traces of calc-spar and iron pyrites are found 
in the vicinity of the latter, and of bog iron ore in the marshes. 
We do not know that any fossil organic remains, either animal or 
vegetable, were ever discovered in this place. 

The rocks are, in all cases, covered with red clay, mixed with 
gravel, over which rest sand, loam, or peat. Peat occurs both on 
the higher and lower grounds. In almost all instances, it is of a 
light and spongy consistence, of a chesnut colour, and apparently 
composed chicHy of moss and heath. But, at the bottom of deep 
moors. It IS blacker, more friable,— and when dried, harder than in 
other Situations ; and contains branches of trees in a half-decayed 
state. Within the last five years, in the course of trenching a bog 
about a quarter of a mile from the minister's house, hazel-nuts 



174 



OUKNEY. 



were found in a state of perfect preservation, at the distance of 
three feet below the surface of the ground, although no trees of 
that kind at present exist in the island. 

The soil seems generally to be untransported, except in a few 
sandy spots near the sea shore, where its situation and appearance 
prove that it has been accumulated by the force of the wind ; and 
in valleys, where a more than ordinary depth betrays its dependent 
character. But the circumstance of greater depth in particular 
situations, though perhaps originating in transportation, may not 
be altogether owing to that cause. For if the accumulation were 
once begun, the increase of soil itself would give greater vigour to 
vegetation, and the decay of its productions, then, independently 
of the former cause, maintain the accumulating process. And 
this proceeding in a natural course, if only commenced by the ope- 
ration of some extrinsic circumstance, might account for the phe- 
nomenon. Perhaps few places, for their extent, can boast of a 
greater variety of soil. One kind does not extend far, till it is in- 
terrupted by another. It is sometimes, though rarely, sandy, and, 
at other times, loamy, but generally clayey or mossy. Sand, 
loam, moss, and clay, are, however, found combined in infinite 
variety of proportion. But the soil that has been long under cul- 
tivation, has assumed the black colour of productiveness, from hav- 
ing been manured chiefly with decomposed organic matter. Large 
portions of the uncultivated ground are covered with a thin stra- 
tum of mossy matter, resting on gravelly clay. And this kind of 
soil, called yarpha, yields few productions except mosses, some of 
the coarser grasses, and stunted heaths. The soil in general, in- 
dependently of the sterile clay on which it rests, is seldom more , 
than three or four inches deep, unless in spots where cultivation 
has been carried on for many years, or where some extrinsic ac- 
cumulating process has been in operation ; in which cases, the 
depth is often from eight inches to a foot, and in marshes some- 
times much more. Its general character is extreme wetness, w hile 
rainy weather continue, — and a tendency to become hard and to 
crack in drought. 

Grubs are most common in places that have been recently 
brought under cultivation, particularly if mossy, and seldom do 
much injury to fields that are regularly ploughed. 

It is stated in the former Statistical Account, that " small bits of 
lead are sometimes found here," probably referring to the rocks on 
the east coast ; and such was once the general belief. But it is now 

3 



ST ANDREWS. 



175 



supposed that iron pyrites was mistaken for lead, as none of the 
latter mineral can at present be discovered. The same has also 
been ignorantly mistaken for silver. 

Zoology. — Hares were found here at an early period, but had af- 
terwards become extinct till within the last few years, when they were 
again introduced, and they are now very numerous, much to the 
annoyance of the farmer. Rabbits are seen in different parts, but 
have a predilection for the sandy ground called links. Otters live 
in the rocks by the sea shore ; and seals abound in the bays. 
Grouse are found here and in the adjacent moors. A great va- 
riety of sea fowl occurs. Eleven species at least of the tribe Anas 
occasionally visit Deersound. Swans are seen in spring and 
autumn, as they migrate to other latitudes, and often rest for days 
on the lake, where they sometimes fall a prey to the sportsman. 
They also occasionally appear during winter, when it is supposed 
that they pass the season in the neighbourhood. Solan geese are 
sometimes seen ; and a species of sea fowl, Anas hernida, Lin. 
Syst., which has here received the name of Horra-goose, perhaps 
from its loud hoarse cry, comes to Deersound about the end of 
December, and remains till the end of February. It is worthy of 
remark, that this bird is not known to visit any other part of Ork- 
ney, excepting Hoy Sound and Westray firth. Several lapwings 
choose this as a situation for rearing their young. Other migra- 
tory birds are seen in winter, as snow -buntings, fieldfares, and 
blackbirds, &amp;c. And the landrail is a hybernating bird common 
in this place. But, for a complete list of the great variety of birds 
which may at different seasons be found here, we refer the reader 
to Barry's History of the Orkney Islands, where those enumerat- 
ed and described will, without many exceptions, illustrate the or- 
nithology of this parish. 

Whether deer ever lived here, it is now difficult to ascertain. 
But part of the antlers and bones of one of these animals were 
dug out of a tumulus on the glebe during the incumbency of the 
present minister; and a few other remains of them have been 
discovered in the island. In corroboration of a prevalent tradition 
that this neighbourhood was once inhabited by these animals, we 
arc reminded of a supposed derivation of the names Deersound 
and Deerness, from deer,— the one signifying the sound and the 
other the cape of deers. But, whatever may be the fact as to the 
existence of deer in this place at some former period, it is much 

 IJouk III. CluiiXer I. 



176 ORKNEY, 

more probable, according, to the opinion of the more intelligent, 
that these names come from some language now in disuse. And 
" in Gaelic, which may have been the language of the country 
under the Pictrh kingdom, Deerness or Durness signifies a penin- 
sulated promontory." According to Dr Barry several remains 
of deer have been found. He says, " an entire skeleton was dug 
up, some years ago, in the heart of an old ruin, in the middle of a 
loch in a parish contiguous to one that is said to have derived its 
name from its being the abode of these animals. The parish to 
which we allude, is Deerness, — a peninsula on the eastern extremi- 
ty of the mainland, which is believed to have been named the 
cape of Deers, because it abounded in these quadrupeds, that 
found shelter in the forest with which it was then covered, and 
which was afterwards destroyed by a storm and inundation. In 
some of the ground in that parish, which is of a marshy nature, 
deers' horns have several times been found." The " parish conti- 
guous" can be no other than St Andrews. But, besides there 
being no loch " with an old ruin in the middle" of it, — the old ruin 
evidently referred to, standing on the margin of the lake, — we ne- 
ver heard of the," entire skeleton" of a deer being discovered any- 
where in the parish, nor of " deers' horns being several times found." 
And it does not appear, that the Doctor's account of the former 
state of Deerness is sufficiently authenticated. 

The species of fish most abundant in Deersound and Inganess 
bay, is the colefish. Small rock-cod of a red colour, the Gadus 
mustela, and some varieties of the tribe Pleuronectes, may also be 
got in considerable numbers. Trout is occasionally met with. 
And several other kinds of fish, which are unimportant in an eco- 
nomical point of view, occur in these bays. Eels are to be found 
in abundance in the lake, but are seldom sought after. Quanti- 
ties of large cod, haddock, skate, dog-fish, herrings, also mackerel, 
and some others, are, however, brought from the adjoining seas. 

With regard to shell-fish, there are numbers of crabs and lob- 
sters ; also cockles and razor-fish, which are taken chiefly in the 
spring season, and used as articles of food. Oysters of a superior 
size are not unknown in some parts of Deersound. Limpets occur 
on all the rocks along the sea shore that are, at the return of every 
tide, covered by the salt water, — but are used only as bait for otiier

fish. The catalogue might be greatly extended by an enumera- 
tion of many other less important kinds. 

Botany. — We are not aware that any very rare plants occur 
here. But, as a kind of index of the nature of the soil, we may 
mention the following — yellow water-flag, marsh marigold, buck- 
bean, cotton-grass, mint, butterwort, and yellow rattle ; corn- 
marigold, wild-mustard, docks, sorrel, and thistles; devils-bit, 
dog's-tail grass, rush, dwarf-willow, foxglove, plantain, common 
primrose, sundew, heath, parnassia, mushrooms, puff-balls ; and a 
variety of fuci on the sea shore, which are burned for kelp. There 
is no wood in the parish, yet the peat mosses bear presumptive 
evidence of its having grown here or not far distant from this place, 
at some former period. Some years ago, the removal of the sand on 
the sea shore, in the immediate vicinity of the bog in which were 
found hazelnuts, discovered several branches of birch trees. This was 
occasioned by a violent gale of north-east wind ; and wherever the 
sand was removed, the stratum below was peat moss to the depth 
of several feet. In the eighth appendix to Dr Barry's history, we 
have an extract from a manuscript by Matthew Mackaile,. preserv- 
ed in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, where it is said that, " at 
the east end of the main, at head of Deersound, at Campstown, 
there is a little wood almost two pair of beets in length, and one 
broad, and as tall as a man, of the ordinary Salix angustifolia or 
viminia." All remembrance of this has long since vanished. 

A spirited attempt was, a few years ago, made by Mr Baikie of 
Tankerness, to introduce the useful and ornamental article of 
wood. He planted with plane-tree, fir, ash, willow, &amp;c. several 
acres of ground along the north side of the lake; but no hope is 
entertained of the success of the attempt,— indeed, the trees have 
almost all entirely disappeared. Perhaps the sea breeze, combin- 
ed with some ungeniality in the rough and uncultivated soil in 
which they were planted, rather than any peculiar rigour of the 
chmate, has proved adverse to their growth : for various kinds of 
fruit trees, and even tender shrubs will thrive well in a good soil, 
and under the protection of a sufficient wall. About four years 
ago, the same gentleman planted two or three acres of good 
ground near his house with the same kinds of wood, and the young 
trees seem healthy, and are progressing in stature.

references to the one as well as the other of them in accounts of the 
Orkney Islands, and even in the Old Statistical Account. The mi- 
nister always resided in St Andrews. He officiated every alternate 
Sabbath in the adjoining parish of Deerness, till May 1830, when, 
in consequence of the Parliamentary grant of 1823, for building 
churches and manses in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, 
the latter was blessed with a resident clergyman of its own, and 
the former with a regular dispensation of religious ordinances. 

Parochial Register.— The only parochial register is the ses- 
sion-record, which extends backwards to the year 1657, and con- 
tains an account of births, marriages, and sessional transactions. 
It was accurately kept till the year 1796 inchisive; but from that 
period till 1804, it was sadly neglected. And, notwithstanding the 
exertions of those who have since had the charge of it, to render 
it more complete for the succeeding period, it still forms a very 
imperfect record of the parochial events of the present century,— 
the carelessness or bigotry of Dissenters often preventing them 
from applying for the registration of their children's names. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are. Lord Dundas ; 
James Baikie, Esq. of Tankerness ; and James Stewart, Esq. of 
Brough. 

Antiquities.— lu different parts of the parish are to be found 
ruins, now almost levelled with the ground, which are called cha- 
pels. We could particularize at least four, each in a separate 
division of the parish, called an ursland, and situated near, or in 
the midst of a considerable extent of good ground. It is thought 
that they are the remains of Roman Catholic chapels, one of 
which probably formed an appendage to the dwelling of each con- 
siderable proprietor, for whom, in former days, it was customary 
to reside on his estate. On the point of Ness, there is the vestige 
of a small rude fort, consisting of a circular embankment of earth 
and stones, which is said to have been used, in days of piracy, for 
annoying vessels when entering Deersound. One piece of ord- 
nance still lies on the spot. There are in the parish three tumuli, 
denominated lioioies. One of these stands on the minister's glebe, 
by the side of the lake, and projects into the water. It is about 
1 40 yards in circumference at the base, and 1 2 feet high. At the 
time at which the last Statistical Account was written, it contamed 
a wall 9 feet thick, in which, says the writer, " there seem to 
have been no apartments, or if there have, they are now filled 
with rubbish. Some pieces of wall have been found on the out- 

3

side, but their use or form cannot be ascertained." Besides the 
deer's horn already alluded to, small bone rings, shells, and "bones 
of various kinds of animals, have been found in it. Part of it has 
also thie appearance of having, at one time, been a burial ground- 
Another of these tumuli stands near the centre of the parish. 
It is of a truncated conical form, hollowed at the top, 90 yards 
around the base, and 16 feet in height. It appears to have been 
surrounded by a mound, at the distance of twenty yards from the 
base, but has not been opened within the memory of man. A 
third tumulus, of larger dimensions than either of the former, 
being 36 feet high, is situated on the isthmus at the southern ex- 
tremity of the parish, and is called Dingy's How, or Duncan's 
Height. No record or tradition remains of the age of these ac- 
cumulations, nor of the objects which they were intended to serve  
but a superstitious belief, now almost exploded, once invested 
them with a sacred character, and regarded them as" the residence, 
or the haunts of fairies. 

Public Buildings. — The only erections of a public nature, are, 
the plain parish church and school, unless we include two small 
and simple undershot water-mills for grinding corn. The summer 
residence of Mr Baikie of Tankerness and the manse are conspi- 
cuous among the humbler habitations of the peasantry. 

The stone used in building is sandstone flag, which is found 
here in great abundance, and of very superior quality. It is ob- 
tained at little expense, as it occurs almost every where, at a short 
distance from the surface of the ground. Roofing slate has been 
lately discovered in one part of the parish, though only of an in- 
ferior kind, and to an inconsiderable extent. The farm-houses are, 
however, generally roofed with straw or heath. And it may be re- 
marked, that the mode of thatching in these islands is different from 
that adopted in the southern parts of Scotland. The straw or heath 
is first twisted by the hand into the form of a thick rope, which, 
when so prepared, is called simmons. Parallel folds of this cordage 
are passed over the joists from eave to eave, till the whole of the 
building be once covered. A stratum of loose 'straw is then in- 
terposed between this, and another layer of the same cordage; 
and these are alternated until a covering be formed, which will 
hold out the wind and rain. The inferiority of this method is, 
however, manifest, from its requiring repair, almost every year. 
But this often consists of nothing more than an additional stratum 
of simmons.

III. — Population. 

No information can be obtained respecting the ancient state 
of the population. In 1831, it amounted to 857 persons — 382 
males, and 475 females. According to the return made to Dr 
Webster in 1755, and according to the enumeration by Mr Scolly, 
the incumbent in 1772, it was at these respective periods, nearly 
the same as at present. But, at the time at which the last Sta- 
tistical Account was drawn up, there was a considerable decrease, 
owing, it was alleged, to " the continual drain of men to the navy, 
to the northern fisheries, and, above all, to Hudson's Bay. Be- 
fore the year 1741, the Hudson's Bay Company's servants were 
all taken from England, Ireland, or the Shetland Isles. About 
1741 or 1743, they began to get a few from Orkney, and, finding 
them to be submissive and industrious, they now take most or ail 
of their trades-folk and contracted servants from this country." 
Whatever effect these supposed causes may have had upon the 
population forty years ago, they certainly do not seem at present 
to exercise any sensible influence over it. 

The only person of independent fortune residing in the parish, 
is Mr Baikie of Tankerness. And the number of proprietors of 
land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, is three, viz. those 
mentioned as the chief land-owners. The number of families is 
156, and of inhabited houses, 146. There is one fatuous, and 
one blind person. 

One peculiarity in the customs of the people that may be men- 
tioned, is, that the majority of the men may be said to have no 
fixed profession, but are farmers, fishermen, and artisans, at dif- 
ferent seasons of the year. Another is, that each tenant claims 
an exclusive right to the fields which he rents, only during the 
time that the crop is on the ground. Although a little improve- 
ment in this respect has, of late, begun to manifest itself, yet, what 
was written for the last Statistical Account, will, in general, still 
apply. " All the cattle, horses, sheep, swine, geese, &amp;c. go at 
large for about nine months of the year. As soon as any one te- 
nant cuts and brings in his corn, the whole country becomes at 
once a common, and all his neighbours must follow his example, 
or leave their crops, ripe or unripe, to be trodden down and de- 
stroyed." 

The people are decent in their external appearance. And al- 
though their habits, in regard to the preparation of food, and 
cleansing of kitchen utensils, might, in some cases, give offence to 



ST ANDREWS. 



181 



a Jelicate or refined taste, yet they are very particular in the ob- 
servance of such rules as fall within their own notions of decorum. 
They are, however, very deficient in attention to the order and 
cleanUness of their habitations. The interior of the apartment 
commonly occupied by the family is generally coated with dust, 
ashes, and soot, — owing, in no small degree, to the practice of 
having the fire-place in the middle of the room, without any other 
chimney to conduct the smoke outward, than a hole in the roof of 
the house. In addition to this, poultry, and even pigs and calves, 
as well as dogs and cats, are often admitted to a corner of the same 
apartment with the family. The food of the people consists of 
bread made of the meal of oats or bear, and sowens, which is a pre- 
paration from the siftings of oatmeal ; also of potatoes, cabbages, 
milk, butter, cheese, and fish, with a small quantity of animal food, 
— and that chiefly goose or bacon. 

Poaching is unknown ; and smuggling is almost at an end, — 
the only remaining instances of the latter being occasional attempts 
to make a little malt for private use, without previously lodging in- 
formation with the excise officer of the district. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The lands never having been surveyed, and the 
cultivated parts lying in detached shreds of every size and shape, 
it is impossible to state accurately the number of acres that this 
parish contains, or that is under cultivation. But from the best 
local knowledge, we may venture to give 2200 acres, as an esti- 
mate, of the quantity ever under tillage, which is probably a near 
approximation to the truth. Perhaps half of the ground that has 
never been touched with the plough might, by labour, be made 
yield the means of human subsistence. But from the wetness and 
natural poverty of the soil, it is questionable whether in a corner 
so remote from markets this could, except in a very few cases, be 
done with a profitable application of capital. 

Where the extent of a farm is not known, either by the land- 
lord, his tenant, nor any one else, it is difficult to state the average 
rent of arable ground. But it may be estimated at from 7s. to lOs. 
value per acre. Along with the arable land so rented, however, 
the tenant receives as much or a greater extent of pasture ground, 
which is considered as going into the bargain. The practice of 
grazmg cattle for rent is so little known, that nothing satisfactory 
can be said as to its average expense.

ORKNEY. 



Wages — There are but few cases, in which farm-servants are 
hired, — the farms being generally small, and the members of the fa- 
mily sufficing for the accomplishment of the necessary work : so 
that an estimate of their wages would be drawn from a small induction 
of particulars ; and as the terms of service are often short, and pe- 
culiar to the country, little information of general utility could be 
obtained even from these particulars. A man's wages, however, 
for a year, may be from L. 6 to L. 8, exclusive of board ; and a 
woman's, from L.2 to L. 4, according to their capabilities. The 
harvest-fee, for a period understood to extend to six weeks, is from 
L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 10s. for a man ; and for a woman, 15s. or upwards. 
Hiring persons by the day for farm-work, is not yet so common as 
to enable us to say any thing decisive as to the rate of expense. 
But men may be hired for quarrying or breaking stones and 
other ordinary purposes at little more than Is. per day. Mowers, 
master-masons, and regularly bred workmen, receive from Is. 6d. 
to 2s. each per day. 

Produce, c. — The kind of grain called bear or big is sold, when 
raw, by the ivey, a quantity equal to IG stones Dutch or 1 8| stones 
imperial ; and when dried, then called " melder-corn," by the 
" meil," which is nearly 1 litones Dutch or 14 imperial. These 
quantities of raw and dried grain, respectively, are considered of equal 
value, and may be purchased at a sum varying from 14s. to L. 1 Ster- 
ling. Oats, which are generally of very inferior quality, are sold af- 
ter the same manner ; only that the above mentioned denominations, 
when applied to this sort of grain, signify about a fourth less than 
when applied to bear. The "meil" of oats sells at the rate of from 8s. 
to 16s. Both kinds are frequently sold unthrashed, and the prices 
vary chiefly according to the demand for fodder. Potatoes sell at 
from 8d. to Is. per anker, z. e. from 2d. to 3d. per peck. Turnip 
and hay are not raised in sufficient quantities to become general 
articles of purchase. Cattle sell at from L.3 to L.6. But the 
average price of a cow either for milk or beef, may be stated at 
L.3, 10s. ; of a sheep of the common kind, 8s. and of the larger 
breeds, L. 1 ; of geese, great numbers of which are reared here, 
Is. 9d. or 2s. each ; of common fowls, 7d. or 8d.; eggs, 2|d. to 
4d per dozen ; and butter, Gd. or 7d. per lb. Beef varies in price 
at different seasons of the year, from 2id. to 5d. per lb. And 
most other things are in proportion.

dinary purposes, is that called the " garron," supposed lo be of

Norwegian origin. Their distinctive characters are thick necks 
and heads, with short ears. They seldom exceed fourteen hands 
and a half in height, and are very strong and hardy. The breed 
of black-cattle, which appears to be the oldest known, if not the 
indigenous, species of this country, is still common, though much 
mixed. They are small, thin, and often ill-shaped; but this pro- 
bably proceeds from bad treatment. On the scanty pastures, which 
the soil affords them, however, they are more profitable for the 
dairy than more improved breeds ; and their flesh is highly es- 
teemed for its delicacy. The native sheep are distinguished from 
the southern breeds by inferiority of size and shape, and the exces- 
sive shortness of their tails ; and from the famous Zetland breed, 
by the general coarseness of their wool. They are sometimes of 
a gray, and at other times, of a dark tawny or black colour, as 
well as white. The head is often ornamented with horns, — that 
of the male almost always with large twisted ones, sometimes six 
or seven pounds in weight. And these frequently prove fatal to 
them in swimming. In order to obtain marine plants for food, it is 
customary for these animals in winter to repair, at low water, to the 
sea-side, where they sometimes forget the necessity of retiring from 
rocks \vhich are insulated at half-tide, before the water entirely sur- 
rounds them ; and when they are at last swept from their foot- 
ing, the strongest often perish first in the attempt to reach land ; 
their heads beitig borne down into the water by the weight of their 
horns, and their destruction occasioned by what is intended to beau- 
tify their appearance when confined to their native element. A kind 
of hog, of a diminutive size, and having small tapering extremities, 
was formerly common in this place, but is now nearly extinct. Its 
most peculiar features are a ridge of strong upright bristles extend- 
ing from between the ears to the tail, the ears quite erect, and the 
back arched like that of some species of the hyena tribe. 

Husbandry. — The state of husbandry is in general wretched. 
Established customs are inveterate in spite of their absurdity, and 
there seems to be nnpossibility of getting out of the old beaten track. 
There are indeed one or two creditable exceptions, but the following 
may be received as the character of the husbandry commonly pur- 
sued. There is no regular rotation of crop, no rest for the soil, no 
means used efl'cctiially to clean the ground from an abundant crop 
of weeds, and no manure aflbrded exco[t once in evcM-y two years. 
Bear, and a kind of smail-bearded grey oats are sown alternately 
on the same ground, from generation to generation, — the former 



184

receiving manure, either sea-weed, the cleanings of the dwellings 
of domestic animals, or a cold inactive composition of these with 
earth, there being no lime in the place, while the latter is sown 
without any fertilizing substance, and left to wear out the transient 
effects of what raised the preceding crop. Green crop is almost 
unknown. Turnip, hay, pease, or beans, are hardly thought of. 
And potatoes, which, if properly managed, might tend to clean 
the ground, are either confined to the drier parts, or planted in so 
small quantities, that before a whole field can be taken in rota- 
tion, the good effects are lost upon what was first treated in this 
manner. The mode of ploughing is in keeping with the system 
of cropping. The ridges are seldom drawn straight. They are 
so much raised towards the middle, that there is not soil left in 
the furrow sufficient to cause almost any vegetation ; and their 
different parts are often of unequal breadths, which occasions a 
great waste of time and labour in ploughing. Little attention is 
paid to the reclaiming of waste land. Indeed, no regular plan is 
ever pursued for thus improving the district. The chief way in 
which any portion of it is reduced to cultivation is, when a person 
from inability to stock a farm, or other adverse circumstances, re- 
treats to the common, rears a cottage, and partially subdues the 
surrounding spot. But in bringing one acre into a profitable 
state, the surface of several acres is skinned and destroyed ; and 
at best, this practice, instead of substantially improving, only studs 
the common with half-cultivated patches. Within appropriated 
bounds again, it seems an established, if not a sacred maxim, that 
what has once been ploughed shall never be allowed for a year to 
rest, and what has never been turned up, must be allowed for ever 
to remain. So far, indeed, is this principle carried, that insigni- 
ficant spots of ploughed land are not unfrequently seen in the 
midst of pasture fields, where, independently of the expense of 
labour, the crop from depredations of cattle and other causes, 
seems hardly sufficient to supply seed for the succeeding season. 
And deformed shreds of grass may be observed stretching into, 
or surrounded by corn-fields, as if it were sacrilege " curvo aratro 
luedere." 

Trenches have sometimes been cut, to draw off water. But to 
the improvement of covered drains, the example has yet to be 
set. Irrigation and embanking are both unnecessary and imprac- 
ticable. 

Leases were formerly granted for three years, or for one, two. 



ST ANDREWS. 



185 



and even three nineteens of years. But leases of more than a 
single year are now seldom obtained. 

Farm buildings are constructed of stones and clay, and covered 
with thatch. They are seldom so high as conveniently to serve the 
purposes for which they are intended, and not rebuilt till they are 
actually falling down. The few existing enclosures, excepting 
those on the minister's glebe, and one other farm, are mostly in- 
suflicient turf walls. 

Improvement of any kind in agriculture cannot be said to have 
yet generally commenced. One is animated by the anticipation, 
rather than by the appearance of its first dawn, and all obstacles 
combine to retard its progress,- — want of lengthened leases, want of 
capital, of enclosures, of winter herding, and want of the separa- 
tion of the lands of different farms. It is common for the arable 
lands belonging to several farmers to be so intermixed, that the 
breadth of 100 yards can scarcely be found in the possession of 
one tenant. Lands so distributed are called run-rig : and far- 
mers who hold their lands only for a single year, such are 
styled tenants at loill. Now, where there are few or no en- 
closures, and the disproportion between the extent and the pro- 
ductiveness of the ground, is very great — where a farmer has often 
not half a dozen ridges lying together, without some of those of 
his neighbours intervening, and winding their serpentine course 
along them, — and where leases are seldom granted by the land- 
lords to excite a spirit of improvement among their tenantry, the 
wretchedness of the husbandry cannot be altogether charged 
against the listlessness of the peasantry. And till these obstacles 
be removed, it is impossible that improvement can proceed to any 
extent, or the industrious powers and spirit of the lower ranks be 
manifested. In the same way, while one tenant cannot improve 
without the consent and co-operation, not only of all his neigh- 
bours, but also of the proprietor himself, or while improvement is 
altogether impracticable from the manner in which the lands are 
partitioned; while there is no encouragement, at least on the part 
of the tenant, to inclose, as ho holds his farm only from year to 
year; and while, consequently, the crops which are sown have not 
a fair trial, — it is diflicult to say what is the productive power of the 
soil, or what are the improvements that would reward enterprise and 
industry. But, from a few specimens of superior nianagcnioiit, it is 
evident that the lands are capable of yielding a much greater return 
than they at present make. Whether, however, they would repaythe 



186

labour requisite to give the experiment its full force, is a question 
not so easily answered. 

Fishery. — The only employment of this kind that is here pro- 
secuted on a large scale as a source of economical wealth, is the 
herring-fishery. The curing of herrings commenced with us 
only in 1833, and as this is but on the advance as a station, 
and the fishing has not been attended generally with its usual suc- 
cess, since it began here, nothing can yet be said as to its annual 
profits. The people of the place, however, were in the habit 
of prosecuting this employment, and delivering their fish at other 
stations, for several years before curing commenced in their own 
parish. 

Raio Produce raised in the Parish. — When most of the farmers 
know neither the quantity of grain that they sow, nor that they reap, 
but calculate both by guess, or do not calculate at all, and when 
few of the particulars under the present head of inquiry will ap- 
ply to this place, as must be evident from some of our previous re- 
marks, — little information can be expected on this part of our sub- 
ject. But the chief sources of wealth,. independently of the grain 
which is raised on the lauds, are selling of cattle, fishing, and the 
savings of persons employed as seamen out of the country, who 
come home to spend the winter months, and the decline of life 
among their friends. Formerly the making of kelp, and with the 
women the plaiting of straw, . formed the two principal means of 
earning money. The former of these, indeed, at one time, consti- 
tuted the chief source of revenue to the whole county. And 
though it now yields little or no direct profit to the proprietor, it 
is still an object not unworthy of his attention. For, in many cases, 
the making of a certain quantity of kelp is part of the tenure by 
which lands are held ; and so long as this commodity fetches as 
much in the market as is allowed in value for making it, it is the 
means of bring hard cash into the hands of the landlord, and in ef- 
fect enables the tenant to pay more for his farm, than he could in 
other circumstances afford. 

Manufacture — The only manufacture is that of kelp. It is not 
now conducted so eagerly and so extensively as formerly. It might, 
atone period, have occupied sixtyorseventypersons foramonth : but 
now, not nearly so many. The number of hours per day that they 
work is uncertain, for those who cut the weed from which it is made 
are almost unremittingly occupied while the tide allows them to reach 
it, whether that time be day or night. They often rise at one or 



ST ANDREWS.

two o'clock A. M. to prosecute their toil, and may sometimes be 
seen at it till eleven p. m. But they refresh themselves with sleep 
during part of the intervening period, when the return of the 
waters covers the sea- weed. Both men and women are employed in 
this work, the former receiving from L.l, Is. to L.1, 10s., with four 
stones of meal, and the latter from 15s. to L.l Sterling, and three 
stones of meal, for a month's labour. Although persons so occu- 
pied have little sleep ; are subjected to irregular periods of refresh- 
ment; often stand for hours in water, and seldom have their feet 
dry ; yet, as this employment engages them but for a short period, 
and that at the best season of the year, the month of June, when 
the sun is upwards of eighteen hours above the horizon, it has not 
been found prejudicial to the health of those who are not consti- 
tutionally delicate. And it does not seem, farther than any other 
occupation, to deteriorate their morals, — more than ten or twelve 
persons seldom forming one company, and single families often 
working by themselves. 

V. — -Parochial Economy. 
There is no town or village in the parish. The nearest town 
is the burgh of Kirkwall, which is seven miles distant from the re- 
motest, and two and a half from the nearest, part of the parish. 
The road to it is one of the best in the country, though not a 
turnpike, and has hitherto been kept in repair by means of statute 
labour. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is tole- 
rably central, being four miles from one extremity of the parish, 
and two and a half from the other. It was built in the year 1801, 
and was enlarged and thoroughly repaired in 1827. It is, at pre- 
sent, commodious and comfortable, affording accommodation for 
upwards of 400 persons. Formerly, there was a nominal rent 
charged for some of the seats, but now there is nothing paid for 
any of them. 

The manse was originally built in the year 1756, but left in a 
very superficial state. In 1793 it was all renewed, except the 
walls, which were then heightened and much weakened by alte- 
rations. It was last repaired in 1830, when an addition was also 
made to it, and is at present comfortable, but far from a state of 
permanent sufficiency. The extent of the glebe is 17 acres, 
and its annual value may be estimated at L.6. The amount of 
stipend is L.200 per annum, exclusive of L. 8, 6s. Bd. for com- 
munion elements.

There are no chapels in the parish, either in connection with 
the EstabHshed Church or any other body of Christians. There 
are 70 male heads of families, and individuals from 84 families, 
who attend the parish church. The number of persons of all ao-es 
who attend it, is from 250 to 300, but the number is constancy 
varying. The average number of communicants is about 200, but, 
like the former, is variable. Divine service is regularly attended 
by almost all who profess adherence to the national church. Dis- 
senters attend divine worship beyond the bounds of the parish. 

Contributions are made here in behalf of the Orkney Church" 
Bible and Missionary Society, to the amount of L. 5. The an- 
nual amount of church collections, for religious and charitable ob- 
jects, is L. 6, 10s. lOfd. at an average of eight years. 

Education. — There is no permanent school except the parochial 
one. And the branches taught in it, are reading, writing, arith- 
metic, and grammar. At present, the parochial schoolmas'ter is so 
nearly blind as to be incapacitated for discharging the duties of 
his office, and cannot be compelled to provide a substitute. The 
school is, however, taught by a qualified person, who, in addition 
to the school-fees, receives a small gratuity from the heritors. The 
schoolmaster's salary was, by the late augmentation, raised to L.27; 
and the school-fees, under an efficient teacher, may amount to 
from L. 9 to L. 12 Sterling. He has, besides, a school-house, con- 
sisting of .two comfortable apartments. The expense of attendance 
at the school is, for English, Is. 6d. ; for ditto and writing, 2s. ; 
and for these with arithmetic, 2s. 6d. per quarter. It may be af- 
firmed, that no person belonging to the parish, above seven years 
of age, and of ordinary capacity, is entirely unacquainted with the 
elements of education ; and that there is none, above ten, unable 
to read with some degree of intelligence. And the people seem to 
be so far alive to the benefits of education, that, in the present un- 
fortunate circumstances of the parochial school, they make such 
exertions as prevent their children growing up in total ignorance. 

The school is situated in the immediate vicinity of the church 
and is of course equally central. Winter, however, being the sea- 
son most convenient for attendance, and the roads being then bad, 
as well as the days short, it is hardly possible that it can be at- 
tended by the children of those who live in the more remote parts 
of the parish. The population that lies beyond the reach of con- 
venient attendance, is, probably, not more than 150 persons. And 
for the children of such, care is taken to encourage temporary se-

minaries of instruction. Two schools placed at a moderate dis- 
tance from the extremities of the parish, instead of one central 
school, would meet all the exigencies of the case. 

The few remaining traces of superstition are fleeing away before 
the progress of enlightened knowledge. But the novel and fa- 
shionable modes of education have not yet been introduced. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid, is 12 at an average of eight years; to each of whom 
is allotted, only, the small pittance of from Is. 6d. to 10s. per 
annum, with occasional supplies as necessity requires. The only 
sources whence funds for their relief are derived, are, church col- 
lections, marriage dues, and payment for the use of the mortcloth, 
which, exclusively of the first, amount annually to L. 1, 18s. 9d, But 
from the same funds are paid precentor's and church officer's salaries. 
The old virtuous principle of attempting self-support, so long as it 
is possible, still so far prevails, that application for assistance is 
seldom made, till "urged by necessity's supreme command" 

Fairs. — Cattle markets are held at two places in the parish, 
Knockhall and Occlester, three times a year; at Candlemas, Mid- 
summer, and Martinmas. 

Inns, Alehouses, cc. — There is only one licensed alehouse. It 
is situated at the side of the road leading to a neighbouring pa- 
rish, and at one of the places where a cattle-market is held. It 
seems to be established for a useful purpose, is orderly kept, and 
is not known to produce any bad effect upon the morals of the 
people. 

Fuel. — The general description of fuel, and indeed all that is 
used here, except a small quantity of coals, brought either from 
Newcastle or the ports on the Frith of Forth, is peat, which is ob- 
tained at the distance of a quarter of a mile, or at most two miles, 
from each house. But as each family undertakes the labour of 
cutting, drying, and carting home as much as will suffice for its 
own consumption, — little can be said satisfactorily of the expense 
of this sort of fuel. The carting alone occupies three weeks, or 
a month of constant labour.

PItESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. JOHN GERARD, MINISTER. 



I.— TOPOG RAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

This parish consists of three parishes united, time immemorial, 
under one minister, viz. \st, South or St Mary's parish, compre- 
hending above one-third of the large island of South Ronaldsay, 
and three islands in the Pentland Frith, two of them inhabited, 
Swona, and one of the two Pentland Skerries ; '2d, North or St 
Peter's parish, comprehending the rest of this large island of 
South Ronaldsay ; and, 3c, the parish of Burray, which consists 
of the islands of Burray, Hunda, and Glumesholm. The two 
first are inhabited. 

Geology. — The highest land in the parish does not exceed 300 
feet above the level of the sea. The general inclination of the 
rocks is to the north-west; but some varieties of that inclination 
are truly striking. On the east side of Stoos-head, where the 
rock is above 200 feet high, the rock is suddenly depressed to 
the south-east about 75°, going down into the German Ocean, 
and, at a few yards distance on the north and south side of this, 
the general depression to north-west prevails, and continues over 
the whole parish, except a small portion east or Grimness-head ; 
and, on the north-west end of Glumesholm, the depression is not 
less than 80°. These sudden variations in the position of the va- 
rious strata, prove clearly that all were laid down by water, and 
long continued in a soft state. The sudden depressions prove 
that softer materials below gave way to their pressure, and occa- 
sioned this variety of position. The whole of the islands in the 
parish, are composed of sandstone and dark blue slate or rather flag. 
The sandstone can seldom be quarried in thin pieces ; but the flag 
or slate may be raised in slabs from six to eight feet diameter, at 
Hoxa and Hcrston.

The rents in the rocks can be traced nearly in a straight line 
from south-west to north-east, over Pentland Skerry ; and it de- 
serves notice, that where they come in sight, on the'other islands, 
they run in the same direction. This is easily explained by the 
general direction of all strata, as they become indurated, from the 
universal principles of their cohesion and shrinking. Shrinking 
chiefly explains the direction of the rents in all rocks, and the 
strange appearances of some within flood-mark, where the surface 
of the rocks is like street paving, with round stones from two inches 
and upwards. In the deeper strata of sandstone, are many fragments 
of blue slate, quite solid, proving that they had been broken down 
from a bed or stratum, and then tossed about on the shore, and left 
in small parcels of a few inches in extent, and at other places in 
strata of two inches and upwards, between deep beds of hardest sand- 
stone. In the small rents of this rock, under and about a- quarter 
of an inch, the iron and sulphur make a crust of hardest texture, 
which withstands the waste of lime for thousands of years. 

Some other appearances in this rock deserve notice. The rents, 
in some places, have formerly been of more extent than those now 
seen, as is proved by the large pieces of basaltic rock everywhere 
on the surface of moors and arable land, and on the shores, from 
2 to 9 inches in diameter. But, on the north corner of the parish 
of Birsay, within flood-mark, this is seen to perfection ; — the rent 
to twenty inches wide is filled in solid form, and projects above 
the surface of the rock washed by the tide. Till I saw this, I 
never could conceive how this substance was formed, nor whence 
it came. It seems to prove that all basaltic formation is, by heat long 
continued. That which we now see cold and solid was certainly 
laid down by water; and heat from the central part of our globe 
produced crystallizations of every form, from the diamond to the 
particles of sandstone. Quartz of different sizes, from that of the 
pea to three inches in diameter, are found, of various colours, per- 
fectly smooth, on the highest land in Orkney : and in this 
parish, they are found in the clay where the mountain has been 
bared by storms ; and I have seen sixty such in a piece of stone 
about a foot in diameter. 

There is evidence to an attentive observer that these islands 
came gradually into their present form and appearance. I have seen 
the roots of the giant grass in sandstone, a specimen of which I 
lodged in the College Museum of Edinburgh, and have traced 
it for several feet. This proves that the stratum of sandstone

193 



was formed in fresh water. I have also found wood lodged in the 
sandstone as it was laid on the beach, and reaching over different 
layers of the sand, and then covered over. The different depres- 
sions in Orkney astonish the attentive observer. They appear to 
have happened at vast distances of time from each other ; for 
that part which remained above the sea, till peat moss of considera- 
ble depth was formed, is now under the sea. The most striking 
instance is on the north side of Widewall bay, bounded by the 
lands of Hoxa. 

The geologist who visits our island may attend to Otterswick 
bay in Sandy, — an island south of Shapinshay, and the bay of 
Skail, in the parish of Sandwick, in Pomona or Mainland. It is evi- 
dent, that the materials of which the whole Orkney islands consist 
and the base on which they rest, have sunk down very gradually, 
II. — Civil History. 

The remains of Picts' houses are numerous and of great extent. ' 
Of late years, a few ancient coins have been found ; but they do 
not throw light on the periods when these islands were invaded. 
The mounds caWed'hill dikes have, in many cases, been entrench- 
ments thrown up by invaders. At the manse, there is an under- 
ground building 3 feet wide, 2A feet high, and 11 in length, neat- 
ly paved with water-worn stones from the beach, and covered with 
til in stones. This is supposed to have been a Pictish grave. 

Some large standing stones, supposed to be Druidical monu- 
ments, still remain ; one, about 1 1 feet high, stands near the manse, 
and deep in the earth. 

There were nine places for Popish worship in the united pa- 
rishes, with burying-ground at eight of them.

Within the last twenty-four years, 480 couples have been mar- 
ried, and not above five of these were independent of fishing. 

IV. — Industry. 

Before the herring-fishing began, the people fished skrac or 
siUoch, podlies, and sold them by thousands,— taking other fish for 
their own families. Now, much of their time is employed in pre- 
parmg for herring-fishing, and less is done in laying in store for 
t leir families. Bad weather prevents the boats from going to sea

in the winter season ; insomuch that I have known when there was 
not so mucli fish taken during five months, as would furnish one 
meal to each inhabitant of the united parishes, and when even the 
cormorants died for want of food. At other times, the influx of 
small fish into some bays was such, that nets took them up with 
ease, and in great abundance for some weeks. 

Hundreds have married in the hope of receiving L.3, 12s. of 
wages from the herring-fishing : but even this is sometimes a deceit- 
ful expectation, — that fishing being often very unproductive. 

In 1838, there were 245 herring-boats, belonging to the united 
parishes, and 4066 barrels were cured. Could the curers have 
4s. clear on each barrel, this would make L. 813 of clear gain. 

Most of the small crofts are let at double rent, in the hope of 
payment being made practicable from the proceeds of the fishing. 

The universal appetite for spirits is dreadful, and the many 
himdreds of pounds spent in this destruction of health and morals, 
is appalling, The curers give one bottle of whisky to the crew of 
every boat: and the children are taught to drink at home, &amp;c. 
- At our yearly market, at Martinmas, the sums spent in drinking 
and dancing are very great. We try to suppress these practices ; 
but in vain. 

Fishings. — The cod-fishing was begun in 1817. Now, eleven 
sloops belonging to this parish are employed in it. In 1838, there 
were 116 tons, 16| cwt. of cod, ling, and hake fish dried, at L.14 
per ton. 

Although the whole herrings cured in our stores in 1838, 
amounted to 12,180 barrels, yet boats from other places had their 
share of the profits, and tlie whole produce of the fishing far ex- 
ceeded that amount. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— 'T\\q attendance at the parish churches 
has been far better, and our collections have actually increased, 
since a minister of the United Secession was settled in 1830. 

In the three united parishes, 909 sittings are wanted to com- 
plete the legal accommodation. If a small loft were put in each 
end of South Church, and the present seats repaired, the accom- 
modation would be complete, and the attendance much better 
North parish should have accommodation for 1020; but the ac- 
tual accommodation is only for 414, at 18 inches each ; and there 
is no accommodation for the island and parish of Burray. 

About forty years ago, the church in the island and parish of

Biirray fell into ruins, during the incumbency of the Rev. James 
Watson, and it has not since been repaired ; while it stood, there 
was sermon, in each of the three parishes by turns. Thus the 
people could have sermon, only once in three weeks. And the 
effects of this, as may be imagined, were deplorable. 

Since 1st January 1837, the minister has preached every Sab- 
bath in North Church, and his son has volunteered to preach 
twice every three weeks in South Church, when health and weather 
permit. 

In 1832, the parishioners offered to put a loft in North Church, 
to accommodate 250 people. Lord Dundas, as chief heritor, con- 
sented; but some of the other heritors discouraged the proposal. 
Baptists have, in consequence, invaded the parish. 

Education. — William Tomison, a native of South parish, who 
went into the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, about the 
year 1770, and, by his fidelity and industry, acquired a consider- 
able fortune, left, about forty years ago, his gains for the first 
twenty-five years, for the endowment of a free school to the inha- 
bitants of the three united parishes. There is, in consequence, 
a commodious house, and a salary of L. 40 for the teacher. To 
this endowment, the Right Honourable Lord Dundas added a croft 
of land surrounding the house. 

Mr Tomison also left L. 200 in aid of the poor's funds of his 
native parish, and a sum for the erection and endowment of a fe- 
male school ; which, in terms of his will, is left to accumulate for 
a certain period. 

A parochial school was erected, about twenty-six years ago, near 
the village of St Margaret's Hope. We have excellent teachers 
in South and North parishes. But the vast extent of these pa- 
rishes requires many more than the above schools, and the inha- 
bita;nts have made great exertions to supply the deficiency. At 
present, we have eight subscription schools, making altogether ten 
.schools in the three united parishes. 

Pour and Parochiul Funds.— The people arc very patient in tri- 
bulation and content with little. The heritors have not been called 
upon for an assessment. But .some of them have contributed li- 
berally on occasions. 

Inn.i. — There are sixteen public-houses in the united parishes, 
though seven would be sufficient. 

Fuel. — Fuel is fast wearing out in the three united parishes.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. DAVID PITCAIRN, MINISTER: 



I. — Topography and Natural HFstory. 
These parishes have retained their present names from time 
immemorial, and nothing satisfactory can be said as to their ety- 
mology. 

Extent, 4-c. — The parish of Evie, which is the most northerly 
of the two, runs from north-west to south-east, about 6 miles in 
length, being very narrow towards the northern extremity, and 
gradually increasing in breadth, till it joins the parish of Ken- 
dall, which is much more compact, and may be estimated to ex- 
tend from 4 to 5 miles square. 

Situation, t-c. — These parishes are situated on what is commonly 
called the mainland of the Orkney Islands. They are bounded on 
the north, by the ocean ; on the north-east, east, and south-east, 
by a sound or frith, which separates them from the islands of En- 
hallow, Rousay, Wyre, Gairsay, and Shapinshay. The southern 
boundary is partly a bay of the sea, called Damsay sound, and 
partly the parish of Firth. To the west of Rendall lies the pa- 
rish of Harray ; and the parish of Birsay meets Evie on the north- 
west. 

Topographical Appearances. — Costa-head forms the northern 
termination of Evie. It is a hill of considerable size and eleva- 
tion, presenting to the ocean a face of bold and precipitous rock. 
From Costa, there is a contiguous range of hill ground, which di- 
vides these parishes from Birsay and Harray. These hills are cover- 
ed with peat moss or heath, mixed with coarse grass. Their outline 
and general aspect is exceedingly tame and uninteresting. In height, 
they are very uniform, and probably not more than from 300 to 400 
feet above the level of the sea. There are also bills of smaller di- 
mension, but of the same character, which intersect the parish of 



EVIE AND RENDALL. 



197 



Rendall ; and the whole of this hill ground, which constitutes by 
far the largest portion of each parish, is undivided common, se- 
parated from the grass and corn lands, by an earthen fence, called 
the Hill Dike. The cultivated ground generally lies on a gentle 
declivity towards the sea shore, and varies in breadth from half a 
mile, to nearly a mile and a halfi in some places. 

The outline of the coast is not marked by any of those deep in- 
dentations which are common throughout Orkney. The beach, 
with the exception of one small bay, of beautiful white shell sand, 
is rocky. In some places, the rocks rise abruptly, forming a kind 
of wall against which the sea dashes ; and there are a few fissures, 
on a small scale, however, which are not destitute of the pictu- 
resque ; but for the most part, the rocky shore is low and flat. There 
is no headland of any importance, except that at Costa, already 
mentioned. The principal bay is at Woodwick, and Gairsay is 
the only island which deserves notice. It is part of the parish of 
Rendall, from which it is separated by a narrow sound. It is 
nearly circular, and in circumference upwards of four miles. The 
ground gradually rises from the shore, and terminates in a beauti- 
ful conical shaped green hill, u[on the summit of which there is a 
cairn of stones ; but at what period carried there, or for what pur- 
pose, there is no tradition. 

Meteorology. — The ordinary range of the barometer is from 28i 
to 30. I have rarely observed it higher or lower. 

Climate. — The climate of these parishes is decidedly damp. 
Besides the moist fogs which are common in spring and the be- 
ginning of summer, it seldom happens that we have a week of 
continued dry weather. There is a great humidity in the 
atmosphere, and the diseases which are prevalent, are pre- 
cisely what might be anticipated from such a climate. Fe- 
verish colds, with dysentery, occur every season; cases of ague 
and consumption occur occasionally, and very few of the people 
who are advanced in life, are free from rheumatic attacks. To 
some constitutions, however, the climate seems to be positively 
beneficial, and many of the inhabitants outlive the allotted erni 
of threescore years and ten. 

Hydrography. — The frith that bounds the parish of Evic on 
the north-east and east, is called Enhallow Sound. It varies in

breadth from two to three miles. There are dangerous shallows 
in the centre. In some places, it becomes suddenly deep, which 
causes what is called in this country a " roast." When the tide 
ebbs over the submarine precipice, the surface is violently agitated, 
even in calm weather, and still more so when the wind is blowinff 
contrary. In this sound, and likewise in that which bounds Ken- 
dall on the east and south-east, the tide ebbs and flows with a 
current at the rate of six to eight miles in stream-tides, and three 
to five miles in neap-tides, per hour. The water is strongly sa- 
line, and so beautifully transparent, that objects lying below can 
be distinctly seen at the depth of three or four fathoms. 

There are numerous springs of fine water in both parishes. 
Most of them are perennial ; but a few flow only in winter. In 
the grass parks adjoining the manse, there is a spring which never 
dries up. The water is chalybeate ; but not so strong as to be 
unpleasant. The marshy ground in the vicinity furnishes evidence 
of a connection with iron, from the scum that settles on the small 
pools, and from the colour given to the drains which have been 
cut. I have not heard of any other spring that can be denomi- 
nated mineral. 

The only lake or loch lies on the boundary line betwixt Evie 
and Birsay. It extends nearly two miles in length, and is about 
half a mile broad. There is a small island in the centre, which 
has been found, by a late decision of the SheriS"- Court, to belong 
to a Birsay proprietor. But it is admitted that one-half of the 
loch is common to Evie. There are plenty of excellent trout in 
it ; and although the depth of water is not great, yet it is of es- 
sential use in driving a meal-mill in summer, when the other mills 
are at a stand. The locality of this loch of Swana is exceedingly 
pleasing; and, were the surrounding hills partially clothed with 
trees, the landscape would merit the title of beautiful. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The mineralogist finds these pa- 
rishes a very unfruitful field. The rocks here are all of the se- 
condary formation, passing from blue slate to white sandstone. 
The colour and consistency of strata difl'er widely ; some being 
almost as hard as flint, and as dark as lava; and others quite soft, 
and of a brownish-grey. The rocks are all in horizontal strata, 
with a gentle dip towards the sea ; and I am not aware of their 
sufi'ering any derangement from cross veins or dikes. Indeed, 
wherever the soil is removed,- either by water-courses or the pur- 



EVIE AND KENDALL 



199 



jiose of quarrying, the uniformity of tlie strata and alio of the dip 
is very marked. 

I have not seen, nor have I been informed, of any organic re- 
mains being discovered, or of any particular spars. Towards the 
north end of Evie there is a vein of pyrites ; but it is too insigni- 
ficant to be worked. 

It is said that at Woodwick, on the southern extremity of Evie, 
there is a considerable deposit of marl. If it really exists, no use 
is made of it. In the neighbourhood of the rivulets, on pieces of 
low ground, there are various deposits of sand and gravel mixed 
with clay and peat-mould, washed down from the hills. Part of 
the ground close to the manse is of this description. 

There is an inexhaustible supply of excellent peat in the va- 
rious valleys which intersect the hills. There are also peat-bogs 
in the low grounds, which might easily be drained. In Kendall 
there is a large valley, which is an unbroken peat-moss. Some 
portions of it are so full of the roots and branches of trees, that 
the people cannot work to advantage. Last summer, there was 
excavated a solid trunk of a tree. It appeared to have been 
of stinted growth, and was chiefly remarkable for its freshness. 
It is interesting to ascertain the fact, that trees, even of puny di- 
mensions, have at some remote period adorned a country, where 
now they can only ie reared in inclosed gardens. 

The soil of these parishes is partly a rich black loam, and 
partly a mixture of clay and sand, resting on blue slaty rock, 
sometimes inclining to sandstone. In Kendall, the soil is gene- 
rally of a lighter and sharper descriptwn than that of Evie. 

Although the whole country is destitute of cover, the 
quantity and variety of small birds is great— starlings, larks, lin- 
nets are the most numerous. Grouse are found on the hill-grounds, 
and snipe in the marshes. As a rara avis, there once was brought 
to me a young water-hen. Sea-fowl, large and small, from the 
heron and the cormorant to the dotterel, abound ; but I am not 
aware of any species existing here, that is not common to other 
parts of Orkney. I have seen lately a very fine specimen of the 
Death's hcadmoth. 

Bdany — The natural grass is full of wild flowers, whicli not 
only give to the pasture-ground the appearance of a beautifully va- 
riegated carpet, but it is probable that this aromatic and medici- 
nal food contributes both to the health of the cattle, and the rich- 
ness of the milk.

Trees there are none, excepting in the manse garden. A few 
apple-trees, planted by a former incumbent, are now bearing; and 
about a dozen more, planted within the last three and four years, 
all on the wall, are promising. Pear-trees planted at the same 
time have grown well to wood, but have neither blossomed nor 
yielded fruit. The cherry-trees of the same age have, for the last 
two seasons, made a tolerable show of blossom, and some fruit set, 
yec we have never had a ripe cherry. These trees having all an 
exposure to the south-south-east, are protected from the winds, 
which are here most blighting. And as the soil in which they are 
planted is good, it is only the want of sunshine that can hinder 
their prosperity. 

Shortly after my settlement in 1830, I laid out apieice of plea- 
sure ground in front of the manse, and planted alders, mountain- 
ash, laburnum, ash, elm, plane, and birch. The situation is ex- 
posed to the west wind, which, even in summer, is here so hurtful 
to vegetation, that it blackens the very nettles and docks. But 
they have struck their roots deep in rich earth, and I have much 
pleasure in observing their progress. Many of the original plants 
died gradually, but beautiful suckers shot up ; and there is now 
• tlie appearance of a shrubbery. The alders and mountain-ash 
seem to thrive best. 

Under this head, it may be mentioned, that all kinds of escu- 
lents, flowers, and shrubs that suit the climate, grow with a re- 
markable luxuriance. 

II. — Civil History. 

The late Sir W. Honeyman, one of the Senators of the Col- 
lege of Justice, was born at the family residence of Aikerness in 
Evie. His extensive possessions throughout Orkney have now all 
passed into the hands of other proprietors ; and the ancient man- 
sion was pulled down about fourteen years ago, to give place to a 
modern farm-house and steading. 

The mother of Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine was of the fomily 
of Halcro, one of the oldest in Orkney, said to be lineally de- 
scended from a Norwegian King, and connected by marriage with 
the Royal House of Scotland. Margaret, the daughter of Hugh 
Halcro was married to the Rev. Henry Erskine of Chirnside, at 
the kirk of Evie, 27lh May 1696.

The Hall of Rendall is at present possessed by Mr John Hal- 
cro, whose small remaining property has escaped the waste of eight 
centuries. 

Land-oivners. — The principal landed proprietors at this time 
are, William Traill, Esq. of Woodwick; John Balfour, Esq.; and 
William Gordon, Esq. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of Rendall were 
lost in consequence of the house, where they were kept, having 
been burnt. There is one old volume of the Evie registers extant, 
but it is quite in tatters. It contains minutes of session from Au- 
gust 1725 to January 1759 ; also registers of births and marriages 
from 1725 to 1802. There is a new volume for the united pa- 
rishes, in which are recorded baptisms from 1802, marriages from 
1814, deaths from 1816, to this date; and since May 1830, the 
minutes of session have also been regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — Under the head of antiquities, may be mentioned 
those circular ruins commonly, though perhaps erroneously, called 
Picts houses. There are no less than nine of them, of different 
sizes and at irregular distances, planted along the shores of Evie and 
Rendall, What was the precise nature of these buildings, it is difficult 
to conjecture. That they were at one period inhabited, seems pro- 
bable, from the quantity of shells still found around them. There 
are also a number of tumuli in Evie, some of which were opened 
in 1818 by the son of a fqrmer minister of the parish. They 
were all found to contain a square open space, formed by four flat 
stones, having one at the bottom and another on the top. These 
holes were from one foot to two feet square, and about 18 inches 
deep. In the bottom of each, were invariably found a quantity of 
ashes, charcoal of wood, and small fragments of burnt bones. 

In the summer of 1832, when taking down a small old farm- 
house at Cottascarth in Rendall, to rebuild it, there fell from a 
hole in the wall 150 pieces of silver coins, which had been wrap- 
ped up in part of a meal sieve, overlaid with a bit of coarse wool- 

prcsents shall come, be it known, that the bearer hereof, Margaret Halcro, lawful 
daughter of the deceased Hugh Ilalero, in the Isle of Weir,;and Margaret Stewart, 
his spouse, hath lived in the parish of Evie from her infancy, in good fame ami re 
port; 19 a discreet, godly young woman, and to our certain knowledge free of all 
scandal, reproach, or blame. Asalso, that she is descended of her i'ather of the house 
o llalcro, which is a very ancient and honourable family in the Orkneys ; he No- 
bleand potent Karl of Airly and Lairds of Dun in Angus ; and by her molher, of 
inc i.aiiM ol l.arscobe in Galloway. In wiuiess whereof, we, the minister and clerk,

len cloth. These coins were chiefly sixpences, shillings, and half- 
crowns of the reigns of Elizabeth, James L, and Charles L, with 
a very few Scotch. It is not unlikely they may have been depo- 
sited in this concealment, during the usurpation of Cromwell. 
They were sold, and the landlord generously allowed his poor te- 
nant to reap the whole benefit of this unexpected treasure. 

Mr Gordon has erected a moderate-sized mansion-house at 
Burgar, where he resides. A central church for both parishes, 
and a parochial school and schoolmaster's house, have been built 
since the publication of the last Statistical Account. 

III. — Population. 

Amount of populatioD in 1789, . 1564 

1811, . 1227 

1821, . 1329 

1831, . 1450— males, 617; fein. 833. 

The great decrease from 1789 to 1811 most probably arose 
from so many men engaging in the array, and especially the navy, 
during the war. At a later period, in several instances, four, five, 
or six small farms were thrown into one, which also tended to di- 
minish the population; and I incline to the opinion, that, a hun- 
dred years ago, the population must have considerably exceeded 
what it was even in 1789, as the registered baptisms were nearly 
one-third more numerous. 

There being neither town nor villages, the people are all dis- 
persed over the country. 

For the last seven years, the yearly average of registered births 
has been 21f ; but a good many parents forget or decline to re- 
gister; of deaths, 14f ; of marriages, 7i. 

Mr Gordon of Outer Evie is the only person of independent 
fortune residing in the parishes. 

There are 10 proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 
and upwards. 

There are 2 persons insane, and 4 more or less fatuous ; 3 fe- 
males are blind. 

Languages. — In the language of the people, there is an inter- 
mixture of Norse words with Scotch and English; but, on the whole, 
they speak more correctly than the peasantry do in other parts of 

• Only when the moilcloti is uscdjjiave the dcallis been registered. The whole 
deaths during the last six years have been about 100 ; and it deserves to be notited, 
as an extraordinary deviation Trom the usual rate of mortality, that the deaths under 
ten years of age, during that time, are only 13.

Scotland. Tlie accent is peculiar, though far from being unplea- 
sant. 

The people are naturally shrewd and sagacious; their character 
is not without defects ; but in many respects, it is very estimable. 
Gross immoralities are not known here. They are quiet and 
peaceable, and remarkable for their pohteness to each other, and 
for their kindness to strangers. They manifest a high respect for 
religion, and, with the exception of a very few, are a regular 
church-going people. 

IV — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Evie and Rendall were originally two pa- 
rishes. It is not known when they were united : but it is suppos- 
ed to have been as early as the Reformation. There was formerly 
a church in each parish ; but both falling into decay, a single 
church was built about the end of the last century in Evie, within 
a mile of the boundary of the two parishes. The church contains 
498 sittings. The number of communicants is about 620. In fa- 
vourable weather, the church is always well attended. The popu- 
lation attached to the Established Church amounts to 1350 : dis- 
senting population, about 100 Secedersand Independents. The 
stipend amounts to L. 154 : the annual value of the glebe may be 
about L. 50. 

Education. — There are one parochial and five other schools in 
the parish. The parochial teacher's salary is L. 30 per annum. 
He exacts no school fees : and about L. 4 of his salary is given to 
a young man for teaching a small number of children in the island 
of Gairsay. The parochial school is situated at Evie. One of 
the non-parochial schools is on the scheme of the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian knowledge. All the people of the parish, of 
proper age, can read. 

Poor and Parochicd Funds. — The average amount of church 
collections for the poor is about L. 1 5 per annum : from tiiortcloth 
dues, &amp;c. L. 1, 17s. The average number of paupers is about 40.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKWALL, SYNOD OF ORKNEY. 

THE REV. ANDREW SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish stretches along the wind- 
ing shores of the SounJ of Holme. On the north, it is bounded by 
the parishes of Kirkwall, St Andrews, and Deerness. It is four 
miles distant from Kirkwall. Its length from west to east is about 
six miles; its breadth from north to south, betwixt one and two. 
At the west entrance of the Sound is the promontory of Howquoy 
Head ; at the east entrance is the promontory of Roseness. 
Nearly in the middle of the Sound, stands the island of Lambholme, 
about three miles in circumference, which belong-s to this parish. 
Betwixt this island and the Mainland, there is a pretty secure an- 
chorage ground, called Holme Sound. 

The soil is in general light, thin, and loamy. The climate, 
though humid, is on the whole salubrious. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land owners. — The principal land-owner is Alexander Graeme, 
Esq. of Grajmehill, who possesses nearly the whole of the parish. 
He does not reside in the parish.

Fisheries. — Cod and herring-fishing are carried on by the peo- 
ple of the parish in Holme Sound, and the adjacent sea. These 
fishings, however, have been very unproductive for some years 
past. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical Estate. — The stipend amounts to L. 157, — of 
which L. 97, 4s. lOd. is from parsonage teinds. The value of the 
glebe is about L. 4 per annum. 

Education. — Tliere is only one school in the parish, the paro- 
chial. Salary of the master L. 26 per annum. He has also a 
croft worth about L. 7 per annum. The parochial school was es- 
tablished here, as in most other parishes of Orkney, only about 
thirty-five years ago. Rural employment of one kind or another 
occupies the youth from seven years of age upwards, during spring, 
summer, and autumn, — and during that long vacation, they forget 
what they had acquired in the previous winter. 

Poor. — Average number of poor on the roll, 15. Average 
amount of church collections in their behalf, about L.2; average 
amount of other voluntary contributions, about L. 5, 10s. ; of mor- 
tifications, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. L. 9, 10s.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100166">ORKNEY</name>.</head> 
<p>

Name.— OacADES is the ancient name of these islands : under 
which, they are mentioned by Pomponius Mela. It is probably 
derived from Cape Orcas, which Ptolemy mentions as a promon- 
tory in Caithness. Whether the modern name of Orkney is a cor- 
ruption of the old one, or has a different etymology, we" shall not 
enquire. Previous to the passing of the Reform Bill, it formed a 
complete county, and sent a representative to Parliament. But 
that act united Orkney and Zetland as one county ; and the latter 
cluster of islands, which formerly was not represented, now unites 
with Orkney in returning a member. Orkney and Zetland, how- 
ever, are so unconnected in other respects, and so dissimilar, that 
this notice refers only to the Orkney group. 

Extent. — The county of Orkney extends between the parallels 
58° 44' and 59° 24' north latitude, and between 2" 25' and 3° 20' 
west longitude. It is separated from Caithness by the Pentland 
Firth, which is about 12 miles broad, and thence stretching out 
to the north, it separates the Atlantic from the German Ocean. 

Its population in 1831 was 28,047, and its ParJiamentary con- 
stitutency in 1840 was 381. 

Topographi/. — There is much waste ground, and many hills in 
Orkney ; but, in general, it cannot be called mountainous. The 
Ward Hill of Hoy, which i.f the highest, is about 1600 feet above 
the level of the sea, and other hills in that island are nearly as 
high ; but none of the other islands have hills of any considerable 
height. A few of these islands are flat, and Sanday is particularly 
low; so that, at the distance of some miles, the land seems to be 
sunk beneath the waves, and ihe more elevated houses appear like 
solitary pillars in the ocean. The great extent of coast must be 
obvious, when we mention, that the number of these islands is 67. 
Of these 27 are inhabited, and the smaller ones, called holms, are 
used for pasture, &amp;c.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON ORKNEY. 



207 



III some places, the coast is flat and sandy ; in- others, bold and 
rocky, forming a range of perpendicular or overhanging precipices 
that resist the encroachment of the waves, while the lower and 
softer portions of land have been swept away by their fury. As 
in most other parts of the world, these precipices are highest on 
the west side, those of Hoy reaching the height of 1000 feet 
perpendicular. They present sublime scenery, and magnificent 
exhibitions of strata for the geologist. They are frequented by a 
variety of sea-fowl, which build, in some places, as closely as pi- 
geons in a dove-cot, on the harder strata that protrude beyond the 
softer, with remarkable regularity. 

The gradual destruction of the precipices gives rise to nume- 
rous caves and fissures. These add greatly to the interest of the 
scene, which, when the waves dash against them, is one of the 
grandest in nature. 

This cluster of islands is generally divided into the Mainland or 
Pomona, which contains more than half of the population, viz. 
15,787, — the North Isles containing 8360, — and the South Isles, 
4700. 

Meteordlogy. — It will be seen, from the tables inserted in 
the account of Sandwick, that the mean annual temperature 
of Orkney is AQ ; whence it appears, that neither are our win- 
ters so cold, nor our summers so hot, as those of places where 
the mean annual temperature is much the same as ours, 
such as Applegarth in Dumfries-shire, Vide account of that 
parish. Again, comparing our table with that kept for nine 
years by Mr Hutchison, in Glasgow, where the moan annual 
temperature is 49.75, or above that of Orkney, I find that the 
temperature of November, December, and January is almost the 
same in both places ; but that of Glasgow gradually rises above ours 
in spring. In May, June, July, and August, it is 7° above ours, and 
fall s again in September and October. This is what might be an- 
ticipated from tlie insular situation of Orkney ; the temperature of 
the deep surrounding ocean not being quickly changed, and the 
uniformity of its temperature producing such a uniformity near is 
shores, that excessive heat, and long-continued frost, are equally 
rare. This arrangement may be pleasant or favourable to animal 
life, but it is far from favourable to vegetation, as iho luxm-iance 
of our connnon crops depcMids on the temperature of three or four 
months in summer, while they are on the ground, and not at all on 
that of the rest of the year; and if we could gain a few degrees

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



of temperature in these months, by sacrificing as many in winter, 
our agriculturists would greatly gain by the exchange. The above- 
mentioned tables also show, that the mean height of the barome- 
ter for twelve years, at the manses of Stromness and Sandwick, 
was 29.640. 

There are no aqueous meteors peculiar to Orkney ; but I may 
mention a kind of cloud which I have observed four times, cover- 
ing a considerable part of the sky, hanging down like a dark dra- 
pery, and each time followed, within twelve hours, by a storm. 
Water spouts are not common. 

The west and south-west winds are thought to be the strongest 
and most prevalent ; but, for about two years, the south-east has 
prevailed very much, as may be seen from the following table, show- 
ing the number of days that the wind blew from the different quar- 
ters each month, during the year 1840.

Ht/chography. — This country is bounded, as we have men- 
tioned, by the Pentland Firth and the Atlantic and German oceans : 
it is also intersected by their waters, which form firths or sounds, 
through which the stream-tide runs at the rate of nine miles an 
hour. The tides are irregular and very perplexing and dangerous 
to strangers ; but they facilitate the intercourse between the dif- 
ferent islands, carrying those who know how to take advantage of 
them, with railway speed ; so that even with a contrary wind, a to- 
lerable passage may be made, when the tide is favourable. 

In most place.=, there are springs of good water; and chalybe- 
ate ones are not uncommon, flowing from the granite, clay flag, or 
sandstone. There are numerous lochs. That of Stenness is by far 
the most extensive, being about fourteen miles in circumference. 

Geology and Mincraloffi/.— There is a district of gra-

nite and gneiss, about six miles long, and one broad, the south 
extremity of which is in the island of Grsemsay, from which it 
passes in a northerly direction, through the town and parish of 
Stromness; and the other end is seen in a precipice, on the south- 
west coast of Sandwick. Its range, however, is not continuous. 
In one place, it passes into mica slate, containing garnets ; and 
in the road above Edinburgh Park, hornblende rock is found. 

The other rocks of which Orkney is principally composed, are 
classed by geologists as of the old red sandstone formation, which 
embraces the conglomerate, certain greywacke slates, bituminous 
claystones, yellow and red sandstones, &amp;c. 

The conglomerate forms a belt around the gneiss, from 50 to 
100 yards thick, — which contains portions of the primitive rock of 
various sizes imbedded ; and the farther from the primitive rock the 
strata are, they have less of these portions or coarse slate till they 
gradually pass into the schist, which occupies more space than all 
the other rocks together. It is argillaceous, siliceous, or calcareous ; 
but the first prevails most. The strata generally dip westward, at an 
angle about 20°, particularly in the west mainland, and the nearest 
islands ; but in some places, there seem to have been so many forces 
at work, elevating and distorting the strata, that, in a short space, 
they dip in all directions. What is in immediate contact with the 
east side of the conglomerate, in some places, dips slightly eastward. 

In two places, this is quarried as an inferior roofing slate, and 
is of the same formation as the paving stone of Caithness. Al- 
most all the houses and dikes in Orkney are built of it. When 
much weathered, as on the precipices at the west coast, the har- 
der portions protrude, and form the figured stones much noticed 
by the older writers. 

In a few places, the calcareous strata are burnt for lime, but 
not to a great extent. In others, the strata are bituminous on the 
surface, or have small cavities filled with soft bitumen, and occa- 
sionally glance-coal; or there are numerous nodules, and veins of 
Lydian stone or chert. In the West Mainland, these strata are 
'■-v--|uc-niij- intersected by whin dikes, the thickest of which is ten 
feet wide, and which run due west. These, and veins of py- 
rites, crumble and destroy the strata near to them, thus giving 
rise to fissures of various kinds in the precipices. It is in these 
strata that fossil organic remains so frequently occur, general- 
ly of fish, more rarely of vegetables, and both may be seen on 

ORKNEY. O

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON TflE 



the same specimen. The ichthyolites prove our schists to be iden- 
tical with those of Caithness, and of some places south of -the 
Moray Frith. 

Sandstone, some hundred yards thick, lies close to the primi- 
tive rock on the coast of Sandwick. Veins of galena, associated 
with heavy spar, stromnite, quartz in veins or rock crystal, calca- 
reous spar, iron, and copper pyrites, are found in these strata. 
Upon these rests the upper sandstone, which is now considered 
as one of the rocks of the old red sandstone formation, though it 
was formerly classed among the newer sandstones. It is very soft, 
and generally of a lightgrey colour; but in Eday it is red. Our 
highest hills are formed of it. In Hoy, it contains a fine vein 
of mansanese; and another of brown hematite, or iron ore, is 
found there. Trap rocks also occur, as greenstone, basalt, por- 
phyry, or amygdaloid ; most frequently as whin dikes through the 
clay flag, but also through the granite on its north extremity, and, 
I think, through the upper sandstone of Hoy hill, above the green ' 
of Gair. One of these dikes also bounds, on its south-east side, 
a mass of amygdaloid in Walls, extending about 300 yards along 
the coast. A large bed of trap occurs in the west hills of Hoy, 
more than 100 feet thick, and extending for several miles; and in 
its neighbourhood, at Rackwick, is a fine vein of fibrous gypsum. 

The alluvial deposits are neither extensive nor interesting. 
Some rolled blocks of granite are found, far from their original po- 
sition. There are many collections of sand in the neighbourhood 
of sandy bays. There is abundance of clny, and in most parish- 
es, of peat moss; in many places, marl ; and in some, bog iron ore. 
In the peat mosses, roots of large trees, hazel-nuts, deer's horns, 
&amp;c. are frequently found, showing that forests formerly existed 
there. 

The decomposition of the clay fl;ig makes clay the predominant 
natural soil ; but in some places, there is pure sand, and these are 
mixed in various proportions; but the best soil is a ricli black loam. 

2:00/0/7/.— Orkney is particularly rich in sea birds and fish. Seals 
are pretty common, and otters rare. A few pairs of both species of 
eagle annually build in the precipices. There are several species 
of hawk and owl ; and grouse are numerous on our heath-covered 
hills. We have also the great northern, and other species of diver ; 
great numbers of gulls of different species ; a few swans in winter, 
;md some wild geese in spring, and many species of duck all the 
year; also several kinds of grebe; and one pair of the great auk

used to build here. There are many other rare birds of passage, 
or occasional visitors, which need not be specified. Several spe- 
cies of whale, indeed all that inhabit the North Sea, have either 
run ashore on these islands, or been seen in the neighbourhood, 
and even a sea-horse from Greenland has wandered hither. All 
other species of fish found around the north of Scotland, are also 
found here, with the exception of the salmon, for which we have 
no inviting rivers. 

Butterflies and winged insects are not numerous ; but there is a 
great variety of sea insects, and molluscous animals, some of which 
have not yet been honoured with a name in the catalogues, or a 
place in the collections, of naturalists. Messrs Forbes and Good- 
sir have lately brought some of them into notice, with the Ne- 
ritina flaviatilis, which has not yet been found in other parts of 
Scotland. Lobsters and crabs are abundant, and the former are 
sent to the London market. Horses, cows, and sheep are general- 
ly of a small size. 

BoUim/.—\l will be seen in the Account of Sandwick, that the 
Flora of Orkney contains 610 species of plants, which are probably 
more than might be expected in its high latitude; ia3 of these 
are sea-weeds, many of which are very beautiful, and some very 
minute. The only Orkney plant new to Britain, is the Cliara 
aspera. A few may be mentioned here, which are either rare 
or beautiful ; as Primula Scotica, and Primula elatior, Scilla 
veria, Dijitalis purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Cochleai "in JJa- 
nica, Epilohium angustifolium, Senecio viscosus, Thlaspi ar- 
vense. The following are principally Alpine plants, and are 
found in Hoy, and some of them there only ; Vaccinium irnjr. 
alias, Juniperus communis, Narthecium ossifragum, Hypericum 
elodes, Dryas octopetala, Rhodiola rosea, Saxifraya oppusitifolia, 
and S. hypnoides, S. aizoides, S. caspitosa, Silene acaulis, Solidago 
viryaurea. Arbutus alpiua, A. uva ursi. Azalea procumheiis, Dro- 
scra lomjifiUa, D. rotundifolia, Pyrola rotundifoUn, Scirpus pau- 
c.ifloruH ; also several cryptogamous plants, wliich need not be spe. 
cified. 

There are no forests in Orkney ; and the climate seems 
very unfavourable to the growth of trees ; but the few plantations 
winch have lately been tried, succeed so well in sheltered situa- 
tions, as to encourage the hope that more extensive plantations 
would thrive in the most sheltered inland valleys. The trees that 
succeed best, are the plane, ash, mountain-ash, cjlrn, willow, &amp;c. 



212 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 

Civil History. — The ancient history of Orkney is very interest- 
ing; and it is said that " there are probably few districts of the 
same size in the world, about which more has been written." In 
" Thoughts on Orkney and Zetland," will be found a list of nearly 
fiftyprinted volumes, and fifteen manuscripts, relating solely orprin- 
cipally to these islands, besides a greater numberof volumes contain- 
ing passages relating to them ; but for the ancient history, we shall 
only refer to the Orkneyinga Saga, and Tortaeus' Orcades ; and 
for more modern accounts, to Wallace's description in 1693, and 
Barry's history, 4to, in 1805, which is the most comprehensive 
that we have. From these accounts, it appears that the first per- 
manent inhabitants of Orkney probably came from Caithness ; 
that the Picts retained possession of it, for a considerable time, 
and Belus, Gaiusi and Gunnas, are mentioned as three of their 
kings, but they were conquered by Harold Harfager, King of 
Norway, who arrived A. d. 876, and on his return to Norway, in- 
vested Ronald, Count of Merca, with the government of Orkney. 
It was thus held by a long line of about thirty Scandinavian Earls, 
whose practice it was to fit out fleets, and sail during summer to 
neighbouring places, which they plundered, or laid under contri- 
bution, — so that they were generally known and feared, through- 
out Great Britain, and were also so much respected, that they 
intermarried even with the royal families of Scotland and Norway. 
After them, the 

" St Clairs held princely sway, 
O'er isle and islet, strait and bay ;" 

Earl Henry Sinclair having obtained a renewal of his investiture 
from Norway in 1379. This rule of Scandinavian Earls was 
finally terminated in 1468, when Orkney and Zetland were 
handed over to James III. in pledge for the portion of the 
Princess Margaret of Denmark, whom he married; and ever 
since, they have remained politically united to Scotland. Af- 
ter this, the Earldom was several times annexed to the Crown, 
not to be alienated again, and as often granted to some one of 
the nobility, or sons of the King, till a redeemable mortgage to 
James, Earl of Morton, was rendered irredeemable in 1742, and 
in 1766 he sold his estate for L. 60,000 to Sir Lawrence Dundas, 
the great grandfather of the present Earl of Zetland, who is the 
greatest proprietor in Orkney. The Crown has also a consider- 
able estate here. Besides these, there are few who have a rental of 
Iv.lOOO a-vear; and in some parishes, so great is the subdivision 



COUNTY OF OUKNEY. 



213 



of property, that a great part of it is occupied by udallers, who 
possess about teu acres or less of arable ground. 

Christianity seems to have been introduced here by St Co- 
lumba so early as a. d. 570 ; but it was again introduced by Olaus 
Friguesson, King of Norway, a. d. 1000. 

Jntiquities. — What has just been said on the history of Orkney 
will throw some light on its remaining monuments of antiquity, 
for descriptions of which we must refer to the Accounts of the pa- 
rishes in which they occur ; but we may briefly notice, that to the 
Picts, or those who inhabited it, previous to the arrival of the 
Scandinavians, are ascribed the Picts' houses, such as that of 
Quanterness, near Kirkwall ; the elf-stones, tumuli, or bury- 
ing-places, such as have lately been opened in Sandvvick ; the 
standing-stones of Stenness, and the broughs, one of which was 
lately opened 'in Evie; and either to them or their successors 
we owe the dwarfie stone of Hoy, and cromlechs, or altars. To 
the Scandinavians are ascribed some graves, in which armour 
and various articles are found, — and the pundler and bismar, 
which are rude instruments still used for weighing; and it is well 
known, that they erected the stately Cathedral of St Magnus, the 
Bishop's Palace, and Castle of Kirkwall. But the Earl's palace 
there and that at Birsay were built after the annexation to the 
Crown of Scotland, and, it is believed, also the Castle of Noth- 
land, in Westray. 

Population. — The population of the county had increased ten 
percent during the ten years previous to 1831, and 15 per cent, 
during the ten years preceding that, probably owing, in a great 
rneasurj, to improvements in agriculture, and the extension of the 
fisheries. All speak English. The customs and habits of the peo- 
ple are not very different from those of others similarly situated. 
Their dress, in general, is plain, and their food as poor as need be. 
If low in the scale of earthly comforts, they stand high as an intel- 
lectual, moral, and religious people. And I believe that crime is 
less common here than in most parts of Great Britain. 

Ayriculture. — In this department, considerable progress has been 
made of late, but it is still in a very backward state. The single 
stilted plough is now, itidced, a curiosity, and the common kind is 
introduced, with iron-tecthed harrows, rollers, &amp;c. which are de- 
cided improvements. A great part of the ground is occupied by 
tenants at will, in farms of not above ten acres of arable land, and 
observe no rotation, but an alternation of oats and bear, part of

GENERAL 013SE U VATIONS ON THE 



an acre only being planted with potatoes for family use. Under this 
system, as might be supposed, the soil is so full of weeds, that the 
crop of grain is frequently choked, and the field is more pleas- 
ing to the botanist than the farmer. There are, however, many 
bright exceptions to this rule, too numerous to be named ; butamong 
our greatest proprietors, Mr Pollexfen of Cairston, Mr Baikie of 
Tankerness, Mr Heddie of Melsetter, and Mr Traill of Wood- 
wick, are the most distinguished. An enterprizing farmer from 
the south, also, has lately given a stimulus to agriculture, — so that 
there is a prospect of more extensive improvements being speedily 
introduced. Many obstacles, however, prevent these improvements 
from being generally adopted bythecottagers, such as, want of capi- 
tal and encouragement, defective leases, insufficient accommodation, 
&amp;c. The common breeds of sheep and cattle are very small ; and for 
some years, there was little encouragement to rear or improve them, 
but the present great demand and high prices, with easy access to 
the southern markets by steam, are inducing many to try improved 
breeds. 

Quarries. — There is no quarry of consequence; but there is 
abundance of our common clay-stone and flag for building in 
every parish. Some of this, resembling the Caithness paving- 
stone, has been polished and exported for southern markets, and 
also some of the Stromness granite ; but hitherto, these have not 
been extensively quarried. 

Fisheries. — The herring and cod fisheries have increased very 
much, of late. At the commencement of this century, they were 
entirely neglected; but already they are so extended, as to bring 
in more money than the kelp used to do, even when the largest 
quantity was manufactured ; and they promise to be still farther 
extended. These may be considered as the substitute for kelp, 
and though they do not compensate ihe kelp proprietors for the 
destruction of that manufacture, yet it is believed that the pro- 
prietors will ultimately receive some benefit indirectly from the 
lisheries. During the last three years, the average number of 
sloops engaged in the cod-fishery was 18; and the quantity of 
cod cured each year, 381 tons; while the average number of her- 
ring-boats belonging to Orkney has been 724; and of herrings 
cured on shore and afloat, 42,073 barrels. These are sold by 
the fishers to the curers at about 10s. per cran or barrel ; and the 
cod bring as much per cwt., producing L. 24,852 per annum, — 



COUNTY OF ORKNEY. 



215 



whereas the largest quantity of kelp ever made in one year  1826 
was 3500 tons, which, at L.7 per ton, would produce L. 24,500, 
Manufactures. — The principal manufacture carried on, is that 
of straw-plait for ladies' bonnets ; in which about 2000 girls are 
constantly employed, and almost all our young women, and some 
of the married, do more or less, in the intervals of their other oc- 
cupations. 

The building of boats, and making of sails, nets, and cordage, 
may also be mentioned ; and there are two licensed distillers at 
Kirkwall, and one at Stromness. 

Navigatum and Trade. — In 1833, there were 78 vessels belong- 
ing to Orkney, carrying 4049 tons, and 319 seamen ; and probably 
the number has since increased. 

The following table shows the sums received in Orknovin 1833,

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



sailing packets go, about once a month, between Leithand each of the 
two towns. We have now a daily post to the south, and a post-gig 
daily travels between Kirkwall and Strorjiness, which carries pas- 
sengers; other vehicles also go occasionally. The public road 
between these two places is about fifteen miles lung, and pretty 
good ; and there is a considerable extent of as good road in other 
parts of the Mainland, The principal harbours, and the most fre- 
quented by shipping, are those of Stromness and Long Hope, but 
there are many bays besides, in which vessels frequently take shel- 
ter ; and at the former of these places, there is a patent slip for re- 
pairing them. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Till 1832, there were six clergymen in each 
of the threepresbyteriesin the synod of Orkney ; but since that time, 
five more have been added by a disjunction of two parishes, and by 
two Government churches, one on the Royal bounty, and one aided 
by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. There is still, 
however, much need of several more ; for in some cases, one clergy- 
man has two or three parishes under bis charge, and as many 
churches, so that he can only preach in each of his parishes once 
every two or three weeks, which is an evil that cries loudly for a 
remedy. There are sixteen Dissenting ministers of different sects, 
but most of them of the United Associate. Schools are esta- 
blished in all the parishes, and all the young are taught to read, 
and many of them to write. Sabbath schools are also in general 
operation. There are good public libraries in each of the towns, 
both for the higher and lower classes, and similar institutions in 
most of the country parishes. There is an evident improvement 
in the conduct of the people since they have enjoyed increased 
facilities, of education. Besides the usual religious, charitable, 
and other kinds of Societies, there is an " Orkney Natural His- 
tory Society," which has a museum in Stromness. 

The principal fairs are the I-ammas fair at Kirkwall, and one be- 
ginning on the first Tuesday of September at Stromness: and there 
are numerous cattle fairs in difTerent parishes.

ADDITION TO THE ACCOUNT OF HOLME AND 

PAPLAY.</head> 
<p>
BY THE REV. ANDREW SMITH, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 
" The parish of Holm," says Mr Vedder in his Orcadian Sket- 
ches, " is perhaps one of the most beautiful in the Orcadian archi- 
pelago. It slopes gently to the ' sweet south,' and is protected 
from the influence of the northern blast by a range of heath-clad 
hills, sufficiently high for this purpose, without being high enough 
to retain their snowy coverings on the return of spring. A consi- 
derable number of limpid rivulets meander from the heights to the 
shore, giving an air of fertility and freshness to the scene, — while 
the shore itself is laved by one of the noblest friths that can 
be conceived — rushing to and from the German Ocean with tre- 
mendous velocity, and with a noise, "should the wind blow in an ad- 
verse direction, ten thousand times louder than the fall of Lodore, 
so admirably described by Southey. Where, indeed, can there be 
a greater difference than between the surplus water of a puny 
mountain-lake falling from an elevation of some forty or fifty feet, 
and the illimilable unfathomable Atlantic urging its restless course 
through a narrow strait, chafed and maddened at intervals by rock, 
islet, and headland ; while the fierce east wind sweeps o'er its agi- 
tated surface, making the white billows take even a vertical direc- 
tion, as if they would brave the very heavens." 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Persons. — Under this head, the family of Graeme, de- 
scendants of Bishop Gra3me, who occupied the see of Orkney from 
1615 to 1638, may be mentioned as havingbeen uniformly kind and 
indulgent landlords to the people of this parish. It is stated in the 
old Account, that they had resided at their family seat of Graames- 
hall, for a hundred years, and cherished a spirit of industry among 
their tenantry ; that the ancient rents of the farms had never been 
raised ; and that, though no leases were given, many of the tenants 
living at the time that the Account was drawn up,held thesamefarms 
that had been occupied by their forefathers for several generations. 
Mr Patrick Grteme, who was sheriff-depute of the county about the

year 1770, particularly encouraged among his tenants the culture 
of flax, which was consequently more attended to in Holme at that 
time, than in any other part of Orkney. He furnished them with 
linseed gratis — had them instructed in all the particulars relating to 
the cultivation, manipulation, and manufacture of it into linen cloth. 
Their families were thus furnished with what is much wanting in the 
present day, profitable employment in the winter season and in other 
intervals of agricultural labour, — the female domestics spinning 
it into yarn fit for weaving into cloth. It is also stated, that, for 
many years previous to the date of the old Account, 1795, 
there had been annually exported of such cloth, woven and bleach- 
ed, in the parish, 20,000 yards, which always brought a good price 
at Newcastle and other English markets. By the profits hence 
derived, the tenantry of Holme became distinguished above their 
neighbours for industry and wealth. But, on the death of their 
benevolent landlord, who was suddenly cut off in the prime of 
life, their exertions in this branch of industry gradually relaxed, 
until their culture of flax and their linen manufacture were en- 
tirely given up. He was succeeded in the property by his bro- 
ther, Admiral Alexander Graeme, who distinguished himself in 
the action with the Dutch fleet off the Dogger Bank, where he 
lost his right arm in the cause of his country. Though he did not 
reside on his estate, having no turn for rural affairs, yet his tenants 
always experienced from him the greatest kindness and liberality. 
Alexander Sutherland Grasme, Esq. having lately succeeded to 
the property, is, as before stated, the principal land -owner in the 
parish,— the estate of Graimeshall being nineteen-twentieths of 
the whole. 

Parish Rei/isterx. — The register of births and marriages begins 
in 1654. The record of the kirk-session begins in 1673. It 
may be mentioned as evidence of the heterogeneous mixture of 
Episcopacy and Presbytery, which continued for several years in 
this synod, — that it is recorded of Mr George Tod, December 
11th 1681, and of Mr James Graham, F'ebruary 26th 1688, that 
they " were transplanted by the bishop and presbytery from their 
former charges to the kirk of Holm, as their presentation, institu- 
tion, and induction thereto bear." 

Mill. — There is but one mill, driven by water, to which the 
tenants are astrictcd, paying the usual proportions of multure, — 
a twelfth part for oats, and a sixteenth for bear. There is no kiln

ADDITION TO THE ACCOUNT OP 



at this mill, nor, I believe, at any other mill in the county, — but a 
kiln is an appendage to every farm-house and also to every manse. 
III. — Population. 
It is stated in the old Account that, " although there are up- 
wards of fifty farmers who pay from L. 6 to L. 12 Sterling of 
yearly rent, and'who have brought up from five to ten children of 
both sexes, yet there are not four of them who have the assistance 
of a son at home of twenty years of age. From fifteen to that age, 
the youths, from a disposition to leave their native country, take to 
a sea-faring life, and most of them never return," and it is added, 
that " the females give material assistance in farm-work." The 
case is much the same at present. It is to be observed, however, 
that this continual emigration of the young men proceeds not 
merely from a restless disposition which disinclines them to settle 
at home, but it is with them a case of necessity— there being no 
employment in the farm for them. Most of the youth have 
no ther means of living but engaging as hands on board of 
coasting-vessels and revenue-cutters, or vessels trading to the Bal- 
tic and foreign countries, and few of them ever return. The po- 
pulation must in this way be, at least, kept stationary. 

Every householder, both tenant and cottar, has a share of a 
fishing-boat, by which he supplies his family with fish of various 
kindsr The coal-fish, termed here, when young, sillocks, and 
when a year old, keuths, furnish both agreeable food and excel- 
lent oil, and are found quite at hand in the Sound, a little off from 
the shore, most part of the year ; and on going out of the 
Sound, a mile or two eastward of Roseness, there is found abun- 
dance of haddocks, cod, ling, skate, flounders, halibut, &amp;c. 

It is only with a view to domestic provision, however, that any 
encrage in fishing. None are fishers by profession. They are a 
community of small farmers, with such a proportion of the ordi- 
nary handicrafts among them of shoemakers, tailors, smiths, car- 
penters, &amp;c. as can find sufficient employment. 

IV. — Industry. 
Jgriculture.— From the period at which the old Account was 
drawn up 1795 to 1829, agriculture had been making slow advan- 
ces beyond a rude state. The plough with one stilt-the harrows 
with wooden teeth, had gradually given place to better implements. 
But the sowina of oats and bear in uninterrupted succession, without 
any alternation of green crop, except a trilling extent of potatoes, 
continued still to be the general practice. A change of seed was 



HOLME AND PAPLAY. 



221 



never thought of, — nay, the worst of the grain produced on the 
farm was selected as the most proper to be sown. The produce 
accordingly was just what might be expected from such husban- 
dry, — the average produce being three times the quantity of seed 
sown for oats, and five times the quantity for bear. The fields 
were everywhere overrun with weeds, both annual and perennial. 

But since 1828, two occurrences have taken place, and that 
almost simultaneously, which promise to effect in due time a ma- 
terial alteration for the better in the agricultural industry of this 
parish. In the above year, Mr Grgerae's property was surveyed, 
cleared of run-rig, and laid out into a considerable number of 
forms of various sizes ; and whereas hitherto, the tenants had, vyith 
only one or two exceptions, been all tenants at will, they were now 
admitted to leases of fifteen years. For the first five years, they 
were to hold at nearly the old rent, and then a small rise was to 
take place, but with liberty then to quit ; another small rise at 
the end of the tenth year, with liberty then also to quit. They 
were restricted from flaying the surface of the hill-ground, — a cus- 
tom which had long prevailed among them for making up their 
compost dunghills. They were bound to a strict observance of 
winter herding, and to have a certain proportion of their farms re- 
gularly under green crop and grass. A plan of the estate was made 
out, which shows that there are 2830 imperial acres divided into 
farms, and 4767 acres of undivided common. 

The other occurrence alluded to, was the introduction of steam 
navigation, which will prove an effectual remedy for what has hi- 
therto been a principal obstacle to agricultural improvement in Ork- 
ney — distance from the best markets for the ready and profitable 
disposal of stock. Since 1836, a powerful steam vessel has plied 
weekly for eight months of the year betwixt Leith and Kirkwall. 
In consequence of this accommodation, the farmer in this quarter, 
who formerly depended on the casual visits of drovers from the 
south, for the sale of their cattle at an inferior price, can now ship 
them on board the steamer, on the morning she sails from Kirk- 
wall, and after a run of thirty-six hours, have them ready to be 
shown in the Edinburgh market. 

The average rent of land in the parish is 10s. per acre. The an- 
nual quantity of bear grown in the parish may be averaged at 785 
bolls of 16 stones Dutch. Annual quantity of oats, 585 bolls same 
weight. 



222 



ADDITION TO Tini ACCOUNT OF 



The number of acres in grass is 829 ; the number sown with 
turnip, 65; the number planted with potatoes, 96. 

The total rent of the parish may be estimated at L. 876. 

The price of raw bear, on an average of the last seven years, 
per quartep-of 348 lb. imperial, is 16s. 7d. The price of oats on 
the same average, per quarter of 184 lb. imperial, is 7s. 6d. Each 
quarter of bear or of oats is eight bushels measure. 

Of the bear, about 170 bolls are payable in kind to the Crown. 
A quantity is disposed of to the distillers in Kirkwall, and a part 
of it in malt, to the brewers there. The remainder is reserved for 
the use of the parishioners for seed. There has never been much 
oatmeal sold out of the parish. 

The bear here mentioned is what is commonly called big, an 
inferior sort of barley, and the oats are of the small black or grey 
kind. These inferior grains have been hitherto preferred, the for- 
mer on account of its ripening earlier than barley, to avoid the 
hazard of a late harvest, and the black oat, on account of its not 
being so liable to be shaken as the white kind, by those boisterous 
winds which occasionally prevail here in autumn. But there is no 
reason to doubt that, were the land once brought into good heart 
by improved modes of farming — both barley and red oats, which 
are less liable to be shaken than the white, and at the same time 
are a stronger grain, might be successfully cultivated. 

The soil, in general throughout the parish, is of a kind that rea- 
dily admits of improvement, especially by lime, which has never 
yet been applied to it being, for the greater part, a light black 
loam, in some places mixed with sand, and in others having a mix- 
ture of clay. But, whatever be the variety of the surface, the bot- 
tom is uniformly of a porous nature, so that whatever quantity of 
rain may fall, it soon disappears, and of course there is no marshy 
ground, nor stagnant surface water to be seen throughoutthe parish. 

From two to three tons of turnip seed grown in the parish have, 
of late, been annually exported to Edinburgh and other places, for 
which the seedsmen have readily allowed the highest current prices, 
on account of its superior quality. This is a new and quite un- 
looked for article of profitable produce to the Orkney farmer. 
Rye-grass seed sown in Orkney is equally prized by seedsmen. 

The excellence of the turnip seed naturally arises from the 
peculiar suitableness of the soil and climate to the cultivation of 
this root, which, in several instances, has succeeded here, when it 
has failed in countries further south. Here it is not subject o 



HOLME AND P AP LAY. 



223 



the black-fly, nor any other destructive insect. It often grows to 
the size of 12 lb. or 14 lb. ; and more than thirty tons have been pro- 
duced on an acre. 

Nor are the soil and climate less favourable to the production 
of the potato, which here has not yet been infested with the dis- 
ease called the curl, so frequently injurious to this root in the 
south ; and where the soil is in good heart, it has yielded from 
thirty to forty fold. The planting of this root is found to be the 
readiest way to bring waste and barren ground into tillage. 

No less peculiarly well qualified are the soil and climate for the 
production of the artificial grasses, red, white, and yellow clover. 
Rib and rye grass, with some other kinds have been cultivated most 
successfully for green food, while they have also yielded a plenti- 
ful quantity of hay. From land that will produce luxuriant crops 
of the above roots and grasses, there may also be expected, under 
a proper mode of management, corresponding crops of those kinds 
of grain which have been found best adapted to the soil and cli- 
mate. The observation may be extended to flax, which, as has 
been already stated, was for several years cultivated in this parish 
with great success, and the manufacture of which into cloth fur- 
nished useful employment to female industry, which, at the pre- 
sent time, is much wanted. The same observation may also be 
extended to hemp, to which the soil that produces flax may be 
presumed to be equally favourable. The raising of it might also 
supply employment to several additional hands, in preparing and 
manufacturing it into ropes, sails, and nets. 

About forty years ago, the comnaon Orkney breed of cattle was 
the only kind generally reared in the parish. But of late years 
this breed had been considerably improved by the introduction of 
the West Highland or Dunrobin bull. And a more considerable 
improvement is now expected by means of crosses with the Tees- 
water or short-horned breed. 

A bull of this breed was introduced here, about two years and 
a-half ago. The calves of the first cross betwixt this bull and 
Orkney and Dunrobin cows advanced so quickly in size and con- 
dition, in the course of twelve months, that they were readily sold 
at nearly L. 6 per head ; a price which commonly was with diffi- 
culty obtained for the best Orkney and Dunrobin breed of 
four years old. The introduction of the Teeswater breed, either 
pure, or as crosses, has in various places tended much both to in- 



224 



ADDITION TO THE ACCOUNT OF 



crease the size of cattle, and also to quicken their fattening for 
the butcher. 

Prices.— It is stated in the old Account, that, " during the pre- 
vious thirty years, provisions were tripled in price, but not improved 
in quality," and that in 1762, a good mart cow could be purchased 
for 15s. When a whole carcase was purchased, the beef was had at 
apenny per pound ; andin 1795, a mart cost L. 2, 10s. At the same 
date, farmers paid their men servants from L. 1, 10s. to L. 4 a 
year; and female servants from 10s. to L. 1. Day-labourers, from 
6d. to 8d. without victuals ; tradesmen's wages from Is. to Is. 6d. 
Eggs were then three-halfpence a dozen ; a good fowl 6d. ; 
chickens 3d. a pair ; beef and mutton from 2d. to 2d. per lb. 

At present, the wages of a man-servant for farm-work is L. 8 a 
year ; of a woman servant L. 3. The hire of a labourer in sum- 
mer is Is. per day without victuals, or 6d. with victuals. In winter, 
he is paid by the hour. Harvest hire for a man is from L. 1, 5s. 
to L. 1, 10s. ; for a woman, from J 4s. to IBs. Mowers receive Is. 
6d. a day, and six meals. The same number of meals is expect- 
ed by farm-servants, during the seed time. Eggs are now 4d. a 
dozen ; fowls 8d. a piece ; chickens 6d. a pair ; beef and mutton 
from 4d. to 6d. per pound. 

Fisheries.— It has been already stated that every householder 
has a share of a boat, by which at intervals of leisure he may pro- 
cure for his family a supply of fish, which forms a material article 
in their diet. They are also all adventurers in the herring fish- 
ing, which occupies them, including the preparations for it, about 
two months. These two months could be spared from the care 
of their farms, under the old mode of farming, without much in- 
convenience ; but it is rather doubtful, how far their 
this fishing may be compatible with their following out, with due 
activity and exactness, the improvements connected with their 
leases, by preparing compost manure, keeping clean their green 
crops, and harvesting their hay, the more especially, as the for- 
mer part of the season is occupied chiefly in carting home their 
peats. 

But the fishing that might be prosecuted with the greatest and 
surest emolument, and for which the country has peculiar facili- 
ties, is the cod and ling fishery ; but which, both from want of 
capital and want of hands, has been hitherto neglected. For the 
encouragement of hands making fishing their occupation, there 



HOLME AND PAPLAY. 



225 



has been laid out here a site for a fishing village, and due encour- 
agement held out to settlers. The situation is at the ferry side, 
close by the harbour of Holme Sound Bay, and is peculiarly conve- 
nient for prosecuting the cod and ling fisheries. It is within a few 
miles of the German ocean on the one hand, and the Atlantic ocean 
on the other. All along the neighbouring coasts, and at no great dis- 
tance from the land, there are banks where cod are found in plenty. 
In proof of this, it may be mentioned that in the island of Waas, the 
small farmers on the shores of the Pentland Frith, have sometimes 
employed the time they could spare from their ordinary labour in 
fishing, and, with a few boats indifferently fitted out, have been 
known to catch from fifty to sixty thousand cod in one season. 
But had the attention of these men been solely directed to the 
occupation of fishing, and had they been provided with boats of a 
proper size and construction, they might no doubt have caught 
ten times that number in a season. 

A proof of what capital can effect on the fishing banks of Ork- 
ney, is the success of a wealthy English company who, for more 
than half a century, have employed, and slill employ, about a 
dozen of welled smacks at an expense of L. 60 or L. 70 per month, 
to supply the London market with live cod and lobsters. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Holme Sound is a thoroughfare betwixt the eastern and western 
coasts of the kingdom, by which vessels can pass from the one to 
the other with greater dispatch, and with greater security than 
either by the Caledonian Canal when in its best state, or the Pent- 
land Frith. 

Holme has great advantages for navigation over the Pentland 
Frith and Caledonian Canal. In passing through Holme Sound, 
all that is necessary to be considered is the time of flood or ebb tide 
suitable to the course in view to be steered ; and when this is observ- 
ed, vessels, on entering the. Sound are sure of falling in with a regu- 
lar current, moving during spring tides at the rate of nine miles an 
hour ; and should any mistake occur as to the proper time of tide, 
there is safe anchorage in several parts of the channel, in which 
to await the proper tide. The lights, too, erected for the direction 
of vessels entering cither end of the Pentland Frith are equally 
serviceable for directing vessels to either end of Holme Sound ; a 
light-house, erected forty years ago on a skerry at the eastern 
opening of the Frith, is a plain guide to the eastern opening of 
Holme Sound, which is but twelve miles farther north, betwixt the 



226 



ADDITION TO THE ACCOUNT OF 



Head of Roseness and the opposite point of Burray, where there 
are neither rocks nor shoals. The light-house, too, recently 
erected on the north-west extremity of Dunnet Head, for prevent- 
ing vessels mistaking the bay of Dunnet for the Pentland Frith, 
formerly a cause of shipwreck, is of equal importance as a guide 
for vessels making for or departing from the western entrance of 
Holme Sound by Stromness and Hoymouth, which is but fourteen 
miles of a straight course farther north than the western entrance 
of the Frith. Here, too, the navigation is safe. During last war, 
large convoys of merchant vessels bound for the Baltic, after ren- 
dezvouzing in Long Hope of Waas, commonly preferred thecourse 
eastward by Holme Sound to that by the frith, and were occasionally 
seen passing along the Sound to the number sometimes of from for- 
ty to sixty sail. Skeldaquoy Point, stretching out to the length of 
a quarter of a mile from the shore, forms the west side of what is cal- 
led Holme Sound Bay, where vessels of 200 tons may conveniently 
anchor. It is from this part of the shore that the post and tra- 
vellers are ferried over to Burray. The ferry is about four miles 
and a-half broad, and with a good boat and crew is attended with 
no danger. 

There has been, for some time past, a daily post from Edinburgh, 
which, during the summer, generally reaches Kirkwall within the 
third day. The mail is dispatched from Kirkwall by a foot-post 
to the ferry of Holme, where a boat with four men crosses over 
to Burray. He then proceeds across Burray to the small ferry 
of Water Sound, by which he crosses over in a boat with two men 
10 the village of St Margaret's Hope, in South Ronaldsay, where 
there is a sub-post- office. From that, he proceeds through South 
Ronaldsay, a distance of about eight miles to Burwick, on the 
Pentland Frith,— from which the mail is conveyed in a boat with 
four men, across the Frith, a breadth of twelve miles, to Huna m 
Caithness ; from which a gig post takes it to Wick, a distance 
of eighteen or twenty miles. 

Ecclesiastical Stoe.— This is one of the few parishes in Orkney 
in which there has always been but one church. According to tra- 
dition, it was dedicated" to St Nicolas. It is situated in the east- 
most district of the parish, called Paplay. Of this name for the 
site of church and manse, there are instances mother Orkney pa- 
rishes The Paplays are always the most fertile spots of a parish, 
and ae supposed to have been so named from their being allotted 
for the residence of the pnpse or priests in the times of popery. 1 he

site of the church of Holme is far from being centrical. It is from 
four to five miles distant from the west end of the parish, where the 
population is equally dense as in the other quarters of it. It was re- 
built in 1818, and affords sufficient accommodation. It is kept in 
good repair. No seat rents have ever been exacted. The average 
number ofcommunicants is from 100 to 110. A new manse and of- 
fices were built in 1804, all in the most substantial manner, and 
on the most convenient plan, and are kept in good repair. The 
glebe consists of about seven acres. The soil is good; but the shores 
were the most valuable part of it, so long as there was a market for 
kelp, as they yielded annually about four tons of kelp, which sold at 
an average of L. 7 per ton ; but, for some years past, the expense 
of making it would exceed any price that could be obtained for it. 
Up to 1815, the stipend, in common with that of six other pa- 
rishes in the synod, was on a very anomalous footing. It consisted 
of certain portions of malt and grease butter, paid out of the cu- 
mulo revenues of the bishopric. The allotment out of these re- 
venues for the stipend of Holme, consisted of 86 meils of malt 
weighed on the malt pundler, the meil being equal to 12 stone 
Dutch and six barrels of grease butter. The vicarages or small 
teinds drawn in kind also formed part of the stipend. The vi- 
carage teind butter was weighed in merks on the Bismer. 

But when the act of Parliament was passed for augmenting the 
small stipends, in all cases where the parochial teinds were inade- 
quate, it became necessary to place these stipends on the same foot- 
ing with others, and for this purpose, to institute in the respective 
parishes a process of valuation of teinds. The teinds of this pa- 
rish being found deficient for raising the stipend to L. 156, 6s. 8d. 
by about L. 60, this sum is accordingly paid from the Exchequer, 
half-yearly, at Whitsunday and Michaelmas. 

The United Associate Seceders have a chapel on the north-east 
corner of the parish, where it borders on the parish of St Andrews. 
The Earl of Zetland is patron of the parish. 
A school in a more centrical situation than the parochial school 
is much required.

PRESBYJERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. THOMAS BARCLAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish extends, from north to 
south, about 6 miles along the sea coast, and is nowhere above a 
mile in breadth. On the east and north-east, it is bounded by 
the sea, which separates it from the island and parish of Brassa, 
and forms that excellent harbour commonly called Brassa Sound. 

The parish, and country around it, are rocky and mountainous. 
The soil, on the mountains, is generally peat or moss, and is deep 
to their very summit. The arable land lies in spots along the sea 
coast; the soil is light and sandy, but as fertile and productive as 
can well be supposed from the situation and climate. The high- 
est hill in the parish rises little more than 300 feet above the level 
of the sea. The air, though moist, is far from being unhealthy. 

Harbours. — The only harbour in this parish is that of Lerwick, 
OF Bressay Sound, a capacious bay, in which vessels, well found, 
may ride at all seasons in perfect safety; and what renders this 
harbour particulariy commodious, is, its having two entries, one 
from the south, and another from the north. On the outside of 
the north entry, lies a sunk rock, called the Unicorn. 

Geoloffi/.— The predominating rocks in this parish are sandstone 
and conglomerate, both of which Jjelong to the old red sandstone 
of geologists. 

11. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.— Theve are three volumes of parochial re- 
gisters in the possession of the session-clerk. '1 he first begins in 
the year 1704, and ends in 1750. The births and marriages are 
both recorded in this book ; but, owing to the originally imper- 
fect buiding of the volume, it is now almost in fragmenls, and the 
births for several years at the commencement have been either not re- 
corded, or more probably the record has been lost. The second volume

commences in the year 1751, and seems to have terminated in the 
year 1777; but the latter year has been torn away. It appears 
to have been kept in a very regular and accurate manner, and is 
in very good preservation. Births, marriages, and deaths are all 
recorded The third volume commences in the year 1778, and is 
that still in use, being only about half exhausted. It contains a re- 
gister of births and marriages-the latter probably complete, but 
the former, from its being optional with Dissenters to register, has 
probably been much neglected. The people of all sects are now, 
however, it is believed, alive to the importance of registration. 
This volume contains no register of deaths till the year 1817; 
and from the want of some imperative regulation for ascertaining 
and communicating the facts, they have necessarily been entered 
in a very irregular manner. The session-clerk, apart from his 
own observation, is almost entirely indebted to the sexton for h.s 
information respecting these. 

Land-owners.-'Yhe land-owners of the parish are. Sir Arthur 
Nicolson, Bart .; William Hay of Laxfirth ; James Greig of Sand- 
sound- Earl of Zetland; Charles Ogilvy of Seafield ; Francs 
Heddle of Helerness, and others. Sir Arthur Nicolson is the pnn- 
ctal land.owner. This enumeration does not embrace the town 
of Lerwick, which contains many considerable owners of house and 
tiark property, besides those above-mentioned. 
 The valued rent of Zetland is L.28,275, 14s 6d. Scots ; but no 
apportionment of it upon the lands was ever made,_owing to w Inch 
he Zetland landholders, until the late extension o the franchise, 
wereexldedfrom qualifying as freeholders. All public assessmens 
Ire ev" anddivisions made, according to the numberof merk lands 
te ansh. All arable lands were anciently, under the Nr. - 
gian law, rated as merks,-a merk containing eight u.es. These 
merk a e quite indefinite as t« extent. Ic is, indeed, clear that 
It rntlnomination of merk land had not refere.ce t 

ficnl extent of surface, but was a denomination of value alone, in 
which was included the proportion of the surrounding commonty 
iTold Merks land are of different values, as sixpenny, 
or scattold. J' twelvepenny merk having formerly 

"'":"7b;en d equal to'two sixpenny merks; and in 

1 , deed" ltds are described as 30 merks sixpenny, 

some old 1-- ""f 

otherwise 15 merk twe j . p. 

however, for a very lo gpe od, be    

portioned, according to m k , with   
were sixpenny or Iwelvepennj.

contain about 14,000 merks land; and it will be noticed, that, 
however much the ancient enclosed land be increased by addition- 
al improvements, the number of merks ought to be and are station- 
ary. The valued rent, divided according to the merks land, would 
make a merk land in Zetland equal to L.2 Scots of valued rent. 
The parish contains 253 merks land. Lerwick is built on the 
commonty or scattold of Sound. ,The real rent of the country pa- 
rish is believed to exceed L. 500. The real rent of the town is 
about L.3700. 

MansionHouses. — Excluding the town of Lerwick, the only 
house in the parish that can be properly termed a mansion-house 
is that of Gremista, the occasional residence of Sir Arthur Nicol- 
son. There are, however, several houses in the neighbourhood 
of Lerwick, the summer residences of gentlemen residing in the 
town, which have been built within these few years, and have 
greatly improved the appearance of the neighbourhood. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquities w'orth noticing are the re- 
mains of a Pictish burgh or castle, on a small island in a lake 
close to Lerwick. It is fast hastening to decay. There are, or 
at least were lately, the remains of several chapels at Gulberwick. 
III.— Population. 

The population of the town of Lerwick, in 1837, was . 3069 
of places immediately adjacen', . 52 

of the country part of the parish, in 1831, 444 

The number of illegitimate births within the last three years 
in this parish, was 5. 

IV. — Industry. 
The real rent of the parish is L. 4200. 

The only improvements that have been made within the last 
fifty years are in the neighbourhood of Lerwick. That town was 
originally built on the commonty of Sound, and was surrounded 
by deep moss. The increase of the inhabitants has gradually caused 
the cutting up and consumption of this moss for fuel, until the 
immediate neighbourhood has mostly come to consist of extremely 
bare, stony, or rather rocky ground. Within the last twenty years, a 
common, surrounding the town, of about 40 acres, has been en- 
closed and divided into 31 parks, which aie now mostly cultivated 
and laid down to grass. They yield a rental of about L. 80, from 
which the minister's stipend, falling on the town, and other ex- 
penses, arte in part defrayed. Several gentlemen have also, at 
much expense, brought under cultivation ground in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town. And the summer residences of Mr Hay 



4 



SHETLAND. 



Mr Ogilvy, Mr Greig, and Mr L. Duncan, display, on a limited 
scale, such as the locality admits of, considerable taste and spirit of im- 
provement. Mr Ogilvy's residence at Sound is laid out with 
equal taste and convenience ; and the sheltered situation of Mr 
Duncan's is evinced by a small but flourishing little plantation 

before his house. 

ManM/ac/Mres.— Properly 'speaking, there is now hardly any manu- 
facture carried on in the parish. The women in this, as in other pa- 
rishes, are a good deal employedin knittingstockings, mitts, and other 
articles of hosiery. There was formerly a straw-plait manufactory ; 
hut, for several years, it has been dropped. There is an attempt 
at present making by Messrs Hay and Ogilvy, to establish a her- 
ring-net manufactory ; and there can be no doubt of the propriety 
of thus securing employment on the spot in the manufacture of 
an article, the weaving of which is so simple, and so easily ac- 
quired, and which is now much used in the district. The popu- 
lation of Zetland are generally too much averse to turn their spare 
time to account. They fish during the season. They necessarily 
apply to their small labourings and harvests ; and they cut their 
peats at the proper seasons ; but when not so engaged, many of 
them are apt to be idle, or at least to employ themselves in a 
listless manner. It is said that the want of leases accounts for 
this ; but those who know the district are aware that there are 
many who have no such excuse ; and that there are few who 
could not obtain leases, if they wished. 

Quarry —In Lerwick, there is a freestone quarry wrought ; 
and several vessels, some of them of 200 and 300 tons burden, 
have been built by Messrs Hay and Ogilvy. 

Fishings.— TXQ fishing most constantly followed in Zetland 
is that of ling, which is carried on from the middle of May to the 
beginning or middle of August. It is, however, only followed by 
a very few boats from this parish. There are a number of small 
sloops that pursue the cod-fishing, during summer; but it is sub- 
ject to great vicissitude ; the fish appearing for a series of years 
to leave the banks, on which, for another series of years, they are 
again found. The herring fishing has, of late years, been carried on 
ith considerable spirit, in the manner practised on the Sco ch 
nnd in larger boats than were formerly used in Zetland. 
riB34 the take in Zetland exceeded 50,000 barrels; but 
ince the'n, it has gradually declined. In 1839, 174 boats mostly 
belonging to this parish, delivered herrings .n or near Lerw.ck, 



LERWICK. 



5 



but the whole take from these was only 4872 barrels, and the her- 
ring-fishing last year was a total failure. The losses sustained by 
both curers and fishermen were consequently very severe, and have 
much damped the energies, and contracted the means of both. It 
may be doubted if the Zetland fishermen yet understand the habits 
of the herring, or the best way of looking out for them ; and it is 
matter of wonder, that greater exertions to procure some of the 
experienced fishermen from Scotland, to follow the herring fish- 
ing in Zetland, have not been made. Notwithstanding of the 
late failures, yet, as a large capital is invested in boats, nets, and 
materials, the fishing will, doubtless, be again attempted another 
year. 

Navigation. — The number of vessels belonging to Lerwick is 
85. The amount of their tonnage, 3132. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — From an account now taken, the number 
of families belonging to the Established Church in the town is 
458; in the landward district in 1831 80 families. And from 
an account now taken, the number of Dissenting or Seceding fa- 
milies, is 187. 

About 40 families in the town may be said to attend no place 
of worship, being generally the most wretched, and standing most 
in need of Christian instruction. The usual excuse for non-atten- 
dance, is want of proper clothing, &amp;c. 

The stipend amounts to L. 150, and L. 8, 5s. 9d. is allowed for 
communion elements. The stipend is made up thus : From the 
bishopric rents of Orkney, L. 27, 15s. 6d. ; from town of Lerwick, 
L. 16, 13s. 4d. ; from lands of landward district, L.23, Os, 8jd. ; 
from Exchequer under small stipend Act, L. 90, 16s. 3d.; total, 
L. 158, 5s. 9d. 

There is neither manse nor glebe in the parish. The com- 
pensation paid by the heritors is L.50 per annum. 

Education. — There are four schools conducted by male and 
by female teachers in the parish ; and one additional for boys, 
and one for girls of the middle class of society, are required. Per- 
haps, a well conducted model-school, accessible to all teachers in 
Zetland, and the children of the parish, would be a very great ad- 
vantage. It is luckily now beginning to be perceived, that teach- 
mg IS a profession requiring previous training; and, in the schools 

I-erwick being the seat of the Custom-house, all vessels beloneing to Zetland 
are registered there.

SHETLAND. 



in Zetland, though conducted by estimable, zealous and right- 
minded men, the mere attainment of reading and writing, combined 
with the almost mechanical reading of the Scriptures, form the 
staple of the education ; and but too little attention is paid to the 
moral and intellectual part of education. The Sunday schools, 
wherever established, have been productive of. very great and pal- 
pable good effects. 

The yearly amount of the parochial teacher's salary is L. 34, 
4s. 8ld ; his fees amount to about L.30 per annum. 

Scfbings Banks.— There is one of these banks established in the 
parish. But the succession of bad crops and fishings has almost 
entirely stopped the deposits, for some time. 

In 1838 the sums withdrawn amounted to L.45 ; in 1839 to 
L.16, 8s. ; and in 1840 to L.13, 9s. 

Poor and Poor's Funds.— The number of persons receiving pa- 
rochial aid is 105. The average sum allotted to each is Is. 8d. 
per month. The average annual amount of contributions for their 
relief, is L.116. This sum is taken from the receipts for the 
year commencing 1st December 1839, and ending 1st December 
1840, and may be deemed a fair average; the collection not 
having much varied, for several years. Of the above amount there 
was derived from church collections, L.74, Os. Qd.; allowed by 
heritors to make up deficiency, L.22 ; from two donations, L.6, 
5s.; mortcloth hire, L.2, 12s. 6d. ; collection at sermons by mi- 
nister of parish on St John's day, at request of masons of Morton 
Lodge, L.12, Is.; total, L.116, 18s. Sd.

PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. ZACH. M. HAMILTON, Minister of Bressay. 
THE REV. JAMES GARDNER, Minister of Quarff. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Boundaries, §-c. — These parishes comprehend six 
islands, with a part of the mainland of Shetland. One parish lies 
on the east of the mainland, consisting of the islands of Bressay 
and Noss, divided from each other by Noss Sound, and from 
Lerwick by Bressay Sound. 

Bressay is nearly six English miles in length; its breadth varying 
from two to three, or, at some points, rather more. Its aspect on 
the west is somewhat diversified by indentations of the coast, the 
height of its hills, the cultivated land sloping toward the sea, and 
by the houses, cottages, and hamlets interspersed from south to 
north. Tracks of hilly ground run through it in irregular direc- 
tions, between which that sort of variety occurs, which is formed 
by the intermixture of pasture and peat moss. 

Noss is two miles long, and a mile or more in breadth, having 
an acclivity from west to east. The greater part of it is pasture 
ground ; but in the lower part, there is enough of cultivation to 
form a comparatively large and good farm. 

Topographical Appearances. — The most prominent object in 
Bressa is tlie Ward or Beacon Hill near the south extremity, 
which rises 724 feet above the level of the sea, somewhat coni- 
cally shaped ; and, being covered with heath, stunted grass, and 
peat-moss, it has a very sombre aspect. St Andrew's or Ander 
Hill, on the east side of the island, is a hilly ridge, 400 feet or 
more in height. 

Some caverns occur along the coast, one of which, on the south 
part, is the most remarkable, and has never been thoroughly ex- 

' Drawn up by the Rev, Georee Marshall, ministor of Flisk, formerly ministci- 
of Brcway.

plored, althoiigli a boat may penetrate into it for a considerable 
way. On this quarter of .the island, there are various perfora- 
tions in the rocks forming natural arches, by means of a column 
from each projecting into the sea, below which boats pass in fa- 
vourable weather. One of these is known by the name of the 
Giant's Leg. 

Both in Bressay and Noss, the coast is rocky, sometimes very 
high ; while at some intervals, a small extent of sloping beach oc- 
curs, of a sandy but oftener a calcareous description. 

The principal headlands on the south, are the Ord, the Bard, and 
Hammer. The Ord is a reclining rock above 500 feet high, and 
inhabited by Eagles. The Bard and Hammer are bold promon- 
tories, which, with the whole coast to the south-east, and Hova, 
the south headland of Noss opposite, are about 200 feet high. 

Noss is distinguished principally by its eastern headland, called 
the Noop, or by mariners, Hangcliff, the height of which is said 
to be about 600 feet. 

Around the coast of both islands, there are some holms or unm- 
habited islets, the most remarkable of which is the Holm of Noss, 
a perpendicular rock, 200 feet in height, separated from Noss by 
a very narrow channel, having a space on the top sufficient for the 
pasture of a dozen of sheep, for two or three months. The me- 
thod of communication between the island and this holm, by means 
of a cradle suspended on ropes, is detailed in the former Statis- 
tical Account. 

Quarff, a part of the mainland, forms the middle parish, lymg 
six miles south-west from Bressa, and situated between the pa- 
rishes of Lerwick and Tingwall on the north, and that of Dun- 
rossness on the south. The inhabited part is mostly a valley 
between high hills ; extending about two miles between the east 
and west sea, and about half a mile broad, but having uncultivated 
or pasture ground belonging to it, extending a mile on the north 
and south. The winding valley, cottages at convenient distances 
near the foot of the hill on both sides, having a meadow between 
them, and a pleasant bay on the east and west,— exhibit a pictu- 
resque and simple scenery. 

The Cliff and Coningsburgh hills terminate in a ridge on the 
south part of the valley, as do the hills of Tingwall and Lerwick 
on the north. The height of Scraefield, the highest point on the 
north, may be above 500 feet. 

West from QuariT is the parish of Burra, which comprehends 



BnESSAY. 



9 



the Isles of House and Burra, and the small Isles of Hevera and 
Papa. 

House or the East Isle of Burra lies about half a nrule from 
Quarff; and Burra, or the West Isle, the same distance from 
House. In their appearance, there is nothing very remarkable ; 
but thev are mostly two hill ridges, irregular in shape, the one 
about six, and the East Isle about five miles in length, and from 
half a mile to a mile in breadth. The south part of the Isle of 
Hou«e is a peninsula, a mile in length, the greatest part of it 
consisting of pasture ground. The coast of both is rocky, espe- 
cially on°the south, and particularly that of Burra, on the west. 
At one point the two islands approach so near to each other, as to 
be joined by a bridge composed of some loose timbers resting on 
two rude piles of stones. The Isle of Papa, a mile north from 
Burra, is a small spot inhabited by two families. 

Hevera, two miles south from Burra, has the appearance of a 
high rock, having only one proper access by a romantic sort of 
creek, intei- scopulos pendentes. It accommodates five families, 
whose houses are frightfully situated on the brink of the preci- 
pice. An islet is attached on the south to this, called Little He- 
vera. 

Noss Sound is not a quarter of a mile broad, about twenty 
feet deep, having a strong tide, and is often impassable with east- 
erly winds, f 

Bressay Sound is well known as a harbour. In the middle, op- 
posite Lerwick, it is hardly a mile broad, and perhaps fifteen fa-- 
thorns deep, the tide falling in it about eight feet; narrowing 
very much to the norlh entrance ; but its breadth and depth in- 
creasing towards Quarff, on the south, where it opens into the 
ocean. 

Cliff Sound, nearly half a mile broad, is, like Bressay, a 
difficult sound in stormy weather, owing to its situation between 
high grounds on both sides. It is said to be eight or ten fathoms 
deep. 

Stream Sound is the junction between the Cliff and Burra 
Sound, said to be six fathoms deep, running east and west be- 
tween the north point of House, and south of Trondra ; its 
breadth, about a quarter of a mile, between these ioints ; its cur- 
rent as visible as that of a river. 

• Since this account was written, some improvements have been here made. 

t I'he statements here given of the deptli of these arms of the sea, are given from 
the opinions of fishermen in the neighbourhood, and cannot, therefore, be warranud 
as correct. An accurate survey has since been made by Captain Thomas.

The West, or Burra Sound, is somewhat broader and deeper, 
extending the length of Burra ; and, being narrowed by the ap- 
proach of the opposite points at the bridge, toward the south, it 
affords a space for more tranquil boat-navigation, than any other 
in the parish. 

Various springs in the different districts have a slight mineral 
tinge, perhaps from the bog-iron that frequently occurs. 

Bressay has a dozen of small lochs, two or three of them only 
being half a mile in length or breadth, but some containing ex- 
cellent trout, seldom disturbed by the angler. Burra and Quarff 
have each two small lochs. 

Geology. — Bressay and Noss belong to the old red sandstone 
formation : Quarff to the clay-slate and mica-slate formations ; the 
Isles of House, Burra, and Hevera are of primiti\ e formation ; and 
Papa of epidotic syenite. 

Quarries of coarse slate, of a grey, heavy kind, have been for 
a long time wrought in Bressay, the layers being from four to 
ten feet deep, mostly imbedded between rocks of sandstone. 
Some inferior kinds of limestone are found in Quarff and in 
Burra. 

Zoology.— The headland of the Ord of Bressay affords a domi- 
cile to a few eagles. The Noop of Noss, in summer, exhibits a 
curious spectacle, being covered with birds of passage and others, 
which occupy the narrow shelving of the rock. The noise of these 
creatures is occasionally like that of the most deafening waterfall. 

Whales are sometimes seen in the Sounds. One above forty 
feet long was lately brought ashore near the manse, said to be 
the species Balcena hoops. 

Although there are few trees here in the present day, yet there 
must have been a time when they did exist in it, as many of the 
ipsa corpora are found in the mosses here; as in other places of 
the country. It can hardly be said that any experiments in plant- 
ing made in this country have been made with such energy, that 
their failure should be held decisive. Several spots near the man- 
sion-house were, some years ago, planted with willows and ash. 
The plants of ash are not in the same state of progress as the willows. 
Some plane trees thrive tolerably. In the ground adjoining to 
the mansion-house, there are various plants of aspen, poplar, la- 
burnum, elm, and plane-tree thriving well. The chmate does not 
appear to favour evergreens. 

Culinary vegetables thrive well ; and gooseberry and curran 



BRESSAV.

bushes produce tolerably, but require the shelter of a wall. There, 
have been often at the Mansion-house tolerable crops of strawber- 
ries. There is not, so far as I have heard, any instance of a hot- 
house in this country, except here ; and in it the vines produce 
an exuberant crop of large grapes. 

II. — Civil History. 
In the year 1636, the Rev. William Umphray, who had been 
at that time fifty-five years minister of this charge, executed two 
deeds of mortification, by which he left eight merks of land to 
Burra and Quarff, and four to Bressay, for maintaining a reader, 
and other pious uses, together with the interest of L.20 Sterling 
to the one, and of L. 150 Scots to the other. The communion 
cups seem to have been his gift, as they bear his name, with the 
date 1628. 

An event of great importance to the minister and people 
lately took place, in the erection of a Government church in 
QuarflF. Before this erection, the charge of these parishes was 
one of the most difficult kind, the Bressa and Burra churches be- 
ing about twelve miles distant from each other ; and it be- 
hoved" the minister to go in a very small boat to Quarff, then to 
walk two miles, and lastly, to embark with his Quarff parishioners 
for the kirk of Burra, situated at five miles distance. His Sab- 
bath days' journies thus occupied eight hours, before his return 
home. The arrangement of places so distant under one charge, 
rendered it impossible for one man to go through the duties of a 
minister in them, with any regularity or satisfaction. 

Its first minister, Mr James Gardner, was inducted September 
1830. The district at present allotted to him consists of Quarff, 
with the adjacent islands in Burra parish ; and he has the duty 
of preaching in the Burra church, as circumstances riiay permit. 
But as there are contiguous parts of Coningsburgh, Gulberwick, 
and Tingwall, for whose inhabitants it is vastly easier to attend at 
Quarff than at their own parish churches, the Presbytery have it in 
contemplation to annex, quoad sacra, these contiguous places to 
the charge of Quarff. It is much to be wished, for the sake of 
order, and the comfort of all concerned, that the whole were con- 
stituted a separate parish. The ground required for the church 
and manse, was generously given by the late Charles Ogiivy, Esq. 
of Seafield, and the disposition executed by his son, .lohn Ogiivy, 
Esq. 

• The Bressay bell declares, in Latin, thai it was cast, in 17'i3, at Hanibvirgh, foi 
the use of this kirli.

SHETLAND. 



Land-owners. — The land-owners are, in Bressa and Noss, Wil- 
liam Mouat, Esq. In Quarff, the Right Honourable Lord Dun- 
das ; John Ogilvy, Esq. ; Mr Andrew Irvine ; and Mr Thomas 
Henry. In Burra, John Scott, Esq. of Scalloway. In Hevera, 
Robert Bruce, Esq. of Symbister. 

For time immemorial, separate sessions have been lield at the 
kirks of Bressay and Burra ; and it is probable that a volume or 
volumes of minutes and registers have been lost, at both places. 
The first extant are in the worst condition, and much mutilated ; 
the earliest date 1737. They are now better kept; and it is found 
expedient to have a separate book and register at Quarff. 

In Noss, a small burying-ground is used, lying rohnd the frag- 
ments of what appears to have been a Popish chapel. 

There are three burying-grounds in Bressay. The most an- 
cient appears to have been at Gunista, on the north part of it. 
There is here a small fragment of a church, which seems to have 
had vaults below it, or, according to tradition, a prison attached to 
it. On the site of this church, a spacious tomb of hewn stone, and 
neat workmanship, was built by some former proprietor, the walls 
of which remain. 

The ruins of a church appear also at Culbinsgarth, on the north- 
east, where there is another burying-ground ; and from this place 
Mr Umphray's deeds of mortification are dated. How long be- 
fore this the manse and kirk had subsisted, does not appear ; but 
they were both removed to the present site, on the west, in 1722; 
and since that time, the church has been renewed once, and the 
manse twice. 

Several traces of Pictish buildings occur, mostly in the form of 
subterranean cells ; and both in Bressay and Burra, are some of 
these objects called standing-stones. 

Of late years, some tumuli were discovered, containing square 
stones, within which were bones, exhibiting marks of combustion. 
Other conically shaped knolls, that have every appearance of 
being tumuli, have never yet been opened. 

The churches in Bressay and Burra are small and incommodious. 
The Government Church in Quarff is a commodious and beautiful 
building.

One family only of independent fortune resides in the parish,— 
and this in Bressay, only during summer. 

IV. — Industry. 
Jgriculture.—Mesismemenl by acres is here unknown, and that 
by mark land, which has been used for time immemorial, is, and 
has been, for many years, ill defined and arbitrary. Originally, 
a mark of land must have been a definite measure, and pro- 
bably a measure only of cultivated land. But as every small 
farm" has a portion of pasture or uncultivated ground belongmg 
to it, an industrious tenant does what he can to add to the cul- 
tivated space as much as he can spare from the pasture. In 
some places, a mark signifies a space equal to an acre, and in 
others only to half an acre. 

Certainly it would be far better, in order to prevent erroneous 
calculations and disappointments, that farms in this country were 
measured precisely by acres as in the south. 

In this and most parishes here, the cultivated land is often not 
a third, or a fourth, or not nearly so much of the waste land or 
undivided common. The rental land, or that which has been in 
cultivation from olden times, consists in 

Bressay and Noss, of 342 marks. 
Burra, • 252 

Hevera, . 18 

Quarfif, . 93 

Jlent, The average rent of land in the three districts is L. 1 

per mark, with public burdens. But perhaps the outsets, or small 
farms occasionally let from the common, may make the cultivated 
space amount to a third more than what has been stated. The 
rental land connected with any hamlet or township, as it is called, 
lies in run- rig among the tenants. The outsets lying by them- 
selves and unfettered by the system of run-rig, and being some- 
times enclosed, possess by these means greater facilities for im- 
provement than the other. 

Husbandri/.— The mode of cropping, from time immemorial, has 
been by oats and bear alternately on the infield, with potatoes 
once in four or five years. The manure employed is a compost 
of moss earth, dung, and sea-weed ; the earth being taken from 
the common during summer, and mixed with the dung as it accu- 
mulates, and with the sea-weed as it casts up. The offals of her- 
ring are also considered an excellent manure. 

A good many years ago, the proprietor of Bressay brought a 
grieve from Berwickshire to manage the farm annexed to the 



14 



SHETLAND. 



mansion-house, who afterwards took the lease of a small farm 
and managed it by the same mode of agriculture to which he had 
been accustomed in the south ; it was found that it seldom failed 
to produce'an average crop of grain, turnip, rye-grass, or clover, 
compared with any hill district in Scotland. One or two tenants 
possessing advantages above the rest, availed themselves of the 
example thus set. But as to the generality, their poverty, and 
the want of leases, enclosures and roads, together with the sys- 
tem of run-rig, effectually bar all attempts at improvement. 
Other obstacles, however, arise from their engfagements in fishinar, 
and from the circumstance that the young men of almost every fa- 
mily, in the months of February and March, run eagerly to Ler- 
wick to engage in the Greenland and Strait's fisheries, and, of 
late years, to the cod-fishing; so that, both in spring and harvest, 
a great part of agricultural labour devolves on the females. But 
even many of the men who remain at home, think nothing of de- 
serting their farms for a whole day, now and then, for the sake 
of any traffic with ships in the harbour. Of course, from these 
circumstances alone, much agricultural improvement is not to be 
expected. 

Two or three leases only exist here, the duration of which is 
from nineteen to twenty-6ve years. 

Many of the farm cottages have of late years been rebuilt on an 
improved plan, and emulation has been excited on this matter. 

It should be mentioned, that the best cultivated farms may 
produce 5 or 6 bolls of oats, and 8 bolls of bear to the pro- 
portion of an acre, or 200 ankers of potatoes. It is seldom that 
meal is sold ; but when this happens, it is sold by the lispund, a 
foreign measure at present very variously defined. The average 
price of oatmeal in Bressay is 4s., and of bear meal 3s., reckoning 
to the lispund 36 lbs. of 16 ounces. Potatoes are sold at 8d. 
per anker. 

Rate of Wages, 6c. — Labourers' wages from lOd. to Is. 6d. ; ma- 
sons, from Is. 4d. to 3s.; carpenters, 3s. ; journeymen, 2s.; quar- 
rying and building dry stone dikes per fiuhom, 2s. 6d. ; wages of 
a housemaid per annum, L.2 ; of a farm female servant, L. 1. Sum- 
mer's grazing of a cow, from 7s. to 10s. ; of an ox, 15s to L. 1 ; 
winter's fodder, from 5s. to 7s. — Price of a full-grown wedder, 7s. ; 
of an ewe, 5s. The average weight of a cow for slaughter is 
about two cwt., of an ox about six years old, about three cwt. 
The sheep are, in general, left to run at large on the common. 



BRESSAY. 



15 



The weight of one fleece may be from one to two or three 
pounds. 

Quarries. — Stone quarries for the purpose of building may be 
here found almost in any place. Slate and Aug is shipped from 
the quarries in Bressay, for the different parts of this country, and 
on some occasions is carried to the southern coasts. In these 
quarries, a dozen of men and boys are employed, at wages of lOd. 
or Is. a day. 

Fisheries. — The ling-fishing is called the haaf or far-fishing. 
Bressay sends to it thirteen or more boats, IS or 20 feet in keel ; 
QuarfF, four ditto ; Burra, ten, of 15 feet keel. Of the largest of 
these, each boat carries fifty Bughts or lines, each bught being 
fifty fathoms in length. The expense of outfit of one of these 
boats, may be from L.'iO to L.26. In each, there are commonly 
six sharers ; but if a man is needed to complete the crew, he 
may be hired sometimes for L.lj 10s., or a sum between that and 
L.3. A haaf boat may be hired for the season for L.'2, 8s. 

On this fishing, the Bressay and Quarif people have to proceed 
far to the eastward, sometimes till they lose sight of land. The 
Quarff people have to leave their homes during the week, and to 
lodge at Noss as a fishing station, where others also, from differ- 
ent parishes, are collected, and have a few shillings to pay for the 
use of the huts in which they are accommodated; those from 
Bressay set off from their own homes. Both of these, and also all 
who fish to the eastward, must be at open sea at least for one, some- 
times for two nights. The Burra people do not need to go farther 
out to sea than one mile, their lines being set in the evening, and 
drawn ontheir return in the morning. 

From their employers they receive at present Gs. 6d. for the 
cwt. of wet ling, and 4s. 6d. for the tusk and cod, which they brino- 
from this fishing. The accounts I have received of the fishermen's 
profits differ somewhat. A gentleman, whose knowledge ought 
to be accurate, stated to me from his books, that the average pro- 
fit of each man for the season was from L. 4 to L. 5. The ave- 
rage amount of the Bressay ling-fishing may be about seventy cwt. 
in a season to each boat. Of the Quarf fishing, fifty cwt. Of 
the Burra fishing, eighteen cwt. 

The cod-fishing to the west and south west of this country em- 
ploys many hands, and begins about Whitsunday; being carried 
on by small sloops of between fifteen and twenty tons. From the 
whole of this parish, six or more sloops of this kind are sent to it, 



16 



SHETLAND. 



and last year, there were about seventy of the parishioners who en- 
gaged in it. Eight or ten men commonly are partners in a sloop ; 
but sometimes boys are hired to make up their complement, whose 
wages may be L. "2, and Is. 6d. per ton offish. These sloops 
may get in a season from four to ten tons. 

•The herring-fishery commences at the conclusion of the former, 
in the month of August. The same persons mostly engage in 
this as the two former, and the boats used for the ling fishing are 
employed by them, along with some of a larger size, by others who 
have prepared them for the purpose. The ordinary kind of boats 
must be provided with nets, the expense of which is about L.22. 
Some, however, make their outlay only L. 6 or L. 7. They need 
only to go on this fishing, two or four miles from land. Last year, 
the Bressay boats alone got 1-528 crans, the average being seventy 
six to each boat. The Quarff boats got 390 crans. The Burra 
men had not yet engaged in this fishing. 

The curing' of herring in Bressay employs about thirty women 
and children in the season. 

The manufacture of kelp in Bressay employs twenty or thirty 
boys and girls, who receive 9s. or more in the month, and have to 
work at least three hours every tide, by day or night. An over- 
seer is employed, who receives "at the rate of L. 2 per ton for his 
own wages and payment of the workers. 

The manufacture of Shetland hosiery is carried on by the in- 
dustrious, although it has not so much encouragement as in the 

days of Provost Coulter. 

The manufacture of herring-nets now engages attention, and pro- 
mises to be a useful employment. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

EcclesimdcalState.-TheBressychuvch is situated convenient- 
ly, and so is the Government church in Quarff. Notso the Bur- 
ra church. Situated near the south extremity of the West sle, it 
caused intolerable hardships to the minister and half ot the pa- 
rishioners ; and still gives needless travel to the Government minis- 
ter in Quarff. Bressay church was built in 1 815 ; is in good repair ; 
accommodates 370 ; has no free sittings. The Government church 
i„ Quarff was finished in 1829; is a beautiful and commodious 
building built to contain 320 ; has 106 free sittings Biirra church 
was built about twenty-six years ago; accommodates 210 , has no 
free sittings; and is seldom in any tolerable state of repair. 

T man e at Bressay was rebuilt in 1819. The glebe was ex-

value ; it is said to contain twelve marks of land, and, according to 
-present rents here, would let for L. 12. The stipend is L.150, 
of which L.117, 17s. lOd. arise from the parish. 

There are two places called meeting-houses in Burra that may, 
perhaps, each contain 100 ; one of Independents, and the others 
Wesleyans. I am told that twenty or thirty only are in commu- 
nion with either. Many of them, when their hours of meeting differ, 
attend the parish churcli. Two or three individuals only at parti- 
cular times have appeared as Dissenters in Quarff or Bressay. 

The three parish churches in summer are well attended. Cer- 
tainly those of Bressay and Burra are not too large for the popula- 
tion. The situation of young persons here, all along, has been quite 
deplorable. Till lately, they had no opportunity of anything de- 
serving the name of education ; and even, though there had been 
anxiety shown to bring them to church, there was not, and there 
is not, room for the tenth part of them either in Bressay or Burra 
churches. The average number of communicants in Bressay is 
290. When there was only one church for the west district, there 
might be there 150. But, since the erection of the Government 
church, arrangements not having been completed between Quarff 
and Burra, and the contiguous parts, the number of communicants 
cannot be accurately specified. 

Education. — There are three regular, and commonly four small 
private, schools in these parishes. 

The parish school is in Bressay. The salary is L. 25, 13s. ; 
amount of fees, L. 1, 6s. ; quarter payments for reading, lOd. ; 
writing, 2s. ; arithmetic, 2s. 6d. ; a set of book-keeping, 3s. At 
Jast examination, there were 25 scholars present. 

The Assembly schoolmaster in Bressay has L. 20 of salary ; 
amount of fees at present L.9. A school is supported by the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, in Burra. The 
salary L.15; amount of school-fees, L.l. Rale of quarter pay- 
ments, for reading, lOd.; writing, Is. 4d.; arithmetic, 2s. 6d. 
Number of scholars at present, 26. 

For more than twenty years, there have been two schools in 
Bressa, and one in Burra, taught by women, having each 1 5 or more 
scholars. That in Burra, and one of those in Bressay, are extreme- 
ly useful for the younger children. 

Sabbath schools are kept by the Assembly and Society teachers, 
and one in Quarff, by a catcchist of the Edinburgh Society 

SHETLAND. jj  /

for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor. One in 
Bressay is kept by an elder. 

Almost all who can get to school between eight and fifteen 
years of age, are now beginning to read, and a greater proportion 
than before to write. Upwards of fifteen years of age there are 
at least twenty who, confessedly, cannot read. I believe that not 
more than twenty or thirty are capable of the smallest epistolary 
correspondence. The institution of the Assembly school has 
excited a desire for education in Bressay beyond what existed be- 
fore, and the people appear sensible of the great advantage of 
having a teacher so well qualified as the present. The district of 
Qiiarff remains wholly destitute of a teacher, and there a school 
is loudly called for. 

Friendhj Society. — In this parish, there is a branch of the Shet- 
land Fishermen's Fund, for decayed fishermen and their widows. 
The annual payment, 2s. and a little entry money at first. In 
this parish, there are 46 contributors ; 18 widows at present, 
who receive each 14s. ; six decayed members, who, altogether, re- 
ceive L. 1, 14s. 6d. 

The nett stock of the general fund is at present, L.2485, 16s. 
7id. Its concerns are diligently superintended by William Mouat, 
Esq., the general treasurer.- This excellent institution would 
have prospered much more, had it not been for seme unfounded 
prejudices fostered among the peasantry.

The mortified land in Burra ought to yield at least double what

contributed to render this spot of ground of no avail for the 
pious and charitable purposes of the mortifier. ' 

It must be evident, that, if the distressed poor did not receive

obtained by trading vessels.

PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JOHN ELDER. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish is situated on the west side of 
Shetland, and near the middle. It is bounded on the east, by the 
parish of Sandsting, and on all other sides by the sea. It consists 
of four districts, namely. Walls, Sandness, Papa-Stour, and Foula. 
Walls and Sandness make part of the mainland, which is the 
largest of the Shetland islands; a hill of considerable height forming 
a division betwixt them. Papa-Stour Stour signifying great is 
an island about two miles in length, and one in breadth, lying 
north from Sandness. It is separated from it by Papa Sound, 
which is a frith a mile broad ; through which, runs a rapid and dan- 
gerous tideway. Foula is about three miles long, and one mile 
and a-half broad, lying to the west of the other parts of the pa- 
rish, and distant from the nearest point of land, which is in Walls, 
about sixteen miles. There is another valuable island in the 
south part of the parish, belonging to Walls district, called Vaila; 
on which is the residence of the principal proprietor of the parish, 
John Scott, Esq. of Melby ; and inside of which, there is an ex- 
cellent harbour with two entrances, named Vaila Sound. 

The greater part of the coast is rocky, the rocks frequently 
rising to more than 100 feet in lieight. On he west sido of Foula 
they are several hundred feet high, and at one poinf, 1200; and 
m summer, are covered with sea-fowl. The parish is about ten

miles long, from the south side of Vaila to the north side of Papa, 
and five broad, exclusive of Foula.  . , • • u 

Geology -The chief rocks on the mainland of this parish are 
quartz-rock, gneiss, and porphyry, vith red sandstone. n the 
•isle of Papa-Stour-porphyry, trap, and red sandstone prevail ; and 
Foula is composed of old red sandstone, with subordinate deposits 
of'granite, gneiss, and mica slate. 

II, — Population. 
The population is '2315: of this number, 1104 belong to 
Walls; 642 to Sandness; 367 to Papa; and 202 to Foua- 
There are four propietors, each of whom has more than L.oO of 
rent from land ; besides several others who have less. 

III. — Industry. 
With two or three exceptions, the whole of the parishioners are 
employed in the same manner. They unite the two occupations 
of fishino- and farming. In a favourable season, most of the fami- 
i s havens much meal and potatoes as they require or own 
use • and some of them can even sell a considerable quantity. . 
Thy have also milk and a little butter for family use besi es 
geese and eggs. Each family, in general, kills a pig yearly and a 
few sheep of lambs. Small fish also for home use are obtained 
: t g eat abundance, at particular times Tea and tobacco ai. m 
general use. When the crops are good and the fishing successful, 
ost of them live in a very comfortable manner. So-, howeve;, 
live very poorlv ; chiefly owing to their marrying before they have 
meaL'of stocking a farm, or to dieir settling on - P 
ground which are insufficient for their support. When the crops 
fnil manv families are reduced to great want.

crops produced are oats, bear, potatoes, cabbages, and a very few 
turnip. There are only three ploughs in the parish, and they all 
belong to proprietors. 

The industrious and careful are, in general, well provided with 
wearing apparel and bed-clothes, manufactured by themselves from 
their own wool. Their Sunday dresses are imported. Their 
houses are warm ; but very little attention is paid to either order 
or cleanliness by most. Indeed, it is the general practice to place 
the byre in front of the dwelling-house ; through which, therefore, 
you must pass on entering; and inside, you meet with calves, sheep, 
and young pigs, besides dogs and fowls. 

Fishing. — The principal fishing is that of the ling. It is carried 
on in open boats many miles from land. A considerable quantity 
of the cod fish is caught nearer the shore by old men and boys, in 
smaller boats than those used in catching the ling. The herring 
fishing has been introduced of late years to a great extent, and is 
likely to prove very beneficial. It commences after the ling fishing 
is concluded, — generally about the middle of August, and continues 
for a month or six weeks. 

The rents of the farms are paid from the profits of the fishing, 
and from the sale of cattle and butter. 

IV. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — There are four parish churches, — being 
one to each of the four districts of which the parish is composed. 
They are all conveniently situated, except the church of Walls, 
which is only one mile from one end of the district to which it be- 
longs, and four miles from the other end, and they contain the 
legal amount of accommodation. Each congregation has its own 
elders, session-clerk, and poor's fund, and the I-ord's Supper is 
dispensed annually to each. As there is only one minister. Di- 
vine service is performed in the different churches in rotation ; in 
Walls once every fortnight, and in Sandness and Papa once in 
four weeks, and in summer occasionally once a-fortnight, — both 
places being attended to on the same day. Foula is visited only once 
a-year, on which occasion the minister remains in the island two 
Sabbaths, preaching frequently during the interval. If there was 
a minister for Sandness and Papa, the minister of Walls might, 
visit Foula twice a-year; but at present, while he attends to it, ho 
leaves behind him three churches vacant. In each church, how- 
ever, there is a reader, generally the schoolmaster of the district, 



22 



SHETLAND. 



who, every Lord's day, reads a sermon to the people, and unites 
with them in devotional exercises. 

The Wesleyan Methodists have three chapels in this parish, 
and one minister, who has also to officiate in the parish of Sand- 
sting. Their members are 216 in nimiber. 

The Congretrationalists have two chapels and one minister, who 
has also to officiate in many other parts. Their members are 115 
in number. 

The communicants belonging to the Established Church are 
584 in number; namely, '240 in Walls, 159 in Sandness, 136 in 
Papa, and 49 in Foula. 

The stipend of the parish minister is L.150 per annum, and 
the glebe is worth about L.15. 

Education. — In each of the districts or parishes, there is an en- 
dowed school. One of these is the parish school ; the other three 
are supported by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christ- 
ian Knowledge. Occasionally, a few children in different parts 
are taughtby persons employed by the parents for this purpose, on 
account of the distance at which they are placed from the parochial 
or Society school; and some are taught at home by the parents them- 
selves. Though not more than a twelfth part of the population 
attend school at one time, and very often a much smaller number, 
yet the whole of the young people learn to read their Bibles with 
tolerable accuracy. A considerable number also learn to write, 
but seldom before they are grown up,— the parents considering 
that they discharge their duty sufficiently when they afford them 
the means of learning to read. As the young people seldom at- 
tend public worship till they are able, by their own exertions, to 
provide themselves with clothes for the purpose, it is of the utmost 
importance that the schoolmasters be men of piety and intelligence. 
Many parents might provide tlieir children with such clothes as 
would enable them to go to church, if there was a willing mmd. 
The industry of the young people themselves in this matter is 
very commendable. One additional school is required for Walls, 
which, it is hoped, will soon be provided. The district for which 
it is needed contains upwards of 300 persons. Scarcely any school 
fees can be got from the scholars. 

Poor.— The poor are very easily supported, atid in the follow- 
ing manner : The parish is divided into sections ; and when a poor 
pe°ron has no relations who can support him, he is assigned to one 
of these,— the inhabitants of which receive him into their houses

in rotation and board him, while the poor's fund supplies what is 
required for clothing. This fund is derived from collections made 
at the doors of the churches, and amounts to about L.IO annually-

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF BURAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. WILLIAM WATSON, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

The united parishes consist of the Island of Fetlar and the 
north part of the Island of Yell. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Fetlar is in north latitude between 
about 60° 34' and 60° 38' by Thomas's chart ; bounded on the 
east, by the German Ocean ; south, by the wide frith separating 
it from Whalsay and the mainland ; west, by Colgrave Sound be- 
tween it and Yell ; and north, by the Sound which separates it 
from Unst and Isle of Uyea. It is 7 miles long and 4 miles broad. 

North Yell is in latitude between 60° 07' and 60° 4.'3' ; bounded 
on the east, by Blue Mull Sound, separating it from Unst ; south, 
by Mid Yell ; west and north, by the Northern Ocean. Length, 
G miles ; breadth, 5 miles. 

The figure of both is very irregular, being indented by nume- 
rous bays and inlets of the sea. There are no mountain ranges 
but several hills, none of which rise more than 300 feet above the 
level of the sea. In both parishes, there are some fertile valleys. 

The coasts, both of Fetlar and North Yell, are of great extent, 
owing to the many bays in both. In P'etlar, the principal bays are, 
Tresta, sandy ; Aith Bay, pebbly; Funzic, the only liiig-iishing 
station in the island; Gruting Voc, pebbly; Urie, where there is 
a kind of pier lately built; Sand, a small sandy bay ; and Mowick, 
where the jieoplc of the east part of the island bring down their 
peats from the hill of Lambhoga, to be transported iiome by sea.. 

The principal bays in North Yell are, Basta Voe, a broad. 



24 



SHETLAND. 



deep, shingly bay ; Gloup Voe, long, narrow, and partly sandy ; 
Sand of Brecon, Papal, and Cullivoe. 

Our climate is mild but moist ; snow seldom lies more than 
three or four days at a time. Rheumatism and stomach com- 
plaints are very prevalent, and sometimes fever comes amongst 
usj but is seldom very fatal. North Yell is said to be more healthy- 
thau Fetlar. 

Hydrography. — Colgrave Sound bounds Fetlar from south-west 
to north-west: it is about nine miles broad between Lambhoga in 
Fetlar, and Burravoe in South Yell, and three miles broad be- 
tween Hammersness in Fetlar, and Burraness in North Yell. 
The Sound between Fetlar and Unst, is about six miles broad, and 
Blue Mull Sound, betwixt North Yell and Unst, about one or two 
miles, where narrowest. In all these sounds, but particularly in 
Blue Mull Sound, the tides run at a very rapid rate, so strong 
when wind and tide are contrary, that no boat or vessel could at- 
tempt to stem them. 

We have some mineral springs but of no account, and no lochs 
of any consequence, though numerous small ones. The largest is 
in Fetlar, in the neighbourhood of the manse, which may be three- 
fourths of a mile long, and one-fourth broad. 

Geology. — Serpentine, containing chromate of iron, is an abun- 
dant rock; associated with the serpentine are deposits of mica 
slate, quartz rock, gneiss, chlorite slate, and clay slate. We may 
add to our list of rocks, diallage rock, syenite and syenitic green- 
stone, and granite in veins. 

Zoology. — Sea-fowl in abundance breed on our rocks and holms, 
and many eggs are taken in the breeding season. Scarths, gulls, 
kittiwakes, marrots, mother Carey's chickens, and ducks of vari- 
ous kinds, abound. The wild swan pays us a visit in considerable 
numbers, going north and returning. Of land-fowls we have the 
corbie, the hooded-crow, the hawk, the grey plover, sparrow, 
•linnet, starling, blackbird, wren, snowfleck. The mother Carey's 
chickens breed in deserted rabbit holes in the holms. The plovers,, 
starlings, linnets, sparrows, snowflecks, and corn huntings are found 
in large flocks. I have seen only one or two robins, and once heard 
the cry of the cuckoo. The corncraik comes to us in summer, 
and wild pigeons are in abundance. 

Our breed of cattle and ponies is small but hardy. A good num- 
ber of both is sold every year ; fat cattle, from L.2 to L.y ; ponies, 



FETLAIl AND NOUTH VELL. 



25 



from L.l, 10s. to L.5. The prices o{ both have been consider- 
ably raised since the steamer commenced. 

A mixed breed of sheep was, some years ago, introduced into 
Fetlar, by Sir Arthur Nicolson, and scab, which was unknown 
among the native breed, was introduced along with them. This 
mixed breed does not seem to thrive well. 

In the small lochs there is plenty of trout, which go up the bum 
to spawn about the end of September. Ling, cod, haddock, tur- 
bot, seath and flounders, are found in our friths and bays, sillocks 
and piltocks all along our shores. Limpets and welks are com- 
mon. The limpet is used for bait to catch haddock, sillock, and 
piltock. Spouts and large muscles are sometimes driven ashore in 
stormy weather. Large oysters are dragged in Bastavoe ; and 
some spouts are taken in Gloupvoe. 

There are no forests of any kind iu the parish. A few stunt- 
ed trees and bushes drag out a miserable existence in some of the 
gardens. A few apples have grown in the manse garden, also 
some gooseberries, currants, and strawberries. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — There are 28 proprietors in Fetlar and North 
Yell, of whom the chief are. Lord Dundas, Sir Arthur Nicolson, 
and William Mouat, Esq. ' 

Parochial Registers. — No parochial register is to be found, of 
older date than 1754: it commences with the ordination of Mr Gor- 
don on the 12th June of that year, and was irregularly kept till 1803, 
when a new book was begun, in which the births and marriages 
are pretty regularly entered ; but there are no entries of deaths. 

Antiquities. — In antiquities, we are not behind our neighbours, 
if any body thought it worth while to investigate them. We have 
St Hillary's kirk above Feal, Old kirk at Fetchie Burn, Roman 
Catholic chapels at Oddsta, Urie, Rossiter, Gruting, Strand, 
Hubie, Funzie, North Dale, Roman camp at Snawburgh, Pictish 
forts at brough of Hubie and Aithsness, two round Pictish build- 
ings at Aithsness, several fonts dug up at Aithsness, some urns 
at Stackaberg with ashes, and bones among the ashes, stone urns 
dug up in the manse yard in 1828, old burial place at Hammers- 
field, where the bodies have been burnt, numbers of small round 
tumuli among the hills. All these in Fetlar. In North Yell, is 
a brough at Burraness almost entire, and another at Brough, 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern buildings which we have 
m i'etlar are, a nondescript kind of house, designed for a mansion- 



26 



SHETLAND. 



house, by Sir Arthur Nicolson, and a modern mansion-house, be- 
longing to Mr Smith, an heritor, both built of graystone from 
quarries in their neighbourhood. 

In North Yell, are several modern buildings, — the church, the 
houses of Gloup, Midbrake, and Greenbank, all built of stone 
from their neighbourhood, with some freestone from Lerwick, for 
lintels to doors, windows, &amp;c. 

III. — Population. 

Dr Webster's report in 1735 is the oldest authentic statement, and it stales the 

population of the two parishes at 1098

The probable causes of this increase are, 1st, no drains from 
the parish since the peace ; 2d, no epidemical diseases; Sd, early 
marriages; 4th, the introduction of vaccination. 

All our population resides in the country. We have no towns 
or villages.

The people are not remarkable for any personal qualities. 
There are, in the two parishes, two insane persons, two silly, three 
blind, one deaf and dumb. 

The people are social enough among themselves, — sympathize 
with one another,— are apt to murmur at their high rents,— are not 
intemperate, since smuggling has been almost entirely put down ; 
but, within these few years, they have fallen into an abominable 
habit of smoking tobacco.

IV. — Industry. 
All the males in the two parishes, except a few to be hereafter 
mentioned, are employed in agriculture.' Those who are employ- 
ed in the home fishery, have all something to do with the cultiva- 
tion of land, as heads of families, or children, or servants belong- 
ing to the family. There cannot be said to be any manufactures 
among us. A few, at their leisure intervals from the work of the 
farm or fishing, for these two occupations are conjoined, employ 
themselves in weaving " hame claith," or in making and mending 
clothes or shoes. In the two parishes, there may be ten or twelve 
persons, who are chiefly employed as masons; but all of these have 
small farms, and most of them are engaged in the herring-fishing 
in the season. In Fetlar, there are two retail merchants for tea, 
spirits, cloths, &amp;c. and the same number in North Yell. There 
are in Fetlar, 123 men at the ling and herring fishing; 32 at Green- 
land and Davis' Straits; and 26 superannuated labourers. In 
North Yell, there are 128 ling and herring fishers; 25 at Green- 
land and Davis' Straits; and about the same number superannu- 
ated. 

We cannot reckon, in the two parishes, more than five or six 
men-servants, all above 20. Of women-servants, there are 38 in 
Fetlar, and 44 in North Yell. 

Jfjriculture. — I cannot give an accurate account of the number 
of acres cultivated and uncultivated in the two parishes; but there 
are in Fetlar 786f merks, and in North Yell, 634 merks of cul- 
tivated land, each merk being about three-fourths of an acre. 
Of uncultivated land, there may be in Fetlar from 10,000 to 
12,000 acres, all undivided common, except 1200 acres, and a 
great proportion of which might be cultivated with a profitable 
application of capital. 

In North Yell, there may be from 12,000 to 15,000 acres un- 
cultivated, all undivided common ; much of which might be im- 
proved, though it is much more rugged than Fetlar, and not 
nearly so capable of being cultivated. . 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land in Fetlar is about 
16s. per merk, and in North Yell, about L. 1, with privilege of 
hill pasture. The expense of grazing an ox or cow for the sum- 
mer is 6s., and a sheep for the year Is. 6d. T 

Prices — The price of oats per lispund of 32 lbs. is Is. 9d.; of 
bear, Is. 8d. ; of potatoes, 6d. per anker of 10 gallons; wool, 
from 8d. to Is. per pound ; wadmal or claith, from Is. to Is. 4d. ; 



28- 



SHETLAND. 



Stockings, from Is. to 5s. and upwards. Stockings made in Fet- 
lar have been sold as high as L. 2, 2s. per pair ; gloves from 6d. 
to lOs. per pair. 

Live-Stock. — A mixed breed of sheep has been introduced into 
Fetlar. The old breed is kept up in North Yell, which, 
though much smaller, and producing less wool, seems to stand 
our climate much better, to be hardier, and to have fewer diseases 
than the new breed. The cattle are small, and no attention is 
paid to their improvement. My own cows are a kind of cross, 
considerably larger than any in the parish ; but they are not so 
hardy, require considerably more food and attention, and are not 
so easily fatted as the pure Shetland breed. 

The character of our husbandry is very slovenly, there being 
only four ploughs in Fetlar, and one in North Yell. The infield 
rotation in Fetlar is varied; 1. potatoes bear with manure above, 
lea, two crops of oats, then potatoes ; 2. potatoes, oats, bear with 
manure below, oats, then potatoes; 3. potatoes, two crops of oats, 
bear with manure below, then potatoes. 

The first rotation is accounted the best ; and when the bear 
comes after potatoes, the ground is neither ploughed nor dug, but 
scratched with a harrow after sovi-ing, and the manure spread- 
above. 

Outfield Rotation. — Oats and lea alternately. The oats are 
found to be more fertile in this way, especially when manured. 

In North Yell, the land is cropped every year. Rotation — bear, 
oats, potatoes ; but the land must be manured every year, except 
to potatoes, which are always planted in infield ground. The small 
gray oat is generally used, and this, from never changing the seed, 
has degenerated so far as to be little larger than rye-grass seeds. 
Potato oats, and other kinds of white oats have been tried by a 
few, but they seldom ripen, and are more liable to be shaken than 
the gray oats, though in good ground they grow very luxuriantly. 
Barley has been tried in a few places, and in good years has suc- 
ceeded tolerably. Wheat has also been tried in North Yell, with 
indifferent success. We want enclosures to protect, and sun to 
ripen it. 

Very few outsets have been made in Fetlar ; a good many in 
North Yell. By these, a considerable quantity of hill ground has 
been brought in, to the great displeasure of those who occupy the 
rental laud, as they curtail their hill pasture, and thereby render 
their farms less valuable, though they pay the same rents as before 



FETLAR AND NORTH YELL. 



29 



the outsets were made. We have no system of drainins:, irrio-a- 
tion, or embanking, by which either the old or the new lands can 
be properly improved. Indeed, there is no encour;igement for im- 
provement, — all except a very few being tenants at will on a rack- 
rent, their farm-buildings in general most wretched, and no en- 
closures except paltry ring-fences of turf. Where any improve- 
ment is made, a neighbour, envying the industrious tenant, goes to 
the laird, and offers a shilling or two per merk more rent, when 
the improver must either pay this additional rent, or flit at next 
term. 

Mr Jerom Johnson, a small udaller, who had been a consider- 
able time in the army, at Gibraltar, Minorca, and with General 
Abercromby in Egypt, on his return home, more than five and 
twenty years ago, made great improvement on his kail-yard, con- 
verting it into a neat, small garden, where he cultivates currant 
bushes, and other shrubs, flowers, turnip, onions, pease, carrots, 
and tobacco. He claims the honour of being the first who intro- 
duced field turnip into Fetlar. 

Mr George Lyle has, of late years, rented a small spot, of 
formerly barren ground, between two and three acres, which 
he has enclosed, and in which he cultivates with success, Scots 
oats and barley, field and garden turnip, cabbage, greens, and 
pease, though he holds a lease of only seven years. This shows 
what might be done, if landlords would give encouragement by 
granting leases, and giving proper accommodation to their te- 
nants. 

Quarries.— Some years ago, there was a quarry of chromate of 
iron wrought in this island; but it is exhausted, and no other has 
since been opened. Wherever houses are to be built, quarries 
are opened in their neighbourhood, and the necessary quantity of 
stones taken for the purpose required,— after which, they are "de- 
serted. 

Fisheries — The fisheries are a most important branch of our 
statistics. If prosecuted with vigour, they would prove to us an 
mexhaustible mine of wealth. But in this, as in most other 
branches of our economy, we are far behind in the race of im- 
provement. Our boats are too small, and our means too limited, 
to enable us to make the proper exertions. Nevertheless, we are 
dmng something; and, being well situated for the prosecution both 
of hng and herring-fishing, it is hoped that in time we may make 



30 



SHETLAND. 



greater progress. The ling- fishing has been long carried on, and 
formerly to greater advantage than of late years. The grievous 
catastrophe of 1832 seems greatly to have damped the spirit of 
our fishermen. The ling-fishing is carried on from Funzie, on 
the east side of Fetlar, and from Gloup, on the north side of Yell, 
the former open to the Eastern, the latter to the Northern Ocean. 
But there are various other stations, in both parishes, where her- 
rings are cured. 

Though innumerable shoals of herrings yearly traverse our seas, 
and though our neighbours, the Dutch, have for centuries been 
battening on our wealth, it is but of very late years that Shetland 
has begun to avail herself of her own stores. There is not a more 
commodious station for the herring-fishing in the whole of Shet- 
land, than the Island of Fetlar. About the end of June or begin- 
ning of July, the herrings set into our bays, and continue with us 
till the middle of October. Some suppose that they remain all 
the winter, but this I will not affirm. Blow from whatever airth 
the wind may, the boats have shelter, for the fish surround the 
whole island. Boats from other parishes fish herrings in our bays, 
and are often obliged, by stress of weather, to land in our island, 
and sell their fish to any curer that will buy them, and at any 
price he chooses to give. 

There are "three herring-curing stations in Fetlar, viz. Urie, 
Strand, and Aithbanks, and two in North Yell, Cullivoe, and 
Bayanne: the North Yell boats coming out every evening to 
our shores, and returning in the morning when the weather per- 
mits. 

Formerly, it was the custom in Fetlar for every tenant to keep 
up one-sixth of a boat for the ling-fishing, furnishing lines and 
other materials himself, and to give his fish to the landlord or 
tacksman at a certain rate. For a few years back, the mode here 
has been for the fish-curers to give boats and lines free to the 
fishermen, and to receive their fish at a reduced price. 

In North Yell, most of the tenants still keep up boats and lines 
for themselves, giving their landlords or tacksmen their fish at 
the current price ; but they are prohibited from selling their fish 
to any but the landlord or his tacksman. In the herring-fishing, 
again, the Fetlar men furnish their own boats and nets, and are 
obliged to deliver their herrings to the tacksmen at the current 
price. The North Yell men generally use their own boats, re-

ceive nets from the landlord or his tacksman, giving the half of 
the produce for the use of the nets, and selling the other half to 
him — the landlord, or tacksman, and no other, for the current 
price. 

The following statement of the fishing in Fetlar and North 
Yell, may not be uninteresting.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns.— The nearest market-town is Lerwick, the ca- 
pital of Shetland, distant from thirty to forty miles by sea, of a 
dangerous navigation ; boats are frequently lost in the passage. 

Means of Communication.— There is no post-office in Fetlar. 
Our letters often lie weeks on the way. In North Yell, there is 
a country post-office, which has communication with Lerwick 
twice a-week. We have no turnpike roads— no roads of any 
kind— not even sheep tracks, but must guide our way by rneaths 
from hill to hill, and from toon to toon. No public carriages, no 
railroads or bridges; no canals, no harbours, but some open 
roadsteads, as Tresta Voe, Strandwick and Urie, in Fetlar ; Bas- 
ta Voe and CuUivoe in North Yell. Of these, Basta Voe and 
Cullivoe are pretty safe; the others very unsafe, except in the 

height of summer. . 

Ecclesiastical State.-ln both parishes, the churches are situat- 
ed close upon the sea-shore,-that of Fetlar at betwixt four and 
five miles distance from the farthest extremity of the island south- 
east; that of North Yell, at betwixt five and six mdes from the 
farthest extremity south. 

The church of Fetlar was rebuilt in 1790, and is much too 
.mall for the accommodation of the parish, having legal sitting, 
communion forms included, for only 267 persons. The exami- 
nable persons in the parish are 553. The communicants at last 
sncfament, in May last, were 372, all parishioners of Fetlar. 

The church of North Yell was built in 1832 ; and, notwith- 
standing the repeated remonstrances of the minister, for which he 
tnbiected himself to much obloquy and ill-will, it is too small 
having legal accommodation only for 327, including sacramental 

 Shortest net 32 yards long, by twelve score meshes deep. Longest net 50 yards 
iong, by fifteen score meshes deep.

forms. The examinable persons are 614; and the communicants 
at last sacrament, the Sabbath after Fetlar, 399, all parishioners 
of North Yell. The communion forms are the only free sittings. 

The manse was built in 1756, out of the vacant stipend; re- 
paired in 1805, again in 1824, and again in 1833. Still, it is very 
uncomfortable, exceedingly damp, being built in a morass. Hence 
the walls draw water like a syphon. Neither books, nor clothes, 
nor provisions will keep in it; and, although a good deal of money 
has been expended on it, the minister has neither comfort nor pro- 
per accommodation in it. 

The glebe consists of 12 merks, and would let for L. 9. 

The stipend is L. 180, including communion elements. Were 
taxes, and expense of ravelling to his church in North Yell, and 
to Presbyteries, to be deducted, the minister's clear yearly income 
would not amount to L. 150. 

There is one chapel in Fetlar belonging to the Methodists. 
It may be said that all the families in both parishes attend the 
Established Church, there being no families that I know, the whole 
members of which are Methodists ; but there are individuals to 
the number of from 20 to 30 in Fetlar, and from 10 to 15 in 
North Yell, that are connected with the Methodists. In good 
weather, the Established Church is generally thronged ; on sa- 
cramental occasions, crowded almost to suffocation. 

The church collections in Fetlar last year, including commu- 
nion, amounted to L.6, Is. 8d. ; in North Yell, L.6, 15s. 9d. 

Education.— There is one parochial school in North Yell, and 
one private; one Society school in Fetlar, two private. The 
branches taught in the parochial and Society's schools are, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and navigation. The 
parochial schoolmaster has the minimum salary;" the Society 
schoolmaster L.15. Their emoluments from scholars are small, 
not more than L. 8 at most.

ter m December 1834, it was found that there were in

The reason that North Yell is behind Foliar in education is 

SIIETLANn.  



34 



SHETLAND. 



that Fetlar has had a Society school estabhshed in it, for a consi- 
derable number of years ; and it is only eight years since the pa- 
rish school has been fixed in North Yell. The people in neither 
parish are so much alive to the benefits of education as could be 
wished. 

There are, on the west side of Fetlar, two schools for children 
who are not able to attend at the Society's school,— one taught 
by a woman permanently through the year; the other by a lad 
during the winter quarter. Each of them has from 20 to 30 
scholars. There is, besides, an old man who has 5 or G children 
attending him ; his number seldom amounting to 10. 

North Yell, though it has the advantage of the parish school, 
and a good teacher, is not so well provided with the means 
of education. The parish school is situated near the north end 
of the parish, and is convenient only for the inhabitants of the 
north, leaving those of the south quite destitute. Some years 
ago, a subscription was entered into for building a school and 
school-house for the accommodation of that destitute quarter; 
but, though the minister subscribed L. 5, 5s. from his own family, 
the whole subscriptions did not amount to L. 19. The expense 
would have been more than four times the sum raised ; so the 
scheme was dropped ; and as the people are neither richer nor 
more willing now, it need not be resumed. On a visit to that 
quarter lately, I found that upwards of 130 scholars betwixt five 
and eithteen might attend a school, were there one in the neigh- 
bourho°od. Nothing Has been done to supply this deficiency, and 
nothing can be done by the parish on account of its poverty. Un- 
less subscriptions can be obtained in the south for a school and 
school-house, the parish must still suffer. 

Library.— ThexQ is a parochial library in Fetlar, containing 200 
volumes, mostly religious. There are about thirty subscribers at Is. 
a-vear. In North Yell, there is also a small one ; but it is falling olt. 

Poor.— Our poor are quartered on the several districts of tlie pa- 
rish, being maintained by the inhabitants of those districts, and re- 
ceiving a small sum annually for clothing from the poor s fund 
There are only 13 in Fetlar receiving out of the poors funds, and 

7 or 8 in North Yell. 

Puhlic-Houses.-i:hQre are two houses in Fetlar licensed to 

sell spirits, and as many in North Yell. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written there has been 



FETLAU AND NORTH YELL. 



35 



a considerable increase in the number of inhabitants. The pa- 
rishes are susceptible of much improvement, were a better system 
of husbandry introduced, — were farms enlarged, and nineteen 
years leases granted. But the people are rather of a rambling 
turn ; do not like to be confined to one place ; are often flitting 
from mere caprice ; frequently remove to Lerwick, where they 
think they will be free of voar and harvest labour; and, after hav- 
ing spent, in Lerwick, what little they have saved here, return des- 
titute, and are glad to get a bit of land, probably much inferior 
to what they possessed years before. 



Since the above was written, a fearful increase of destitution 
has taken place. The three or four years of famine preceding 
the last harvest have completely impoverished almost every family 
in the two parishes, and the poor have increased far beyond the 
means in our power to relieve them. In the years of famine, the 
parish poor had more good meal supplied them, than they could 
ever before command; for the stores sent us by the benevolence of 
our brethren in Scotland and England though the portion given 
to our poor was very scanty in comparison were regularly doled 
out to them, and gave them a more abundant supply than they 
could have received from their own country produce, even in the 
best years. But now, since this source has been closed up, and 
those by whom they used to be maintained can hardly maintain 
themselves, I know not what is to become of them. Our rich he- 
ritors are non-resident, and, though written to repeatedly, have not 
responded very satisfactorily to our calls ; and the resident small 
heritors have enough to do with themselves. 

In addition to the temporal wants of these parishes, they suffer 
much from spiritual destitution. 

From the difficulties of travelling, the parish of North Yell must 
often be without sermon for many weeks ; and in the most favour- 
able circumstances there can be sermon there only once a fortnight. 
From the poverty of the parish nothing can be done to remedy 
this evil ; and, unless the Committee on the Royal Bounty wiU 
place an ordained minister in North Yell to take the spiritual charge 
of that parish, it must still continue in that neglected state-

PRESBYTERY OF BURRAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JAMES INGRAM, A. M. MINISTER. 

THE REV. JOHN INGRAM, A. M. Assistant and Successor. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, 8fc. — The island of Unst, of which this parish 
consists, lies in north latitude 60° 45' ; west longitude 50'. Its 
length from south to north is 12 miles, and its mean breadth three 
miles. Its form approaches to an oblong square, and it contains 
upwards of 36 square miles or 24,000 acres. It is separated from 
the island of Yell by Blumel Sound, on the south-west, a rapid 
tide-way of about a mile in breadth ; and from Fetlar, on the 
south side, by a sound four miles broad. It has the German 
Ocean on the east and north, and the Atlantic on its west coast. 

Topographical Appearances. — A considerable proportion of its 
surface is dry and level, when compared with many oilier 
parts of Zetland ; and although it has not yet the advantage of 
turnpike roads, one can ride from one end of it to the other 
without meeting any obstructions. Hills of a moderate height di- 
versify its scenery. Valleyfield, nearly 700 feet in height, runs 
along the western coast, and forms a strong barrier against 
the fierce assaults of the Atlantic, which, notwithstanding, dashes 
its huge billows against it with such fury, during a north-west gale, 
that foam and spray are thrown over it, into the valley on its 
eastern side, and strongly impregnate with salt every green herb. 
This hill terminates in a long projecting headland, called Herman- 
ness from a hero who is said to have landed, in days of old, on 
these shores, the most northern point of the island, and of her 
Majesty's dominions. On the east side of this hill, is a valley, 
extending from Uyea Sound in the south, toBurrafirth in the north, 
almost the whole length of the island ; and in it there is a continued 
chain of lochs, which empty themselves, — one part of them, into 
the sea at Uyea Sound, — the other part, at Burrafrith. The 
lochs in the south division, from their dimensions, are called the 
small waters. The loch of Watly, the first in the northern chain, 



UN ST. 



3r 

is one mile long; the next to it is the Loch of Cliff, tliree miles 
long. An arm of the latter runs towards the east, on the north 
side of the hill of Crucifield, for nearly a mile, and is called the 
Loch of QuoyhoLise. Saxa Vord, a hill of 938 feet in heioht 
on the east side of the bay of Burrafirth, rises abruptly from the 
sea, and its bluff round-head, showing itself considerably above 
every other point of land in its neighbourhood, makes a very con- 
spicuous mark for fishermen, along the whole eastern coast. Cru- 
cifield runs from west to east, at right angles with Valleyfield, 
and separated from it by the loch of Cliff, and terminates in its 
eastern extremity in two conical points called Heogs, one of them, 
much higher than the other, and supposed to have been anciently 
a place where courts of law were held, and where criminals were 
executed. This hill lies nearly across the middle of the island, 
and separates the Mid from the North parish. A little to the 
south-east of Crucifield is a high headland, called the Keen of 
Hammer, query the Celtic Cean, which forms one side of the 
north entrance to Balta Sound. The Vord Hill, on the south side 
of the voe or harbour, stretches along the east coast. Valleyfield 
and Saxa Vord, and the hills connected with them, are covered 
with peat-moss, an article most useful in this northern climate, 
where no coal has yet been discovered. To the eastward of the 
valley which runs along the base of Valleyfield, and following the 
course of the Loch of Cliff, and turning off by the Loch of Quoy- 
house, all that section of the island to the south and east except- 
ing some small spots in the south-east extremity, is completely 
denuded of moss, and has a bare stony appearance. Notwithstand- 
mg. It yields excellent pasture for the native horses and sheep 
which thrive remarkably well upon it. This section is composed 
principally of serpentine, hornblende, and diallage rocks. The hills 
to the north and west are chiefly composed of gneiss. 

Caves.— There are a variety of caves roundhe coast, but not 
vvorthy of notice. Under a very high and precipitous rock, which 
forms the north-eastern base of Saxa Vord, a noted haunt of kit- 
tiwakes and other aquatic birds, there is a grand natural arch, 
having sufficient breadth and depth of water to admit a boat to be 
rowed through it; it is 300 feet in length, and of considerable height. 
PnfnT -C'Mfain Thomas of the Investigator, who has been 

ployed for some years in surveying the coasts of Zetland, has 
Deen very particular in his survey of this island, both alono- its 
coast and ,n the interior. When his chart appears, it will furnish 



38 



SHETLAND. 



all the information that can be wished for, as to the form and ex- 
tent of the coast, &amp;c. The shores of Unst, like every other part 
of Zetland, are deeply indented by numerous bays and creeks, 
some of which are low and sandy. The intervening headlands, 
especially in the north-east, north, and west coasts, are bold, high, 
precipitous rocks. The principal bays are, Burrafirth, on the 
north; Norwick, and Haroldswick, and Sandwick, on the east; 
Watswick and Wick, on the south-west ; and Woodwick, on the 
west side. None of these are safe harbours. Burrafirth and Nor- 
wick are two deep sandy bays, quite open towards the sea. Both 
have a very romantic appearance, and a considerable extent of 
good land on their shores, and are much admired by strangers 
who occasionally visit this island. The only safe harbours are, 
Balta Sound, on the east coast, about the middle of the island, 
completely covered from the sea by the grazing island of Balta, 
the property of Thomas Edmondston, Esq. of Buness, whose ma- 
nor house is situated near the bottom of the Voe, or harbour; and 
Uyea Sound, on the south, covered by the island of Uyea, about 
a mile and a half long, and one mile in breadth, an appendage of 
this parish, and the property of Thomas Leisk, Esq. The 
grazing islands of Haaf Grunie and Huna, and the holms of bka, 
Burrafirth, Woodwick, Newgord, Heogaland, and Weatherholm, 
belong to the proprietors of Unst, and lie along its shores, afford- 
ino- pasture for a considerable number of black-cattle and sheep. 

''Hydrography.-The streams of tide off some of the extreme 
points, especially off Hermanness, Ska, and Lambaness, are so 
vapid and turbulent, that it is extremely dangerous, and often im- 
possible for boats to cross them, even in moderate weather, and it 
not unfrequently happens that they perish in the attempt. 

Perennial springs of excellent fresh water are most copious and 
abundant in every part of the island; but there is nothing remark- 
able either in their situation or character. 

Gcofow.— The chief rocks in this island are, gneiss, serpen- 
tine, diallage rock, and chlorite slate. Besides these the foUow- 
incr may also be enumerated, viz. talc slate, protogme, limestone, 
quartz rock, hornblende rock, and mica slate. The most import- 
ant ore is the chrome ore, or chromate of iron.

proprietors, possessing from 20 down to 3 merks of land. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are of very mo- 
dern date. The first entry is made in October 1776. No doubt, 
records must have existed, at a much more remote period ; but 
after the most diligent inquiry, not the least vestige of them can 
now be traced. 

Antiquities. — Around the island, and so situated, that the one 
can be seen from the next in order, is a continued line of ruinous 
buildings, called Pict's houses, or castles, or burghs, — round tow- 
ers, open in the top, with massy walls, built of large stones. Some 
of them stand in the midst of small lochs ; some on projecting 
headlands on the margin of the sea ; and others on level ground, 
and surrounded by two or three ditches or moats. According to 
tradition, they were used as watch-towers, for the purpose of com- 
municating, by means of smoke, intelligence of the approach of 
an enemy; and this could be speedily done overall Zetland. At 
Muness, in the south-east quarter, there is a ruinous feudal castle, 
now the property of William Mouat, Esq. of Garth, which bears 
over the main entrance the date 1598, together with the follow- 
ing inscription ; 

List ye to knaw this building quha began, 
Lauranee the Bruce, he was that worthy man, 
Quha earnestlie his ayris and aflspring prayis, 
To help and not to hurt this wark alwayis. 

This Laurence Bruce is said to have been of the family of Cults- 
malindie, in Perthshire, and to have fled hither, in consequence of 
having slain a neighbour in an affray. The castle is an oblong 
square, 60 feet by 18 within the wall, and 24 in height. At each 
of the four angles, is a tower. Two of these are hanging ; the 
other two rise from the ground. On the hill of Crucifield, are 
some concentric circles of earth and stone, with eminences raised 
in the middle, where, perhaps, in the days of Paganism, the priest 
of Odin had performed his unholy rites. . . . Two ancient obe- 
lisks, or standing stones, are to be seen, the one near Greenwell, 
a rude, unshapely mass ; the other near Uyea Sound, higher and

•more tapering, but without any inscription or traditionary story. 
Each is supposed to commemorate the site of a battle when some 
renowned warrior fell. 

The ruins or some vestige of an ancient chapel, are found at 
every turning. No fewer than twenty-four, at some remote pe- 
riod, have been standing in this parish. One of them, called the 
Cross Kirk, or St Cruz, in the neighbourhood of Haroldswick, is 
still accounted a holy place, and occasional pilgrimages are made 
to it by some of the older inhabitants, whose minds are not yet 
emancipated from the Popish superstitions of their ancestors. 
There are six burying-places in the parish, around the ruins of 
so many old kirks, viz. at Norwich, Haroldswick, Balliasta, Sand- 
wick, Wick, and Uyea. The Rev. William Archibald, who offi- 
ciated as clergyman of this parish, from the year 1735 to 1785, 
preached, by rotation, in three of these kirks for many years, viz. at 
Haroldswick, Balliasta, and Wick. The manse, then at Norwick, 
was one mile to the northward of Haroldswick, four to the north- 
ward of Balliasta, and nine miles to the northward of Wick. A 
number of stone urns were found in the island of Uyea some years 
ago, filled with bones and ashes, and deposited beneath a heap of 
stones and earth. They are supposed to be of Scandinavian origin. 

Modern Buildings,-r-K very neat new church forms a very con- 
spicuous object, as seen from a vessel entering the Voe or har- 
bour of Balta Sound, and, with the exception of the school- 
house, this is the only public building in the parish. Of private 
buildings a considerable number has been reared within these 
few years. Mr Edmondston has built a new manor-house at 
Buness, and two other dwelling-houses in his vicinity ; and at 
Uyea Sound, Mr Mouat has built a lodge for his own accom- 
modation, when he visits that part of his property which lies 
in Unst; and a range of neat houses along the shores of the har- 
bour, for dwelling-houses; a shop for merchandise; warehouses; 
and workshops for a blacksmith, boat-carpenters, and a cooper. 
The water-mills for grinding corn are the same as they have been 
for centuries, exceedingly simple, but answering the purpose very 
well. Every neighbourhood has its own mill, and every farmer is 
his own miller. The mills are minutely described in the old Sta- 
tistical Account. 

HI. — Population. 
There is reason to believe that this island had a numerous po- 



UNST. 



41 



|Hilatioii at a very remote period. The vestiges of houses and 
stone-fences, now in ruins, and grown ovei-- with grass, or buried 
in moss, are no indistinct indications of this. In former days, the 
inhabitants had but little intercourse with other countries, and had 
to depend chiefly on their own resources ; the healing art was 
little known amongst them, — perhaps not one medical practitioner 
in the land. In 1729, and again in 1740, the small-pox appeared in 
Zetland in such a virulent form, and made such havock, almost de- 
populating some districts, that they are yet spoken of under the name 
of the mortal pox. Accordingly, we find, that, subsequent to that 
time, the population was very low ; for, in the year 1755, it consisted 
only of 1368 souls. From that period, the increase has been steady 
and rapid. In 1780, it had risen to 1853; in 1790, to 1988; 
and in 1831, to 2909 souls. 

Vaccination, which has been resorted to ever since the year 
1800, may be assigned as one cause of this great increase. An- 
other cause may be found in the very favourable seasons this 
country has enjoyed during the last thirty years. There has been no 
failure of crops; the fishing has been successful; and trade has 
greatly improved. 

There are six proprietors of land of the value of L. 50 and up- 
wards per annum. 

Much has been said, and much has been written, by men very 
superficially acquainted with the state of the country, about the 
wretchedness, the enslaved, and oppressed state of the peasantry. 
They have had all their information from hearsay, and have not 
given themselves the trouble to inquire after the truth, where they 
might have had it impartially stated to them ; and the consequence 
has been, that they have geen greatly imposed upon, and they, in 
their turn, have imposed upon others. They who have lived long 
amongst the people, and are intimately acquainted with their ways 
and means, and have seen the comforts they enjoy, can bear the most 
ample testimony to the fact, that there are but few of Her Majes- 
ty's subjects, of the same class, who are treated in a more kindly 
and indulgent manner by their superiors ; who enjoy so much li- 
berty ; who pass through life with so little labour or care; or 
who have more reason to be contented with the situation and cir- 
cumstances a kind Providence has assigned them. They do 
not live in affluence ; but they seldom want the necessaries, 
and they have many of the luxuries of life, with one-half of 



42 



SHETLAND. 



the toil that people of their class are doomed to undergo, in more 
genial climes. 

The inhabitants of Unst are remarked for being naturally a 
shrewd observing people, acute and discerning; and although they 
have not, until lately, had the advantage of schools, which highly- 
favoured Scotland has long enjoyed, yet many of them are well in- 
formed, can read well, and write an excellent hand, and keep ac- 
counts ; and, in respect of general knowledge, they may compete with 
those who have had superior opportunities. Their moral and re- 
ligious character is far from being so high as it could be wished 
to be. They are just what people generally are in the same 
circumstances, — some good, some bad ; but, in general, they ap- 
pear to have a thirst for religious knowledge ; and it is hoped, there 
are many amongst them who truly fear God. 

Smuggling was for a long time carried on in this place to 
a great extent, and was no doubt attended by the evils which 
naturally accompany that illegal traffic. It has scarcely been 
heard of, for these last twenty years, 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There are about 2000 imperial acres of arable land 
in the parish, most part of it yearly under crop. Nearly an equal 
quantity of meadow and grass land, connected with the arable, 
remains uncultivated. The meadows produce a considerable 
quantity of good natural hay ; and on the grass grounds, milch 
cows are pastured during the summer. The whole of the mea- 
dow and grass ground might be broken up, and with proper ma- 
nagement, converted into good corn land, and much of it has, 
within these few years past, been cultivated, and made to produce 
very tolerable crops, by some of the more industrious tenantry. 
But the greater part of the farmers being also fishermen, little at- 
tention comparatively is paid to agriculture. Indeed, the pursuits 
of fishing and farming seem to be incompatible with one another, 
in the same persons. The soil is, in many places, excellent. Un- 
der a better climate and more skilful management, it would yield 
the best of crops ; and even with all the disadvantages of climate, 
and the slovenly manner in which it is cultivated, it yields heavy 
crops of black oats, bear, and potatoes ; the latter not inferior to 
those produced in the best districts of Scotland. Some gentlemen 

 Since this Account was drawn up, the circumstances of the people have been sad- 
ly altered. A general failure of the crops, for five or six years in succession, has re- 
duced them to great poverty, and it must he long, even under the most favourable 
circumstances, before they can regain their former state. 



UN ST.

in this island, who have turned their attention to the subject, have 
raised very fair crops of Angus oats, and have proved that as good 
turnips, and rye-grass, and clover can be grown here as in any 
part of the kingdom, and that the climate and soil are peculiarly 
adapted for such crops. They have vastly improved the appear- 
ance of the farms under their own immediate management, and 
made them look like oases in the midst of a barren desert. 

Most of the farms are, to this day, lying run-rig, and, according 
to the old system, consist of outfield and infield. The outfield 
seldom receives any manure. It is turned over with the spade 
every alternate year, for, since the reduction of the size of the 
farms, ploughs amongst the tenantry have been wholly laid aside ; 
yet, notwithstanding of this treatment, the outfield land yields a 
fair average crop of black oats. The infield, or ground nearest 
the farm-house, is yearly manured, and on it they raise fine crops 
of bear and potatoes. If the farms were brought into a more com- 
pact form, and enclosed, a few of the more active and intelligent 
might be induced to sow turnips, and rye-grass, and clover, and 
thus produce an abundance of nutritious winter provender for their 
cattle, of which, under the present management, there is often 
great scarcity. 

None of the tenants, or but few of them, have leases, not that 
the land-owners are unwilling to grant them ; such is not the case, 
but because they are not disposed to take them. Many of them 
are so restless and fond of change, that they do not choose to 
bind themselves to remain for a fixed time in one place, and this 
is often the cause of much annoyance and loss to the proprietors 
of the soil, for it is not to be supposed that such tenants will take 
much trouble about the improvement of their land. It is seldom 
that the land-owners warn a tenant to remove, if he is honest and 
industrious, and there are many of the most substantial and re- 
spectable of the tenantry, who are now in the same houses and 
on the same farms which their fathers and grandfathers occupied 
before them, and some of them, by their industry, have doubled 
the ancient extent of their arable land. 

Many of the tenants have comfortable houses, built solely at 
the expense of the proprietors, at a cost not under three years 
rent of the land they occupy. 

As the extent of the commons or hills and unenclosed ground 
has never been ascertained by any actual survey, it can only be 
stated conjecturally. The truth, however, is not exceeded, when

sites besides, which will make up her fee to L. 1 more. Nehh r

paid, and when they are sober and economical they save money 
as living to them is comparatively cheap. A good stone-mason

day labourers, Is. a day. A house-carpenter can earn 2s. 6d. ; 
a boat's carpenter, as much ; a tailor, 2s. ; and a shoemaker, Is. 6d. 
a day. The rates at Lerwick may be somewhat different, and in 
some cases higher. 

Live-stock. — The breed of sheep, black-cattle, and horses, with 
a few exceptions, which cannot be mentioned as improvements, is 
much the same as it has been for time immemorial. The native 
breed is most suitable for the country and clituate, and under pro- 
per management, would be by far the most valuable. The cows, 
for their size, are excellent milkers, and their milk is of the very 
richest quality. The sheep, when attended to properly, carry re- 
markably 6ne wool, and their mutton is highly prized for its deli- 
cacy and flavour. But, what is the concern of a great number is 
the concern of nobody, and as the cattle go at large and feed pro- 
miscuously on the commons, no attention is paid to their breed, 
and, the consequence is, they are degenerating fast. This is re- 
markably the case with the fine, lively, sagacious, and active breed 
of native ponies. They are now much smaller in size than they 
were thirty years ago, entirely owing to the fact, that all the best 
and stoutest are exported, and stallions of the most puny size are 
allowed to go at larcre. 

Quarries and Mines. — Chromate of iron, discovered on this 
island by Professor Jameson, and afterwards found in large quan- 
tities by Dr Hibbert, in the course of his mineralogical survey, has 
been raised and carried to market in its crude state in considerable 
quantity, for which a very fair price was at first realized ; but of late, 
it has been discovered in Norway and in other places, and the free 
importation of it being allowed, the price now offered is very low. 
There are also limestone quarries at Cliff and in the neighbour- 
hood of Balliasta. The tenants of those districts are allowed to 
work the quarries, and to manufacture the stone into lime on their 
own account. The lime is usually sold at the rate of one shilling 
per barrel, and becomes a source of considerable emolument to 
those who engage in the work. 

Fisheries. — This is the most important branch of industry in 
Zetland, and which the men prosecute with much spirit and skill; 
and although often exposed to the most imminent danger, on a 
rough and boisterous sea, and although many valuable lives are 
often lost in this hazardous pursuit, as was the case in 1832, when 
seventeen boats with their crews, five of them belonging to this pa- 



SHETLAND. 



nsh, were overtaken by a dreadful storm, and buried in the sea  
yet with undaunted courage, they launch out in their small open 
skiffs, to a distance of thirty or forty miles from the shore, and 
appear to be more in their element when so employed, than in 
any other occupation. Their boats are now built somewhat larg- 
er than they were in former days. They measure from 18 to 22 
feet in length of keel, with six men in each, and they carry from 
60 to 100 ground lines, each 42 fathoms in length, with hooks 
fastened to them by a smaller line, of about 3 feet in length, and 
at the distance of 3 fathoms from each other. The boats and lines 
are either furnished by the fishermen, at their own expense, or 
hired out to them, by the land-owners, or others, who purchase 
their fish in a green state, and cure them for the market. When 
the fishing is successful, they may average from 80 to 100 cwt., for 
which they receive, from 5s. to 6s., and sometimes as high as 7s. 
per cwt. Ling, cod, and tusk, and seath or coal-fish, were long 
the only fish which were considered marketable, and of these greal 
numbers were caught, salted and dried, and sent to Spain, Ireland, 
and to Leith, and sold at from L. 12 to L. 22 per ton, for ling and 
tusk ; and from L. 9. to L. 12 for cod and seath. Immense shoals of 
herrings, annually, visit the coasts of Zetland, and every summer 
for a long series of years, the Dutch have fitted out a great num- 
ber of busses, which have appeared in swarms, in the harbours and 
along the shores of Zetland, and remained in the undisturbed pos- 
session of the herring fishery, to the great emolument of their 
country. It never entered into the minds of the Zetlanders, that 
they might with the greatest ease come in for a share of their gain, 

until within these fewyears, when somepublic spirited gentlemen have 
exerted themselves to rouse their countrymen to a sense of their 
own interests, and to engage in that lucrative branch of industry. 
The herring-fishery is now fairly begun, and promises to be 
a source of great additional wealth to the people. The land-owners, 
in general, furnish nets, which they either hire out to the fisher- 
men, or advance to them, at prime cost, to be paid for from 
the proceeds of the fish, within a time limited by agreement- 
They also provide casks, and salt, and take upon themselves the 
whole expense and risk of curing, and sending the herrings to 
market. The fishermen are paid so much per cran, and as there 
is a good deal of competition, they are sure of the highest price 
that can be afforded. The amount of fish cured and marked by 
the fishery officer in the year 1831 was as under:

Manufactures.— ATtic]es woollen hosiery, chiefly consistmg 

of stockings and gloves, are the principal manufacture in this pa- 
rish. They are knit by the females, and are highly prized for their 
softness and the beauty of their texture. The demand for Zetland 
hosiery is not nearly so great now as formerly ; yet the quantity 
sold is still very considerable. Stockings vary in price from Is. to 
10s. per pair, a few pairs of extraordinary fineness are sold for 
L,2 per pair, and gloves from Is. to 10s., or even sometimes as 
high as 15s. per pair. The only other manufacture of any account 
is a coarse kind of woollen cloth, which is dyed blue, black, or red, 
according to fancy, and constitutes a considerable part of the daily 
wear of both men and women, 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The only market-town in Zetland is Lerwick, at least forty 
miles distant from this parish by sea. Cattle are driven by land 
to be sold there, at very considerable expense, and with great 
toil, through bleak swampy mossy hills, without any trace of a 
road or bridge, and they have also to be transported in boats, 
over two sounds or arms of the sea, where the tide runs 
with extreme rapidity, and renders the passage uncertain and 
dangerous. When the inhabitants are disposed to sell any other 
part of their produce at Lerwick, they carry it thither in 
their own boats, and bring back with them such necessaries as 
their families stand in need of, and they can afford to purchase. 
Until about the year 1820, this was the only mode of communi- 
cation betwixt Unst arid Lerwick, where the general post-office is 
established, and all letters and newspapers coming from the 
southward had to remain there, to wait any opportunity that 
might occur, unless when it was found expedient to dispatch an 
express, at a considerable expense. To remedy this inconveni- 



4S. 



SHETLAND. 



ence experienced by all, some gentlemen residing in Lerwick, in 
the year 1820, entered into an agreement to engage a man to 
travel as post betwixt Lerwick and tbis place, and to call at se- 
veral intermediate stations, and to carry all such letters and papers 
as might be committed to his charge. People residing in the 
country parishes have some agent, or friend in Lerwick, who re- 
ceives their letters from the general post-office, and puts them into 
the hands of the person who is appointed to make up the mail for 
the landward districts, where there are receiving-houses conveni- 
ently situated. This plan has been found to answer extremely 
well. The post travels twice a-week, and greatly ' Gdds to the 
comfort of this remote parish and other parts of the country. 

Fences in general are of a very inferior kind. A ring fence, of 
turf and stone intermingled, about three feet high, surrounds 
townships, of from 80 to 100 merks of land, often belonging to 
different proprietors. Within this fence there are from 12 to 40 
small farms, for the most part lying run-rig ; and the consequence 
of this mode of division is, that the tenants cannot, if they had the 
inclination, raise crops of ryegrass and turnips, because it is not 
in their power to protect them from the cattle. The land-owners 
have good sufficient stone fences around their own farms, and they 
have them also subdivided into enclosures of six or seven acres 
€ach, and are thus enabled to have a judicious rotation of crops. 
They are now beginning to see the inconvenience to their tenants 
of the old system, and are having their farms laid in one spot, with 
the view, it is hoped, of enclosing them. Indeed, the work of en- 
closing has been going on, in a very spirited manner, for the last 
three years; and although this cannot be converted into an agricul- 
tural country — the pursuits of the people, as fishermen, the vari- 
ableness of the climate, and the want of good markets for any ex- 
tra produce, being insurmountable obstacles in the way, — yet there 
is good hope that such improvements may be effected, as will meet 
the demands of an increasing population, and enable the people to 
procure for themselves many additional comforts. 

Balta Sound, on the middle of the east coast, and Uyea Sound, at 
the south end of the island, already mentioned, are much frequent- 
ed harbours, and as good, and of as easy access, as any in the king- 
dom. It is much to be regretted, that there is no lighthouse to direct 
distressed mariners to their entrance. Such a work is as necessary 
on the north, as it has been fouud to be on the south extremity of

Zetland. Many a vessel tossed on the north sea, and in dark and 
stormy nights ready to be dashed against our rocks, would hail 
with joy the appearance of a light, by which they might be guid- 
ed to a safe place of refuge — and many valuable lives, and many 
a valuable cargo would thus be saved. There are two places where 
such an erection might be made, for the benefit of all vessels coming 
from the north and east, viz. Lambaness, a long projecting head- 
land which forms the north side of the bay of Norwick in Unst, and 
Strandiburgh in the Island of Fetlar. 

Ecclesiastical State, — The parish church is as nearly as possi- 
ble in the middle of the island, distant six miles from the northern 
and southern extremities, and one and a~half from the eastern and 
western. It was built from the foundation, at a small distance 
from the old church of Balliasta in 1825. It is a handsome, 
substantial, well-finished, and commodious place of worship, 
and does great honour to the heritors who erected it, at the ex- 
pense of about L. 2000 Sterling. It has accommodation for 
1200 souls, with a sufficient number of free sittings for the poor. 
There is at present no manse in the parish. The incumbent 
lives in a house of his own, and receives an allowance from the he- 
ritors in lieu of a manse, and with this arrangement all concerned 
are well satisfied. 

The glebe is at Norwick, about four miles to the northward of 
the church. It consists of 14 imperial acres of very good land, 
and, although let to a tenant considerably lower, is worth L.9 Ster- 
ling per annum. 

The tithes are valued, and the stipend, which is paid by the he- 
ritors, including communion elements, amounts to 249 Sterling. 

A small chapel was lately built by a few Independents, and 
another by the Wesleyan Methodists near Norwick. They have 
no stated ministers, but are occasionally visited by some preachers 
of their own persuasion, who are paid by their respective Societies. 

About 487 families, comprehending an examinable population 
of nearly 1900 souls, attend the Established Church, two-thirds 
of which it is found to accommodate sufficiently, on all ordinary 
occasions. The people, in general, attend well. When the wea- 
ther is favourable, the church is fitll. The number of communi- 
cants is generally from 1 130 to 1200. The number of Indepen- 
dents in this parish, is 15; of Wesleyan Methodists, 25. 

Church collections average about L. 80 per annum. 

Education. — There are only two schools in this parish, — a pa'

rocliial school near the church, and a school on the General As- 
sembly's scheme at Norwick. The branches taught at these schools 
are, English, reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and navi- 
gation. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum. The 
school fees are about L. 6 per annum : but the school being situ- 
ated in a very populous district, a more efficient schoolmaster 
would double that amount. The Assembly's schoolmaster has 
L.25 Sterling of salary; and his school fees may vary from L.IO 
to L, 12. 

There are no persons in the parish from six to fifteen years of 
age, who cannot read a little. But there are still a few aged 
people who cannot read. 

The north and mid parishes of this ministry are now well sup- 
plied with schools, which are within reach of the whole popula- 
tion, and well attended, the Assembly's school especially, which is 
full to overflowing, and is accounted by the people a great blessing. 
Yet there is still a large part of the population in a most deplo- 
rable state for the want of schools. The south-east, south, and 
south-west parts of the island, with a population of at least 1200 
souls, are at the distance of from four to six miles from the parish 
school, separated from the mid-parish, where it is situated, by a 
long dreary hill ; and the people have no means for the education 
of their children, unless when they can occasionally engage some 
young man, during the winter quarter, who has been educated at 
the parochial or Assembly's school, to undertake the charge. 

Two additional schools, one at the south-east, and another at 
the south-west part of the parish, are greatly wanted, and loudly 
called for. The people alDOut Uyea Sound, and Sandwick and 
Muness, are, many of them, exceedingly anxious about the edu- 
cation of their children. In that district, were a school established, 
100 children could easily attend it; and surely in the present en- 
lightened times, it is sad to think that so many young creatures 
should be deprived of the means of instruction. 

Library. — In the year 1823, a parochial library was established, 
under the direction of the present incumbent. It is supported by 
a subscription of Is. yearly, paid by each member; and as many 

 Since this was written, a scliool-liouse has been built in the pi oposcd locality, 
chiefly at the expense of the late William Mount, Esq. of Garth, by whose lamented 
death the cause of education in these islands has been deprived of one of its warmest 
and most generous friends. A salary has been granted and a teacher ajipointcd by 
the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. Tlie people on the west side of 
the island are still lamentably destitute of the means of education for their children.

of tlio parishioners as choose, have it in their power to become 
members at any time. It has succeeded very well, and consists 
of about 300 volumes of religious and historical books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are about 70 poor peo- 
ple constantly on the roll. They receive from 5s. to lOs. 
per annum, to help to purchase clothes. They are lodged and 
victualled by a certain number of the people, fixed upon by the 
kirk-session, who keep them In their houses a certain number of 
days, in rotation, in proportion to the number of merks of land 
they occupy ; and they are generally well treated. Some of the 
poor have small houses built for them by their friends, in which 
they live, and the people amongst whom they are quartered send 
in to them part of such provisions as they have for themselves, 
and, in this respect, they shew much kindness, for we seldom hear 
that the poor are in want of necessary food. 

The ordinary church collections amount to about L. 30 per 
annum, and a demand for an extraordinary contribution does not 
frequently occur. But wh,en it does, and a collection is called for 
in aid of any individual case of distress, it is as liberal as could be 
looked for, considering the circumstances of the people, and no 
other mode of procuring funds for the support of the poor has hi- 
therto been found necessary. It is, however, much to be regretted, 
that there appears no disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief. So far from considering it degrading, they 
express the greatest earnestness to have their names placed upon 
the roll, when they have the slightest pretence for making the re- 
quest, and when a " quarter" becomes vacant, by the death of a 
pauper, there are always immediate applications for it. It is hoped, 
that, as the minds of the people become more enlarged by a 
Christian education, they will assume a more independent spirit. 

Public-Houses, Sc. — There is no house in this parish which can be 
properly called an inn; but the kindness and hospitality of the people 
are such, that a stranger can never be at a loss, and there are two 
houses in the neighbourhood of Uyea Sound, kept by shop-keep- 
ers, where wayfaring men will find very comfortable lodgings. There 
are seven licensed retailers of spirits, ale and porter, in this island. 
Some of these are of too respectable characters, to allow of any im- 
proprieties in their houses ; but there are others who retail liquors 
and some of them without license, who are a nuisance in their neigh - 

That listric'l or number of houses, fixed upon hy tlic Ulrk-srssioii. for llio main, 
icnnncc ol a pauper, is called a " luarter."

boiirlinod, and wlio use every art to engage tlie young men in 
drinking to the great injury of their morals, and the waste of their 
substance. The population, with a few exceptions, is in general 
sober, yet the quantity of ardent spirits exhausted in the parish, 
was some years ago very great, equalling in value one-half of the 
rent of the island. There is now a great change. The institu- 
tion of a Temperance Society in November 1831,' has produced a 
very happy effect. The quantity of liquors now exhausted in the 
parish, is less than the half of what it formerly was. 

Fuel.— Feats from the hills of Valleyfield and Saxa Vord, are 
the only article of fuel used by the tenantry, and are procured by 
.many at no small labour and expense, especially on the east side of 
the island, where peat moss is completely exhausted. Besides the 
labour of cutting and drying them, the people are obliged to em- 
ploy from eight to ten horses, for the space of five or six weeks, 
every summer, to carry them home, and these must be attended 
by a person to put on the loads, and one or two boys to drive the 
horses. Most of the gentry use a considerable quantity of English 
coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Very considerable changes have taken place here, since the last 
Statistical Account was published, some of which have been glanced 
at in the course of the foregoing observations. The farms are now 
smaller, and more adapted for a population of fishermen, whose 
avocations allow them but little time for farm -work, and who have 
but very little inclination for it. They are, however, sufficiently 
large to supply them with meal, potatoes, cabbages, &amp;c. ; and to 
enable them to keep a sufficient number of milch cows, liorses, 
sheep, and some pigs; and they have at all times an abundant 
supply of the best fish, both for family use and for the market. 
Favourable seasons and successful fishings have placed many of 
them in easy circumstances, and enabled them to indulge in tlie 
luxury of tea, formerly little known among them, but now used in 
the crreatcr number of families twice every day. 

In consequence of the reduction of the size of the farms, ilouglis 
have entirely disappeared from amongst the tenantry. That im- 
plement of husbandry is now only employed on the farms of the 

' Since lliis stalcmeni was drawn up, a society has been formed in tl.is parish, base.l

gentry, and is of the same construction witii the ploughs used in 
the south country. The old Zetland plough has now yielded to 
the spade, and is nowhere to be seen. 

In this island, far removed from a market-town, great or rapid 
improvements in agriculture are not to be expected. It is well 
adapted for a population whose chief employment is fishing, and 
who hold their small farms as cheap places of abode, and for fur- 
nishing them with various comforts, which they could not have, it 
they had only their fishing to depend upon. Yet improvements 
are silently going on, and considerable quantities of ground are, 
from year to year, added to the old arable land. If the com- 
mons were divided, and the improvable parts inclosed, from time 
to time, as the population increases, portions of them would be 
willingly taken at a low rent and cultivated by tenants; and this 
is the only way in which improvements could be prudently made 
in this place. To attempt speculations in agriculture here, on a 
large scale, would be the height of folly.

niliSBYTERY OF BURRAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JOHN M'GOWAN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The parish consists of the three parishes of Nesting, 
Lunasting, and Whalsay ; and to these are annexed the detached 
islands of Skerries. 

Extent. — If the whole land of the parish were thrown together, 
its average length would be from 18 to 20 miles, and average 
breadth 4. 

Boundaries. — Nesting is bounded on the east by the Island of 
Whalsay, with the Skerrie Islands adjacent ; by Catfirth Voe on 
the south ; and by Belting on the west. 

Geulo/y. — The predominating rock in this parish is gneiss. Pri- 
nutive limestone, mica-slate, syenite, and granite veins occur in 
sulordinate quantity. In the out Skerries there are beds of iri- 
nntive limestone associated with gneiss.

SHETLAND. 



II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Rcf/isfei's. — There are registers of births and mar- 
riages, but not of deaths. These registers were very irregularly 
kept till 1827 ; and the Dissenters do not register, except those 
who have been married and baptised by the parochial minister. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, Robert Bruce, 
Esq. Simbister, and Miss Robina Hunter of Lunn'a. These pos- 
sess nearly the whole parish. 

Mansion- House. — A splendid house and offices have been built 
in Whalsay by Mr Bruce of Simbister. The building is of gra- 
nite, and cost L. 20,000. The stone was imported across the 
Sound of Whalsay. 

III. — Population. 

Amount of population in 1801, - 1941 

1811, - 1866 

18-21, - 2005 

1831, - 2103 

The population of the three parishes is supposed to be at pre- 
sent 2250. 

During the last three years, only one case of illegitimate birth 
occurred. 

This parish contains a greater number of inhabitants, in pro- 
portion to the rental land, than any other in Shetland, owing to 
the exertions of the two principal heritors in making outsets, or 
new settlements, on grounds formerly uncultivated. 

IV. — Industry. 

The extent of arable land in the parish is supposed to be about 
1000 acres. All the rest is waste or in pasture. The whole 
land is undivided, and common to the tenants of the two principal 
proprietors. No wood. 

Rent. — The average rent of land per merk is L. 1. No progress 
in the wretched agriculture of the parish, has been made during 
the last fifty years. The people direct their sole attention to fish- 
ing, and consider the cultivation of the lands as only a secondary 
object. 

Fisheries — The inhabitants adventure in what we call the great 
fisheries of ling, cod, and tusk ; but the principal part of their 
subsistence arises from the small fishing of piltock and sillock, 
which, except in very extraordinary years, they can pursue at no 
expense, and with great advantage, all the year round. 

There are fourteen or sixteen herring boats belonging to Mr 
Bruce, and about seven to Mr Hunter. Mr Bruce's average 



NESTING. 



55 



fishing amounts to 2000 barrels per annum, and Mr Hunter's is in 
proportion. Ling and cod, and tusk-fishing, called the Haaf Fish- 
cry, commences in the beginning of June, and continues till July 
and August. The produce is sent to Leith. The greater part 
of the male population is concerned in fishing ; — and many men go 
to the Greenland whale fishery.  

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are three churches, viz. at Nesting, 
Whalsay, and Lunnasting. The church at Nesting is made for 
the accommodation of the whole population at sacrament. Sker- 
ries Church is sixteen miles distant from the mainland, and the 
minister preaches there only once a-year. Whalsay is visited by 
him eleven times in the year, and Lunnasting eleven times also. 
It was intended that the Whalsay church should have been en- 
dowed as a Parliamentary church ; but, unfortunately, this ad- 
vantage was not obtained. Lunnasting Church has been newly 
repaired, and the seating is good. Whalsay Church has been 
newly roofed ; but the seating is not good or comfortable. 

The parish church of Nesting was built in 1794, and is in a 
tolerable state of repair. 

The whole population belongs to the Established Church, ex- 
cept thirty individuals, who are Methodists, Baptists, or Indepen- 
dents. 

Stipend L. 1 50 ; of which sum L. 69 are received from Exche- 
quer. The extent of the glebe is twelve merks and a half. 

The manse was built in 1770. It was lately repaired, but again 
needs repair. 

Education. — There is one parochial, and two adventure schools. 
Three more are required. Education is, in this parish, at the 
lowest ebb. The parish schoolmaster's salary is L.25 per annum, 
and his fees do not exceed L. 2 or L. 3. 

Poor. — Average number of paupers yearly on the permanent 
roll for the three years 1835-36-37, 25. Average yearly amount 
of church collections for these years, L.14, 2s. Id. Mortcloth 
dues, &amp;c. L.l, 8s. 

" Seventeen boats perished In 1832; seven of which belonged to Nesting. Alout 
L.3000 were raised in Scotland and in London for relief of the widows; each widow 
receiving L.3 : each child under fourteen, 10s; and parents depending on sons, L. 
This allowance they have got annually since 1832, and will get till 1843.

PRESBYTERY OF BURRAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JOHN PATON, MINISTER 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Situation, and Extent. — The name sefems to be of Danisli 
or Norwegian origin. The parish is bounded on the west by North- 
maviug, from which it is divided by a long narrow voe, called Siilom 
Voe ; on the east, by Nesting and Lunnasting ; on the north, by 
Yell Sound, which separates it from Yell ; and on the south, by 
Weesdale and Sandsting, It is difficult to state, with any degree 
of precision, the length or breadth of this parish, as it is much inter- 
sected by narrow voes, and no part of it is above two miles from 
the sea. The appearance of the county is hilly, bleak, and barren. 
The air is moist, but not unhealthy. 

There are some small lakes or lochs in the parish, but nothing 
deserving the name of river. 

Geology, — The prevailing rocks in this parish are gneiss and 
syenite : subordinate are beds of limestone and of hornblende rocks. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a register of births and mar- 
riages, and a record of the acts of the kirk-session. The latter 
commences in 1709, and was regularly kept till 1719, — from which 
time till 1751 there is a blank. From 1751, this record was again 
regularly kept till 1781. Since 1821 the entries have been quite 
regular. The register of marriages and births commences in 1751, 
but was not properly kept till within the last twenty years. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners at present are, Earl 
of Shetland; Arthur Gilford of Busta; Captain C. Mowat of 
Garth ; Mrs William Mowat ; Miss Hunter of Lunna ; Repre- 
sentatives of R. Hoseason ; and William Angus of Toft. No 
valuation ever existed in Shetland. Public charges are paid ac- 
cording to an arbitrary arrangement of old standing, and peculiar 
to this county. 

 From notes furnished by tlie sclioolmastcr al Brae, Dclliiig. 



DELTING. 



b7 



Mansion- Houses. — The mansion-houses in the parish arc those 
of Busta, Garth, Ullhouse, and Mossbanlt. 

Of antiquities the parish has little to boast. Of 
the Pictish castles mentioned in the old Account there are no 
remains, except that of Brough, at Yell Sound side, which is much 
dilapidated. The others, at Burraness in Firthsvoe, and Burra- 
voe in Bustavoe, have been entirely demolished, and levelled with 
the ground, — the foundations being occupied for booths or store- 
houses and stations for curing fish. But there are two relics of 
antiquity not mentioned in the old Account. One of these is 
the remains of a wet-dock or harbour at Burravoe, which, from its 
proximity to the Pictish castle that stood there, must have been 
built as a place of security for such small craft as belonged to it. 
The other is a stone, a block of granite lOj feet high, circumfe- 
rence near the top 18 feet, at the base 16 feet, commonly called 
the standing-stone of Busta. It has evidently been set up by the 
hands of man. 

In the rocky banks of Culsterness, there is a cave of some ex- 
tent, and moderate height, containing an outer and inner apart- 
ment, and of very difficult access, said to have been in former 
times a hiding-place. There is another cave at the side of the 
loch of Trondavoe, of less extent, which appears to have been 
made by art, for what purpose cannot now be ascertained ; but it 
is supposed to have been a place, which, in times long past, was 
used by sheep-stealers, in which to deposit their stolen sheep. 

III. — Population. 
In this parish there are neither towns nor villages. 

Ihe paiulation amounted in I8I1, to . 1624 
1821, . 1818 
1831. . 2070 
1841, . 2087 

During the last three years, there was only one illegitimate birth. 

IV, — Industry. 

The land is not estimated by acres, but by merh-land, an old 
Norwegian or Danish denomination, the quantity designated by 
which is not now understood ; but, generally speaking, this measure 
may be estimated as containing about two-thirds of a Scotch acre. 
Upon this reckoning, the parish may contain about 1000 acres 
under cultivation ; and the pasture ground enclosed and attached 
to these 1000 acres, may be as much more. 

There is no wood of any description in the parish. 

Rent. — The rent hiay be pretty fairly taken, on an average, 



58 



SHETLAND. 



at L. 1 per merk-lund. The real rent, as nearly as can be ascer- 
tained, is about L.IOOO. 

There have been rmprovements lately made in draining, instead 
of the old system of leaving an open ditch between each rig, which 
caused a great waste of surface. In several places, these ditches 
are filled with stones, covered over, and the land brought into a 
proper state. There have also been introduced into this parish 
twenty ploughs, commonly called Scotch ploughs, I suppose to 
distinguish them from the plough formerly used in the parish, 
which had only one stilt, and thirteen carts. A few years ago, 
there were only two carts in the parish. 

Fisheries. — The fishings are of ling, cod, and herring. Last 
year, 52S barrels of herrings, and 60 tons of ling, cod, tusk, and 
saith, were cured in the parish ; but a much greater quantity were 
taken by the fishermen belonging to it. In the month of May, all 
the fishermen belonging to the parish repair to the fishing -sta- 
tions in Northmavine and Papa- Stour, for the purpose of prosecut- 
ing the ling and cod fishing, upon which they principally depend 
for the payment of their rents. Besides the above, the coal fish 
commonly called sillock and piltock are taken extensively in the 
parish ; from which, the inhabitants derive support for their fami- 
lies, and occasionally make considerable quantities of oil. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The number of families belonging to the 
Established Church is 374; there are 17 families Methodists ; and 
3 Independents. The stipend amounts to L. 150. The extent of 
the glebe is nine merk-land ; yearly value L.IO. The manse was 
built in 1751; completely repaired and enlarged at the expense 
of at least L. 500 between the years 1819 and 1821. Its present 
condition is not good. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish. Two more 
are very greatly required. The salary of the parochial teacher is 
L.25, 13s. 3jd. His fees may amount to L.3 per annum; and he 
receives L.2, 2s. 9d. in lieu of garden ground. 

Poor. — The average number of [ersons receiving aid during 
the last three years is 25. Average sum allotted to each, 5s. 3|d. 
The average annual amount of contributions for last three years, 
L.9, 17s. 6|d. Of this sum L.6, lis. on an average were annual- 
ly divided among the poor. The remainder was expended on the 
interment of paupers, and other casualties.

PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JOHN TURNBULL, MINISTEli. 



I, — Topography and Natural History. 

Bmndaries. — This parish, consisting of the u-nited parishes 
of Tingwall, Whiteness, and Weesdale, is bounded on the north, 
by the sea, and the parishes of Nesting and Delting; on the west, 
by the sea, and the parish of Sandsting; on the south, by the sea 
and Quarff; on the east, by Lerwick and Gulberwick. Lerwick 
was disjoined from Tingwall, and erected into a separate parish, 
in 1701. Sound and Gulberwick were disjoined from Tingwall in 
1722, and annexed to the parish of Lerwick. 

Extent. — Tingwall is in length, from north to south, from 12 
to 14 miles. Whiteness lies to the west of Tingwall, and is in 
length from 5 to 6 miles. Weesdale is to the north-west of Wliite- 
ness, and from 6 to 7 miles in length. 

II. — Civil History. 

Ancient Remains. — There are many tumuli, where the Scandi- 
navians had buried their dead. In those which were lately opened, 
earthen urns of various sizes were discovered, containing calcined 
bones. Steinbartes or stone axes, called here thunder-bolts, are 
frequently found, also arrow-heads. There are also the remains 
of a very great many Roman Catholic chapels. 

Tingwall was formerly an archdeaconry. Most of the church 
lands in it were made over by Sir Jerome Cheyne, the Popish 
Archdeacon of Tingwall, to his nephew, and remained in the fa- 
mily, without, I believe, ever being challenged. 

In 1592, when Presbyterianisra was established in Scotland, 
Tingwall was the seat of, and gave name to, the Shetland Pres- 
bytery ; the meetings of which were afterwards removed to Scal- 
loway. 

While the Shetland Islands remained under the Danish crown, 
the Foud or chief magistrate resided here.

At ii small holm in the Loch of Tingwall, the assize was liekl, 
and the judgments of the other courts Gula Tiling were revised. 
On a hill at a little distance, is the place where the last sentence 
of the law was inflicted on the condemned. After these islands 
came under the Scottish Crown, this court was removed to Scal- 
loway. . The last who suffered there, were Barbara Tullocli, and 
lier daughter, Ellen King, who were condemned for the crime of 
witchcraft, and put to death in a cruel manner in the beginning 
of the eighteenth century. 

Scalloway is the only village in the parish. It was anciently 
the capital of Shetland, and a burgle The name is said to sig- 
nify the harbour beside the mansion houses, — Scallu signifying 
house, and ivay, or more properly vie, a roadstead. Some sup- 
pose it to have been Scallavich, the little harbour. In this village 
most of the Shetland gentlemen had residences. And even in the 
recollection of some old people, the Sinclairs of House, descen- 
dants of the St Clairs of Caithness, Mitchells of Westshore, 
Scotts of Giblesta, Umphrays of Asta and Berry, Mitchells of 
Girlsta, Dicks of Fracafield, Dicks of Warmadale, Mowbrays, 
&amp;c. had houses in Scalloway. The only gentleman in the village 
now is Mr Scott of Scalloway. The castle of Scalloway, a fine 
old ruin, stands to the east of the village. It was built in 1600, 
by Earl Patrick Stewart. Great oppressions and heavy burdens 
were imposed upon the people during the erection of this edifice. 
The village has increased much of late, and is chiefly supported 
by the fishing. 

Ancient History. — St Ninian is said to have introduced Christ- 
ianity into Shetland; but it did not generally prevail until 995. 
These islands were in a very unsettled state being frequently 
taken by Scotch pirates, and retaken by the Danes, until King 
Harold, in 776, took possession of Shetland, Orkney, and the 
Western Isles. Hacon Adlestain introduced the Gula Thing law 
into Shetland. After King Harold was slain at Stamford Bridge, 
in 1067, his son visited Shetland, &amp;c. and, with the consent of 
Adlebert, Archbishop of Bremen, established bishops in all these 
islands. After his return to Norway, in 1672, he granted to the 
merchants of his new city of Bergen the sole right of trading with 
the islands, excepting that 360 cwts. of wool were annually ex- 
jiorted for the use of the Archbishop of Bremen and his clergy.

In 12G9, King Henry of England entered into a commercial 
treaty with King Magnus Lagabetter of Norway. Englishmen 
were sent to inquire into the state of the islands, their extent, 
produce, &amp;c. It is supposed they also divided the land into merits. 

In 1271, Shetland was separated from Orkney, and united to 
Faroe. They had had the same Foud and Lagamand who resid- 
ed at Scalloway. They had between them nine bishops.  

By a treaty of 1 470, Shetland was pledged to the Crown of 
Scotland ; and from that period, the original inhabitants were most 
grievously oppressed by tyrants, from time to time, sent over by 
the Scottish Crown. At the time of the transfer, all the property 
in Shetland was held by Udal tenure, descending from father to 
son without any written documents, paid no fees, and owned no 
superior. About 1664, Douglas of Spynie, factor for Lord Gran- 
dison, compelled many of the simple udallers to take out feu-char- 
ters for their lands. Very few of the descendants of the Norwe- 
gians now possess lands in Shetland. There are still a few in Dun- 
rossuess and Cunningsburgh. For a century before the islands 
were transferred to the Scottish Crown, the St Clairs of Caithness 
possessed a very large share of the Shetland property, which their 
descendants enjoyed until a late period. 

In 1530, the islanders were so oppressed by James, Earl of 
Moray, that, simple and yielding as they were, they rose in arms 
against his factor, and the Crown was compelled to revoke the 
charter granted to him of the lands belonging to it in Shetland. 

In 1561, Queen Mary, importuned by Lord Robert Stewart, 
her natural brother, made a grant to him of all the Crown lands 
in Orkney and Shetland. After her unfortunate connexion with 
Bothwell, she revoked the grant given to Lord Robert Stewart, 
and conferred it on her husband. On Bothwell's forfeiture, the 
lands again reverted to the Crown, and Lord Robert Stewart 
gained possession of them ; but, owing to his cruelty to the inha- 
bitants, he was deprived of them, and confined for six months in 
the palace of Linlithgow. But, in 1581, his interest at Court 
procured for him a new grant of the Earldom; he was also ap- 
]ointed Justiciar, with power to convoke and dissolve the Law- 
taings. He forfeited the grant in 1585. 

In 1587, Sir John Maitland obtained a grant of the islands, re- 
venues, &amp;c. ; but, having resigned, Lord Robert Stewart prevail-

ed on King James to confer them on liim ; and, in IGOO, Earl 
Patrick obtained a new grant of tliem, lived at Scalloway, built 
the castle, and grievously oppressed the inhabitants, doing all in 
his power to prevent their complaints reaching the ears of Govern- 
ment. In 1608, however, they made known their grievances to 
Parliament, which, in 1612, revoked the charter, and annexed the 
Lordship to the Crown. Two years afterwards, Earl Patrick, who 
justly merited punishment for his cruelty to the Shetlanders, was 
put to death for high treason. He had the power of life and death 
over the inhabitants of these islands, fined them, and confiscated 
their property at his pleasure. He assessed the country in money, 
provisions, and personal labour. He also feued lands he had seiz- 
ed from the poor udallers ; and these, with scatt and other bur- 
dens then imposed, together with the Crown lands, form the re- 
venue of the Earldom in Shetland. 

In 1614, Sir James Stewart of Ochiltree farmed the Crown 
property ; but he being also guilty of the greatest oppression was 
deprived of it. 

In 1624, Sir George Hay was appointed Farmer- General and 
Steward of the islands. He, too, oppressed the poor Shetland- 
ers ; and the lordship was again annexed to the Crown by act of 
Parliament. 

In the reio-n of Charles I. the Earl of Morton obtained a wad- 
set of the Lordship of Shetland and Earldom of Orkney for the 
sum of L.30,000, said to have been advanced his Majesty by him. 
This deed was ratified by act of Parliament. No attention was 
paid to it during the Commonwealth ; but, at the Restoration, 
Viscount Grandison, as trustee for the Morton family, obtained a 
grant of the property and revenues belonging to the Crown in 
Shetland and Orkney. 

In 1641, the alleged debt due the Earl of Morton was discharg- 
ed, and the Lordship of Shetland and Earldom of Orkney were 
to remain inseparably annexed to the Crown. During the reign 
of Queen Anne, however, on account of the active part taken by 
James Earl of Morton in bringing about the Union between Eng- 
land and Sc6tland, he obtained a new grant in the form of a wad- 
set, redeemable for the old sum of L.30,000. 

In 1742, the Earl of Morton obtained an irredeemable right to 
the lands, on condition of improving the islands. He was to drain 
marshes, build harbours, promote the fisheries, and improve the

agriculture. These conditions, however, have never been ful- 
filled. 

In 1776, Lord Morton sold his lands and casualties in Shetland 
to Sir Laurence Dundas, the ancestor of the present Earl of Zet- 
land, for the sum of L.66j000. 

Burdens. — There vvere many burdens imposed on Shetland, 
such as scatt, wattle, sheep, and oxpenny. Although it is main- 
tained that scatt was the Danish land-tax, yet, until lately, it was 
never levied, when the lands were not under cultivation ; but, in a 
process before the Court of Session in 1829, this casual payment 
was made a feu. Scatt varies on the mark from 4d. to Is. 6d., 
those farms or rooms having a right to a large common paying 
more than those not having such a privilege. The scatt was for- 
merly paid in butter and oil. The Shetland proprietors have also 
to pay the British land tax. The wattle was a tax imposed on 
every family, paid in barley to the foud or bailie. It is said to 
have had its origin from presents made to a pious lady, sent over 
by the Bishop of Orkney to bless the pastures, in order to the in- 
crease of the flocks. It is now included in the scatt. Sheep and 
oxpenny had their origin from a certain number of sheep and oxen 
furnished for the governor's table from every parish. It was also 
paid in butter and oil. It, too, 'is now included in the scatt. 
The feus were also paid in butter. All these butter payments 
vvere made in marks and lispunds. The lispund was formerly 
15 lbs. ; but, in a process lately before the Court of Session, it 
was made 30 lbs. Tron, or 32 lbs. Avoirdupois.f 

By a late act of Parliament, the Earl of Zetland then Lord 
Dundas obtained leave to dispose of his feus, scatt, &amp;c., which 
have almost all been bought up by the Shetland heritors. 

Land Rent. — The land mails or rents were anciently paid in 
woodmail, afterwards converted into money and butter. The 
merks land were rated at 6 penny, 12 penny, &amp;c. The J 2 penny 
paid 16s. and 16 lbs. butter. The tenant also paid the teinds in 
kind, now converted into money.§ They also paid one fowl for 
every house or reek " to feed his Majesty's hawks." This claim 

' iMrst granted as a corapliment to Bothwcll, when he took refuge in ShethiuU 
after Ins marriage with Queen Mary,

has again been set up by lier Majesty's Falconer for Scotland, but 
resisted by the Shetland gentlemen, and a process in regard to it is now 
depending before the Court of Session. Formerly, when leases were 
granted, a sum was advanced by the lessee, termed a grassum, or 
entry money, in order that the lands might be kept at their old 
rent. In addition to the land rent, every tenant was obliged to 
pay one fowl per merk to his landlord, to deliver his tish to him 
at a certain price ; and whatever produce of his farm he had to 
dispose of, had first to be offered to him. The landlord in return 
always supported his tenant in years of scarcity. Rents are now 
paid in money. 

Until lately, great attention was paid to the division of scathold. 
The bailie, or chief magistrate, went along the marches, accom- 
panied by some of the most respectable people of each parish, who 
were well acquainted with the division, and with them some young 
boys, on whom they bestowed a good flogging at particular places, 
in order that they might remember the marches; after which, they 
received some little reward. I have heard some old people who 
were present, describe what took place at these ridings of the 
marches, called " riding the Ilagra." 

They also paid great attention to the sheep-flocks, which con- 
stituted their chief wealth. They had large stone inclosures in 
all their pastures. They made a coarse warm cloth of the wool, 
which is still done by those who have any sheep. In 1797, the 
sheep-flock in this parish was computed at 10,000. It does not 
now amount to 1000. The want of them is very much felt.

Soil and Produce.— This parish lies in parallel straths, from 
north-east to south-west. The soil is generally a light-brown, 
black loam, or moorish. Each strath has a bed of primitive blue 
limestone, interspersed with quartz. The subsoilof most of the peaty, 
ground, has a crust of iron ore impervious to water, and which at 
first resists the plough. After some years' cultivation, however, 
this ferruginous substance yields to the plough. The subsoil can 
then be turned up and mixed with the moss, greatly improving 
the soil. I have not found the iron ore so hurtful to vegetation 
as might have been supposed. But wherever there is a chalybeate

spring, it requires to he drained ; for when it runs over tlie soil, 
it renders it unproductive. Tlie subsoil of most of the meadows 
is blue till, mixed with small stones. This is even found under 
the beds of marl. The hills on the east side of Tingwall parish 
are composed of clay slate, and micaceous schistus, and appear 
capable of cultivation ; those on the west side do not appear so 
capable. Whenever the moss on them is cut, the whole surface 
is covered with large stones of coarse granite and gneiss. 

Near Rova Head, on the north-east part of Tingwall parish, 
Sir Arthur Nicolson, Bart, has discovered a field of fine blue 
slate, which promises to be of great benefit to the country ; the 
gray slate, in use at present, soon splitting when exposed to sun 
and air. 

In some of the meadows, there are quantities of fine shell marl, 
which answers well as a manure, especially for green crops. 

The want of inclosures is much felt : cattle injuring the crops, 
and poaching the land in the winter time. In some places, how- 
ever, there are good stone inclosures. 

An improved system of agriculture has been introduced, and in 
many places a regular rotation of crops followed. The common 
rotation is, Isyear, turnips and potatoes; 2d, big barley, with 
grass seeds ; 3c, hay ; 4th, pasture ; bth, oats. The potato is 
cultivated to a large extent, and in ordinary seasons, Lerwick and 
Scalloway are supplied from Tingwall parish. The potatoes are 
planted in drills, horse-hoed, and when taken up, put into pits du- 
ring winter. Turnips grow well. The red and green tops and 
Swedish are tried ; but the yellow are preferred. The barley in 
use is the four and six-sided big. " The two-sided has been tried, 
but does not answer. It is some weeks later in ripening, not so 
productive, and more easily injured by the wind. Wheat and rye 
have been attempted, but do not answer, owing to the want of 
sun. Pease do well, unless when we are visited by early frosts, 
but are little cultivated. Flax and hemp have also been reared, 
and grow luxuriantly, but the people do not know how to manage 
them when pulled. 

Tiie old one-sided plough is still in use. In some parts, the 
Rotheram, or Small's plough is in more general use, drawn by 
two horses ; if they are small, assisted by two oxen. Close carts 
are also much used. The land is in many places cultivated by 
the spade. 

I he method of making hay is much improved. It is in general

spread out as soon as mown, and before night put up in cocks. 
This method is continued for a few days, when it is led home, by 
which means the natural juices and nutritious properties are pre- 
served, as well as the fine smell. A little salt is often mixed with 
it, when building. 

Meadows. — The meadows and boggy land arise from springs 
of water issuing from higher land and running through crevices in 
the limestone. These meadows produce a quantity of coarse 
grass, which is made into bay for fodder for the cattle in winter. 
From these wet grounds, as well as from stagnant waters, there 
arises a mildew, whenever a slight frost takes place, especially on 
the fall of a north wind during the summer or autumn seasons. 
This exhalation or ground-fog is frequently seen to arise from 
these bogs like the smoke of so many fires, until, uniting, it forms 
one dense cloud over all the damp ground. It instantly destroys 
vegetation. The potato crop, in particular, is ruined whenever 
it reaches it. Not only do the stems soon wither, but the poi- 
sonous matter seems to descend into the bulbs, which renders 
them so unpalatable, that some seasons even the swine will not 
eat them. For the last four years, the crops in all our valleys, 
at a little distance from the sea, have been ruined by early frosts, 
accompanied by mildews. The crops within the vortex of the 
cloud on the lower ground, are often completely destroyed, while 
the upper part of the same field remains unharmed. The oats 
and barley, under the influence of the mildew, assume a dirty white 
appearance. 

The advantages of draining are fully experienced. It is carried 
on in a very sufficient manner by Mr Hay, on his property at Lax- 
firth and other places. But it is not to be expected that tenants; 
without either capital or leases, are to follow his example. And 
until bogs are drained, and the stagnant water carried off, the 
saving of the crops must always remain precarious. 

Considerable quantities of waste land have lately been brought 
into cultivation ; some by the tenants themselves. It was for- 
merly the practice for the landlord to mark out a piece on the 
common, and assign it to a tenant, who, on condition of bringing 
it under crop, had it for seven years rent free. But it was seldom 
the tenant could drain, trench, and inclose it properly. 

It has been the practice here, as in all other parishes of Shet- 
land, to cut up the best soil in the common, carrying it home 
either for manure, or to spread under the cattle in the byre. By 



TINGWALL, WHlTENEaS, AND WEESDALE.

this destructive practice, the best pasture in the country is not 
only injured, but in many places completely destroyed. This 
system has been put a stop to by some of the heritors; but unless 
they will all unite, the evil will not cease. It is distressing thus 
to see the best pasture completely destroyed ; and no sooner does 
the grass begin to spring than the ground is immediately robbed 
of its new surface; and this continues until the whole soil is either 
carried away by the tenants, or washed away by the winter rains. 

Roads. — Roads are now so good in some places, that carts can 
drive on them. But they are yet in their infancy ; and the want 
of them is a great bar to all improvements. There are excellent 
roads about Laxfirth and to the northward, but the middle of the 
parish has been sadly neglected. The soil being open, and carts 
and horses constantly traversing them, the roads that are, are so 
broken up during winter, that people cannot go to church with 
any comfort. These observations refer to Tingwall only ; for in 
Whiteness and Weesdale, there can scarcely be said to be any 
made roads. 

Fis/ieries.— The Shetlanders subsist chiefly by fishing, without 
which few could pay their rents. The inhabitants in the southern 
parts of this parish begin their spring fishing in February, ventur- 
ing out to sea whenever the weather permits, often risking their 
lives. A few salt their own fish, and dispose of them, when ready 
for the market, on their own account. The price of cod in ge- 
neral is 4s. per cwt. for wet fish ; price of ling, 6s. : two cwt. 
and rather less than a-half of wet make one of dry fish. The 
summer fishing begins about the end of April, and ends about the 
12th of August. It is carried on in sloops of from twenty to forty 
tons. More than one-half of the fish caught goes to the men ; 

most of whom about Scalloway have shares in the vessels. Some 

of them are sole owners. 

The people in these parishes are under no obligation to fish to 

their landlords, or to dispose of any of their product to them. 

They are at liberty to employ themselves in any way they please. 
There was formerly a bounty on Shetland fish, and also on the 

vessels engaged in the fishing, of L. 1 per registered ton. 

For some years past, the herring-fishing has been extensively 

carried on. The people deliver their herrings at about 7s. per 

cran, I have known one of our boats take 297 crans in a season. 

In 183.5, above ] 5,000 barrels were shipped from Scalloway alone. 

For the three last years, this fishing has not been successful ; and

the crops having aiso failed, he people are in a very reduced 
state. In sucb circumstances, rents can hardly be paid eitlier for 
lands or houses. Yet, with a very few exceptions, no tenant has 
been turned out of his possession by his landlord. The rents are 
at present all paid in money. There are 1637 merks land in this 
ministry. The rental is about L.2000. The arable ground will 
measure rather more than 2500 acres. 

E.vports and Imports. — It is impossible to separate the exports 
and imports of this parish from the rest of Shetland. Som of the 
exports of these islands, as extracted from the Custom- House books, 
are as follows : —

The late Mr Mouat of Garth states, that, in 1831, there were 
in Shetland 25,000 acres cultivated land, — 400,000, uncultivated, 
—the rental being from L. 26,000 to L. 28,000. He reckons the 
gross proceeds of lands, fishery, trade, &amp;c. to be L. 300,000 per 
annum. 

Lakes. — There are many lakes in this parish, abounding with 
fish. The principal ones are the lakes of Tingwall, Asta, and 
Girlsta in Tingwall ; and the lake of Strom in Whiteness. In a 
small holm in Tingwall lake, the Grand Foud held his Court. 
Girlsta lake is celebrated by Torfjeus. He says, it was called 
Geirhildar-vatn, from the daughter of Floke, a northern pirate, 
having been lost in it. -f- In the lake of Strom, there are the re- 
mains of a small castle, said to have been inhabited by a son of 
the Earl of Orkney, who was afterwards slain, by order of his fa- 
ther, at the standing-stone of Tingwall.

any in Shetland. To the north, are Deal's Voe, Laxfirth Voe,

Voe, and Cliffsound. And to the west of Scalloway, there is a 
cluster of islands belonging to this parish, within all of which there 
is fine anchorage. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are at present two churches, — one 
at Tingwall, built in 1788, after a long litigation before the Court 
of Session, — and one at Whiteness for the united parishes of 
Whiteness and Weesdale, at which there is a missionary on the 
Royal Bounty. It stands by the loch of Strom, near to the an- 
cient fortification already noticed, part of which was taken down to 
help to build the former church. The present church is a new 
one. The old church was dedicated to St Ola. Near to this, 
lived Sinclair of Strom, famous for his bravery in defending the 
rights of the udallers against the Government in 1530. In this 
contest, the Earl of Caithness was slain. There was formerly a 
church at Weesdale dedicated to " Our Lady." It was much 
sometimes still is frequented by people from every corner of 
Shetland, who, by casting in an offering of money at the shrine of 
" Our Lady," believed they would be delivered from any trouble 
they laboured under. There is a tradition regarding the building 
of it, still firmly believed by the superstitious of the islanders. Two 
wealthy ladies, sisters, having encountered a storm off the coast of 
Shetland, vowed to " Our Lady," that, if she would bring them 
safe to land, they would erect a church to her on the first spot 
they reached. They landed at Weesdale, and immediately com- 
menced building the church. And each morning, when the masons 
came to work, they found as many stones ready quarried as they 
required during the day. One of the elders of the church, who 
lately lived in that neighbourhood, used regularly to gather up 
the offerings, which he put into the poor's box. A church is 
building at Scalloway, for the village and its neighbourhood, the 
walls of which will be finished in a few months. 

Stipend. — Tingwall is celebrated for its process of augmenta- 
tion. The Court of Session declaring that they had no power to 
augment the stipends of the clergy, the incumbent, the Rev. Wil- 
liam Mitchell, appealed to the House of Lords, who gave a deci- 
sion favourable to the clergy. The Court of Session then aug- 
mented it to L.578, 13s. Scots, and 108 lispunds of butter, witli 
L.40 for communion elements. It at present amounts to L.25i;

14s. 3cl., with 20 lispunds butter, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements. 

Education. — The parochial school is placed about the middle 
of Tingwall. There are three schools supported by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge, one in Weesdale, one 
in Whiteness, and one at Scalloway. In the island of Trondra, 
there is one of the General Assembly's schools : and there is 
another at Laxfirth, where Mr Hay has built a commodious school 
and dwelling-house. Owing to the parish being so intersected by 
voes, there are many children who can attend none of these 
schools. 

Poor. — There is a great proportion of poor, especially in Ting- 
wall parish, and there are no funds for their support but the Sab- 
bath-day collection, to which the absentee heritors have contri- 
buted nothing, at least for the last thirty-three years.

PRESBYTERY OF BUURAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. WILLIAM STEVENSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Some suppose that the name Northmavine signifies 
North Main, i. e. the north part of the Mainland of Zetland. 
Others imagine, that as the neck of land which divides this parish 
from that of Delting is called Maven, and as the whole parish 
lies to the north of it, it has thence derived its name. 

Extent, Sc. — It is a very extensive parish, being 8 miles broad 
from east to west, and 16 miles long from north to south. The 
sea is its boundary on all sides, except where it is joined to the 
parish of Delting by the neck of land referred to above, and which 
is only about an hundred yards broad. 

Topographical Appearances. — The figure of the parish ap- 
proaches near to that of a triangle, and its surface is very irregular 
It is covered with hills, but none of these are of great elevation 
except Rona's Hill, which, in the former Statistical Account, 
is said to be 3944 feet above the level of the sea ; but, lately, it

was ascertained to be only about 1500 feet. It is the highest 
liill in Zetland ; and from its summit, under a clear and serene 
sky, which very seldom happens even in the finest summer weather, 
a most extensive and beautiful prospect is presented to the view. 

The coast is very irregular, and intersected by a vast number 
of voes or bays. The shores for the most part are high and pre- 
cipitous, except where banks of sand or gravel are formed, and 
composed of rocks of the hardest description. Other materials 
would not long endure the fury of the winter's storm. 

Around the parish, there are many excellent bays or voes. The 
principal, the most extensive, and beautiful, is St Magnus Bay, 
from which many voes run into the interior of the land, where the 
largest vessels may ride at anchor in the most tempestuous wea- 
ther, in perfect safety. Upon the west side of the parish, there is 
Mangaster Voe, Hammer's Voe, Gunister Voe, and Urafirth Voe ; 
but Hillswick is most frequented by vessels, as it is considered a 
very safe harbour. Upon the south and east side, there is SuUom 
Voe, which is said to be eight miles long, and Gluss Voe, and 
Collafirth Voe, and others. Upon the north side of the parish, 
tliere is Rona's Voe, and Hamnavoe ; the former is said to be six 
miles long, and is narrow; the latter is an excellent place for 
vessels riding at anchor : but the entrance to it is very small. 

This parish is also surrounded by a great number of small 
islands or holms, and pillars or rocks, situated near the shore, and 
which are very picturesque objects, when viewed from a distance. 
There are the Isle of Eagleshey, the Isle of Niben, the Isle of 
Gunister, the Isle of Stenness, Gluss Isle, the Isle of Uyea and 
Fetheland, and the Island of Lamma, and some others. None of 
these are inhabited at present ; and the pasture of most of them 
is considered excellent, and is famed for producing the richest 
beef and mutton. And upon the. most of them, sheep and cattle 
are kept in winter as well as summer, without shelter, or receiving 
fodder of any kind, even in the most inclement seasons. 

Here, also, many curious rocks may be seen. The most re- 
markable is one situated at the back of Hillswick Ness, and cal- 
led the Drongs. This immense rock rises, almost quite perpen- 
dicular, to the height of an hundred feet from the water, and at 
a distance has the appearance of a vessel under sail. Near to 
this are two very high pillars, of the same kind of rock with the 
Drongs, and with the stupendous crags upon the shore. And it 
is not improbable that these have all been at one time unit

eel together, but have been separated, not by volcanic eruptions, 
but by the billows of the ocean, which nothing almost can resist, 
during the winter storms. There is another rock, called Dorholm, 
from a lofty and spacious arch passing through its centre, and 
which has the appearance of a door in certain directions. The 
height of this rock is 76 feet from the water, and the height of 
the arch is said to be 54 feet. To the north of this, there is a 
rock called the Maiden Skerry, which is very near, but completely 
detached from the shore, and on which, it is reported, the foot 
of man has never trod. Two miles farther north, there is a rock 
of very great height, called the Osse Skerry, through which also 
there is a very large arch, which may be seen at an immense dis- 
tance. Near to Fetheland, there is also a number of very high 
rocks, called the Ramnastacks. All these rocks and holms, and 
others that could be mentioned, differ in their appearance from 
one another, and stand forth amid the waters of the ocean ; con- 
sequently they are excellent sea-marks to mariners in search of a 
harbour or place of safety. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere is very va- 
riable, and very moist. Sometimes, however, the barometer re- 
mains stationary for several days and weeks, and then the weather 
is uncommonly fine. I have seen the barometer as high as 31, 
and as low as 28, in a tremendous gale of wind from the west. 
The barometer always rises when the wind is northerly, even al- 
though it rains heavily. And when it falls suddenly, a very heavy 
sea may be expected, or a gale of wind. 

Rains are frequent, and sometimes very heavy. Some seasons, 
however, are very dry ; the peat-banks are rent asunder, and the 
grass and crops are injured, even although, in summer evenings, 
there may be thick fogs and heavy dews to refresh the soil. 

The winds are very variable, and the prevailing wind is westerly. 
During the winter season, when storms and tempests prevail, the 
wind often changes from one direction to another, suddenly and 
unexpectedly. Houses are unroofed, crops destroyed, and boats 
and other property lost ; and every season, shipwrecks take place. 

The climate is considered mild and temperate. The summer 
season is very seldom disagreeably or oppressively hot, an equality 
in the atmosphere being preserved by the surrounding waters. 
The winter, sometimes, also is very mild, at other times the cold 
and frost are intense. But although the climate is very damp, it 
is not considered by any means unhealthy ; and warm clothing is 

4 



NORTHMAVING. 



73 



an indispensable article of dress. Rheumatism and asthma are 
very common complaints among the people ; but perhaps these 
may be attributed as much to the low, miserable, and uncomfort- 
able dwellings in which they live,. as to the dampness of the cli- 
mate. Fever of a very infectious nature sometimes occurs ; but 
it is commonly confined to two or three families in the same 
neighbourhood, as no intercourse whatever takes place with per- 
sons so affected, and thus they sometimes die a miserable death 
for want of cleanliness, proper treatment, and medical attendance. 
Pulmonary complaints are also to be met with, but are not com- 
mon. That the climate is, by no means, injurious to health, 
may be inferred from the fact, that, in 1831, there were 
thirty-nine persons in this parish, and chiefly women, upwards of 
6'oity years of age. Some of them were above ninety years, and 
one woman died lately said to have been an hundred years old. 

Hydrography. — This parish is nearly surrounded by the sea, 
and voes run into the interior, almost in every direction. Many 
excellent springs are to be found. Very near to the top of Rona's 
Hill, there are several powerful springs, which send forth an im- 
mense quantity of water, in a short space of time. And as these 
springs are more elevated than the tops of the highest hills in 
these islands, where must their source or origin be  No medi- 
cinal springs, I believe, have hitherto been found. Lochs or 
lakes, some of considerable extent and depth, are very numerous 
in this parish, amounting, it has been said, to upwards of an hun- 
dred, and many of them abounding with most excellent trout. 

Geology.~T\\e direction of the strata of rocks, in this parish, is 
from east to west ; and innumerable are the veins or dikes and fis- 
sures that cut across the strata, and more or less derange and alter 
their original position. The mountains and hills are chiefly com- 
posed of granite, syenite, syenitic greenstone, gneiss, diallage rock, 
porphyry, &amp;c. Old red sandstone and limestone, of a coarse descrip- 
tion, are also to be found in different parts of the parish. No fos- 
sd organic remains, or petrifactions, whether belonging to the ani- 
mal or vegetable kingdom, have ever been found, that I have 
heard of ; neither are there any ores containing copper, lead, 
&amp;c. Chromate of iron has been found in certain situations, but 
not of the best quality ; also Scotch pebbles or agates, and garnets. 

Peat moss, for the most part, is the only soil that covers the 
solid rocks referred to above. Along the shore, in favoured spots, 
the soil IS of i light and sandy description, which in good seasons 



74 



SHETLAND. 



bears excellent crops ; in other places, it is of a clavey or loamy 
nature, which also produces well. The soil, in general, is very 
thin, even where it is thickened by the application of other earths 
by manual labour ; and it is naturally wet, but draining would be 
a tedious and expensive operation, as the subsoil is so very hard 
and impenetrable. 

Zoology. — In this parish, there are some birds which are consi- 
dered rare. There are several kinds of gulls ; the Bonxie or Skua 
gull is the most rare. Rona's hill, Foula, and island of Unst are 
the only three situations in Zetland where it is to be found. It is 
a beautiful and powerful bird, and is said to have many a hard 
battle with the eagle, which is also an inhabitant of Rona's hill. 
There are also many varieties of wild ducks frequenting the voes 
and lochs, at all seasons of the year ; and also different kinds of 
geese, such as the ember-goose, or great northern diver, and the 
rain-goose or red-throated diver. Hawks, snipes, plovers, curlews 
&amp;c. are often met with. Large flocks of swans are sometimes ob- 
served flying about, but do not take up their residence here. 

In this parish, a great number of cattle are reared every season 
and sold, and also ponies. Some of these are very small, for which 
sometimes high prices have been obtained. The real Shetland 
breed of sheep is hardly now to be found in this parish, except on 
Rona's hill, as it has been crossed by the Cheviot, or black-faced 
breed ; and some think that it would have been better, had such 
breeds never been introduced into the country, as the real Shet- 
land breed is much hardier, and stands the climate better, and the 
food which nature has here provided is coarse, and not very nutri- 
tious. 

Most of the lochs abound with salmon-trout, and great numbers 
are caught every season. Sea-trout is also very abundant, and of 
a large size. The spawning season is in the month of October ; 
but it is thought by some, that they spawn two or three times in 
the year. 

Many varieties of shell-fish are found here, such as oysters, 
spouts, mussels, cockles, and lobsters of a large size. These, in 
seasons of scarcity, afford food to the people, but are seldom or 
never used, so long as they are able to obtain fish. 

Botany. — No rare plants, I believe, are to be found in this pa- 
rish. A few are found of a medicinal description ; some are also 
used for dyeing cloth. There are no forests or plantations in this 
country; but the experiment has never been made, and the pro- 



NOIITMMAVING. 



75 



prietors have no inclination or desire to try the experiment, whe- 
ther large plantations of different kinds of trees, properly walled 
or fenced, to prevent cattle and sheep from injuring and destroy- 
ing them, would succeed or not. Some situations in this parish 
appear favourable for the attempt. In certain places trunks and 
branches of trees are found imbedded in the moss. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The chief land-owner is Arthur Gifford, Esq. 
of Busta, to whom the greatest part of the parish belongs. The 
other proprietors are. Earl Zetland; Henry Cheyne, Esq. of Tang- 
wick ; Arthur Cheyne, Esq. of OUaberry ; and Mrs Ogilvy of Gas- 
saburgh. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, for a few years, 
have been kept well and accurately ; but the old records are far 
from being perfect or voluminous, and are not of a very early date. 
At the commencement of the ministry of Dr Jack, in the year 
1 765, new session-books were obtained, and ever since they have 
been more or less regularly kept, according to the qualifications 
and ability of the session-clerk. 

Antiquities. — A huge granite stone appears to have been raised 
upon the top of an hill in this neighbourhood, having a circle of 
smaller stones around the bottom. What deed it commemorates, 
or whether it was raised for a religious purpose, none now can tell. 
There are the ruins of several religious houses in this parish. 
The church at OUaberry has been in ruins, for many years; also 
the church at North Roe. The remains of a very large Pict's 
house on the west side of the parish are still visible. It appears 
to have been a very strong building, and house of refuge or de- 
fence, being surrounded by water. On the top of Rona's hill, an 
ancient watch-house, as it is called, is still visible, built of a few 
large flat stones; it might have held six or seven persons. 

Ancient arms have been found several times. A few of the 
people are in possession of the ancient battle-axe, which is care- 
fully concealed in some part of the house, and superstitiously pre- 
served, and it is commonly called a thunderbolt. The writer of 
this paper has one in his possession, which was obtained from a 
parishioner, as a great favour. It is quite entire, and composed of 
a very hard grey stone,— such a species of stone as is not to be 
found in this part of the country. An ancient sword was also 
found, several years ago, by accident, and is at present in posses- 
sion, It is believed, of the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh.

III. — Population, 

The population of this parish in 1755, amounted to 1009. In 
1784, it had increased to 1657. And in 1831, it was very near 
2500. The number of males was 1091, and the number of fe- 
males 1295. This great increase of population is to be attributed 
to the dividing of the arable lands into smaller portions, for the 
accommodation of those employed in the fishing, and the taking of 
small farms from the undivided common, for a similar purpose. The 
population is altogether a rural population. The yearly average 
of births for the last seven years is 60, and of marriages 14 ; but 
of deaths, it is impossible to say, as there are five difi"erent burial- 
places in the parish, and no register of such has ever been kept. 

In this parish, there are only two persons or families of indepen- 
dent fortune residing, and there are only two proprietors of land 
of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

At present, there are 400 families in the parish, and about the 
same number of inhabited houses. None are uninhabited, and 
a few are now building. 

The circumstances of a vast number of families are so poor and 
miserable, that cleanliness cannot be observed. On Sunday, how- 
ever, they appear at church clean, and well-dressed. In former 
times, their every-day dress was a coarse cloth of their own manu- 
facture made of wool ; now Scotch and English cloth is generally 
used. 

The people may be said to be generally of an intellectual cha- 
racter ; and, considering the opportunities they enjoy, they may 
be also called a moral and a religious people. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish is supposed to contain 60,000 acres 
of land ; but, as only a small fractional part of the surface has ever 
been measured, it is very difficult to say how many acres are cul- 
tivated, or occasionally in tillage, — perhaps 6000 acres. The re- 
mainder has never been cultivated, and is in a state of undivided 
common ; and it is difficult to say what number of acres, with the 
profitable application of capital, could be added to the cultivated 
land of the parish. Many suppose, that the only profitable way 
to apply capital, in cultivating waste lands in Zetland, is to turn 
these lands into permanent pasture, by sowing natural grasses for 
the rearing and feeding of cattle and sheep. 

The state of husbandry, with respect to cultivation and reclaim- 
ing waste lands, is low indeed, except in a very few cases. Even 



NORTHMAVING. 



77 



those who are considered good farmers among the people, know 
nothing about draining, or the process of fallowing. Indeed, fal- 
lowing is impossible, — for all the land that the poor people have, 
must be turned over from year to year, for the support of their fa- 
milies, — it is so very small. Perhaps there are not a dozen of 
fields in the whole parish properly drained ; and no lands here 
have undergone the process of irrigation. 

There is, however, a number of impediments which prevent the 
land from being cultivated and improved as it might be, in this 
country. Very few of the farmers have money or capital, and none 
are willing to lay out in the improvement of the soil, to pay the expense 
of keeping servants for that purpose, or purchase the necessary 
implements of husbandry. Very few of the farmers have leases. 
They are all, for the most part, tenants at will. They may be 
removed by the landlord or proprietor, when he pleases, and they 
may remove themselves from the lands, when they think proper. 
As they cannot tell, therefore, how long they may occupy the 
lands, they have no spirit or desire for improvement, as they may in 
a short time be possessed by another. Another impediment is the 
want of good enclosures and good roads. As they are, in general, 
tenants at will, and have no leases, they are very careless about 
making good enclosures. There are very few stone fences. For 
the most part, the fences are built of turf, and it requires one of no 
ordinary kind to prevent the Zetland sheep from molesting and 
destroying the crops in their season. Every year, the poor people 
sustain a loss, more or less severe, on this account; and those 
who have bad fences, require to keep a number of dogs for the pro- 
tection of their property. Again, the ling and herring-fishery is 
another impediment. With a few exceptions, every farmer is a fisher- 
man, and every fisherman a farmer. During the summer season, 
therefore, when the men are at sea, the crops, cattle, &amp;c. are left to 
the care and management of women and children, who, I dare say, 
do the best they can. But it is to be supposed, that, if a division 
of these two employments could be effected in some way or other, 
the land would be improved and cultivated to better advan- 
tage, than it has hitherto been. 

The Shetland spade is almost the only instrument of husbandry 
used by the people, and three or four or five persons turn over the 
earth, or peat as they call it, at the same time, and they make 
more progress than a stranger would suppose ; but they. commonly 
turn it over down hill, so that the earth falls from the spade very 



78 



SHETLAND. 



easily. And the consequence is, that at the bottom of every plot 
of ground or ridge, the earth, and always the best, has accumu- 
lated to a considerable depth. Ploughing is, at present, very little 
used, and perhaps, as the farms are divided into smaller portions, 
may get into disuse, almost altogether. When the former Statis- 
tical Account was written, there were twenty- six ploughs in the 
parish ; at present, there are only twelve, and these are drawn by 
oxen or horses, or both, as the people can get them for hire, or 
are able to rear them and keep them for themselves. 

Live-stock. — The sheep and cattle reared or bred are, for the 
most part, of the pure Zetland breed ; but little or no attention 
whatever is paid to their improvement. Some of the Scotch kinds 
have occasionally been introduced, but were found not to answer well, 
as they are too tender or soft for the climate. The hardier the 
breed, the better for Zetland. The breed of horses, it is said, has 
fallen off very much, for some years past; and the reason is, that 
the best of the horses are always sold, and only those of an infe- 
rior description kept for breeding ; and things will never improve 
till the proprietors interfere and enact a law, which they can 
very easily do, that the best horses shall always be kept ; and this 
would, ultimately, be greatly for the interest of both landlord and 
tenant. 

Fishing. — Fishing is the chief occupation of the people, during 
the summer season, and almost all depend on this, and not on the 
produce of the soil, for the payment of rent and other burdens. 
And various kinds of fishing are carried on, in this parish. Cod- fish- 
ing is, at present, almost given up, as it has been a complete failure 
for some years. Herring-fishing has commenced, but it has not hi- 
therto been attended with much success; but, perhaps, this may 
arise from not having boats of a proper size and construction, and 
nets of the proper dimensions and depth. Ling-fishing has been 
carried on for a great many years, with the most complete success, 
and much wealth has been obtained by it. The boats, however, 
are now very much reduced in number from what they were once ; 
and this is to be attributed to the scarcity of fish, the lowness of 
the price, and the great expense with which the fishing is attended. 

In this parish, there are a great number of excellent stations for 
pursuing the ling-fishing. — Stenness, Hamnavoe, Uyea, and Fe- 
theland. At these stations, the crews and boats assemble about 
the end of May, if the weather is favourable, and remain till the 
beginning of August. In former times, the boats fished near the 



NOTITHMAVING. 



79 



shore, and fish were found in abundance. Now, the fish have left 

the shore, and the boats must sail or pull out to sea forty or fifty 

miles, to reach the fishing-ground ; and, if the weather is fine, they 

remain two or perhaps three nights. During all this time, the 

fare of the crews is very simple : water or bland, a little spirits, and 

oaten cake. Seldom a season passes but some meet a watery 

grave, and leave widows and orphans behind. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 

the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, - - L.3000 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, and cabbages, - - 1000 0 0 

Meadow hay, - . . . lOO 0 0 

Ling, cod, tusk, and herrings, - - 3560 0 0 

Beef, hides, and tallow, . - - 600 0 0 

Butter and oil, - . . . . lOO 0 0 

Shetland stockings and gloves, - - 60 0 0 

Calf, otter, sheep, and seal skins, - . 10 0 0 



Total yearly value of raw produce, - L.8430 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is very 
inconvenient for the greater part of the population. It is distant 
from one extremity of the parish twelve miles, from another eight 
miles, from another four miles; and it stands within 60 fathoms 
of the edge of the sea. It was built in the year 1733, and was 
repaired in the year 1764; and in the year 1825 the interior was 
completely renewed. It has accommodation for about 600 per- 
sons, and 70 sittings are set apart for the poor. 

The present manse was built about the year 1768, and repaired 
in 1790. In the year 182], it also received very extensive repairs 
internally, so that it is amongst the most comfortable manses in 
the country. The glebe contains many acres of land, but how 
many I know not, as it has never been all measured. It is not 
valuable, however, according to its extent, as it is situated in four 
different parts of the parish, all at a considerable distance from 
each other. The present value is about L. 15. The stipend is 
L. 150. 

There are a Methodist chapel and an Independent chapel, 
which are together attended by about 100 members. The Esta- 
blished Church is generally well attended, and the average 
number of. communicants is 800 ; the number of families about 
350. 

Smce my induction in 1830, no collections have been made for 
religious or charitable purposes except once. The people 



80 



SHETLAND. 



neral are very poor, and all that can be collected on Sundays in 
the year is not sufficient for the maintenance and support of those 
upon the poor's roll. There are no Societies established for reli- 
gious purposes. 

Education. — At present, there are five schools in the parish : 
one parochial school, one Society school, and three supported by 
individual subscriptions only, for three or four months in the win- 
ter season. The branches of education generally taught in each, 
are, reading, writing, grammar, arithmetic, book-keeping, and 
navigation. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L.25, 3s. 4d., but he 
has not as yet obtained the legal accommodations; and the amount 
of school-fees is very small, about L. 4. The salary of the So- 
ciety schoolmaster is L. 15, and the fees and perquisites amount 
to L. 1. The salaries of the other schoolmasters are from L. 1, 
1 Os. to L. 2 a quarter ; and they lodge with the parents of the 
children. 

It is believed that there are none from six to fifteen years of age, 
who cannot read tolerably well. There are many, however, who 
cannot write, particularly among the females, although some of 
these also are able to produce very good specimens. 

Three additional and permanent schools are absolutely neces- 
sary to give the scattered population of this parish even the ele- 
ments of education. Those schools which are open in the winter 
season for three or four months, are attended with very little bene- 
fit to the children, as they commonly lose in the summer what is 
gained in the winter. And there are three situations in this pa- 
rish, distant each six and ten miles from the parochial school, 
where, if qualified and respectable teachers were obtained, they 
would be attended by sixty or seventy scholars. And as the 
people themselves, being so very poor, are unable to provide pro- 
per accommodations for a qualified teacher, or give him a suitable 
provision, they must wait patiently till the eye of the charitable 
and benevolent is bent towards them, and the hand opened to their 
relief. 

Poor and Parochial Fund.t.— There are, at present, 60 persons 
receiving parochial aid, and the sum allotted to each per year is 
from 3s.°to lOs. according to age, poverty, and other circumstances. 
The money thus given is to provide clothing only, as the poor, for 
the most part, have a certain quarter or district of the parish as- 
sio-ued them to obtain a livelihood; and ll.cy usually go from 



NORTHMAVING. 



81 



liouse to house, according to their fancy or inclination, in order to 
obtain a lodging and the necessaries of life. 

The annual amount of funds for the relief of the poor is about 
L. 24. The yearly collections at the church door is about L. 8, 
and the sacramental collection is about L. 10. Besides, the funds 
are increased to a small extent, by interest received from a small 
sum deposited in the bank, and money on loan. 

There is no other regular mode of procuring funds for the sup- 
port of the poor, than those now mentioned. But should mis- 
fortune befal a family, the elders are sometimes employed in their 
several districts to obtain what they can from the charitable for 
their relief. In this, they sometimes succeed very well, and col- 
lect in small sums, from L.3 to L. 4, which afford a seasonable 
relief, not only to the afflicted, but also to the poor funds, which 
are kept very low on account of the numerous applications for sup- 
port. 

It does not appear that there is a disposition among the poor to 
refrain from seeking parochial relief, neither do they consider it as 
degrading. A few are to be found, however, who, in the most 
miserable circumstances, would rather starve, than seek the least 
support from any person. Others, again, are not ashamed to seek 
support from the funds, for their friends,— who ought to feel ashamed, 
when they consider their own circumstances. Their application is 
generally resisted. 

Fairs.— In this parish, there are three fairs or markets held every 
year, at which cattle and horses are bought and sold. In the 
month of May, there is a sale of milk cows, young cattle, and horses; 
and again, in the month of November, for fat cattle and horses 
These sales are attended by a great number of people, and by 
some from a very great distance. 

Fuel.— Feat is the fuel that is used by all in the parish, and the 
cutting, curing, and flitting home, are, in some cases, attended 
with considerable expense. In two or three genteel families, 
Scotch or English coal is occasionally used.

PRESBYTERY OF BURRAVOE, SYNOD OF SHETLAND, 

THE REV. JAMES ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
This parish is formed by the junction of the Mid and Soutb 
parishes of the Island of Yell, fornnerly written Zell, one of the 
three islands in the Shetland group, commonly called I he North- 
Isles. North Yell, the third parish into which Yell is divided,- 
being joined to Fetlar, quoad sacra, constitutes a portion of 
another ministry. To the ministry of Mid and South Yell are 
joined the Islands of Samphrey and Bigga, both situated to the 
westward of, and distant from, the mainland of Yell about a mile 
and a-half. The former contains six families, the latter, until 
within the last few years, when it has been converted into a grazing 
island. Was generally occupied by eight tenants. It may be re- 
marked, that the teinds of Bigga are paid the one-half to the in- 
cumbent of Yell, the other half to the minister of Belting. To 
Mid and South Yell is also attached the Island of Haseussey, si- 
tuated about a mile from its east coast, and occupied at present 
by six families. 

Situation, Extent— The south extremity of this parish Ues in 
G0° 40', and its most northern in about 60° 51' of north latitude. 
It reaches from 18' to 32' west, making its extreme length some- 
what more than 13 miles, and its extreme breadth nearly 7. 

Boundaries.— On the east side, it is bounded by Colgrave Sound,, 
which separates it from Fetlar; on the south, by Lunnafirth,. 
which runs between it and the parish of Lunnasting ; on the west, 
by Yell Sound, on the opposite shores of which are the parishes 
of Delting and Northmavine. Colgrave Sound averages three 
miles in breadth, Lunnafirth four, and Yell Sound six miles. In 
Yell Sound, the current is perhaps the strongest of any on the 
uorth coast of Shetland, its rapidity at spring-tides being eight or 

gine miles an hour. 

The Lsland of Yell lies in a direction nearly north-east by 



MID AND SOUTH YELL. 



83 



north, along the east side from the Ness of Burravoe to Burra- 
ness in North Yell, when it acquires an inclination of about 12° 
in a more northerly direction. From the Brough of Ciippasetter, 
situated on the south-west corner of the island, to the " Rock of 
the Birreir," a distance which embraces nearly one-half of its 
west coast, the line is also north-east by north. After pass- 
ing this rock, the coast takes a more easterly direction, inclin- 
ing thereto from 17° to 20°; thus reducing the north end of the 
island to nearly one-half of its south end and middle breadths. 
Two ranges of hills, of from 200 to 400 feet in height, extend al- 
most the whole length of the island, and in a direction nearly pa- 
rallel to each other. These are occasionally intersected by others, 
running in a direction east and west ; and between which, are two 
excellent harbours, viz. Midyellvoe and Bastavoe, this last men- 
tioned, being in North Yell. 

Mid Yell voes, formed by the Ness of Lussetter on its south side, 
and the Head of Hindigarth on its north, runs about a mile and a- 
half west, on a bed of clay and shell sand, affording easy access to 
vessels of any tonnage, and of sufficient extent to moor a fleet of 
an hundred sail, in from six to ten ftithoms water. 

Another inlet, called Whalefirtli voe, approaches to that of Mid 
Yell voe from a north-west direction, so as nearly to form a junction 
with it ; there being but a few hundred yards between the pools 
at high water. As the intervening space consists entirely of peat- 
moss resting on a substratum of blue clay, a canal might'be cut at 
a very trifling expense, which the influx and reflux of the sea would 
in a short time convert into a channel, through which boats could 
pass at any time of the fide. Were a communication between 
the seas on the east and west side of Yell thus opened up, there 
can be little doubt that the value of a locality in the vicinity of 
either of the voes just mentioned, would be considerably increased 
from the additional quantity and variety offish that would be there- 
by introduced into them, and the fticility aff"orded to all the inha- 
bitants of that district, of prosecuting the various kinds of fishino-, 
on whatever side of the island their endeavours were likely to be 
attended with the greatest success. 

Along the whole of the east side of Yell, the land is moderate-, 
ly low, and in many places sandy, and there is scarcely more than a 
mile of coast, where a boat cannot land in ordinary weather. On 
the south side of the island, there are also the two good harbours 
ot Burravoe and Hamnavoe, about a mile distant from each olheiv 



84 



SHETLAND. 



But on the west side, after advancing about eight miles to the 
northward, the shore becomes bold and precipitous ; so that from 
Westsandwick to Gloup, the most northern point in the island, 
there are only two places on a coast stretching upwards of eleven 
miles, where a landing can be effected, namely, Whalefirthvoe, 
already mentioned, and the dale of Lumbister, and at this last 
place only when the weather is fine, it being, apparently, a mere 
track worn in the soft stone by the action of a stream of water 
which passes over it. 

Although situated nearly in the sixty-first degree of north lati- 
tude, the air in winter, uniformly moist, is temperate to a degree 
to which those accustomed to the cold prevalent at that season in 
the interior of Great Britain are altogether strangers, and snovp in 
consequence seldom lies above a day or two at a time. 

In a note taken at the manse of Yell, December 24th 1832, 
occur the following remarks : " The turnips are this day as green 
as they were at Michaelmas. The rye-grass among bear-stubble 
measures from eight to ten inches of green blade ; and among the 
year old rye grass, is the daisy everywhere seen in bloom.'" To 
these general remarks in reference to the mildness of Shetland 
winters, the history of those of 1835-36, 1836-37, and of 1837- 
38, forms a striking contrast. In each of the two first mentioned 
winters, there were three different falls of snow, the average dura- 
tion of which was eleven days, while, during the last mentioned, 
the snow which fell on 6th January had not entirely disappeared 
6y 1st of April. At no time, however, during this period was the 
thermometer observed to range lower than 11° below the freez- 
ing point. Thus 21° may be stated as the greatest degree of cold 
ever known in Yell, and 69° as the highest range ever attained by 
the thermometer in summer. The westerly are the prevailing 
winds ; and during the months of October, November, and Decem- 
ber, there frequently occur tremendous thunder storms, most ge- 
nerally at night. This fact, as well as some others which might 
be mentioned, would seem to establish an identity between the 
electric fluid and the aurora borealis, which, from the month of 
October to March, is seen almost every clear night, moving from 
one quarter of the heavens to the other, in all its shapes and shades 
of endless variety. 

As might be expected from the prevailing moisture of the cli- 
mate, rheumatism is a common complaint among all classes. And 
from the same cause, perhaps, in connexion with the circumstance 



MID AND SOUTH VELL. 



85 



of there being but few families of the labouring classes altogether 
free from a constitutional taint of scrofula, those who are carried off 
oy pulmonary complaints are more numerous than are the victims of 
any other single disease. For the cure of this fatal disorder no- 
thing, even at the present day, is deemed so effectual as the 
Royal touch  And as a substitute for the actual living finger of 
royalty, a few crowns and half-crowns of the coinage of the first 
Charles, carefully handed down from father to son, have been ef- 
fectual both here, and in every other parish in Shetland, towards 
removing this disease, and that to an extent which may appear" 
somewhat incredible to many whose minds, in reference to the heal- 
ing virtue still inherent in royalty, may be in a more sophisticated 
state, than those of her Majesty's subjects in this latitude. Be 
this as it may, there are few localities in Shetland in which a living 
evidence is not to be found of one said to have been " cured by 
the coin," and who would instantly be pointed at as a sufficient 
evidence to warrant confidence in its efficacy, should it happen 
that a doubt at any time rested thereon. 

Hydrography. — All the springs fall under the denomination of 
perennial, and the temperature of those least affected in quantity 
by the summer drought, is from 44° to 45°, their water being not 
unfrequently impregnated with iron. 

Geology. — In Yell the prevailing strata are gneiss and micar 
ceous rocks, traversed by veins of granite, and occasionally having 
masses of quartz and whinstone imbedded in them. The direc- 
tion of the strata is nearly north and south, their dip beino- from 
35° to 90°. 

The only ore ever found in Yell is that of iron; and in no 
known instance, has it been found in a shape different from bog 
iron ore. In Yell, as well as in several other parishes in Shetland, 
and in such situations as the banks of burns, or that of the sea 
side, there is frequently to be met with under a mass of peat moss, 
sometimes not less than 10 feet deep, and immediately above the 
prevailing rock, a layer of fine rich loam, from one to two feet 
thick, on the top of which are always found the remains of wood, 
generally birch and occasionally oak. 

The soil throughout Yell partakes, more or less, of the quality 
of moss, mixed either with clay or particles of the decayed rock, 
on which it rests ; and in no instance is it found to be sandy, uii- 
Jess where sand has been thrown up by the violence of the sea 
during winter, and carried over it by the action of the winds. 



86 



shf;tland. 



Such is the depth of pent moss in the interior of Yell, that, if 
equally distributed over the surface thereof, it would afford a 
covering of not less than three feet in thickness to the whole 
island. 

Zoology. — It has sometimes been doubted whether salmon are 
to be found on the coast, or in the lochs in Shetland. This 
doubt admits of an easy solution, as no fewer than twenty-one 
were caught, at one drag of a net on the sands of Valsetter in this 
parish in 1831. All that have been caught here are of a small 
size, none having been seen exceeding nine and a half pounds. 
This, however, is not to be wondered at, when the destructive 
habits of the seal, in reference to this fish, are taken into account, 
— half a score of which have been seen guarding the creek, through 
which the fish had to pass before getting into fresh water, which 
they generally attempt from 20th July to the middle of August. 
The sea-trout, which are most abundant here, are somewhat later 
in their habits, and never seek to get into fresh water before the 
middle of August or beginning of September. 

As a shell-fish, important in an economical point of view, the 
common cockle ought not to be overlooked in the statistics of Yell ; 
for often, in times of scarcity, has it been the means of saving 
the lives of hundreds of its inhabitants. As an example of the ex- 
tent to which the cockle was sought after, during the scarcity 
which prevailed in 1837, it may be mentioned, that, in the month 
of May of that year, 115 barrels of cockle-shells were collected 
from 10 families, who had been reduced to the necessity of living 
on the fish thereof during the preceding spring : And at that time, 
there were more than 50 families in the parish, — from whom a 
proportionate quantity could have been obtained. 

Yell, like other districts, the inhabitants of which live by fish- 
ing, has often been, nay, it may be said, yearly is exposed to sad dis- 
asters from loss of life at sea. But of all the recorded misfortunes 
of this kind, none can he compared with that which occurred in 
the month of July 1832. On that occasion, four boats were lost, 
and of their whole crews, which numbered thirty men, only three 
were saved. These were almost all men in the prime of life, and 
left behind them 23 widows, and 61 fatherless children under four- 
teen years of age, to mourn their untimely fate. 

n. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The principal landlords in the Mid and South 
Yell are, John Ogilvy, Esq. of Gossaburgh and Quarff, and Ro- 



MID AND SOUTH VKLL. 



87 



irert Bruce, Esq. of Burravoe, both resident ; and, with the excep- 
tion of Charles Ogilvy, Esq. of Seafield, and Captain C. Mouat 
of Garth, who are non-resident, there is not another, of all the 
2.S heritors connected with the parish, whose income therefrom 
amounts to L. 50. 

Parochial Beffisters. — The parochial registers extend no far- 
ther back than to the beginning- of the eighteenth century, and, 
though kept with tolerable accuracy, contain but little, and that 
little, perhaps, of still less importance. 

Antiquities. — In so far as can now be traced, no religious houses 
have, at any time, existed in this parish ; and beyond a few Pictish 
buildings, and some traces of the dwellings of the Shetland abori- 
gines, in which last have been found some stone adzes and knives, 
with drinking- cups, lamps, and hammers of the same materials, — 
there is little now existing either to excite the inquiry of the anti- 
quary, or to speak to its present inhabitants of the deeds of other 
years. 

III. — Population. 
The population is exclusively rural, and amounts to 1853. 

Of these, there are under 15 years of nge, . 701 

between 15 and 30, . 556 

30 and 50, . 360 

50 and 70, . 246 

above 70 years of age, . 89 

The average nunaber of births in seven years has been . 42 

marriages, . . . 11.6 

Of bachelors and widowers abave 50 years of age, there are 12 

Unmarried women upwards of 45 years of age, . . 69 

There are 2 fatuous individuals, and 7 in a state of lameness 
throughout the parish. 

Besides the two principal resident heritors, there is not another 
of independent fortune in the parish. 

The inhabitants are, in general, a quiet and orderly class of peo- 
ple ; but although acts of gross and open immorality would be 
branded by common consent, yet it must be confessed, that other 
immoralities are practised to an extent which calls forth an ad- 
mission from all quarters, that some remedial steps ought to be 
taken. The less flagrant immoralities now alluded to can, per- 
haps, be traced to no cause so directly, as to the want of an early 
trainmg of the young to the observance of moral and religious du- 
ties, by means of the discipline of public schools,— a tuition to 
which the inhabitants of Yell have been but little accustomed. 
For vinlil within the last sixteen years, such a thing as a parochial 
school was unknown within its bounds ; and when established in 



88 



SHETLAND. 



1822, it was placed in a district to which not one-eighth part of 
the parishioners could have access. Without investigating minute- 
ly the other causes that may have co-operated, to prevent attend- 
ance on the parochial school, it appears that, for a series of years, 
the quarterly average number of scholars has not exceeded ten, if 
it has reached that number, 

Togiveanythinglikeefficiency tothe meansof education through- 
out this widely extended ministry, four additional schools would be 
required. Were the means of obtaining an early and a solid edu- 
cation extended to a people certainly not void of natural abilities, 
nor of acuteness to discern in what direction their interest lies, a 
stimulus would be given thereby to industry and activity in those 
departments of labour in which they are engaged, and in a practi- 
cal knowledge of which, they no doubt rank behind those who are 
similarly employed elsewhere; while the moral and religious 
aspect of society could not fail to be improved. 

To the moral and religious improvement of the parishioners, the 
two principal resident heritors have not been inattentive. By Mr 
Bruce of I3urravoe, a disposition has been granted to the minister 
for the time being, of six acres of ground for a glebe to an as- 
sistant minister in South Yell, with a right of pasturage on the 
common during summer to as many cattle as the straw raised on 
that ground, can fodder in winter. By Mr Ogilvy of Quarff, as- 
surance has been given of his readiness to provide the necessary 
accommodations for a teacher, so as to secure a salary of L.25 
per annum, at present promised to the parish by the Assembly's 
Committee. Neither of these can be considered slight benefac- 
tions, when the heavy assessments of late made on the heritors of 
this parish, in order to repair the machinery of the parochial eco- 
nomy therewith connected, are taken into view. For, at the end 
of December 1838, the heritors, in building two churches capable 
respectively of accommodating 500 and 380 sitters, and in repair- 
ing the manse, contributed upwards of L.1800 since 1831, and 
that from a rental which certainly does not exceed L.1300  

IV. — Industry. 
The industry of the inhabitants is alternately directed towards 
the cultivating of their crofts, and prosecuting the small, great line, 
or herring-fishing; in which all, with the exception of a few shop- 
keepers, and handicraftsmen, are exclusively engaged. 

The number of statute acres is 37,000, of which about 4000 
are enclosed ; 1500 of these last are at present, or have been cul- 



MID AND SOUTH YELL. 



89 



tivated ; alul the remaining 33,000 acres are in pasture, to which 
the tenants renting the arable and enclosed lands have a common 
right of pasture effeiring to their respective rents. Perhaps the 
half of the enclosed grass grounds might be profitably cultivated 
with a view to improving them as pasture ; while almost the whole 
of the unenclosed common might be rendered more valuable by a 
regular system of surface draining, which, wherever attempted, 
has had the effect of ameliorating both the soil and grass. But a 
want of capital is the great bar to improvements of this or any 
other description ; and, with the exception of what has been done 
by Mr Bruce of Burravoe, and by Mr Ogilvy of Quarff, little has 
this remote district been benefited by the modern discoveries in 
agriculture. 

No attention has hitherto been paid to the selection of proper 
breeding stock, either from the native black-cattle, sheep, or 
horses. This is the more to be regretted, because the native are 
the animals best adapted to the climate and food, and because no 
other description of cattle bred in Shetland will ever be so much 
sought after for the south country market. No animal, in propor- 
tion to its size of bone, has ever been known to carry a greater 
weight of fat ; and compared with it, our present mongrel breeds 
are an ugly gaunt-looking race, utterly unfit for Shetland keep, 
and assuredly never to be sought after by those who know the 
points which characterize a good animal.

thus stated :

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The site of the parish kirk of Mid Yell is as well selected for 
the convenience of the parishioners as can be in a parish, the inha- 
bitants of which are so widely scattered,— fonr-fifths thereof being 
within a distance of four miles, the remainder being from four to 
six miles distant. 

The South Yell kirk, now in progress, is rather better situated, 
since, with the exception of fifteen families, at about four miles dis- 
tance, none of the other families in that parish are distant more than 
three miles. In a parish, however, the surface of which is, in win- 
ter, one continued mossy swamp, and over which there is neither 
road nor bridge, it is only in fine weather, that any thing like good 
attendance can be either given by, or expected from, those at more 
than two miles distance from church. 

There is a small meeting-house built by the Wesleyan Me- 
thodists in South Yell, and capable of containing -200 hearers. 
Connected with this chapel, there are about fifty members; be- 
sides which, there are eight in the Independent communion in 
Mid Yell. Deducting these, the remaining 1795 may be consi- 
dered as attending the Established Church, and of whom the 
average number of communicants are 500. 

For several years past, there has been a missionary on the 
Royal Bounty in South Yell ; and it is expected, if a grant be 
given for the extension of the Church, in those parishes where the 
teinds are exhausted, a salary will be allowed for an additional 
minister in South Yell. 

The manse was rebuilt, and new offices built, under the inspec- 
tion of the late minister, at an expense to the heritors of L. 380, 
in the year 1807. The sum for which decreet was granted against 
them, was L. 430 ; but of this sum, L. 50 are still due the repre- 
sentatives of the late Mr Finlayson, by those now representing the 
then proprietors of Sound. In 1833, the manse was repaired, 
and new byre built, and the other offices repaired, which, together, 
have been estimated, by competent judges, to amount in value to 
one-third of the accommodations originally afforded by heritors, 
under the superintendence of the late minister. These repairs 
are represented by heritors to have cost upwards of L. 300, under 
the special superintendence of one of their own number. 

The stipend of Mid and South Yell is about L. 143, paid by the 
heritors, the remainder being received from the Exchequer. 

The glebe, on which the present incumbent has sunk, in ini- 

4 



MID AND SOUTH YHLL. 



91 



provements, upwards of L. 190, may be considered to a future mi- 
nister worth L. 30 per annum ; but it cannot be said to be worth 
to its present occupant, more than L. 16 yearly. 

The annual collections average in amount L. 10, which is 
generally divided among 30 paupers. But in Yell, as in most 
other parishes in Shetland, the system prevails of assigning the 
most indigent, what is called a quarter, the inhabitants of which 
either make the pauper itinerate among them, or contribute a 
proportion of food towards his or her support, eifeiring to the 
quantity of land rented by each tenant in that quarter. There is, 
generally speaking, but little disposition among the poor to refrain 
from seeking parochial aid. 

MiSCKLLANEOnS OBSERVATIONS. 

Spade husbandry is that universally adopted by the tenant 
here : it can be got executed, by those having occasion to em- 
ploy labourers, at the rate of 8s. the statute acre ; supposing one 
man employed for every two women, the former at Is. and the 
latter at 6d. a-day. This is unquestionably the cheapest, the 
most efficient in producing a return, and, in the majority of loca- 
lities in Yell, the only mode of culture that can be adopted, on 
account of the steepness, the unevenness of the surface on the 
rocks, with which the land is not unfrequently interspersed. 

Considerable addition has been made to the cultivated land, in 
the memory of the present generation ; and, in many instances, 
it has been more than doubled. About 1790, and even at a later 
period, when the population did not exceed two-thirds of the pre- 
sent number, it was considered a favourable year indeed, when 
the produce of the harvest enabled the people to subsist, until the 
next year's seed was put into the ground. Now, on the contrary, 
with the exception of 1835-36-37, which may be ranked as years 
of famine, no active and providenttenant has, for more than twen- 
ty years past, found it necessary to buy meal for his family before 
tlie beginning of August. 

The tenants have an utter aversion, generally speaking, to take 
lease.;, from a mistaken notion, that it is the landlord, and not the 
tenant, who is thereby benefited. And even when they do enter 
into leases, they have been known to object to make improvements, 
which, before the expiry of their tacks, would have remunerated 
them tenfold for all their labour, — so little are the advantages 
arising from this kind of covenant between landlord and tenant 
understood here. 



92 



SHETLAND, 



Perliaps the greatest drawback to the improvement of Yell, 
and it may be of Shetland generally, and which, more than anv 
thmg else, operates as a drag on the resources of the landlord, is 
the small portions into which the land is let off to accommodate 
the present overgrown fishing population. For as each tenant, 
whether paying L, 1, 5s, or L, 5, must have a house to live in, 
built at an original cost of L, 15, and, upon an average, not last- 
ing more than twenty-five years, the heritor who has an income 
of L. 400 a-year, has at least an hundred houses on the property 
from which he draws this rent. Hence he is under the necessity 
of building four new houses annually, at an original cost of L, 60, 
and is exposed to the daily annoyance and expense of keeping the 
remaining ninety-six in a state of habitable repair, which the oc- 
cupants, being tenants at will, never consider themselves obliged 
to do. 

Until this system can be got rid of, which, it is likely, will be 
attempted, when the divisions of the commons, now in progress, 
are completed, there is but a slender prospect either of the tenant 
bettering his circumstances, or of the landlord increasing the value 
of his estate. 

That 33,000 acres of pasture, 1500 acres of arable, and 2500 
acres of inclosed grass land, should only produce an average rent 
of scarcely 8d. per acre, can only be attributed to the distance at 
which they are situated from a market for their produce. But it 
is hoped that the now regularly established communication week- 
ly, by steam, between Shetland and the coast of Scodand, will 
tend to open up a ready market for the various kinds of stock, ex- 
cite attention to the selecting and improving the native Shetland 
breeds, whether of black-cattle, sheep, or horses, and in the end 
greatly improve the circumstances both of landlord and tenant,

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

This parish occupies the greater part of the southern peninsu- 
la of Shetland. It includes the parishes of Sandwick and Cun- 
ningsburgh, now annexed to it ; also the Fair Isle. 

Mineralogy. — There was an attempt made to work a mine of 
copper on Fitfill, some specimens of the ore having been sent to 
the southward, and having attracted the attention of a mining com- 
pany. Some shafts were also sunk at Sand-lodge, in Sandwick pa- 
rish. But these attempts, not proving successful, have been aban- 
doned for many years. 

II — Civil History. 
There was a temporary residence in this parish for the Earls 
of Orkney, when they came to the country ; but the castle of 
Sculloway was their principal dwelling. 

Parochial Registers. — Parochial registers are kept, of the bap- 
tisms and marriages of persons connected with the Established 
Church ; but Dissenters do not register their baptisms ; and only

IV. — Industry. 
Dunrossness is fertile in the production of bear or big, and black 
oats ; considerable quantities of both, and also of potatoes of good 
quality, are annually carried to Lerwick, and sold to the inhabi- 
tants there, at reasonable prices. The standard weight of the 
lispund, of Norwegian origin, is 32 lbs. English ; but it is the 
custom to give 36 lbs. or more.

SHETLAND. 



No natural crops of clover and rye-grass spring here, except on 
a small spot at Sumburgh. 

The island of Colsay carries a good number of sheep of the 
English breed : and until the scab invaded the island of St Ni- 
nians, it carried a considerable number of sheep of a large kind. 
It is at present devoted to the grazing of cattle. 

There has happened a very heavy loss in this parish, of a snug 
estate that belonged to Alexander Sinclair, Esq. of Brow, all the 
most valuable part thereof having been blown over with sand, and 
only some small patches, called outsets or pendicles, now remain- 
ing. A part of the estate of Sumburgh, which was surrounded 
with sand, like an oasis in a desert, and which carried a good flock 
of sheep, is now also so much overspread with sand, that it has not 
one upon it. And a small inlet, which could formerly admit small 
craft, is now filling up very fast by sand blowing from the waste. 

Fishing. — Mr Bruce of Sumburgh's tenants are allowed to cure 
their own fish, which are delivered to him at a certain stipulated 
price, in their marketable state, and of course his lands are let at 
an advanced price. But other heritors who have the fish given 
them by their tenants in a green or uncured state, let their lands 
at an inferior price. 

A herring-fishing has, for some years past, been carried on, 
partly in Dunrossness, but chiefly in the parishes of Sandwick and 
Cunningsburgh, where a number of large boats have been fitted 
out at great expense. This fishing was begun by the tenants of 
Mr Bruce of Sumburgh, under his patronage ; and by his resid- 
ing at Sand Lodge, in the vicinity of the herring stations, he has 
given them great encouragement. Three or four brigs or sloops 
arrive annually at Levenwick bay, from Rothsay, and receive the 
herrings as they are caught, at a stipulated price per cran. Mr 
Bruce of Bigtown is, with his tenants, embarked in a similar enter- 
prise. 

Except at Quendale, Bigtown, and Sumburgh, where ploughs 
are used, the tenants, having but small portions of land, cultivate 
their ground with small spades. In Sandwick and Cunningsburgh, 
a few ploughs are used, drawn by small horses. • . 

Very little kelp is manufactured in this parish. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Some years ago, there was a very handsome, substantial, and 
expensive light-house, erected on the summit of Sumburgh Head, 
the most southerly promontory in Shetland. The tower is ele- 



DUNllOSSNESS.

gant, and the mansions of the keepers very neat. The expense, 
I beHeve, was about L. 40,000. It is visited annually by Robert 
Stevenson, Esq. civil-engineer ; and a yacht comes twice in the 
year, with stores. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are some persons of the Baptist 
persuasion here, but immersion seems not to be generally attrac- 
tive : and there are, also, a good number in both parishes, of 
Wesleyan Methodists. 

The stipend, by decreet of valuation, is L. 200, besides a sum 
for communion elements ; and the glebe is reckoned good, the 
soil being of excellent quality: it contains 13 acres of arable 
ground, and 14 or 15 acres of meadow ; but the pasture is not va- 
luable. 

Education. — This parish is much in want of proper schools for 
the education of the rising generation, there being, besides the pa- 
rochial, only some private ones kept by young men, employed by 
the parents at their own expense, and that only for a part of the 
year, — they betaking themselves to the fishing in summer, as what 
they earn from teaching does not compensate them. The paro- 
chial school is stationed in the parish of Sandwick. In Cun- 
ningsburgh, there are a school appointed by the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge, and a Sabbath evening school. 
There are few or none of the people who cannot read. 

Libraries. — There are two parochial hbraries, instituted lately, 
one in Cunningsburgh, and the other in Sandwick parish. There 
is also one in Dunrossness. 

Fuel — No large tracks of moss are here. Had that been the case, 
peats would not have needed to be transported from a great dis- 
tance to the southern extremity of the parish, a distance of four 
or five miles, upon small ponies, by which great expense is incurred. 

Fair Island. — This island is about .3 miles long and 2 broad. 
It lies about midway betwixt Orkney and Shetland. On the 
north-east corner of the island, there is a small harbour ; but ves- 
sels do not frequent it. There is a large peninsula called Bounness, 
which feeds a considerable flock of sheep of the south country breed, 
and is fenced with a high stone dike across the isthmus. The 
houses are all on the southern part of the island. To the north 
part of the cultivated ground, there is a fence of feal, which shuts 
It in and protects it from sheep. The names of the towns or ham- 
lets are, Shirva, Leogh, Bousta, Gelah, Seutter, and Taing. By 



96 



SHETLAND. 



the census taken this year, 1841, there were 95 inhabited 
houses, occupied by about 35 families : and there were 119 males 
and 1 13 females, — in all 232. A number of years ago, a few families 
removed to Orkney, — the island being rather overstocked with 
inhabitants. There are 96 merks of land in the island, besides a 
few outsets not long occupied. The people had found the prose- 
cution of the ling and tusk-fishing at a distance from the land, not 
profitable; and they now confine themselves to the catching of 
seath, that being not so dangerous and expensive an operation as 
the former. Of this about forty tons, in the dried state, have been 
generally transported to the Leith market ; which, during the ex- 
istence of the Government bounty, together with the oil produced, 
brought a good return. No fish is disposed of to straggling ves- 
sels that may appear on the coast, the fishermen being bound to 
deliver their products to the tacksman. What feu-duty is now 
paid from the island to Lord Dundas I am not aware ; but, instead 
of L. 34 Scotch, formerly paid to the minister as teinds, L.14, 
Os. lOd. Sterhng has been awarded by decreet of the Court, as his 
proportion of L.200, the stipend of the ministry at present. There 
remain some unexhausted teinds, which will raise the stipend 
to nearly L.300 per annum, when a fresh augmentation shall take 
place. 

The number of boats has considerably increased since the time 
of the last Statistical Account; and they all he on the south side 
of the island, in a creek, where a good many of the cod-fishing 
sloops belonging to the mainland take shelter, when the weather is 
unfavourable. 

The people are sober and industrious ; and niost vigorous 
and expert rowers. The Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge has granted a salary to a schoolmaster for his exertions in 
conducting the Sabbath evening school in this island.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND. 

THE REV. JOHN BRYDEN, MINISTER. 



Topography and Natdral History. 
Though the Islands of Hialtland, variously named Hethland 
Schetland, Shetland, Shetland, or Zetland, were assigned in wad ' 
sett to the Crown of Scotland nearly five hundred years aao, little 
more is known of them, generally speaking, than 'if theyhad re- 
mamed, to the present day, a pertinent of the Crown of Denmark. 

That the present inhabitants are of Scandinavian origin, many 
circumstances tend to prove. The historian, Torphaeus, asserts, 
that these islands were discovered about three hundred and eighty- 
five years before the birth of our Saviour; but that they miaht 
have been inhabited from a much earlier period. 

When Harold Harfagre, King of Norway, landed in Shetland 
in 875, he found « Papa;;" but these might have presided over 
the worship of Odin, and directed the rites paid to the Scandina- 
vian god. It is probable that the Christian religion was not at- 
tempted to be introduced among the natives till about the begin- 
nmg of the tenth century; and even then, its progress was very 
slow. For the Earls, who ruled with despotic sway, and who seU 
dom acknowledged any superior, longer than they could renounce 
their allegiance with impunity, uniformly opposed the introduction 
of Lhristianily ; till a circumstance took place, about the middle 
ot the tenth century, which brought about its reception and esta- 
blishment. The King of Norway happening to touch at the 
islands, invited the reigning Earl and his family on b6ard of his 
ship with the determination, it would appear, of converting him 
and his people to the Christian faith, by argument or force. The 
invitation being accepted, the King gave the Earl his choice, 
either to embrace the Christian religion, and be baptised, and thus 
secure his friendship, or to have his Earldom wrested from him 

SHETLAND.  ' 



98 



SHETLAND. 



aWd himself and family put to the sword. The Earl, for a tiire, 
hesitated as to the choice he should make ; but, seeing the sword 
about to be plunged into the breast of his son, parental tender- 
ness overcame his scruples; he renounced the worship of Odin, 
professed himself a Christian, and was baptised. His people soon 
after followed his example. 

Shetland, while subject to the Danish government, was govern- 
ed, in all civil matters, by a judge called " the Grand Foude 
and hence the country was designated by the name of a " Foud- 
rie." This Foudrie was divided into a number of small districts, 
over each of which was appointed a subordinate foude, or magis- 
trate. To him was committed the power of judging and deciding 
in cases of smaller moment, of keeping the peace and of regu- 
lating weights and measures. In the. discharge of these duties, be 
was assisted by inferior officers, called " Ranselmen," and " Law- 
rightmen." Whoever considered themselves aggrieved by the de- 
cision of the local foude and his officers, had the power of appeal 
to the Grand Foude, who, at his " lawting," assisted by the " UdaU 
men," made laws, and determined in all cases of life and death. 

After the islands were annexed to the Crown of Scotland in 
1470, in the reign of James III., their government was usually be- 
stowed on some Court favourite, who made the most of their preca- 
rious possession, and whose sway was generally marked with cruel- 
ty and oppression. Though these rulers were frequently changed, 
the poor islanders for a long time benefited little by any change 
which took place. And, while writhing under the yoke of the op- 
pressor, the knowledge that they were deprived of the means of 
redress, rendered that yoke still more galling. Even when sub- 
ject to a milder sway, the acts of former oppressors contmued to 
be felt; and many exactions, equally unjust in themselves, and 
contrary to express stipulations, were made, and contmued to be 
made; these, by prescription, having now become legal demands. 

a;„e._These united parishes seem to have taken then- name 
from the two bailiwicks or courts of justice held in them ; the one 
on the Ting or Taing, a neck of.land jutting into the sea, in the 
vicinity of Sand, hence Sand's Ting; the other similarly situated 
near Aith ; hence Aith's Ting. 

Under the chief foude or judge, there were inferior foudes or 
judges, whose province seems to have been, to hold then- courts 
in "places situated at a distance fi-om the principal foudry, or 
hih court, to which appeals were carried. 1 he appointment 



SANDSTING AND AITHSTING. O' 

of sheriff" put an end to these courts; but, it must be admitted,, 
that the municipal regulations by which their proceedings were 
conducted, were well calculated for preserving good order in the 
islands. 

Situation, Boundary, and Extent, — These united parishes are si- 
tuated in latitude 60° 30', and form the bounds of one ministry. 
They lie nearly in the middle of the mainland of Shetland, and are 
bounded on the east, by that part of the parish of Tingwall, called 
Wiesdale ; on the south and south-west, by the Atlantic Ocean ; 
on the north-west, by the parish of Walls ; on the north, by a large 
arm of the sea called the Minn, or Swarback's Minn, separating 
them from Muckle Roe, an island belonging to the parish of Del- 
ting ; and, on the north-east, they march with Delting on the 
Mainland. As no regular survey of the parishes has been made, 
or actual measurement of their extent taken, their dimensions 
cannot be stated with perfect accuracy ; but their length may be 
fairly estimated at 10 miles, and their breadth at 8 miles. 

Topographical Jjjpearaiices.— These parishes- are of an oblong 
figure, and their greatest length is from north to south, or rather 
from north north-west to south south east. They abound in knolls, 
or rising grounds ; but there are no hills of any considerable height 
m them, neither is there, in any one place, any considerable ex- 
tent of low level land. The cultivated lands are generally bounded 
on the one side by the sea, while the occupiers of lands, which 
are farther inland, have an easy access to the sea, none of them 
being more distant from it than a mile. All the rising grounds 
are covered with heather, interspersed with patches of green, on 
a mossy soil, while the nesses or peninsulas are generally green. 
The parishes abound in moss, which, in many places, is very deep, 
and which affords abundance of excellent fuel for the people, 
though it yields not much good pasture for the cattle. The shore 
on the west side, where it is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, is 
bold, and in the rocks are many caves, to which the wild pigeons 
resort. 

Climate.— A great deal of rain falls, and the air is generally very 
damp. Notwithstanding, however, the excess of moisture, the 
country cannot by any means be considered as unhealthy. Though 
the deep moss, which is the general soil in these parishes, may emit 
copious exhalations, these do not appear to cany with them any 
contagious miasmata. But when these exhalations are condensed 
and converted into hoar-frost, they often do very serious damage 



100 



SHETLAND. 



to the crops. If the corns are filling, and the potato haulms are 
green, they never recover. 

Heavy and long-continued rains frequently fall in every season 
of the year, but more especially in winter and spring. The hea- 
viest rains are from the south and south-west. Yet, while the 
climate is justly characterised as variable and uncertain, the best 
•proof that these changes are not prejudicial to the health is, that 
many of the inhabitants enjoy this blessing almost uninterruptedly 
till an advanced age. I may mention that there are eighteen per- 
sons now living in the parish, whose united ages amount to 1552. 

Voes or Bays. — The principal voes or bays on the north-west 
and west are, Gruting, Airs of Selivoe, and OUa's Voes, which 
lead in between the south point of the Island of Vaila, in the pa- 
rish of Walls, and the well known land-mark, the burgh of Culs- 
wick. The entrance is narrow, but deep ; and within, there is 
nothing to fear, — these three voes or bays being completely land- 
locked. They are also very extensive, capable of affording an- 
chorage to ships tf any burthen and in any number. 
■ Several miles to the southward and eastward, along a bold 
shore, are the two voes of Skeld. The more westerly voe opens 
to the south, and in it vessels seldom come to an anchor. The 
entrance to the more easterly voe is narrow, but inside it enlarges 
into a fine bason with excellent anchorage. 

By rounding a pretty high headland a little farther east, the 
entrance into Selivoe and Sand- Voe opens. These voes are se- 
parated from each other by a small island- called Kirk-holm, and 
a neck of land called Kirk-ness, The more westerly is Selivoe, 
which, in the Norwegian language, signifies Herring-voe, which 
extends a considerable way inland. In any part of it, a vessel 
may ride in perfect safety. Not even a swell from the ocean is 
felt here ; and if the anchors and cables are good, the bottom 
being a stiff blue clay, blow high, blow low, nothing is to be feared. 

Sand- Voe, on the contrary, is so very open to the south-west, 
and the ground so very loose, that no vessel would anchor in it 
unless in fine summer weather, and would hardly risk lying in it 
over night. 

Leaving Selivoe, crossing the mouth of Sand-Voe, and passmg 
through a narrow sound between the peninsula Foreness, and the 
smallisland Foreholm, Sandsound-Voe opens on the left, and 
winds in a northerly direction between five and six miles inland. 



SAXDSTING AND AITHSTING. 101 

ft takes different names according to the different places border- 
ing on it; such as Sandsound- Voe, Tresta-Voe, Bixter- Voe, &amp;c. 

Entering in from the west, through St Magnus's Bay, and on 
the north part of Aithsting, is the voe or bay of West Burrafirth, 
opening to the north, an unsafe harbour, and seldom taken by 
any vessel. Proceeding east, round the Nien or Ness of Brin- 
dister, a fine voe opens called the Voe of Brindister, from a vil- 
lage of that name near its mouth. As it extends inland several 
miles in a south-westerly direction, it takes the name of Unifirth-. 
Voe, from a village of that name situated on its west bank. It is 
here studded with several small green holms or islands, and its 
shores yield the richest, and, for the same extent, the greatest 
quantity of sea weed for kelp, which is perhaps in the country. 

In proceeding a little farther eas, and rounding a pretty high 
headland called the Ness of Nunsburgh, the Voe of Clousta 
opens, running inland about one mile and a -half in a southerly and 
south-easterly direction. This, as well as the Voe of Brindister, 
affords excellent anchorage, and in both, vessels can ride in the 
greatest safety. The west end of the Island of Vemeutry, with 
some small grazing holms, lie outside, and in a great measure 
cover the entrance into this voe. A vessel leaving Clousta Voe- 
and saiUng east, must steer outside of the Island of Vemeniry and 
through the Minn or Swarback's Minn. There is a passage in- 
side of the island, that is, between the island and the mainland; 
but It IS too narrow and shallow unless for boats. 

A little farther east, is the Island of Papa Little ; passin- be- 
tween It and a part of the mainland called Aithsness, Aith's- Voe 
opens to the southward, and East Burrafirth-Voe due east. Aith's- 
Voe is a very extensive inland harbour, while East Burrafirth-Voe 
is very small. Both, however, are perfectly safe. 

These are the principal voes or harbours in Sandstino- and 
Auhstmg. They are excellent in themselves, but their situation 
renders them comparatively of little benefit either to the public or 
to individuals. Several of them, however, abound with the lanest 
and finest oysters which are to be found in the kingdom. There 
are also many mussel scaaps or beds in them, which are used as 
bait for the small fishing ; and in the deeper parts of the voes, is 
to be found a large mussel called a yoag, which is used as bait by 
vessels in the cod-fishing. 

/s/aMcs — The principal islands are, Vementry and Papa Little 
Ihere are several other small islands or holms, which are capable 



102 



SHETLAND. 



of grazing one or two cows during tlie summer, or a few slieep ; 
and some of them yielding grass barely sufficient for supporting 
an eil-mark sheep for a few months, in the summer and harvest,  

Vementry is a large island, green on the east end, and covered 
with heather on the west. It is considered a rich island, and is 
capable of grazing about twenty score of sheep, besides a propor - 
tion of black-cattle. It is at present stocked with a heavy breed 
of sheep, generally of the white-faced kind. It jields a yearly 
rent to the proprietor, Mr Gifford of Busta, of upwards of L. 60 
Sterling. About one hundred years ago, it was purchased, 
stocked with fifteen score of sheep, for L. 30 Sterling; a striking 
proof how much money has been depreciated, while lands and 
produce have risen in value. There are three merks of rental 
land in the island, which was formerly cropped, but which, for 
these few years back, have been mostly converted into pasture. 
The greater part of the sheep stock are in steelbow.f The island 
pays of stipend to the minister, 16s. 6d. Sterling. 

The Island of Papa Little is neither so rich in quality, nor so 
extensive as Vementry. It also consists of three merks of rental 
land, which is cropped by the tenant. It will carry about ten 
score of sheep, which, till lately, were of the native breed, but 
are now begun to be crossed with the white and black- faced kinds. 
But the tenant is of opinion that the island, owing to the want of 
a sufficiency of good food, is incapable of carrying a heavy breed 
of sheep. The rental land is of a very good quality, but the pas- 
ture ground has a very parched appearance, consisting principally 
of stinted heather. In addition to the sheep slock, the tenant 
keeps about fifteen head of black-cattle, young and old. The 
island was some time since held in steelbow, but it now pays a 
yearly rent of L. 20 to the proprietor. Sir Arthur Nicolson. It 
pays of stipend to the minister, 1.3s. 6d. per annum. The sheep 
in Vementry and Papa Little are free from the scab. 

Springs. — There are innumerable springs in the parish, of pure 
and wholesome water, and also many which have passed over 
bog-iron, and which are strongly impregnated with its tint and 
taste. 

Lochs. There are no fewer than 140 lochs in the parish, 

• Kil-mark, a beast which no dike will mm, and which cannot be- kept out of 

"sicdbow : that is, the tenant receives a certain number of sheep, cows, or horses, 
for the use and profits of which he pays a certain sum per head yearly, and at the 
expiry of his lease is bound to leave an eual number. 



SANDSTING AND AITIISTINO.

some of which are of very considerable exlent. They are ge- 
nerally skirted with green, and several of them are studded witli 
islets or holms, on which numerous wild fowls build their nests. 
The water is very dark- coloured, owing to the mossy nature of 
the soil through which the rivulets run, which feed the lochs. 

Geology and Mineralogy.- — Quartzose gneiss abounds in the hill 
of Riissness, on the east side of the voe of Sandsound, and to the 
southward of a village of that name. It contains a great quantity 
of quartz and of light-coloured mica. The line of bearing may be 
stated on an average from south 12° west, to north 12° east. The 
•dip is to the west, at angles most frequently from 70° and up- 
wards. The position of the strata is sometimes vertical. 

The rocks in Foreness a peninsula to the southward of Inner- 
sand, and lying between Sand-voe and Sandsound-voe, partake of 
the common description of gneiss, the felspar being in excess, the 
other ingredients being present, and the strata traversed by small 
veins of granite. 

At Berfield, a little above Sandsound, on the east side of the 
voe, talc takes the place of mica, not only in the gneiss, but also 
in the granitic veins. 

A little to the northward of Innersand, on the west side of the 
voe of Sandsound, a quarry of chromate of iron was opened some 
years ago. But though several tons of it have at different times 
been sent to market, the quality of it, and the returns made, did 
not warrant a continued working of it. I have seen several large 
imbedded masses of chromate of iron at Garden, in Aithsting. 
These are the only places in the parish, where it has been disco- 
vered. A little to the north of the chromate quarry, limestone 
makes its appearance. 

At a burn called Tactagill, about a mile to the eastward of 
Tresta, which is situated on the eastern bank of a continuation of 
Sandsound-voe, here called Tresta-voe, a great quantity of por- 
celain earth, of a yellowish white colour, is to be found. Rocks of 
gneiss, of which white quartz is one of the component parts, 
blended with talc and felspar, extend from Reawickness to Kirk- 
ness, and the west shore of Bixter-voe, being a continuation of 
Sandsound voe. The directions of the strata are from south 13° 
west, to north 15° east, and from south 20° west, to north 20° 
cast. Several interstrata of limestone make their appearance, in 
a Ime of direction nearly parallel to that of the strata among which 
they occur. Limestone appears in Kirkholm, Kirkness, both on 



104 



SHETLAND. 



the east side of Selivoe, and on the west side ofBixtervoe. The 
predominating rocks, in a line from Reawicii, along the west bank 
of Selivoe to the west bank of Bixter voe, are red granite, which 
comprehends all Sandsting to the west. It contains veins of 
quartz, and, of course, very red felspar. 

The quartz rock of Aithsting is of a bluish grey colour, and 
presents something of a wedge-like shape. The two bounding 
lines diverging from a point in the island of Papa Little, are con- 
tinued in a direction of south 60° west, to the westward ; whilst 
the other extends in a straight line south 32 west, to the head of 
Bixter-voe, when it first comes in contact with the granite of Sand- 
sting. The quartz admits into its composition so much felspar, 
that in decomposed specimens, where this ingredient is particular- 
ly demonstrated, it is sufficiently distinguished from the sandstone 
of newer formations, which it otherwise resembles. Siliceous mat- 
ter is, however, the prevalent substance. In the vicinity of Aiths- 
ness, it contains small sparing portions of clayslate, by which it 
becomes the grauwacke of some authors. At Papa Little, Aiths- 
ness, Clousta-voe, Nunsburgh, and West Burrafirth, the rock is, 
in several places, varied by the presence of small angular portions 
of red felspar, and passes into felspar porphyry. At Aithsness, it 
contains greenstone as well as limestone, in the form of thin beds 
or veins. It is also impregnated with much ferruginous, in the 
shape of an oxide. In some places, are to be observed veins of 
sparry iron-o.-e. 

The quartz rock generally consists of minute grains firmly unit- 
ed together, and possessing semicrystalline forms. In this respect 
it differs from a particular variety of sandstone found on the east 
side of the island, where the texture is much looser, and where 
the grains show numerous marks of attrition. South of the hill of 
Aithsness, and at a few other places, the particles of quartz di- 
minish so much in size, that the rock appears of a compact struc- 
ture. 

The stratification of the quartz rock seems remarkably connect- 
ed with the partial occurrence of mica, whilst its line of direction 
does not follow that of other mountain masses of Shetland, which 
have been represented as stretching from south by west, to north 
by east. On the contrary, it extends from south 60° east, to 
north 60° west, from east to west, and from south 70° west, to 
north 70" east. The dip is at various points of the compass, while 
the angle of inclination is, as appears in an horizontal section, 



SANDSTING AND AITIISTING. 



105 



from 40° to 45°. In several places, the quartz is decidedly unstra- 
tified, and yields to blows of the hammer equally in various direc- 
tions ; but whether stratified or unstratified, it is resolved by other 
seams into polyedrous masses of various magnitudes. 

At the north voe of Clousta, there occurs, resting on the quartz, 
a small roundish conglomerated mass of granite, felspar, and 
quartz, scarcely, perhaps, more than 150 yards in diameter; a 
gradual transition of one rock into the other being observable at 
the junction. A few of the conglomerate strata next to those of 
the quartz, range at a common angle of 45°. But crossing the 
strata for a few yards only, they gradually acquire an inclination 
with the horizon of only 10°, and maintaining this position, they 
are terminated. Now, there is every reason to suppose, that the 
lower edges of the strata of the conglomerate rock are in contact 
with the surface formed by the upper edges of quartz. This 
change of inclination, therefore, from 45° to 10° can be satisfac- 
torily accounted for, on the supposition that the strata had acquir- 
ed an addition of new matter in their descent, which may either 
consist in an increased thickness of the strata, or in an accession 
of new strata. It is thus that the increased accumulation of mat- 
ter which the strata may possibly have received in proportion 
to their depth, would produce an elevation of the uppermost 
strata. 

The quartz rock of Aithsting passes into the granite rock of 
Sandsting, at the bead of Bixter-voe, by gradually losing its homo- 
geneous appearance, and by its ingredients being interspersed 
m a distmct form of larger grains or concretions, until the rock 
IS at length wholly composed of semicrystalline portions of quartz 
and felspar. Occasionally, however, an alternation takes place of 
the two rocks. To the north of Bixter-voe, the quartz rock is 
contiguous to gneiss ; but the junction is, for the most part, much 
concealed by a deep moss. At Braganess, to the north-west of 
Aithsness, the line of demarcation between the two rocks is per- 
fectly complete, no transition taking place. 

The quartz rock is elevated into numerous irregular ridges, not 
above 600 or 700 feet high, running from east to west, and inter- 
sected by valleys. 

Much of the surface of the quartz rock is concealed by a deep 
peat moss ; but everywhere, a great display of bog .iron is presented. 

The strata of gneiss which, from the island of Papa Little along 
the north coast of Aithsting, for a distance of upwards of five 



106 



SHETLAND. 



miles due west, are so associated with hornblende slate, and inti- 
mately combined with the panicles of hornblende, that Dr Hib- 
bert has given to the rock the name of hornblendic gneiss. " In 
most specimens," says be, " which we examine, the hornblende is 
either openly manifested, or is in such an intimate state of union 
with the felspar, as to impart to this ingredient of the rock a green- 
ish tinge." The other ingredients of quartz, felspar, and mica are, 
as in all other varieties of gneiss, described to be found in very 
different proportions. 

The gneiss, at the Nien or Ness of Brindister, is traversed with 
a vein of granite of very considerable size, being not less than 4.5 
feet broad, and running from south-west by south to north-east by 
north. At Vementry, the veins of granite are particularly tortu- 
ous, and ramify in the most remarkable manner. 

Besides granite, veins of quartz, compact felspar, felspar-por- 
phyry, greenstone, or sienitic greenstone, are often seen. Thin 
interstrata, of very pure limestone, are to be seen at Braganess, 
West Burrafirth, and other places. The granitic veins which tra- 
verse them, are often diverted from their course in the most re- 
markable manner, showing great signs of distortion. 

The presence of beds of hornblende slate, or of intermixed par- 
ticles of hornblende, has a strong tendency to disturb the strata 
among which they appear. On this account, any general state- 
ment of the most prevalent line of direction would be impossible. 
The direction, which may possibly be the most prevalent, has been 
found to be from south-west by south to north-east by north. The 
dip was mostly to the west, at angles from 50° to 70°. 

The relations of the strata are much concealed by the sea. At 
Vementry and Braganess, the line of direction stretches from the 
bluish-grey quartz rock, near Aithsness, to the granite of Vemen- 
try ; consequently, the strata are opposed to the bounding lines of 
each of these masses, at various angles. More westerly, they only 
meet, under similar circumstances, the quartz rocks of this dis- 
trict. The invasions which take place, in the form of dikes or 
veins, from the contiguous mountains of granite, both in the south 
end of the Island of Meikle Roe and in the west end of Vemen- 
try, are very large, and are particularly seen near the junction of 
the gneiss and granite in the neighbourhood of the dwelling-house 

in Vementry. . r • , 

I have frequently found, on the shore, iieces of pumice stone, 
which, from its small specific gravity, readily floats on the water : 

4 



SANDSTING AND AITIISTING. 107 

these specimens, it is probable, were driven here from the volcanic 
rocks of Iceland. 

I have also picked up, at different times, several Molucca beans, 
the production of the West Indies ; and have seen some of the 
larger ones of them converted into snuff-boxes, having a top of 
lead or pewter affixed to them. 

The soil, in a very few places, is sandy; in some, clay; in 
others, a light brown mould; but, in the greater part of the pa- 
rish, it consists of a deep black moss. In cold seasons, particu- 
larly in the month of May and beginning of June, the grub worm 
often does great damage to the corns, by destroying the roots. In 
1829, I sowed a small quantity of buck wheat on the glebe, which 
presented a very fine appearance, till it was in blossom, when the 
grub attacked it, and did not leave a single stalk. 

Zooloffi/.-The fresh water lakes abound with that species of 
front usually known by the name of the burn-trout, some of which 
I have caught weighing upwards of six pounds. The sea-trout and 
the burn-trout enter the burns to spawn in August or September, 
according to the time when the rains have swelled the burns. If 
the weather has been fine, and falls of rain, it is very interesting 
to observe the anxiety which the fronts manifest to fulfil their des- 
tination. They leap about the mouth of the burn, where it emp- 
ties itself into the sea, and show distinctly that they know their 
particular season ; and, in their eagerness to gain this end, they 
frequently run into shallow water, and are taken. 

Trouts are often taken by setting a net across the mouth of the 
burn, where it empties itself into the sea, at the time of the tide 
of flood ; and, when it has ebbed sufficiently, they are an ea-y 
prey,— being either entangled in the net, or left without the means 
of escape. There is another method which is often had recourse to 
for the same purpose, viz. « the houvie." The houvie is made of 
the stalks of the dock, wide at the one end, and narrow at the 
other. A dike is built across the burn, leaving an open space in 
the middle sufficient to admit the wider end of the houvie After 
the houvie is firmly placed in this open space, a person, with a 
stick in his hand, wades down the burn, and drives the trouts be- 
lore him. Havmg entered the houvie and reached its narrow end, 
they cannot turn to get out again. 

In most of the friths or voes, there are haddocks, whitings, cod- 



108 



SHETLAND. 



lings, flounders, halibut, skate, mackerel, and herrings in summ 
and harvest, and the cole-fish or seath, with its numerous fry call- 
ed sillocks and piltocks. The sillocks do not exceed six inches in 
length the first year, and are known by this name till they have 
drunk of the first tide of summer, after which they take the name of 
piltocks, and will be found from ten to twelve inches long. When 
two years old, they are called bilyia piltocks; when three years old, 
Steven piltocks; and afterwards they are known by the name of 
seath. The seath-fishing is not prosecuted in this parish. 

Shell-fish of every kind are to be found in the voes or friths ; 
oysters, large mussel or yoag, common mussel, spouts or razor- 
fish, cockles, smisslings, cuUicks, welks, buckles, limpets, crabs, 
lobsters, harps, &amp;c. 

Botany, — Under this head I may observe, that wherever the 
moss is so deep as to admit of peats being taken, roots and branches 
of the birch and hazel have very frequently been dug up. The 
mountain-ash or rowan-tree, the hazel, the honeysuckle, the hip- 
brier, and willow, are natives in many of the islets or holms in 
the fresh water lochs. In any other situations, I believe, they 
could not exist; for horses, cows, and sheep, browse upon and 
destroy every thing that comes in their way, when they are 
hard pressed for food. And this may be the reason why plants 
of this description, and, perhaps, others have disappeared from 
the common range of pasture. That trees will grow and attain 
a considerable size, if properly sheltered and defended from 
man and beast, I have abundant proof. In my garden a native 
mountain-ash has attained to such an height, that crows have 
built a nest in it. And a bower or elder tree also grows in my 
garden, graced with a crow's nest. In the garden at Sand, formerly 
the seat of Sir John Mitchell of Westshore, there are plane, ash, 
elder, rowan, and hawthorn-trees, of considerable size. It may 
be remarked, that, if plantations are ever attempted, they must be 
on a large scale, so that the plants may afford shelter to each other; 
and they must also be protected by a wall, which could not only 
defend from the encroachments of cattle, but which would also be 
proof against the inroads of man. For a shrub of the size of a 
walking-stick, a flail-tree,, or a fishing-rod, would prove a tempta- 
tion too strong for the moral courage of a Shetlander to resist. 

The apple-tree blossoms, and carries fruit ; but 1 have never 
seen it come to perfection. It is different, however, with the 
smaller fruits. The gooseberry, the black, red, and white cur-

rants, thrive well, and in good seasons come to perfection, and are 
particularly fine-flavoured. Strawberries in the gardens, and 
craw-berries on the hills, ripen well and are abundant. Rhubarb, 
mint, and every kind of vegetable usually raised in the kitchen- 
garden, are raised here in perfection.

•Parochial Registers. — The acts or minutes of session commence 
in 1733, and are contained in one volume. They appear to have 
been regularly kept from that period, till about 1765 ; but between 
the death or demi.ssion of one minister and the admission of ano- 
ther, little care seems to have been taken of the register ; so that 
now, it is in a very shattered and imperfect state. 

Antiquities. — The small island, called Kirk-holm, in the mouth 
of Selivoe, presents every appearance of having at one time been 
put in a state of defence. A breast work of earth ]-ound the 
most accessible parts of the island, i. e. on the west, north, and 
part of the east sides, is still visible ; and the foundations of nine 
houses, for the accommodation of those who may have fortified 
themselves in it, can also be traced. Two of the houses, which 
have been erected at the north end of the holm, stood north and 
south, with their door towards the west, and measure each 3d 
feet long by 12 feet broad inside. At a distance of 42 feet to 
the southward, is the foundation of another house of 23 feet long

by 10 feet wide, standing east and west, with the door towards 
the north ; and at a distance of 42 feet to the southward of this 
last-mentioned house, is the first of six houses more, which six 
liouses stand parallel to each other, and in the direction of east 
and west, with their doors towards the north. All the houses are 
separated from each other; but the intermediate space between 
them appears to have been no more than sufficient to have ad- 
milted one person. The doors have been 3 feet wide. 

As there are no springs of water in the holm, a tank or re- 
servoir appears lo have been formed for the reception of rain- 
water, or of water brought from the adjoining ness. 

There are five burying places in the parish, viz. at Sand, West 
Skeld and Gruting in Sandsting, and at Twatt and Aith in Aith- 
sting. Though at two of them only, viz. Sand and Twatt, is 
it certain that churches have been built, yet it is more than pro- 
bable that, while the Roman Catholic religion flourished in the 
islands, there have been churches or chapels in the immediate 
neighbourhood of them all. In addition to the church or chapel 
and burying-ground at West Skeld, there are the ruins of a burgh 
or fort. From the ruins which still appear, we are warranted to 
infer, that it was a place of very considerable dimensions; but what 
these were, or in what form the burgh itself was constructed, can- 
not now be ascertained. It was built of blocks of red granite, 
without cement. In the eighth century, and while defended by a 
band of brave and trusty warriors, we may suppose it affording 
protection to the lives, and the goods and gear of the udalmen 
around ; but in the nineteenth century, its venerable ruins may be 

• Tradition says, that in 1588, one of the Spanish Armada was lost in what is 
called the deeps or haddock-sand, a few miles to the southward that crew took 
shelter in the holm, and that they fortified themselves in .t ull ''''y I''l 
reception they were likely to receive from the natives. Ih.s tradition support- 
ed by the fact, that a particular spot whore the fishermen set ihe.r hnes, and where 
the ship is said to have foundered, is known to the present tune by the name of the 
ship. Tradition farther says that, in gratitude for their preservation, and 'iiend- 
ly reception they met wiUi, the crew built a church at Sand, about a mile and a halt 
from the holm, and dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin. It appears to have been a 
very neat and substantial building, with a chancel or choir on the east end, separated 
from the bodv of the church Uy an arch extending from one side to the other. Ihere 
does not appear to have been any hewn stones made use of in the budding; butsucU

yard dikes, &amp;c. of fifteen families in the village. 

About a mile to the westward of the two Culswicks, and on the 
summit of a precipitous cliff of red granite, of several hundred feet 
in height, stands a burgh, or rather the ruins of a burgh, which 
still, though recently demolished, presents the appearance of hav- 
ing been in former days a place of very great strength. 

A burgh, built on a low neck of land, and formerly surrounded 
by the sea, is to be seen immediately below the present dwelling- 
houses of Nunsburgh. 

Another burgh stands in the middle of the voe of East Burra- 
firth, a few hundred yards from its mouth, and opposite the dwel- 
ling-houses. Whether this burgh was built on an islet or a foun- 
dation forced for it, I cannot say. The voe is not deep where it 
stands, and there is no spare space around it. 

There are several other ruins in the parish ; but, as all of them 
are to be met with on the tops of rising grounds only, the most 
probable conjecture regarding them is, that they have been watch- 
towers : and this conjecture is supported by the name given to the 
particular spots which these ruins occupy, — for instance, " the 
wart" which, no doubt, is a corruption of ward of Reawlck ; 
" the wart" of Brouland, &amp;c. 

In his notices of Shetland, Mr Pennant observes, " that the 
Norwegians had anciently their ward-madher or watchman, a sort 
of sentinel who stood on the top of a vord-hill, and challenged all 
who came in sight." We know that it is customary with foreign- 
ers to change lo into v, — thus, ward, vard or vord, Shetlandice, 
wart. 

There are several tall unhewn stones standing in different parts 
of the parish.f The purpose of these cannot be stated with cer- 
tainty. 

' See description of this burgh by Dr Hibbert. 

t r may mention tiie tradition respecting two standing stones in the neighbour- 
hood of West Skeld, which will show how little credit is to be given to tradition 
when unsupported by some coUateriil evidence. These two stones are said to be the 
metamorphosis of two wizards or giants, who were on their way to plunder and mur- 
der the inhabitants of West Skeld ; but, not having calculated their time with suffi- 
cient accuracy, before they could accomplish their purpose, or retrace their steps to 
their dark abodes, the first rays of the tuorning sun appeared, and they were inune- 
diately transformed, and remain to the present time in the shape of two tall moss, 
grown stones of ten foct in height. All the ancient buildings which have been erect- 
ed, and large stones which have been raised upright, about which there is no parti- 
cular tradition, are uniformly ascribed to the agency of the Picts, or Peclits, as they 
.-ire called, or to evil spirits.

Barroivs or Tumuli. — In several parts of the parish, there arc 
the remains of several barrows or tumuli, probably of Scandina- 
vian origin, some of which I have opened, but could not congratu- 
late myself on my researches, they having been opened before. In 
some, I have found bones partly consumed by fire, pieces of charred 
wood, and parts of the urn in which the bones had been deposited. 
The urns appeared to have been rudely wrought out of a coarse 
sandstone, and others out of a soft stone called kleber. In some 
cases, there is every reason to believe that the body had been 
burned at the spot where the ashes had been collected, and placed 
in the urn; because the stones which were found to surround the 
urn, over which the tumulus was raised, had been subjected to the 
action of a strong fire. In other cases, the urns have been placed 
on a dry piece of ground, covered with a flat stone, and a little 
earth thrown over them. Of this latter description I have one in 
my possession, which I found under the foundation of the glebe 
dike. It measures 12 inches over the mouth, 10 inches over the 
bottom, and is 10 inches deep. It contained a quantity of half- 
burnt bones, and was covered with a pretty heavy stone, flat on 
the side next to the urn. Unfortunately, it was partly broken be- 
fore I discovered it. There is, however, enough remaining to 
show its shape and workmanship. 

I have discovered two other urns on the glebe, filled with a black 
unctuous earth, but so much decayed, that no part of them could 
be lifted. Cut of one of them I removed the earth, and found, 
lying at right angles in the bottom, four pieces of broken stone 
axes. 

session of a quern or hand-mill, dug out of the ruins of the burgh at Easter Skeld. 
It is 13 inches in diameter, and 2\ inches in thickness. It appears to have been 
formed in the same way as the hand-mills now are, or rather it has been the model 
by which they have been made. It has groups or grooves cut for the site to rest in, 
and an hole for the handle. I have recovered the half only of the under stone, the 
dimensions of which have exceeded a little those of the upper stone. They are both 
made of the same kind of stone micaceous schistus as the millstones now in use are 
made of. 

• I subjoin Dr Hibbert's description of these instruments, and then add the obscr- 
v-ations I have to offer : — 

" The ancient weapons of war discovered in Shetland are of stone. That such 
were used by the Teutonic tribes of Europe in the eighth century, and prob.-ibly very 
long before, is evident from the fragment of a prose iomance written about that pe- 
riod, in the Saxon dialect of the Teutonic. This manuscript, which is preserved in 
Cassel, was first printed in Eccardi Comment, de relnis Francia; Orientalis, and it has 
been reprinted with a Latin and English translation, in an interesting work lately 
published in Edinburgh, entitled, " illustrations of Northern Antiquities." From 
this very curious document, two or three disjoined passages may be given, by which 
we may sec the reference which is made to the Teutonic burgh, and to the arms con- 
temporary with this early kind of fortress :— ' I heard it related that Hiltibrant and 
Ilatubrant with one mind agreed to go on a warlike expedition. The relatives sons

at Sancl in Sandsting, and anotlier at Twalt in Aithsting. The minis- 
ter officiated at each every alternate Sabbath. The present kirk was 

kings, it was named a halbert, from tlie Teutonic, hale, a court, and barde, an axe. 
In the true spirit, therefore, of archaiological reasoning, it may be pronounced that 
the blade of this variety of the Shetland steinbarte and the hypothetical handle to 
which it is fastened, constitute the rude form of the northern halbert. 

The blades of steinbartes are very abundantly found in Shetland. Not unfreqaent- 
ly, several of them are discovered buried together, thus indicating a little armoury, 
from which a number of weapons might be distributed on an emergency, by the hand 
of some chief to a small band of natives met together, on the alarm of common danger. 
Assemblages of these weapons have been found in the parishes of Walls, of Delting, 
and ill the Island of Unst. In Northmavine, says Mr Low of Orkney, seven were 
discovered tinder ground, disposed in a circular arrangement, with the points of each 
directed towards the centre of the ring: — it is a pity that the number of these wea- 
pons was not nine, corresponding to the nine wounds of a lance in the form of a cir- 
cle, which the deified Scandinavian hero Odin gave himself, when, by an act of sui- 
cide, he showed an example of death to his surrounding followers. At any rate, the 
circular arrangement of the weapons remains, indicative of a mystical allusion, and 
that is quite sufficient to provoke an antiquarian inference. 

Regarding the people by whom these stone-axes were used, the natives of Shetland 
have not the least tradition, and this circumstance is a proof of their great antiquity. 
They are supposed to have dropt from the clouds, endowed with the power of pro- 
tectin" the houses in which they are preserved from the effects of thunder ; hence 
they are commonly named thunder-bolts, &amp;c — Iter ii. Some of the stone-axes, as 
Dr Hibbert observes, are of green porphyry, but I have seen some of them formed 
out of a remarkably compact grey-coloured stone. And even the green porphyry in 
some of them, from a particular chemical action to which they have been exposed, 
have, in a great measure, lost their distinguishing tint, and become of a whitish grey- 
colour. I have specimens of the stone axe of various dimensions, frorn 54 inches to 
6, 8, 10, and 13 inches in length. The cutting edge of the smallest is two inches, 
and of the largest 3 inches broad ; and they gradually taper to a point at the oppo- 
site extremity. All the specimens in my possession are convex on both sides, but 
more so on the one side than on the other. 

I have some steinbartes of an oval figure, and others of an heart-shape, with the 
apex considerably shortened, both formed of the two kinds of stone above mentioned. 
The largest of ti.e oval ones is 8\ inches long, and 4 inches deep. The cutting edge 
extends to two-thirds of its circumference, and the remaining third is rounded off, 
apparently for the purpose of holding in the hand. The heart-shaped one has a cut- 
ting edge in every part. I have one different in shape from either of these two ; it 
describes almost a semicircle on the one end, and draws towards a point at the other. 
The semicircle, and as far as the point have cutting edges; the back is half an inch 
thick, nearly straight, and rounded off. Several stone axes, on removing the surface 
of the ground, were found lying together, a short time ago, within the dikes of Sto- 

nadale. ... 

It has been maintained, that the larger steinbartes were used as warlike weapons. 
This may have been the case ; but that they were inserted in an haft or handle, ap- 
pears to me very doubtful. From their tapering shape, no thong could have secured 
them in such a position, and having no neck which the handle might grasp, the act 
of lifting it to give a blow, would even be sufficient to cause it slip from its place. 

Neither is any proof to be deduced from the .ippcarance of the thin and broad- 
shaped steinbartes, that they ever were used as halberts. To have rendered them ef- 
ficient as a weapon of war, not only must the liaft have been grooved, but there 
ou"-ht also to have been a corresponding groove in tlio steinbarte, to retain it in its 
ri]ace something after the manner of dove-tailing in wood. As there are no marks 
indic.iting this lo have been the case, the steinbarte ought to have been perforated, 
that it mi;ht have been firmly secured in the groove of the handle

ministry. To have been so it ought to have been placed at CEfirth, 
about two miles farther north. It is seated to accommodate 437 
persons, allowing about sixteen inches to each person. 

Mansion-Houses, — The mansion-houses of proprietors are only 
three in number, viz. Sand House, Garder House, and Reawick. 
Sand House was built in 1754 by Sir Andrew Mitchell of West- 
shore, Bart. The house, gardens, &amp;c. have been, for about forty 
years, the property of the present John Scott, Esq. of Scalloway ; 
but they are fast falling into ruins. 

Garder House, a miniature resemblance of Sand House, was 
built by John Gumming, son of one of the ministers of the parish, 
about 1760, on four merks of land, rented for many years after at 
L.4 Sterling per annum. It is now the property of James Greig, 
Esq. writer in Lerwick. 

Reawick is a plain modern building of six rooms, the property 
of Andrew Umphray, Esq. a minor. 

Mills. — There are about fifty mills in the parish driven by wa- 
ter, and querns or hand-mills without number. 

Ploughs. — When my predecessor, the Rev. Patrick Barclay, 
wrote his Statistical Account of the parish in 1797, there were 
fourteen ploughs, of a construction peculiar to Shetland, in the 
parish. There is not one of that description in it now, and they 
are fast falling into disuse throughout the island.

• At that time it must have been a very elegant house with two wings, and the re-

on each side of which is a garden of considerable extent, which has been tastefully 
laid out — in a line with the outer walls of the gardens, and towards the head ol the 
voe, is an enclosure of about three acres. 'I he beautiful old castle of Scalloway, 
built by Earl Patrick Stewart about 1600, was spoiled of much of its ancient gran- 
deur, by having its dressed freestones torn from their place, to supply door iind win- 
dow jambs and lintels, and corner stones for this mansion. But the spoliiilion of 
the castle, though its foundation was laid in blood, and every stone of its walls tuld 
of opiression, was not permitted to proceed without a fearful warning. While the 
work of demolition was busily going on, a voice, it is said, was heard to decUre,

Character, c. of the People. — The people in general are of the 
middle stature, and well-proportioned, having brown or yellow hair. 
Their features are rather small than otherwise, of an agreeable 
expression, and have nothing of that harshness which is characte- 
ristic of the Anglo-Saxon descent. Both sexes manifest an insati- 
able curiosity for prying into the concerns of others ; and with an 
acuteness scarcely to be credited, and a perseverance worthy of a 
better object. When the direct question and sly insinuation have 
failed, nothing daunted they will renew their efforts, and, if still 
unsuccessful, they will substitute their own conjectures for the in- 
formation withheld. 

They are hospitable to a proverb, and would share their last 
morsel with their neighbour, or even with a stranger whom they 
had never before seen. They have a great volubility of speech, 
and are no mean adepts in flattery, when they think it will promote 
their particular views. Though many carry their passion for dress 
to an unbecoming and even an extravagant length, it gives me 
much pleasure to bear testimony to their general sobriety of con- 
duct, and attention to the external ordinances of religion. They 
may, with truth, be said to be a church-going people, and I trust 
many of them have felt the power of religion, are living under its 
influence, " and asking the way to Zion with their faces thither- 
ward." 

IV. — Industry. 
Arable Lands.— ThoxQ are 777 merks of arable lands in these 
united parishes ; but the extent of-a merk of land cannot now be as- 
fertained. Originally it must have been very small, and have com- 



SANDSTING AND AITIISTING. ]\7 

preliendetl the infield or bear-land only. From the additions 
made by successive tenants, the merk of land has increased, in 
many cases, to eight or ten times its original extent. Besides the 
original arable land, and the successive additions made to it, there 
are no fewer than one hundred and four " outsetts" in the pa- 
rishes ; that is, when a tenant finds himself unable to pay his 
former rent, or when a newly married couple can obtain land in 
no other way, they fix upon some particular spot in the common 
pasture, — obtain leave from the principal proprietor of the nearest 
arable lands, and enclose as much ground as they think will sup- 
port their family ; and such an enclosure is called " an outsett." 
Sometimes, the proprietor builds the dwelling-house and dikes, and 
charges rent from the time of entry; at other times, the tenant 
builds these, and sits rent free, for seven" or nine years. 

Agriculture — Agriculture may justly be said to be in its infancy 
in the parish ; and as long as the landlords continue to reduce the 
farms to the least possible size, no improvements can be expected. 
Farms which formerly were possessed by one or two tenants, are 
now occupied by five or six. There are only three ploughs in the 
parish, — one on the glebe, drawn by two oxen ; one in Reawick, 
and one in the island of Papa-Little, each drawn by four ponies. 
The plough used on the glebe is of Small's make ; the other two 
are made in Lerwick, after a pattern by Morton, Leith-walk. 
The Shetland plough, so minutely described by my predecessor, 
the Rev. Patrick Barclay, in his Statistical Account of the parish, 
is not now used. All the lands in the parish, with the exception of 
those just mentioned, are turned over with a small spade peculiar 
to tle country. The harrows in general use are made of two pa- 
rallel pieces of wood, about three feet long, with from eight to ten 
wooden teeth in each piece, and are connected at the ends by a 
cross bar of eighteen inches long. These are drawn by a man or 
woman, with a rope tied to each end of one of the parallel pieces 
or sides. There are some lands in the parish, on which even a 
wooden harrow has never been used. Instead of which, after the 
ground is delved, sown, and manured, a besom of heather is pro- 
cured, and a person sweeps mould, seed, and manure overhead. 

Crops. — The crops raised are potatoes, oats, and bear or big; 
and the old distinction of infield and outfield is still continued.. 
On the infield-land bear having four or six rows of grain on the 
head is sowed year after year, if we except as much of it as will 
grow the one-hulf of the potatoes the family may require. Thq 



118 



SHETLAND. 



infield, when laboured for a crop of bear, is always well manured, 
from a compost of cow's dung, earth, and sea-weed, when it can 
be got, prepared during the previous summer and harvest, and 
laid on the top and turned under. Dung is very seldom laid on 
that part of the infield which is laboured for potatoes, from an opi- 
nion that the potatoes are softer and more watery when the land 
has been dunged, than otherwise. By this management, it is evi- 
dent that the land must be greatly exhausted and must require a 
very great addition to the usual quantity of manure, to yield any- 
thing like a tolerable crop, the following year. In some places, the 
infield has been sown with bear, year after year, and has never been 
known to produce any other crop, or once permitted to lie ley. 

The outfield is uniformly laboured to oats, with the exception 
of as much of it as will grow the remaining quantity of potatoes 
required for the family. Sometimes, though rarely, a little out- 
field bear is tried on the land that was laboured to potatoes, the 
previous year. All the outfield is manured, whether intended for 
a crop of oats or potatoes ; but with this difference, the oats are 
sowed first, and then the manure is carried and spread, and both 
are harrowed in together ; whereas the manure for the potatoes is 
spread on the stubble, and delved under. Sometimes, the pota- 
toes are planted in the furrow, and covered with the next feal ; 
and sometimes, the ground is delved first, and the potatoes dibbled 
in afterwards. The manure for the outfield is composed of cow's 
dung, earth carried from the hill during the summer or latter part 
of harvest, and sea-weed, when it can be got. These are laid, m 
alternate layers, in small heaps over the lands intended to be 
brought under crop in the spring. When the voar or seed-time 
arrives, these are delved down and well mixed, as required; and 
when a piece of ground is delved and sowed, some carry this ma- 
nure in straw baskets, called " cashies;" others spread it with their 
hands, and one yokes himself or herself into the harrow. The 
ground delved in the course of the day is generally sowed, manur- 
ed, and harrowed in the evening. 

Potatoes. — In some places, especially in those situated near 
fresh-water lochs, the potatoes are liable to be injured, and some- 
times destroved, by mildew ; but in general, they are a good crop, 
and much dependence is placed upon them. About a fourth part 
of the arable lands is cropped with potatoes. There is a great 
variety of potatoes in ihe parish ; but the best, both as regards- 
quality and quantity, is of a light red colour, streaked with whito 



SANDSTING AND AITIISTING.

The method of cleaning the potato crop is rather imperfect. A 
little before or about the time the shoots begin to break the clod, 
the top weeds are turned up with the hand-hoe or spade, which is 
called " shovelling the potatoes;" and having lain for a few days 
to allow the weeds to wither, a double draught of the wooden har- 
row is given to turn up such weeds as may not have been suffi- 
ciently exposed. When the stems are advanced about six inches 
above ground, the hand-hoe is again employed, for choking or 
laying the earth to in drills. This is the last operation till they 
are taken up. The return, in ordinary seasons, of the potato 
crop may be stated at from ten to fifteen, and their price at Is. 6d. 
per barrel. 

Oats. — The oats in general use are the grey-bearded or old 
Scotch flavor. The grain itself is sweet, but, from the very im- 
perfect way of manufacturing it, the meal is never entirely freed 
from the black beard and dust. Within these few years, a num- 
ber of families in the parish have made trial of small quantities 
of Angus-shire early oats, obtained from the glebe, and they ac- 
knowledge that this is superior to the other, both in grain and 
straw. Notwithstanding these advantages, they refuse to use it as 
their general crop, from the idea that it is more liable to be shaken 
by the wind. This I have not found to be the case, though no 
other kind of oats have been sown on the glebe for many years. 

The way in which corn is prepared for meal is this :— every fa- 
mily has a small oblong kiln built in their barn, called a " cinny," 
which will dry about an half barrel of oats at one time. This 
kiln is furnished with ribs of wood. These are covered with oat- 
straw, called " gloy," and the grain laid on the top. . In an open- 
ing about one foot square, in the end of the kiln, a gentle fire is 
kept up, till the grain is sufficiently dried. It is then taken off the 
kdn, put into a straw basket, made for the purpose, called a 
" skeb," and, while it is warm, well rubbed under the feet. This 
operation is intended to separate the beard and dust from the 
gram. It is next winnowed between two doors, or in the open 
air; put into another straw basket called a " budy," and carried to 
the mill and ground. When brought home from the mill, two 
sieves, a coarse and a finer, are made use of, to separate the seeds 
from the meal ; and it is twice sifted over, before it is fit for use. 
1 he coarse seeds taken out with the coarse sieve, the first time 
the meal is sifted, are given to the cows; and the finer seeds taken 
out with the finer sieve, the second time it is sifted, are reserved 



120 



SHETLAND. 



for sowens. There is another kind of meal, called " burstane," 
prepared by drying the grain very hard in a pot. This is usually 
ground on the quern or hand-mill. 

The price of seed-oats is from 9d. to Is. per stone of 17 pounds ; 
and the price of meal is generally from Is. 6d. to 2s. for the same 
weight. The merchants, when taking meal in barter for their 
articles, usually allow Id. per pound. 

Bear or Biff. — Bear or big is generally cultivated in preference 
to barley, being esteemed more hardy, and less liable to be shaken. 
There are two kinds of bear, one having four rows of grain on the 
stalk, and the other having six. This latter kind is much shorter 
in the head than the former. Bear is prepared for meal in the 
same way as oats; but it is allowed to cool, after being taken off 
the kiln, before it is rubbed. Seed-bear is sold from lOd. to Is. 
Od. per stone of 17 pounds; and bear-meal from Is. 3d. to Is, 6d. 
per stone. The manure of the bear-land is always prepared dur- 
ing the previous summer, so that it is allowed to rot for eight or 
ten months, before it is used ; and, instead of being laid on the 
top of the delved ground, it is delved under. 

Wheat. — Wheat is a grain which has very seldom been attempt- 
ed to be raised in the parish. In 1821, a small quantity of spring 
wheat was sowed on the glebe, which strawed most abundantly, 
but was light in the grain. The following spring, another trial 
was made, with seed from the former year's produce ; but still a 
light crop as to grain, though the straw was abundant. More 
sun, less fog, and a longer summer are required, before wheat 
crops can be cultivated with any prospect of success. 

Cabbage, Sc. — Cabbage, turnips, carrots, &amp;c. thrive well in 
the gardens, but have never been cultivated to any extent in 
the fields. Cabbage are used as food for both man and beast, 
and considerable quantities of them are raised. Some families 
plant upwards of 3000. They are all of the late or winter cab- 
bage, and their cultivation is confined entirely to the yards or 
gardens. Turnips of every description seem to agree well with 
the soil and climate; but when a few of them are sowed in the 
fields, they must be taken up when 'the other crops are taken into 
the barn-yard. Carrots, &amp;c. come to great perfection, and are 
particularly well flavoured. The want of enclosures, however, 
prevents the cultivation of these and other crops, which might be 
raised with advantage. 

notation of Crops a thing as a rolalion of crops has 



SANDSTING AND AITHSTING. 



121 



never once been thought of, either by landlord or tenant. The 
want of enclosures, and the small size of farms, are adverse to 
such a practice. 

Obstacles to Improvement. — It must appear, from what has al- 
ready been advanced, that this parish, and the islands in general, 
are very far behind in agriculture. Both soil and climate present 
great obstacles to improvement. None of the lands of the parish 
lie upon limestone, and no lime is used as a manure, either simply 
or united with other substances, The lands are all laid in run- 
rig, whether they are the property of one or more proprietors, and 
this is the cause of much private, as well as open strife among the 
different possessors. While this system is continued, an insur- 
mountable obstacle is raised against every attempt at improvement. 
To obviate this, I have suggested to several of the landlords to 
lay off a certain portion of land to each tenant, in one spot, and 
to build his house on his own ground, and in a situation the most 
convenient. If this system was to be adopted, the tenants would 
soon see the necessity of division dikes between their little farms, 
and, I am convinced, would soon raise them. The lands also would 
be better drained, and rendered capable of a more improved system 
of husbandry. While a spirit of emulation would then be excited, 
small enclosures would spring up, enriched with a regular succes- 
sion of healthy and luxuriant crops. If the laird could be prevailed 
upon to adopt this course, his astonishment at the change that 
would soon be perceptible would be great. 

Among the obstacles to improvement, must not be omitted the 
present ring-fences. These are, nowhere, efficient; and it is only 
during the summer and harvest months that they are kept in to- 
lerable repair. As soon as the corns are put into the yard, every 
" grind" or gate is set open ; the dikes, in many cases, pulled 
down and suffered to continue in that state, till the young corn 
appears several inches above the ground. In the meantime, cows, 
horses, and sheep, are allowed to pasture at freedom, and swine root 
up and destroy what years of the best husbandry could hardly re- 
pair. There is little labour spent in draining ; and the few drains that 
are, being only surface drains, are filled up in winter, and the lands, 
of course, become a complete mire; so that, were it not the great 
quantity of new earth yearly carried from the hill or common, and 
formed into a compost with cow's dung and sea-weed, and laid 
plentifully on the land, no crops could be expected. 

The farms, in most cases, arc very small, not exceeding three 



122 



SHETLAND. 



or four acres, and therefore the tenant cannot be supposed to leave 
much unlaboured to acquire ley strength. The tenant also holds 
his small farm by such a precarious tenure, from one year to an- 
other, that little, if any improvement, can be expected from him. 
And it is no uncommon thing, when a tenant has made all the 
improvement that could be expected from his slender means, that 
an offer of additional rent is made to the landlord, and he the 
tenant must either agree to pay the additional rent or remove, 
without any compensation. Under such a policy on the part 
of the landlord, spirited exertions in improving the lands can 
never be expected from the tenant. It may be observed, that the 
want of leases tends to keep the tenants in a very servile state. 
The landlord's will becomes the tenant's law, and if a disposition 
to resist should manifest itself, it is immediately subdued by a 
threatened warning of removal. Even in the few cases where there 
are missive tacks, the tenantcan hardly be said to sit securely. There 
are so many ways by which the strong can get the better of the 
weak, that the saying, " the weakest are always driven to the wall," 
is verified to a considerable extent here. But perhaps the occupiers 
of small farms are not arrived at that stage of civilization, when it 
might be considered proper, or even safe, to trust them with all 
the immunities a tack would confer. 

In some cases " grassums" are taken, the injurious tendency of 
which has been felt, wherever they are known. They deprive the 
tenant of the earnings of his toil, — they damp his ardour in im- 
provement, and afford him no additional security ; while all that 
can be acquired in this small way, will " bulk little in a holed 
pocket " 

The houses, in general, are mere huts ; and if the landlord puts 
up a dwelling-house once, — tenant after tenant must be content to 
occupy it as he finds it, or to repair or build anew to himself Few, if 
any of the landlords, build any of the office-houses ; and the tenant 
always builds and keeps in repair, such as that repair is, the dikes 
around his farm. The great object of the landlord is to get his rent 
for his land, which, in many cases, it must be confessed, he has con- 
siderable difficulty in obtaining; but, at the same time, he cramps 
not the labour of the tenant with any restrictions, as to management, 
and leaves him at full liberty to employ, as the implements of his 
husbandry, the plough, the spado, or the snout of the swine. 

The climate and situation present formidable barriers to any 
thing like extensive improvement. The former can never be de-

pended on for twenty-four hours together, and the latter is very 
damp, unsheltered, and, in many places, liable to be blasted both by 
mildew and sea-spray ; so that the most promising crops, in one 
hour, may be destroyed for' both man and beast. 

JVoods. — There is a tradition that this country was, at one time, 
covered with wood; and this tradition is supported by the cir- 
cumstance, that pieces of wood are found imbedded very deep 
in the moss, 1 have found some branches of the birch, from 
six to eight feet long, about ten feet under the surface to the 
northward of the glebe. In different parts of the parish, there are 
to be found the creeping willow, the honeysuckle, the mountain- 
ash or rowan-tree, and the hip brier. The crawberry on the hills 
is very common, and in ordinary seasons comes to perfection. 
There are a few plants of the blaeberry which, in some seasons, 
blossom, but seldom carry fruit. Gooseberries and currants red, 
white, and black, in favourable seasons, ripen well in the gardens. 

Coics. — An occupier of three merks of land will keep four milk 
cows, and in some cases six ; and in some very favourable situa- 
tions, from twelve to sixteen. The young cattle pasture on the 
hills or conimon scathold from the end of May till the beginning 
of November. On the hills or common scathold, an unlimited 
privilege of pasture is allowed ; and a tenant who, during the sum- 
mer months, can keep from four to six milk cows, will, during the 
winter, fodder from twelve to fifteen head of cattle, young and old. 
The milk cows pasture on the grass inside of the town in summer 
till twelve o'clock, when they are milked and driven to the hill ; 
and in the evening, are again taken inside of the town, where they 
feed a few hours, are milked, and put into the byre during the night. 
The young cattle, when they are driven to the hill in the end of 
May, are never allowed to enter within the town dikes till about 
the month of November, when they are taken in and set to the 
band for the winter. It is a practice too prevalent, indeed I may say, 
general, to lay on more cattle than can be well supported ; and the 
consequence is, that part of the stock is frequently lost for want 
of food, and part of it is barely able to walk. It is evident that, by 
laying on too much stock, the people are great losers, as they can 
neither bring an adequate price for their cattle, if sold at Whitsun- 
day, owing to the miserable condition in which they are, nor does 
the milk yielded repay even the expense of their half-starved keep- 
ing; the summer being well spent before the cattle have thrown off 
their winter coat, and assumed any thing like a decent appearance.

The cows, when compared with those of a more southerly lati- 
tude, are small ; but, when on good keeping, give much more 
milk than could be expected from their size. Some of those on 
the glebe give about five quarts in the morning, three at mid- 
day, and five in the evening. The general food of the cows in 
winter consists of a small " hallow" or " wap" of straw between 
two, night and morning; and if they are confined to the house by 
bad weather, they get as much at noon. The cows in calf, 
in addition to their stated diet, as above, get a few cabbage 
or potatoes cut down and mixed with a little bear-chaff or 
coarse seeds; and frequently, in room of these, a little meadow 
hav. All the cows are horned, and of every colour; but no at- 
tention whatever is paid to the rearing of a proper breed. Though 
the cold, bleak, and unsheltered pastures, and the want of a suffi- 
ciency of food, stint the animal in its growth and alter its form ; 
yet much good would result from the lairds taking an active in- 
terest in the concerns of their tenants, by ofifering small premiums 
for the best stock in general, or the best bull ; or by not allowing 
any animal to be kept as a breeder, which had not previously been 
approved of. 

The weight of a cow, when fed for slaughter, may be from 1 
to 2 cwts. Cattle bought for slaughter are not considered a good 
bargain, if the beef exceeds ld. or 2d, per lb. A cow in calf, 
at Whitsunday, if she can be recommended as a good one, will 
sell for L.3 Sterling, and sometimes a little more. A farrow cow 
at the same season, Whitsunday, will sell from L.l, 10s. to L.2. 5s. 
Sterling; but at Martinmas they may be purchased cheaper. Al- 
lowing on an average only three milk cows to each family, there 
will be in the parish not fewer than 1122. 

Those who keep four or more cows on their farms, churn once 
every day during summer; but the quantity of butter obtain- 
ed is not in proportion to the frequent churning. The cream is 
never gathered and churned. When the operation of churning 
is advanced to a certain stage, an heated stone is dropped into the 
churn, by which means the labour is shortened, and an addition 
made to the quantity, though not to the quality, of the butter. 
Part of the curd thus becomes incorporated with the butter, and 
presents a spotted white and yellow appearance. By very few, 
indeed, it must be acknowledged, is any attention paid to the dairy. 
This may arise partly from a portion of the rents being made pay- 
able in butter, and partly from want of proper milk-houses, and

t3ue attention to the milk-vessels. So that one of the old country 
acts svoiild require sometimes still to be enforced, which ordains, 
" That no butter be rendered for payment of land rent, or for 
sale, but such as is clean from hairs and claud, and other dirt." 
The lairds, as part of their land rent, and the tenants, for their 
own use, consume the greater part of the butter that is made in 
the parish ; and the little that is sold will bring from 5d. to 6d. 
per pound of sixteen ounces. 

Into the butter-milk, or " bleddick," is poured a quantity of boil- 
ing water, by which means the curd is separated from the serum. 
The former, called " kirn," is supped with sweet milk ; the latter, 
called "bland," is used as drink, and is sometimes kept for several 
months, when it acquires a strong acidity. 

Ponies. — The Shetland poney is now so generally known as to 
require no particular description. It is of every colour, white, 
black, brown, grey, dun, cream, chesnut, and piebald, and of every 
size, from 28 to 44 inches. There are a great many of them kept 
in the parish, but very little work is performed with them. Few 
bring home even their peats with them, preferring the old prac- 
tice of bearing them home on their own backs in a " casie."  
Ponies are sometimes employed in carrying feals from the hill, to 
mix with cow's dung for composts; but are kept principally for storing. 
It is a rare occurrence to see an individual riding to church. In 
good keeping, it is well known that many of the Shetland ponies 
are of high mettle. " When the shelty is in his winter or spring 
garb, it is difficult to suppose that his progenitors were the same 
animals which travellers have described as prancing over the arid 
tracks of Arabia;— the long shaggy hair with which he is clothed 
has more the appearance of a polar dress, or of some arctic livery, 
specially dispensed to the quadruped retainers of the genius of 
Hialtland."f Instead of the sleek skin and handsome appearance 
which he displays with so much spirit in the summer months, in 
winter he is covered with a shaggy coat,— his symmetry-disappears, 
and all his motions are dull and languid. Notwithstanding all the 
privations he undergoes, he frequently lives to a great age. I 
have seen some upwards of thirty years old, and even at that 
age capable of performing a pretty long journey. No attention is 
paid to the breed. On the contrary, if one is remarkable for pro- 
portion or size, as it will fetch the best price, it is the one which

is first sold. The poney is subject to few diseases. The most 
common are gravel and spavin. 

They vary in price from L. J, 10s. to L. 6 Sterling, If proper 
attention was paid to the breed, I am convinced there would be 
found nowhere a finer race of animals. A considerable number 
of them are yearly exported to Scotland and England. Former- 
ly, Orkney men were wont to come over and barter linen for po- 
nies; but none of them have been in the practice of doing so for 
many years. Between Orkney and Shetland there is less commu- 
nication now, than there is between Shetland and any other part 
of Great Britain. 

Sheep. — The number of sheep kept in the parish is very great ; 
but what that number is, it is impossible to say. As every te- 
nant exercises an unlimited privilege of pasturage on the hills or 
scathold, unless the few who drive their sheep into the same 
" cruive" or " pund," no other person can possibly know the num- 
ber of sheep belonging to each individual. 

The native breed of sheep is very small, being in weight about 
20 or 24 lbs. of mutton, and carrying a fleece of from 1 to 1| lbs. of 
wool. They are of the small-tailed race, and it is very rare to .see 
a ewe with horns. They are of various colours, viz. white, black, 
grey, " catmogged," brown or " moorit," black and white, in equal 
proportions, or " Shilah," and piebald. Every neighbourhood has 
a particular pasture or scathold, on which their sheep feed, and 
each person knows his own sheep by their " lug-mark." That is, 
one has a hole in the ear, another a " rift" or slit, another a 
" crook" or piece taken out of the ear, behind or before, &amp;c. The 
same is the case throughout the parish, and no two persons in the 
parish are allowed to " lug-mark" their sheep in one way. Every 
neighbourhood has also a " cruive" or pund, into which they drive 
their sheep, for the purpose of smearing them, taking of the wool, 
marking the lambs, and keeping them tame. When a stray sheep 
is found, the person who finds it takes care of it for a year and a- 
day, and if, after due proclamation at different churches, the 
owner is not discovered, it is sold, one-half of the price going 
to the persons who found it, and the other half to the poor 
of the parish in which it was found. Those whose sheep pas- 
ture promiscuously are called " Scat-brither;" and those who 
•have a few sheep pasturing in any place when they reside at a 
distance from it, or perhaps not in this parish, are called " out- 
scat holders."

The native breed of slieep in several places are beginning to 
be crossed with black and white-faced rams. Where the pasture 
is sound, either of the crosses answers very well, as both mutton 
and wool are improved in quantity ; but, wherever tlie pasture is 
deep and wet, they are invariably found not to be so hardy, or to 
thrive so well as the original breed. Such of the lambs as are 
strong, whether of the native or crossed breed, are allowed to fol- 
low the ewes during the winter ; but those that are not considered 
strong enough to stand the winter out, are taken into the house 
and fed till about Whitsunday, when they are again driven to the 
hill. Some build small houses for the purpose of keeping their 
lambs in during the night, and in which they feed them, night and 
morning, with hay or cabbage, and occasionally with a few coarse 
seeds and cut potatoes ; but the more general practice is to keep 
them around the fire in the dwelling-house. No shelter is pro- 
vided for the sheep to which they might resort when inclement 
weather sets in ; and no provision is made for their support, when 
snow and frost prevent them from obtaining their ordinary scanty 
fare. 

When food is not to be obtained on the hills, instinct seems to 
direct them to another quarter. I have seen them when the tide 
began to ebb, hastening to the sea-shore, feeding upon the sea- 
weed growing on the rock or cast upon the beach, and when it be- 
gan to flow, returning to the hills again. 

An ewe for slaughter will sell for 4s. or 5s. ; a wedder from 6s. to 
8s. ; a ram lamb for Is. 6d. to 2s. ; and a ewe lamb, of the mid- 
dhng size, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. The cross-breed sell considerably 
higher, but their mutton is neither so delicate nor their wool so 
soft. The wool is of various prices, from 6d. to Is. 3d. per lb. of 
sixteen ounces. It is not shorn, as in other places, but torn from 
the sheep's back by an operation called " rooing." For the most 
part, two, and sometimes more persons pull the wool from the 
poor animal at one time. Sometimes, this is done with little 
trouble and as little pain ; but at other times, it may be said to be 
indeed a painful operation.

The rams are generally let to the ewes about the beginning of 
December. 

The principal diseases to which the sheep are liable, are the 
Vinster, the Rot or green-sickness, the Sturdy, the Liver com- 
plaint, the Water or Quarquabus, the Blindness, and the Scab. 

Swine. — Every family keeps one, and many families keep two 
swine, which they feed and kill about Candlemas, for their own 
use. Several also keep herds of swine, which are sent to the hill 
or common pasture during the summer, and are again admitted 
into the farms, as soon as the potatoes are reaped, to dig up and 
to turn down, in short, to commit every species of destruction at 
pleasure. When driven to the hill for the summer, they have no 
other food than such as they can procure for themselves, and con- 
sequently the best parts of the pasture are rooted up and destroy- 
ed. Roots of plants and earth-worms constitute the principal food : 
but occasionally birds' nests alford a savoury morsel ; but still 
more, a young lamb or a weak sheep. The native breed of 
swine is very small, with a long nose very cartilaginous, and 
small ears standing upright ; and when he puts on his winter 
covering, a more ugly animal can hardly be conceived to exist. 
He has a profusion of long stiff bristles, and underneath a close 
coat of coarse wool. Of his bristles and wool a very strong 
and elastic rope is made, which is used for tethering horses and 
cows. Notwithstanding his revolting appearance, when well fed, 
he would disgrace no board. He is very delicate pork. 

A great improvement in the breed, both in appearance and size, 
has lately been introduced by means of swine brought to the 
islands by some of the Greenland ships. A young swine, fifteen 
days old, and of the native breed, costs from Is. to Is. 3d. ; and 
one of the same age, but of the improved breed, from Is. 3d. to Is. 
8d. A full grown swine, that is, one of from one to two years old, 
and of the native breed, when fed, costs 8s. or 10s. ; but some of 
the improved breed have sold as high as from L. 1 to L. 1, 10s. 
The usual selling price of pork, when fresh, is 2d. per pound. 

A young swine is here known by the name of a runny or grice ; 
one fed about the fireside, a patty ; one with young, a silik ; and 
a boar is called a gaat. 

They are liable to a complaint called the gricifer, which de- 
prives them of the use of their hinder legs. They very seldom 
if ever recover of it.

Rent of Lands. — The rents of the lands in the parish are made 
up of so many ditFerent items, that it is almost impossible to ascer- 
tain their exact amount. These consist of cashies, fowls, days- 
works, butter, bear, schoolmaster's salary, teinds, seat-rent ia 
church, scatt, land-rent, and, in some cases, fishing profits. But, 
including outsets, they may be fairly stated at L. 1, 10s. Sterling 
per merk, which will make a total rental of the parish of L.1165, 
10s. Sterling. 

Rate of Wages.~The Rev. Patrick Barclay, in his Statistical 
Account, has stated, that « men servants get from L.15 to L.18 
Scotch," that is, from L.l, 5s. to L.l, 10s. Sterling, " for three, 
fourths of the year." In summer they are employed in the ling- 
fishing, and the boys on beaches. The men get from L.12 to 
L.24 Scotch ; boys from L.6 to L.IO. Women servants get from 
L. 12 to L. 8, sometimes less, when they get liberty to spin and 
knit stockings, for their own behoof and emolument, at leisure 
hours. The yarn is generally spun at night, when they would be 
otherwise idle ; and, when carrying dung, or travelling on the . 
road, they are always knitting, their service to the master is often 
very mconsiderable. Artificers are seldom paid by the day, and are 
always maintained by the employer. A mason has from lOd. to 
Is. 2d. a-day; his servants, 6d. ; wright, lOd.j tailor, shoemaker, 
and boat-builder, are paid by the piece, and generally earn 8d. or 
i The wages usually given to a man for about ten weeks 
on the hng-fishmg is from L.2 to L.2, 10s. with victuals; and for 
a boy to assist m curing fish on a beach, with his victuals, 10s. 
or 12s. Steriing; and without victuals, about L.l. When he 
gets his food, he is bound to do any kind of work required, when 
not employed with the fish. The wages of a man-servant, for 
farm-work, is from 12s. to L.l Steriing for three months; wo- 
men servants generally get 8s. for three months. The usual term 
of service is three months. The servants are in no respect im- 
proved, since my predecessor wrote; neither will there ever be 
good servants, while the present system is pursued. They do 
not consider the obligation as mutual, but regard it as lying 
altogether on the side of the person who employs them. Ind

without food. 

The wages of a man for farm-work, in spring or harvest, is 6d. 
a-day with victuals ; and a woman's wages 4d. 

Very few of the servants take any interest in their masters' ser- 
vice. With the greater part of them, the principal concern seems 
to be, to work as little as possible, and that not always in the best 
manner ; while meal-time and pay-day are well attended to. 

The usual charge for grazing an ox or cow, for about six 
months in summer, is from 6s. to 8s. ; the owner of the animal 
providing a tether. A young cow or ox foddered during the six 
winter months, costs about 5s. ; and a cow in calf, for the same time, 
from 8s. to 10s. Nothing is paid for foddering a farrow cow, her 
milk being considered to pay daily for the fodder she eats. When 
a cow in calf is given out, on the condition that the calf is to be 
reared, the person who receives her keeps her till Michaelmas, 
and then returns her, the calf remaining, which is afterwards con- 
sidered " havers" property ; that is, the calf itself and its store to 
belong in equal portions to the owner of the cow and the person 
who reared the calf ; and when sold, the price to be equally di- 
vided. 

Fisheries.- -The fisheries consist of ling, cod, and herring. 
The ling-fishing is carried on in boats of about 18 feet of keel, 
and manned with six men. This fishing, twenty- five years ago, 
was much more extensive than it is now. At that time, thirty -six 
boats of the above description were engaged in it ; now, there are 
only eight. The boats fish from the island of Papa Stour, as 
being much nearer the " haaf," or fishing ground. And before 
they commence fishing, perhaps eight or ten days, they repair to 
the island, and put in order the huts which are to shelter them, 
when on shore, during the iishing season. P'ishermen are allowed 
by law to build huts for their accommodation, while prosecuting 
the fishing, on any unenclosed or uncultivated land, at a distance 
of not more than 100 yards above high water-mark. These huts 
are very rudely built ; and the wood, pones, or divots, which form 
their roof, must be transported to the island. The usual practice 
is to carry home the roofs of the huts, when the fishing-season is 
over.

SANDSTING AND AITIISTING. 131 

The usual time for commencing the ling-fishing is from the mid- 
dle of May to the beginning of June, and it continues till Lammas. 

When the men leave their homes on Monday morning, they 
carry with them a haddock-line, about 900 fathoms long, baited 
with mussels, which they set on their way to the fishing station, 
that they may procure bait for their long lines. Haddocks are 
always preferred as bait for the ling, when they can be procured. 
But when these are not to be got, they take the young seath, 
called piltocks, which generally abound about the shores in sum- 
mer ; and if these should fail, they bait their hooks with a piece 
of cod, tusk, or ling. The boats leave their stations for the 
haaf about ten o'clock a. m., and reach the fishing-ground about 
SIX o'clock p. M., during which time they will have run from forty- 
five to fifty miles, so that the highest land is only as a speck in the 
horizon, or as the fishermen express it, like awhilly on the water. 
Every boat is furnished with a fleet of tows or lines, which may be 
thus described, one tow,bught, orline, fifty fathoms; sixteen tows, 
bughts, or line, one packie ; six packies one fleet. A fleet of 
tows, then, is the number of lines which a boat carries. Every 
fleet of tows has four buoy ropes, of from 90 to 100 fathoms each, 
to which are attached stones of about 16 lbs. weight, called kap- 
pie or bolta stanes, to sink the lines, and keep them steady at the 
bottom. But besides these, every line has a sinking stone to it- 
self, about 2 lbs. weight, called a bighter. The four buoy-ropes 
are provided with sheep skin buoys. The hooks are made fast to 
a piece of line about four feet long, called a toum, and these are 
made fast to the tows, at a distance from each other of five fa- 
thoms ; so that on a fleet of tows, there are 960 hooks. The 
fishermen having arrived at the spot where they intend to set their 
lines, one man cuts the bait to the proper size, which is called 
sneezing the bait ; and two men bait alternate hooks, while the 
others row the boat in the direction the lines are intended to be 
laid. When the last buoy is put over the side of the boat, the 
men remain by it about three or four hours, if the weather be fa- 
vourable, before they begin to haul in their lines. If the weather 
threatens, they commence immediately to haul in, and always do 
so by beginning at the last buoy. One man hauls the lines, 
another strikes the fish as they come to the surface, with a clip f 
or huggie staff, and takes into the boat, cavilsj the fish, and

snoods the hooks, and a third man guts and takes off the heads. 
The other three andow or shoughf the boat. 

When the men come ashore in the afternoon of the followingday, 
with eight score of Hng, they consider they have made a good liaul. 
This would average 16 cwt., for which they are allowed 6s. per 
cwt. They seldom make more than two trips to the haaf in 
the week; but when there is an appearance of fine weather, 
after hauling their lines, they bait their hooks, and set a second 
time. When the fish are landed, the fishermen have no more 
concern with them. They are split, salted, and dried at their 
landlord's expense. As soon as the boat arrives at the beach, one 
man goes to the lodge or hut, kindles a fire, and acts as cook ; 
while the others land the fish, and see them weighed. 

There is only one proprietor in the parish, whose lands are let 
on a fishing tenure. His tenants man seven boats, and caught, 
last year, about eight tons of dried ling, which sold for L.18 Ster- 
ling per ton. The boat and materials are divided into six shares, 
one of which the landlord, for the most part, holds, putting in a 
feed man, to whom he gives two lispunds of meal, and L.2 Ster- 
ling. The provisions which each fisherman takes with him for 
the season, are two lispunds of meal, two ankers of potatoes, a 
pork-ham, or a smoke-dried sheep, and an half lispund of dried 
bear. Of this, when knocked in a stone trough, which is carried 
to the fishing station with their other necessaries, they make broth. 
They have vory little spirits either at sea or ashore, being preclud- 
ed from the use of that article by the high duty to which it is liable. 
Their usual drink is water, unless when they carry with them from 
their houses on Monday morning, a small cask or jar with bland. 

Johnsmas 24th Jane, O. S. is regarded by the fishermen as an 
holiday. Again, before striking their tents at Lammas, and bidding 
adieu to the busy, bustling, perilous occupations of the summer, the 
fishermen who have been accustomed to associate together during 
the season, meet and take a parting cup, when the usual toast on 
the occasion is, " Lord  open the mouth of the grey fish, and 
hand thy hand about the corn." This meeting is known by the 
name of the fishermen's foy. After this, having nothing more to 
detain them, their huts are unroofed, bag and baggage are bundled 
into the boat, and wafted on the wings of a favourable breeze, 
they hasten to enjoy the smiles of their wives, and the innocent

prattle of their bairns, and in them forget for a time the toils and 
privations of a fisherman's calling. 

Cod-fishing. — The cod-fishing is prosecuted in sloops of from 
18 to 40 tons burden, of which there are eight in the parish, mak- 
ing a tonnage of 224 tons. They carry from nine to twelve men 
each, who hire the sloop for the fishing season, which begins at 
Whitsunday and ends at Lammas. The owner of the sloop re- 
ceives as hire, the half of all the fish caught, and oil made from 
their livers, and is bound to put and keep the sloop in a sea-wor- 
thy state. He also cures the fish, and the men pay for the cur- 
ing of their half, at the rate of 2s. Sterling per cwt., which is de- 
ducted when accounts are settled at the end of the season. It is 
always understood that the owner of the sloop is to have the pre- 
ference, on equal terms, to the purchase of the men's share offish 
find oil. Sometimes, a few men purchase a small sloop in partner- 
ship, and fish with her, taking in the additional men required, 
either as sharesmen, or giving them a fee, and sometimes giving 
them half share and half fee. All that is required to the prose- 
cution of the cod-fishing in a sloop, are two lines, about 100 fa- 
thoms, a lead of 3 or 4 lbs., with a scob, that is, an iron rod 
bent, two feet and a half long, passing through the upper end of 
the lead, to each end of which rod is affixed a short toam and 
hook, baited with the large muscle or yoag. The weekly supply 
of bait is from 1600 to 2200. The usual price paid to the per- 
sons who dredge the bait is from 4d. to 6d. per 100, the expense 
of which is divided between the owner and men. The quantity 
of cod caught in a season varies from 5 to 18 tons, and the price 
paid in the country, for sometime, may be said to have been sta- 
tionary at L.IO per ton. 

The men, for provisions, have 8 lbs. of oatmeal baked into 
cakes weekly, and two-thirds of a barrel of potatoes, and a supply 
of smoked pork or mutton for the season, and as much fresh fish 
as they choose to make ready. The fish heads and small fish are 
carried home for the weekly supply of their families. 

The men are bound to bend the rigging and sails, and ballast 
the sloop before going to sea; and when the fishing is over, unrig 
and dry ropes and sails, heave the ballast, clean the vessel, and 
draw up and secure her for the winter. The fish livers are now 
melted into oil, and divided between owner and men.

and curing of herrings. Bounties were held out as a stimulus to 
engage in this trade ; but while, on the one hand, it was patroniz- 
ed and apparently encouraged, the restrictions laid on the outfit 
of the vessels to be employed in it, not only cramped the energies 
of the fisherman, but even deterred him from prosecuting a fish- 
ing which, he plainly foresaw, would involve him in difficulty and 
debt. The consequence has been, that never, till very lately, has 
any attempt been made unless in the dead water in the voes, to 
set an herring net. Mr James Garrick in Keawick, was the first 
in this parish who set a spirited example in . the herring-fishing. 
He purchased a few second-hand boats from Wick, each of which 
carried about twenty nets, and with these was very successful. The 
herrings caught are of an inferior quality, being mostly spent, and 
the season being too far advanced before the fishing commences. 
The cod-fishing is carried on till Lammas, and the herring-fish- 
ing does not begin till after the middle of August. Last year, 
upwards of 700 barrels of herrings were caught. The general price 
given for herrings when boat and nets belong to the fishermen is 
6s. 6d. per cran. But when boat and nets are provided and kept in 
repair, for these the owner retains the half, and pays the fishermen 
2s. 6d. per cran for their half. In this case, the fishermen incur 
no expense and no risk. This fishing continues about six weeks, 
and during that time, some of the boats have caught 180 crans. 

Manufactures. — Formerly, a great quantity of kelp was manu- 
factured in tlie parish, perhaps not less than 130 tons. But since 
barilla was introduced, kelp has declined so much in value, that 
the price obtained cannot now pay for the making of it. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town nearer than Lerwick, which is distant 
about sixteen miles, with two arms of the sea intervening. No 
post-office ; and when a letter is to be sent or received, a person 
must be sent expressly for the purpose to Lerwick, the post-town, 
to whom is paid from Is. 6d. to 2s. Sterling, according to the state 
of the weather. There is nothing resembling a road in the parish, 
unless a piece which I made some years ago, through the glebe, and 
carried on about half a mile towards the kirk. But there is a de- 
cided disinclination to walk on the road, because it wears the rive- 
lins too fast, and because a road would imply a restriction to a 
particular path ; whereas the Shetlander's delight is to range un- 
controlled, and " to wander as free as the wind on his mountains.'' 
The fences are very inefficient, and being built, for the most part,

of feals, and intended to last for a part of the year only, they may 
be mentioned as one of the obstacles to improvement. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very inconveniently 
situated, as before observed ; and a considerable proportion of the 
population is distant from it about seven miles of marshy road, 
and many of them impeded by arms of the sea. The kirk is seat- 
ed for 437 persons ; and no free sittings allowed. 

The manse was built in 1817; a very insufficient and inconve- 
nient house, — so much so, that when the presbytery and heritors 
met to have it declared free, an heavy fall of rain having taken 
place during the previous night, stepping-stones were laid along 
the passages and lobby, that they might not wet their feet. Two 
years after, it received a new roof. The ends of the joists have 
twice been rotted out of the walls, and two floorings laid, since 
that time. The manse was finished with the very worst descrip- 
tion of planted fir from the north of Scotland. The office-houses 
have stood condemned, by the report of tradesmen, for a number 
of years. 

The glebe is nine merks, and would rent at about L. 12 Ster- 
Img. It IS not good land; but its hill privileges are extensive and 
good. The stipend payable from the lands in the parish is 
L.115, 9s. 6d., and from Government L.42, 17s. 2d. Sterling, in- 
cluding L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There are two Independent meeting-houses ; to one of which 
no preacher is appointed, and the other has not been opened for 
some years,— the members being so very few, they meet in the 
preacher's dwelling-house. This individual has the small sum of 
L. 5 per annum allowed him by the Congregational Union, and 
acts as factor to one of the principal proprietors. In the other, 
worship is sometimes conducted by a regular preacher; but for 
the most part, one or more of the members « divine the word," 
as they feel disposed. The numbers who are joined with the In- 
dependents, may be stated about 40. 

There is one Methodist meeting-house, in which sermon is ap- 
pointed to be once a month, but is not regularly given. The mem - 
bers in communion with the Methodists are between 50 and 60. 
Both Independents and Methodists have not manifested the great- 
est desire to promote the religious instruction of the people of Sand- 
sting, because, instead of building their meeting-houses in the

most destitute quarters of the parish, they have placed them with- 
in a mile from the Established kirk. 

Divine service at the Established kirk is generally well attend- 
ed ; and the average number of communicants may be stated at 
500. Neither Independents nor Methodists are increasing in 
numbers; they are rather declining. Their meetings are pretty 
well attended in the evenings, or when there happens to be no 
sermon at the parish kirk. 

Education. — There are nine schools in the parish, viz. one paro- 
chial, one Assembly, two from the Society in Scotland for Propagat- 
ing Christian Knowledge, and five supported by individual sub- 
scription. The parochial school was built in 1803, and cost 
L.105 Sterling. The accommodations provided are barely what 
are appointed by law, in number ; but, in quality, would not be 
considered by any unconcerned person to approach near to it. 
The school and school-house have thatched roofs, which, by some 
agreement entered into between the teacher and heritors, the for- 
mer is bound or has agreed to uphold. For this he is allowed 
some fractional part of a penny. About one rood of barren mossy 
ground was set off for a garden, which was valued to the proprie- 
tor from whose lands it was taken, at L.6 Sterling, including peat 
groimd. All that it is capable of producing, are a few dwarf cab- 
bages, or a few sheaves of gray-bearded oats. The accommoda- 
tions for a number of years have been in a state of great disrepair; 
but the teacher is to blame, in not having applied to the Quarter 
Sessions to enforce such repairs as competent workmen should de- 
clare necessary. The schoolmaster has a salary of L.26 Sterling 
per annum. Branches of instruction taught are, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and book-keeping. Stated fees for reading, Is.; read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, Is. 6d. ; and book-keeping, 5s. All 
the. fees received would hardly amount to L.l, 10s. per annum. 

The five schools supported by individual subscription are at 
Sand, Aith, Clousta, Culswick, and West Burrafirth. The three 
former are taught by men who, besides common reading, can in- 
struct their scholars in writing and the first rules of arithmetic. The 
two latter are taught by women who profess to teach reading only. 
At these five places schools, on a permanent footing, are much 
needed ; and a small salary, if certain, would secure the services 
of teachers at these stations, qualified for all the duties which would 
be required of them. At present, they are supported by the fa- 
milies in the respective quarters ; but as soon as the teachers can 



SANDSTING AND AITHSTING. 



137 



turn their labour to better account, the schools are thrown vacant, 
and, before other teachers can be provided, the children have lost 
a great part of what they had learned. I may here be allowed to 
observe, that a school situated in any particular district in the pa- 
rish can benefit only that particular district in which it is placed. 
The parish is very extended, and the population is placed, for the 
most part, around the outskirts of it. For this reason it is that 
the benefits of a school are confined to those alone who reside in 
the immediate neighbourhood of it. The people in general ma- 
nifest an anxiety to have their children educated ; and yet, when 
they have the means in their power, do not improve them to the 
extent which they might. There are no children arrived at an 
age capable of being instructed, who cannot read. 

Charitable Institutions. — A fund was established in 1810, called 
" The Shetland Fisherman's Fund," which had foritsobject the re- 
lief of old and decayed fishermen, and the widows of fishermen. Its 
supporters at first were themore wealthy in the country, and an year- 
ly payment of 2s., in addition to 2s. paid by every fisherman on his 
being enrolled a member. Aged fishermen have been receiving 
from 5s, to 7s., and widows I4s. yearly. It is managed by twelve 
general directors, one representing each parish, and by parochial 
committees. 

Poor and Parochial Funds — The relief afforded to the poor 
arises altogether from church-door collections, the amount of which 
may be stated at L.IO Sterling. Out of this, the average number 
of poor persons who receive aid is about 25, and the extent of aid 
afforded to them varies from 3s. to 12s. yearly. Housewives, who 
are active and industrious, receive occasionally a small sum as a 
reward for their activity and industry. The small sum allowed to 
the stated poor would be altogether inadequate for their support 
if the people did not, in addition to the Sabbath offerings, contri- 
bute cheerfully in another way. The kirk-session divides the parish 
into as many sections as there are poor persons. In each of these, 
a poor person is stationed, who generally remains in each family 
one day for every merk of land which they rent, and receive victuals 
and lodging ; while the small pittance received from the session is 
laid out in the purchase of clothes. 

There are more applications for admission to the poor's roll 
than can be sustained, and the receiving of parochial aid is consi- 
dered no degradation. 

Fairs. — That the people may obtain a more ready sale for their

extra stock of cows and horses, I have sometimes advertised and 
superintended a sale at Whitsunday and Martinmas, which is the 
only resemblance to a fair ever held. At both these seasons, a 
number of persons, from the neighbouring parishes, attend, espe- 
cially from the parish of Tingwall. 

Ale-houses. — There are two ale-houses, — one in Sandsting, and 
the other in Aithsting ; but no bad effects are apparent from them. 
There is no propensity in the people, generally, to indulge to ex- 
cess in spirituous liquors. 

Fuel. — Peats are the only fuel used in the parish ; and they are 
abundant. In digging for peats, there is abundant evidence that 
mountain-ash or rowan-tree, birch, hazel, and willow or saugh, 
have, at one time, flourished over a great portion of the country. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Neither rye-grass nor clover are cultivated, nor can be raised with 
any degree of success, till dikes are built, capable of defending from 
the encroachments of man and beast. Both these plants spring up 
naturally in many places,— the former called acre-a-hunh, and the 
latter smorra. There is a considerable quantity of bog-meadow 
ground, the grass of which is cut yearly about Lammas, and dried 
for hay. In general, it is much wasted before it is stacked ; from 
the idea, that if the juices are not, in some measure, washed out 
before it is put together for the winter, it will take heat and rot. 
The scythe in use does not exceed fifteen inches, and some are 
not more than twelve inches in length. It has a straight haft, 
with one handle, and the mower stands nearly upright. The 
upper part of the haft rests on the bend of the arm ; the left 
hand holds the handle, and the right hand grasps the haft. Some 
mowers wield the little instrument very dexterously, and cut down 
more grass than could be imagined, with such a diminutive tool. 

The sickle is of very small dimensions. I have seen the reaper 
make from thirty-five to forty cuts with it, before the hand was fil- 
led with corn. Both scythe and sickle are made in the parish. 

Cottages. — The cottages are of rather a rude description ; and 
in wet weather, somewhat difficult of access, if there be any de- 
sire to keep the feet dry and clean. They are usually built of 
stone with dry mortar, and over the couples and rafters is laid a 
covering of pones or divots, and sometimes of flaws. Over these 
is laid a covering of straw, which is secured by ropes of the same 
material, or of heather, called " simmins." The dunghill occu-

pies a place as near the door as possible, that it may be enriched 
with the general soiling. And frequently before the door of the 
dwelling-house can be reached, a passage must be made through 
the byre. For the most part, the furniture is so arranged as to 
form a but and a ben ; but chimneys are little known. Instead 
of these, some houses have from two to six holes in the roof to 
admit light and allow the escape of smoke. The better to pro- 
mote this latter, a piece of feal or divot, or two pieces of board 
joined at right angles, called a skyle, is placed on the weather 
side of the hole ; and instead of mounting on the roof every time 
the wind shifts, some have a pole reaching down inside, by which 
this operation is performed. The order for doing this is " skyle 
the liim." 

When an opening is left for a window, it is sometimes filled up 
with a bladder, or untanned lambskin freed from the wool, stretched 
on a frame. In the but or kitchen end of the house, in addition 
to the family, there are usually two dogs, as many cats, a patty 
swine, a calf, and some half dozen of caddy lambs.  

Value of Land, c— The Rev. Patrick Barclay, in his account 
of the parish, remarks, that " the superiors formerly had many 
ways of procuring property in Shetland. Patrick, Earl of Ork- 
ney, in a disposition of the lands of Sand to Jerom Umphray, 
narrates, that he had evicted seven merks of that land from Powl 
Nicholson in Cullswick for stealing a swine, and that he had 

evicted SIX merks from in Cullswick for stealing bolts 

from his Lordship's trood,— probably some piece of wreck°which 
had been drawn into Cullswick. In that same disposition, the 
Earl grants receipt for the money from Jerom Umphray, at the 
rate of L. 17, I6s. Scotch," L. 1, 9s. 8d. Sterling, "per merk 
land, being full land's price at the time." The lands in Sand 
now rent at as much yearly per merk as the sum above specified 
to have been their purchase-price in Ib'OO. 

About 1700, an island, with fifteen scores of sheep, was pur- 
chased for the sum of L. 30 Sterling, the yearly rent of which is 
now about L. 60 Sterling. In 1633, an ox for slaughter cost 
L. 1 ; a fat sheep from 2s. to 2s. 6d. In 1738, a lispund, or ' 
6 lbs. of meal, cost Is. 8d. ; a cow in calf, 17s. 6d. ; fee of pre- 
centor and session-clerk, 10s.; officer, 5s.; presbytery-officer, 
Is. 3d. 1746, dues of proclamation, 6d. ; making a grave.

a hen, 2d.; acock, 1-d. Most of these articles nowco'st double 
of what is stated above. 

Weights and Measures. — The instrument in general use for 
weighing is called a " bysmer :" It weighs from one to twenty- 
four merks. One and one-fourth or half-pound make a merk, and 
twenty-four merks make one lispund. The lispund weight varies 
in different parishes, and even in different parts of the same pa- 
rish, from 32 to 40 lbs. Dr Barry, in his History of Orkney, has 
given a particular description of the " bysmar," which I shall here 
transcribe. " The bysmer is a lever or beam of wood, about three 
feet long ; and from one end to near the middle, it is a cylinder of 
about three inches diameter, thence it gently tapers to the other 
end, which ij not above one inch in diameter. From the middle, all 
along this smallest end, it is marked with small iron pins, at un- 
equal distances, which serve to point out the weight, from one 
merk to twenty-four, or a lispund. The body to be weighed is 
hung by a hook in the small end of the instrument, which is then 
suspended by a cord around it, held in the hand of the weigher, 
who shifts it towards the one end or the other, till the article he 
is weighing equiponderates with the large end, which serves it as 
a counterpoise ; and when they are in equilibrio, the pin nearest 
the cord points out in the marks the weight of the subject weighed." 
Grain and meal manufactured in the parish are weighed, and 
bought and sold by " bysmer" weight." 

Measures. — These are a " can," by which oil is measured, and 
which contains one gallon ; the anker, or third part of a barrel, 
by which potatoes are measured ; and the ell, by which Shetland 
" claith" is measured. 

• This cord is tied round llic ends of a round piece of wood, about four inches 
long, and held in the hand, and is called " the snarl." 



SANDSTING AND AITHSTING. HI. 

Superstitions. — A considerable number of the people believe 
in and practise many superstitious rites. The fishermen, when 
about to proceed to the fishing, think they would have bad 
luck, if they were to row the boat " withershins" about. They 
always consider it necessary to turn her with the sun. Neither do 
they give the same name to most of the things in the boat, and to 
several on shore, by which they are usually known. But supersti- 
tious observances .are not confined to the men only, their wives 
also share in them, and even carry them to a greater extent. 
These are practised chiefly, in attempting to cure diseases in man 
and beast, or in taking away the " profits" of their neighbour's 
cows ; that is, in appropriating, by certain charms, to their own 
dairy, the milk and butter which should have replenished that of 
their neighbour. I shall subjoin a few specimens. 

• Wreiiing Thread — When a person has received a sprain, it is customary to apply- 
to an individual practised in casting the " wresting thread." This is a thread spun 
from black wool, on which are cast nine knots, and tied round a sprained leg or arm. 
During the time the operator is putting the thread round the nfFected limb, he saysj 
but in such a tone of voice as not to be heard by the bystanders, nor even by the ]er. 
son operated upon, 

" The Lord rade. 
And the foal slade ; 
He lighted, 
And he righted. 
Set joint to joint, 
Bono to bone. 
And sinew to sinew. 
Heal in the Holy Ghost's name" 
ningworm.—'The person afflicted with ringworm takes a little ashes between the 
forefinger and thumb, three successive mornings, and before having taken any food 
and holding the ashes to the part affected, says, 
" Ringworm  ringworm red  
Never mayest thou either spread or speed ; 
But aye grow less and less, 
And die away among the ase," fashes, 
at the same lime, throwing the little ashes held between the forefinger and thumb 
into the fire. 

Burn — To cure a burn, the following words are used : 

" Here come I to cure a burnt sore ; 

If the dead knew what the living endure, 

The burnt sore would burn no more." 
The operator, after having repeated the above, blows his breath three times upon the 
burnt place. The above is recorded to have been communicated to a daughter who 
had been burned by the spirit of her deceased mother. 

Fey Folk — It is a practice with some to burn the straw on which a corpse has 
lain, and to examme very narrowly the ashes, from a belief that the print of the in- 
dividual s foot, who IS next to be carried to the grave, will be discovered. The straw 
IS set on hre, when the botly is lifted and the funeral company are leaving the house 
... W-iliol.—A notion is prevalent in the p.irish, that when a cow is suddenly takcii 
111, she IS elf. shot; that is, that a kind of spirits called ' trows," din'erent in their 
nature from fairies, have discharged a stone arrow at her, and wounded her with it 
1 hough no wound can bo seen externally, there arc different per.sons, both males and 
temales, who pretend to feel it in the flesh, and to cure it by repeating certain words 
over the cow. They also fold a sewing needle in a leaf taken from a particular part 
ot a psalm book, and secure it in the hair of the cow, which is considered, not only 



142' 



SHETLAND. 



as an iiifiillible cure, but wliicli also serves as a charm against future attacks. This is 
nearly allied to a practice which was at one time very prevalent, and of which some 
traces may perhaps still exist, in what would he considered a more civilised part of 
the world, of wearing a small piece of the branch of the roan-tree, wrapped around 
with red thread, and sewed into some part of the garments, to guard against the ef- 
fects of an " evil eye," or witchcraft, 

" Roan-tree and red thread 

Will drive the witches a' wud." 
When a cow has calved, it is the practice with some, as soon after as possible, to set a 
cat on her neck and draw it by the tail to the hinder part of the cow ; and then to 
set it on the middle of the cow's back, and draw it down the one side and pull it up 
the other, tail foremost, that the cow may be preserved while in a weak state, from 
being carried away by the " trows." This is enclosing the cow, as it were, in a ma- 
gic circle. 

As the trows are said to have a particular relish for what is good, both in meat and 
drink ; so when a cow or sheep happens to turn sick or die, it is firmly believed that 
they have been shot by an elfin-arrow, and that the real animal has been taken away 
and something of a trowie breed substituted in its place. And some who have been 
admitted into the interior of a Irow's dwelling, assert that they have beheld their own 
cow led in to be slaughtered, while, at the same time, their friends on the surface of 
the earth, saw her fall by an unseen hand or tumble over a preci]ice. Sometimes, 
also, the trows require a nur.ie of their children, for it would appear, they too have 
a'tirae to be born and a time to die, and therefore females newly confined must needs 
be watched very narrowly, lest they be carried off to perform the office of wet-nurse 
to some trowling of gentle blood, who has either lost its mother, or whose station 
among her own race, exempts her from the drudgery of nursing her own offspring. 

There is one place in the parish, called" Trolhouland,"a name which indicates the su- 
perstitious notions with which it is associated : it signifies " the high land of the trows." 
The internal recesses of knolls are considered the favourite residences of the trows, 
and they are seldom passed without fear and dread by the inhabitants of the upper 
world. And when, after nightfall, there may be a necessity for passing that way, a 
live coal is carried to ward off their attacks. For many centuries, the same supersti- 
tious belief has prevailed in Norway, that certain places were the favoured haunts of 
malevolent genii. There is their " Trolhetta ;" and in Iceland, " Troladyngiar," 
and " Trollakyrkia." 

Taking away and recovering Milk and Butter prqfiis — That a person may take 
away and procure for herself the summer profits of her neighbour's cows, it is the 
practice to go clandestinely and pluck an handful of grass from the roof of the byre, 
and give it to her own cows, thereby supposing that the milk and butter which should 
have been her neighbour's, will by this means become hers. And, in order to regain 
the profits which are supposed to have been taken away, it is usual to milk in private 
a cow belonging to the person who is suspected of having taken them, and thereby to 
get them back. 

Jiicogle There is also a " trow" called a " Neagle," somewhat akm to the wa- 
ter-kelpie of other lands, who makes his appearance about mills, particularly when 
grinding, in the shape of a beautiful poney. That he may attract the attention of 
the person who acts the part of the miller, he seizes and holds fast the wheel of the 
mill ; and, as is natural, the miller goes out to examine into the cause of the stop- 
page'; when, to his astonishment, a beautiful poney saddled and bridled, is standing, 
and ready to be mounted ; who but an old miller could let slip such a fair opportunity 
for a ride But if he should neglect warnings, and unguardedly put his foot in 
the stirrup, his fate is sealed. Neither bit or bridle avail him any thing. Off goes 
the poney, bog or bank arrest not his course, till in the deep sea he throws his rider 
and himself evanishes in a flash of flame. But some millers are proof against the 
temptation, having been taught caution by the fate of others; and instead of taking 
a ride, salute his Neogleship with a fiery brand through the lightning-tree hole, 
which makes him immediately scamper aw.iy. , , , 

Such are some of the prevailing superstitious notions, which have no doubt been 
derived from the early Scandinavian settlers, and which, there is as little doubt, were 
fostered and made gain of, till the time of the Reformation, by the lower orders of 
the Roman Catholic clergy. And, if they should still retain a hold, to a certain ex- 
tent in the minds of some of the more ignorant, we need not be much surprised. 
But that those who have received a more liberal education, and consequently should 
be better able to appreciate the truths of Christianity, should lend their influence to 
foster such notions, would hardly be credited in the nineteenth century, if facts did

Even so late as the beginning of the last century, visitors were frightened to ap- 
proach the shores of Shetland, for fear of being brought under the influence of the 
spells of witches and warlocks : And by the old country acts, the ranselmen were en- 
joined to seek out and bring to condign punishment, all persons who made use of 
any manner of witchcraft,"charras, or any other abominable or devilish superstitions. 
The signs by which persons might be discovered were, their being devilish, fearful 
and abominable cursers ; takers away of their neighbour's profits ; charmers and 
healers of some, and casters of sickness upon others ; and who led damnable and 
abominable lives, contrary to God's commandments. As long as the islands were 
subjected to the Pope, in matters of faith, crosses, and benedictions, and amulets and 
prayers and pilgrimages were sufficient to prevent or to cure all the effects of the black 
arts. And even after the Reformation had been introduced, it was found no easy 
matter to shake the general belief in the efficacy of many of the Popish ceremonies; 
and, hence, many were ready to supply the place of the Catholic priests, — to pretend 
to cure diseases, — to " tell away pains," — to counteract the effects of an evil eye or 
an evil tongue, — and to promise all manner of success in worldly affiiirs.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47134">SHETLAND</name>.</head>  
<p>


The Shetland Islands are 90 in number, and extend from 
north to south 70 miles, and from east to west 54 miles. Of 
these, 25 are inhabited, the rest are occupied in pasture, some of 
them bemg only islets or holms a few square yards in extent. 
Mamland is the largest, about 55 miles long and 25 broad; 
on Its eastern side, lies Lerwick, a town containing 3000 in- 
habitants, and the only one in the country. Sumburgh Head, 
rendered classical by Sir Walter Scott's « Pirate," is the ex- 
treme south point of Shetland, and lies in latitude 59' 51" north 
and r 16" west from Greenwich. 

The general appearance of the coast is precipitous and pictures- 
que, constantly diversified by bold promontories, deep bays, and 
small creeks, and the rocks are broken into the most ruo-aed and 
fantastic forms by the action of the weather and the surge The 
scenery ,s remarkably varied, chiefly in consequence of the different 
species of mountain rock of which the islands are composed, want- 
ing, however, in one element of sublimity, great altitude, for al- 
• though hilly, the country cannot be termed mountainous. Roo- 
ness h.ll IS the highest land, 1476 feet in height. Of the mural 
precipices- the highest is that of Foola, 1200 feet above the sea 
level. In general, they are under 500 feet. The predominatino- 
feature of the interior is undulating, bleak, moorland. Many of 
he vales and much of the land skirting the bays, have rather a 
fertile and romantic appearance, but the absence of wood, and the 
paucity of sunshine, are deficiencies which enthusiastic tourists will 

QGprGCcltG. 

Climate, cS-c.—The climate is moist and variable, rarely present- 
ing great extremes of temperature, and is, on the whole, mild, and 
tonatives salubrious. The predominant winds are south-west, from 
wtiich quarter commonly those heavy gales arise, that are in autu.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



SO ruinous in certain seasons to the crops. North-east winds are 
next in frequency, and they occur especially in spring. The sea- 
sons run very much in cycles : eight or ten may in succession be 
warm, steady, and favourable, while three or four, as has been 
seen lately, are cold and stormy. An accurate meteorological 
journal in my possession, kept during the years 1750-51-52, 
and 63, by the late Mr Archibald, minister of Unst, shows 
that the weather then was of the same character that it is now. 
The aurora-borealis is common, but seldom more brilliant than 
in more southern regions, and is, for the most part, the pre- 
cursor or concomitant of south winds. The hissing or rustling 
sound, said to accompany this meteor, is here generally believed 
to exist. Thunder and lightning are unfrequent, and are usually 
followed by more unfiivourable weather. Although in this country 
much depends on foreseeing atmospherical changes, compara- 
tively little attention is paid to prognostics, and the judgment 
of very few of the fishermen is to be relied on ; the indivi- 
duals that seem to have the greatest facility at guessing are the 
fish-curers. The arch of the sky is generally low and hazy. When 
high, and the clouds form cumuli, west and south winds are, as 
I have observed, present, or near at hand. When low and strati- 
fied, east especially, and north. 

Whilst the climate is unsettled and sometimes stormy, the coast 
affords a continued succession of noble harbours, where, by the aid 
of the excellent Admiralty Chart lately published, the mariner may 
find a secure asylum. A lighthouse has been erected on the 
southern extremity of the country; but two or three additional 
ones are desirable. Wrecks are now comparatively rare. When 
they occur, the propensity to plunder, common to the inhabitants of 
most maritime districts, is apt to show itself. It is almost ho}e- 
less to convince rude minds, that what is at the mercy of the ocean 
is to be held sacred as private property ; and the very inadequate 
recompense, which, in too many instances, has been allowed for ex- 
treme toil and danger in saving valuable property, strengthens the 
practice of endeavouring to remunerate themselves. In the case of 
no owner being found, it would seem to be equitable, as consistent to 
ancient usage, and it would discourage falsehood and speculation, 
were the Crown, after the custom's duties had been paid, to waive the 
claim to its share in favour of the salvers ; a reference to the records 
of the Exchequer would show how trifling would be the sacrifice. 
Under the existing state of things, every bit of drift-timber that 
can be discovered is taken possession of by officials, and the fisher-

men are often placed in the alternative of either abstaining from 
salvinof or of embezzlinsr it. 

Diseases. — The most common diseases are catarrh, rheumatism, 
and dyspepsia. Continued fever also frequently occurs ; but acute 
inflammations and cutaneous diseases are not so common as they 
were formerly, perhaps owing to a considerable change in the diet of 
the people. Fewer individuals die in infancy than in most other 
countries, possibly from the general prevalence of crusta lactea, 
which evidently acts as a natural and beneficial counter-irritant 
against visceral congestion, but which, when injudiciously interfer- 
ed with by repellants, often produces fatal internal disease. In- 
stances of great longevity are rare. The women usually live to a 
greater age, and preserve their feculties better, than the men, it 
may be from having been less exposed to excessive and desultory 
labour. It is remarkable that no authentic instance of Asiatic cho- 
lera has occurred. A rigorous quarantine was maintained dur- 
ing the prevalence of the pestilence in Scotland ; but whether this 
measure contributed to save the islands from its visitation, is a 
question that resolves itself into the more general one of the con- 
tagious nature of the disease,— a point on which able medical au- 
thorities are at issue. 

Geology — The rocks are mostly all of what has been called 
the primitive formation.— Granite, gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate, 
hmestone, serpentine, and diallage rock ; and towards the south 
end of the country, secondary sandstone, &amp;c. Serpentine forms 
considerable hills in Unst, the most northerly island of the clus- 
ter, and m Fetlar adjacent to it ; and in this rock are found imbed- 
ded masses and veins of chrome ore, some thousand tons of which 
have been quarried and sold. The first quarry of this valuable 
mmeral was found by Mr Edmondston of Buness, on his private 
property, and he introduced it to the British market. It is ex- 
ported in its crude state, or partially pulverized and levio-ated. 
It IS used as a pigment, dye, and alloy, and might perhaps be use- 
ful as a medicine. Limestone is found in different situations, and 
burnt m rude kilns with peat fuel ; it is chiefly used as mortar, lit- 
tle bemg employed m agriculture, though its general introduction 
would be an important economical improvement. When applied 
Ml the state of carbonate, it will act on certain condidons of soil, 
often to be met with here, more beneficially than when it is caus- 
tic, not only by neutralizing acids, but by supplying carbon. Sand- 
stone-slate abounds, and is extensively in demand for roofing; it is

GENERAL OBSEUVATIONS ON THE 



heavy, but on the whole answers well. No coal has ever been met 
with, nor is it likely, from the geology of the islands, that it will be 
found ; but the great abundance and excellence of peat renders 
this deficiency the less to be regretted. In the progress of me- 
chanical and chemical improvements, we hope to see peat made 
available for most of the purposes to which coal is applied, and it 
has these additional advantages, that it is on the surface, and re- 
productive. The moors that produce It, are, however, very much 
neglected, to the injury of the present stock of fuel, and the pre- 
vention of future accumulation. 

Zooloc/y. — In zoology, there is nothing very remarkable. Of the 
wild quadrupeds, the great and small seal, otter, weasel, rabbit, 
common and great Norway rat, house and field mice, exhaust the 
list. Different species of whales are occasionally seen. They are 
such as occur on the Scottish coast, but are not numerous, with 
the exception of the ha an whale [DelpJiinus melas, hundreds of 
which are by boats annually driven on shore. They are to 
be seen in flocks of thousands every summer ; and if a little 
more attention were directed to their history and modes of 
capture, which it might be easy to point out, they might furnish 
a valuable annual addition to the regular marine resources of 
the country, instead of being a merely casual one. The flesh 
is as nutritious and wholesome as beef, and very similar to it 
in flavour. The oil of which each animal, on an average, 
yields about a barrel is excellent. The skin can be made into 
good leather. The off"als are powerful manure ; and the expense 
and risk of hunting them are trifling. Formerly, they were used as 
food here, as they still are by our worthy, intelligent, and substan- 
tial neighbours of Faroe, from which country Shetland might 
receive many useful lessons. The flesh of a congenerous animal is re- 
gularly sold and prized in the markets of the Bermudas, and that of 
the porpoise a miniature whale was a favourite dish in English 
palaces in the fifteenth century; but modern fastidiousness has, 
it seems, found something revolting in eating whale's flesh, so that 
in seasons of scarcity, sea weed is resorted to, while it is allowed 
to rot on the beach. In the case of any of these ka'an whales 

• Tlic first sketch of the Geology of the ShetUmd Islands was that pubh'shcd by 
Professor Jameson in his Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles : his distinguished pupil, 
Dr Hibbert, many years afterwards, gave a more ample description, also from actual 
observation, of lie numurous striking and interesting relations of this remote portion 
of the British empire, in his Mineralogy of the Shetland Isles.

being stranded tind killed, the landlords on wlio.se property they 
were driven, and the Crown or its donatory, exacted and received 
shares. To this claim the latter had apparently no right, ex- 
cept what might have been derived from ancient usages under the 
Norwegian rule, and if this were a valid authority in the whale 
question, it would be so in many others, and confer privileges on 
the Shetlands, of which Scottish law is unconscious. The land- 
lords, on the other hand, have an obvious right to a share, both 
in equity and usage, just as a proprietor on the Scottish coast 
may demand a high rent for a barren rock, which happens to be fa- 
vourably situated as a site for a lighthouse, or a station for a fishery. 

Almost all the British sea-birds are to be met with in Shetland 
at one season or another; but I am not aware that any are pecu- 
liar to it. They are, in some localities, very numerous, and are 
eagerly sought after by the natives, who are among the most dex- 
terous and intrepid fowlers anywhere to be found. These climbers 
seldom act in concert with each other, as is done in St Kilda, 
Faroe, and many other places, but fearlessly and singly scramble 
amongst precipices where a finger or a toe can hardly find a hold. 
This practice should be here sternly discouraged. The benefit 
from it is trifling. It leads to idle and irregular habits, and is of- 
ten fatal to hfe. The destruction, too, of these lovely tenants 
of the precipices, robs the wild grandeur of the scene of one of 
its most interesting attractions. In defending their nests from 
rapacious birds, they become also the protectors of the flocks that 
pasture in their vicinity ; and it is singular that proprietors are 
not more alive to the utility of their preservation. The land-birds 
are comparatively few in number and species, principally from 
the absence of woodlands. No attraction for sportsmen, in the 
shape of grouse or partridge, is to be met with on our damp and 
lonely moors. 

 Most of the fishes found on the British coasts are to be met 
with here. Those in the small lakes and rivulets are the eel, 
common trout, and sea-trout. I doubt if it can be affirmed 
that salmon have been caught in Shetland ; but when eminent 
and experienced icththyologists find it to be a matter of such 
difficulty to furnish an accurate specific distinction for this fish, 
It would be presumptuous to assert that it does not occur 
here. The rivulets arc short and shallow, and almost all of them 
tinctured deeply with moss. 'J'hesc circumstances may bo the

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



cause that salmon are at least rare, or of diminished size and modified 
appearance. Shell-fish are abundant. Oysters of good size and 
flavour occur in many situations. The limpet is universally used 
as bait for the young coal-fish. The kullyack  Mactra solida J is 
frequent, burrowing in muddy beaches, sheltered from the surf, 
and is in season early in spring. Eaten raw it resembles the oys- 
ter in taste, and by many is thought to be more delicate and di- 
gestible. In the department of marine Invertebrata, an inviting 
field awaits the culture of the naturalist. 

Botany. — Only two plants, not hitherto observed in Scotland, 
have been found in Shetland, — the Pisum maritimum and an are- 
naria, believed to be the Norvegica. Both occur_in the island of 
Unstonly, and were discovered in 1837 by a young and promising 
native botanist. He has since surveyed botanically the most of the 
islands, and the following is his list of phsenogamous plants found 
in them, which is interesting, as being, I believe, the first attempt 
at a regular Shetland flora.

gi-own in abundance in Shetland can hardly, I think, be doubted 
fr m he absence of any appreciable peculiarity in climate or soi 
fatal to their growth, and from the general diffusion of their re- 
mains in the peat moors. Some of those peat trees we eTf L 
mconsiderable dimeisions; but, for the most part, they al " 
small size. Prom this, however, it cannot be fairly nferred hat 
generally, the native trees were diminutive. Timber must always 
have been valuable in this country, and the inhabitants wou d nl 
turally consume all that was of any respectable size,-especiallv as 
no spot of ground ,s six miles from the sea in ever; direcdon and 
therefore the woods would be easily accessible. But itt th opt

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



ter to the proof. On a question such as this, d priori opinions, 
thrown out at a venture, are entirely to be disregarded. It is a 
curious fact, for which there is high botanical authority, that cones 
of the silver fir f Abies picea  have been found in some moors in 
Orkney. This tree is not indigenous to Scotland, but is common 
in Norway. It may, however, have been planted or its cones sown 
by some of the energeticand sagacious Norwegian Yar/s, who so long 
ruled the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and who were as remarkable 
for their attention to husbandry and fishing as to politics and war. 

Antiquities. — These consist of Pictish burghs so called and 
standing -stones. The former seem to have been fortified posts erect- 
ed by the Norse or Saxon rovers, — and the most perfect example of 
this structure anywhere in existence, is in the small island of Moossa, 
a few miles south of Lerwick. The remains of these burghs are 
very numerous throughout Shetland. The standing-stones are 
from twelve to twenty feet high, somewhat conical, and sunk a few 
feet in the ground. They were probably erected in commemora- 
tion of celebrated warriors, as were the " Bautasteine" of the 
Northmen. On some of these stones, old people state that they 
have observed indistinct and strange-looking inscriptions, probably 
Runic ; but these are no longer visible, nor do I know of any 
Runic remains in the islands. If the fashion of erecting 
monuments in honour of modern heroes shall penetrate to 
Shetland, this simple kind of pillar may be revived, as at once 
appropriate to the scenery, — economical and enduring. No traces 
of ancient domestic architecture occur ; perhaps the habitations 
were mostly of wood. Rude concentric circles, formed of turf 
and stone, are in some situations still to be seen ; the circles, 
three in number, are near each other; the diameter of the outer- 
most 30 feet. These were, most probably, situations where legal 
justice was administered, suhpleno Jove, as was for centuries the fa- 
shion of the Norwegians. Tumuli are rather numerous ; but no- 
thing novel that I am aware of has been found in any that have 
been opened. No rocking-stones are to be met with. 

The ancient language was a dialect of the Norse, being similar 
to what is now spoken in the Faroe Islands ; but, for more than a 
century, it has been disused, and is now quite forgotten. From this 
latter cause, and from the destruction of every ancient record and 
document that the Earls Stewart and their Scottish retainers 
could collect, any old ballads or histories which Shetland might 
have possessed, have been lost. Thai such did exist can hardly 



COUNTY OF SHETLAND. 



155 



be questioned ; for the geographical position, and many excellent 
harbours of this country, rendered it a favourite resort of the he- 
roic sea-kings; and there are yet extant in Faroe many sacras 
and poems in some of which Shetland is mentioned. Those 
two groups of islands were for a long period united under one go- 
vernment and bishoprick; but Faroe was fortunately not scourged, 
as was Shetland, by royal favourites and greedy adventurers, tak- 
ing advantage of the unsuspecting and defenceless Udallers, un- 
protected as they were by the Government of Scotland, to which 
they had been conditionally consigned, and ignorant of its language 
and its laws. 

Population. — The population, under the Norwegian rule, may 
fairly be supposed to have fully equalled, in amount, what it now is. 
There exists, indeed, nodocumentary proofofthis; butitis a reason- 
able inference, from what we know of the contemporary sta te of Nor- 
way and its other dependencies, all under the same government and 
state of society, and inhabited by the same race of people. This argu- 
ment, which I have elsewhere put forth, might be amply illustrated, 
did our limits permit. A considerable population may also be 
inferred from the warlike achievements and great poHtical influ- 
ence of the Earls of Orkney, of which country Shetland formed 
an mtegral part ;— the conclusion drawn by some of a great popu- 
lation, from the remains of numerous churches, appears to be un- 
tenable, for these churches were small ; and it was the habit as 
It still is m Norway, for the clergyman to have several places of 
worship in a parish instead of one ; an arrangement apparently 
wisely adapted to the religious instruction of the people, though 
demanding a little more activity on the part of the pastor. 

A few years ago, the population was 31,000. Since then, it 
has been, I think, decreasing; the seasons, latterly, have been dis- 
astrous ; and many of the young and able-bodied men have left 
the country. In many parishes, the women are in proportion to the 
other sex, as two to one. Under judicious management, however, 
the islands could probably maintain three times the present num- 
ber of inhabitants. 

To no quarter of the kingdom is emigration less applicable; 
there is ample employment at home for the people, and their ha-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



bits do not render them fit subjects for the measure. The most 
of the men that leave Shetland enter the merchant navy, and few 
eventually are heard of. They make good sailors, and their prac- 
tice at the oar is as near to perfection as this elegant exercise can 
approach. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are twelve parishes in Shetland. 
The stipends of the clergy absorb about a fifth of the whole rental, 
and several of them are above the minimum of L. 150. They 
are all valued at a fixed money rate. The serious consequences of 
this arrangement, were any important changes to take place in the 
value of the precious metals, will be at once perceived. 

Methodists, Seceders, Independents, and Anabaptists, are to be 
found, but no. Catholics. 

Poor. — For the support of the poor, each parish is divided into 
certain districts, and a pauper is appointed to each, who resides a 
given number of days in, or receives a certain allowance from, each 
family. Collections at the churches are also regularly made for 
ihem. In this way their maintenance is lightly felt. Compul- 
sory assessments would, in Shetland, have most pernicious effects. 

The right to a share in Parliamentary representation was first 
granted to Shetland by the Reform Bill. In conjunction with 
Orkney, it now elects a county Member. The number of electors 
is 150. 

Education. — Education is on the same footing as it is in Scot- 
land in general. Parochial schools are established throughout, 
assisted by those of the General Assembly. There are few in- 
dividuals who cannot read ; and writing and arithmetic are pretty 
generally acquired. 

Character of the People. — The people are not remarkable for 
size or muscular strength, but chiefly for hardihood and endurance 
of fatigue ; of a temperament rather versatile and sanguine than 
phlegmatic and persevering; more apt for desultory and adven- 
turous, than for regular and continued exertion ; and this in some 
measure arises, doubtless, from the various and somewhat incom- 
patible occupations on land and water, to which they are early 
accustomed ; and from the lottery-like gains of a fisherman's 
occupation. Their manner and address are mild and respect- 
ful ; their enunciation smooth, and the tones somewhat pensive. 
The language is English, with the Norse accent, and many of its 
idioms and words. The old names of places are Scandinavian. 
They are fond of music and dancing, though they exhibit little 



COUNTY OF SHETLAND. 



157 



proficiency in these accomplishments. The violin is the only in- 
strument in use, and the music is Scottish, with a few rude na- 
tive melodies. Music and dancing have been recently much dis- 
couraged, from a most erroneous notion that they lead to vicious 
excesses. The effects of such a check to an enjoyment in itself 
innocent, and to the love of home, fostered by pleasurable asso- 
ciations, can be easily imagined. 

The people are slavishly indulgent, or rather obedient to their 
children ; and this is perhaps one reason why gratitude, filial duty, 
and reverence for old age are not thought to be among their pro- 
minent virtues. Superstitions are prevalent, though they present 
little novel or interesting. Witchcraft, charms, and apparitions, 
are firmly believed in ; but the idea of fairies is becoming obsolete. 

Benefit Societies. — Benefit societies are not well adapted to their 
habits, the advantages to be derived from them appearing too dis- 
tant and contingent. A Fisherman's Fund, for the relief of widows, 
orphans, and infirm individuals, was established in 1810. The ca- 
pital, it is . understood, is nearly L.SOOO. The members, from 
death and withdrawal, are now so few, and it has become so un- 
popular, that its dissolution would be judicious, with due respect, 
however, to the rights of those having claims on it for relief. This 
measure has been, indeed, loudly demanded by most of the sub- 
scribers for these few years past, when the distribution of the fund 
amongst them would have been so very seasonable ; and it seems 
difficult to conceive upon what principle it can be expediently or 
equitably resisted. 

Temperance Societies. — Temperance societies have been esta- 
blished, but seem supererogatory in a country, on the whole, re- 
markable for sobriety ; their tendency is certainly to produce 
good, mainly by their indirect effect in leading people seriously 
to reflect on the imprudence of indulgence in stimulating beve- 
rages. 

Hospitality is a virtue of which my countrymen may be proud 
of the reputation. Long may they cherish the sentiment, as just 
as it is noble, that the visited is more honoured than the visitor. 
In the majority of cases, the favour lies most truly not on the 
side of the guest, but on that of the host ; and in a country where 
inns can hardly be said to exist, kindness to strangers becomes a 
sacred duty, which no temporary inconvenience can cancel. 

Cottars. — There are few British cottars who have at their com- 
mand, in ordinary seasons, and with common industry, a greater varie- 



158 



GENERAL ODSERVATIONSON THE 



ty of food. Fish, Hesli, fowl, milk, vegetables they have within their 
reach ; but if they are not jierseveriugly industrious to gain, they 
are as little frugal to keep ; and hence the extremes of plenty and 
want too frequently touch each other. The common position of a 
Shetland tenant may be stated thus : He pays L.5 or L.6 annually 
to his landlord. For this he has a cottage, in the construction of 
which there is room for improvement; a cow-house, corn and cab- 
bage yards; 10 or 12 acres of good ground, partly arable, and 
partly grass and meadow; the right to cut as much peat for fuel, 
and turf for compost, &amp;c. on the common as he can consume ; and 
pasture as many animals as he pleases on it. Such a farm may 
produce twenty bolls of bear and oatmeal, and five tons of potatoes ; 
graze, in summer, three to six milk cows, and fodder, in winter, 
from seven to ten cattle of all ages. He may have as much poul- 
try, and as many geese and pigs, as he can manage ; the sea is 
always near to supply him with fish for food, and sea- weed for manure; 
the produce of his summer fishing is generally sufficient to pay 
his rent. The wages of day labour are high, when its effici- 
ency and a comparison with the circumstances of other countries 
are considei'ed, and an active and faithful workman always has 
employment. How happens it, then, that he has frequently 
been brought to the verge of famine, of late years especially  
Partly from bad seasons ; partly because his desultory habits 
indispose him to regular and vigorous exertion on his farm ; 
partly because much of his industry is injudiciously applied ; 
and partly because a taste for luxuries, to which his means 
are not competent, is indulged. An example of this last point 
may be found in the fact, that about 40,000 lbs. of tea are con- 
sumed annually, the value of which would, perhaps, exceed the 
whole gross rental of the islands. He is too much habituated to 
imagine, that six months labour in the year should keep him com- 
paratively idle for the remaining six ; and, in the direction of his 
agricultural industry, he has gradually fallen into the practice of 
trusting to potatoes instead of corn, for his chief food, without pro- 
viding an extra supply of manure to keep the land in heart; this 
leads to the relinquishment of the culture of bear, which ripens 
sooner than oats, — is more productive, and less exposed to da- 
mage from the autumnal gales; the land being impoverished yields 
little fodder and grass ; his cattle are reduced in number and 
plight; he and his family are imperfectly nourished for energetic 

exertion ; and a failure of the potato crop, which, in so variable a 

4 



COUNTY OF SHETLAND. 



159 



climate, must necessarily often occur, at once brings him to indi- 
gence. If he could be induced to provide three times the quan- 
tity of manure which he usually does, and which, in most cases, he 
could do with perfect ease, this alone would make him compa- 
ratively independent. His farm is usually taken for three or five 
years, occasionally by the year; but it is a point of honour and habit 
with most landlords, which public opinion properly and vigilantly 
protects, not to raise his rent or disturb him in his possession, un- 
less for obvious crime or wilful insolvency ; and many examples 
exist, of the same family remaining for several generations on the 
same farm. He has thus almost all the benefit of a lease, while he 
himself is perfectly free to remove at short intervals; and this free- 
dom is a real one, from the number of « ley" farms and landlords 
in competition ; so that, while he obeys the laws, and retains his 
solvency, no subject of Great Britain can enjoy more unrestrained 
liberty. 

His attachment to country is not very strong, an effect which 
may, in some measure, arise from the love of a wandering life, in- 
duced by sailor habits, and which so many of the young men im- 
bibe, by going annually in the whalers to Greenland. This prac- 
tice has always been reprobated by the more sagacious proprietors 
and most justly. It is contaminating to the morals of the unsophis- 
ticated youth; it dissatisfies them with the regular and simple modes 
of living in their native country; it employs the period of life, when 
they should be acquiring the habits and knowledge of fishermen 
and farmers, in making them only half-sailors, and accustoms them 
to expenses which their ordinary industry at home cannot support; 
yet the attempts at salutary restraint here have been stigmatized 
as arbitrary oppression. This is only one instance, however, amongst 
many, in which Shetland proprietors have been cruelly traduced 
as the tyrants of their tenants, unable to appreciate either their 
rights or their capabilities, or the interests and duties of their 
own position. It was formerly a common practice, which is 
still followed in some districts, for the tenant to give his land- 
lord a few days' work every year; this was mutually beneficial, 
and in a country where regular daily labourers, as a class, are 
hardly to be found, was necessary. These days' work eventually 
formed part of the rent, and thus in reality were hired labour. Yet 
this, too, has been often railed against as unjust exaction, as if a 
Shetland cottar were above the sphere of day labour, or as if he 
might practise it for the benefit of any one except his landlord. 



160 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



The injurious consequences of indulging in such crude decla- 
mation, however well meant it may in some instances have been, 
were severely felt, in destroying confidence between tenant 
and master, and rendering the former discontented with his lot ; 
and this naturally conducts to a few remarks on the leading causes 
of the destitution of the last four years, which has claimed and 
received so much relief from a benevolent British community. 
The more immediate cause, certainly, was a failure of the crops 
and fishing, — the more remote, but not less general or efficient, I 
should suggest, was a departure from the ancient relation between 
landlord and tenant. A Shetland proprietor holds his lands, it is 
true, by the same tenure as a Scottish ; but to insure fair and ade- 
quate returns he must, in most cases, view himself rather as a pro- 
prietor in a new colony with which, in many points, Shetland is 
assimilated, or, if I may so speak, as the conductor of a compli- 
cated manufactory, than simply as a landholder having little other 
business to transact, besides merely granting leases and receiving 
rents; he must vigilantly excite and direct the energies of his tenants, 
— assist them with capital and counsel, — receive, and provide a mar- 
ket for the various produce of their industry, — keep a store con- 
taining every necessary article they may require, and carefully at- 
tend to the many subordinate arrangements of order and discipline 
which the peculiarity of their position and co-operative industry may 
demand. He must be at once landlord, merchant, farmer, fish -curer, 
and the banker also of his tenants ; or, if he is not himself able to 
undertake all this, he places his lands under the direction of some 
intelligent and responsible person as tacksman, who, under certain 
restrictions, manages the property as the owner would do. In 
either way, a close and kindly connexion between tenant and mas- 
ter subsisted, — the one had all his necessary and reasonable wants 
provided for, and the other had security for his rents, and each had 
a near interest in the other's welfare. It was the practice, in 
working this system, for the tenant to pay a low rent for his farm, 
and in return to receive a low price for certain parts of his produce, 
especially fish, and this mode of low reciprocal valuation was ob- 
viously more for the benefit of the tenant than the proprietor. 
Under this system the people prospered and were contented, 
and it afforded them facility for gradual and solid improvement ; 
but individuals, who either could not or would not see the wisdom 
of this arrangement, in a certain state of society, — entertaining 
theoretical views of political economy, suited only to great capital

and high commercial civilization,--were unceasing in their de 
nuncations against the landlords, as injuriously compelling their 
tenants to dehver to them their produce at a less price than thev 
could obtain m the market, while the countervailing fact was over- 
Jooked, of the proportionally low rent paid for the land. This ad 
captandum argument was but too successful ; the tenants became 
dissatisfied ; many of them dishonestly eluded the compact by clan- 
destine disposal of much of their produce to others than their 
masters, while these were paid with low rents,-and at length they 
demanded to be at liberty to give their labour to the highest bid-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



ing the population from their native country; and while it may be 
a question with many, whose opinions are entitled to respect, whe- 
ther this would be the more profitable plan, it ought only to be 
had recourse to as a last resource, so long as equity and good feel- 
ing are valued as paramount to iron-handed legal right. The 
proprietors have never been absentees; and if the nature of their 
possessions be such as to demand on their part industrious and de- 
tailed superintendence, they may console themselves with the re- 
flection, that in few parts of the kingdom is there a better field 
than in this, for substantial improvement and active benevolence, 
or where the lords of the soil have more ample power for the 
good of the tenants entrusted by Providence to their care. 

Agriculture. — The natural soil of Shetland may generally be 
termed mossy, with those exceptions which the nature and outline 
of the subjacent rock, and the conditions of exposure produce. 
Much alluvial soil exists along the shores of the bays, and among 
the numerous small vales, and a considerable quantity of good land 
has been made by long culture. The mode of farming which has 
been from time immemorial in use, was probably introduced by 
the Norwegian colonists, and is not ill adapted to the circum- 
stances of the country, however much at first sight it may appear 
to be at variance with the theoretical principles of refined hus- 
bandry. The spade, of a light and peculiar construction, is the 
common instrument for turning over the soil, and it is surprising 
to observe the rapidity and efficiency with which it performs its 
work. Many individuals employ the common Scotch plough, to 
which the ground in general is well suited, and were the farms 
larger, or co-operation among the occupiers more attended to, 
its employment might with great advantage be universal. Some 
new land is annually broken up for cultivation ; but an ignorance 
of sound agricultural principles is here too often apparent, and 
leads to disappointment and loss. 

Carts are little used,— the absence of regular roads, the facility 
of water carriage, and the inconsiderable quantity of produce re- 
quiring transport, render their want the less felt. Ponies with 
pack saddles are the chief substitute. 

The subject of road-making has deservedly attracted attention. 
In a country so indented by the sea, the employment of small 
steam-boats, using peats for fuel, might, for some time to come, 
be suggested as a substitute. 

The manures are, farm-yard dung, sea-weed, peat ashes, 



COUXTY OF SHETLAND. 



163 



and mould, generally mixed together. The labouring season be- 
gins in March, and terminates in May. The staple objects of cul- 
tivation are bristle-pointed oats, {Jvena strigosa, perhaps one of 
the most valuable of all the varieties of dark oats ; bear, {Hor- 
deum vulgare, and potatoes. The common close cabbage has 
been long cultivated. The seed is sown in the end of June, in 
small circular inclosures, of about five yards in diameter, in poor 
ground, and manured with peat ashes alone, for the double pur- 
pose of preventing weeds, and premature luxuriant growth, and 
the plants are set out in rich soil, the succeeding spring. More 
recently, field turnips, on a small scale, have become general, and 
their culture ought, by all means, to be encouraged and extended. 
Thesoiland climate are very favourable for them. No instance of the 
fly, that I am aware of, has occurred; and the only enemy to be 
dreaded is the mountain linnet, {Fringilla flavirostris, which is 
indeed a formidable one, and is very numerous in Shetland. 
These birds crop the cotyledonous leaves as they first appear 
above ground, with the seeds on the top, by which, perhaps, 
they are first attracted, and in doing this the young plants are torn 
up. I have often shot them in the very act of depredation, and 
have counted from 40 to 100 embryo turnips in the crop of 
one. The remedy is diligent watching for two or three days 
after the first appearance of the plant. This bird is rare in the 
Scottish lowlands; but congenerous species may have there done 
equal damage to the turnip crops, and the fact have been over- 
looked. Ihe culture of potatoes is well understood, and is increas- 
ing, but yet httle more manure is collected, and thus the old ara- 
ble ground IS deteriorated, and the corn crop lessened. This is 
an abuse which proprietors would do well immediately to check, 
for It clearly proceeds from ignorance and indolence, and will have 
extensively injurious efi-ects. A better rotation, or larger stock of 
manure, should in this case be compulsory on the tenant The 
disease of curl in potatoes may be said to be unknown. The ha- 
bit is, not to remove the tubers from the ground, until quite ripe, 
indicated by the total decay of the leaves and stem. Inattention 
to this, and planting in too strongly manured ground, I have long- 
suspected to be the main cause of the failure of potato crops. 

Ihe hay is chiefly the produce of natural meadows; but, from 
the careless mode of management, it becomes malted, instead of 
being simply dried grass. This is evident from the smell errone- 
ously attributed to the presence of scented vernal grass, and in sq 



164 



GENEllAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



-moist a climate as that of Shetland, much nourishing matter, hav- 
ing become soluble by fermentation, may be exhausted. Nothing 
can be simpler or more certain than hay -making, if the circum- 
stances that produce malting be avoided. A good deal of coarse 
hay, known by the vernacular name of Tekk, is collected. It is 
composed chiefly of heaths and rushes, cut on the common and 
dried. Much of this is also used as litter, and it in this way fur- 
nishes an excellent ingredient of the manure used for bear. Little 
attention is paid to the artificial grasses, except by a few intelli- 
gent individuals, although rye-grass and clover are peculiarly suit- 
ed to the country, and would add very largely to its resources. It 
would be well, if every cottar in Shetland were to follow the ex- 
ample of his relatives in Norway, where, as Von Buch informs us, 
the peasants of the northern coasts annually collect a large stock 
of sea-weed, chiefly the Fucus digifatus, which, after steeping a 
day or two in fresh water, is carefully dried and stacked for winter 
fodder. Cut fresh, and boiled sea-weed is occasionally, but spar- 
ingly, given to cattle in spring in these islands, and it is evidently 
nourishing and wholesome. Proprietors would find it beneficial 
to keep several pasture inclosures, as well as small islands for 
rearing and fattening cattle, and for assisting their tenants in the 
keep of their regular stock, in the event of bad seasons and scanty 
fodder. 

The more general rotation of cropping is, Jirst, bear, with the 
manure spread above after sowing, and it seems as rational, in cer- 
tain circumstances, thus to top-dress corn as grass. Potatoes come 
next, then oats simply harrowed in. Ley, an essential ingredient 
in every good Shetland rotation, follows. Lastly, oats, and again 
bear as before. 

Clearing the ground of weeds, draining, and opening the sub- 
soil, are little thought of, and yet in average seasons the crops are 
good. Harvest usually commences in September. The habit 
is too general to allow the corn to become dead ripe before cutting, 
which, in the case of oats, is, in this climate, most hazardous, for 
the chief danger is from high winds in autumn. It may be affirm- 
ed, that, if the principal cereal crop had been bear, or if the oats had 
been sooner cut, the better half of the corn crop of the last four 
years might have been saved. It is to be regretted, that, while 
the most minute details on other points of agriculture are made 
public, accurate indications of the ripeness of corn crops are left 
to individual conjecture.

The cattle, horses and sheep, of Shetland, are of races now al- 
mostpeculiar toitj possessing many of the good points of high breed, 
they add the invaluable one of hardihood. The cow is small, the 
four quarters seldom weighing more than 2 cwt. ; the quality of 
her milk is excellent, and its quantity, in relation to her size, abun- 
dant, sometimes reaching sixteen imperial quarts a-day. The ox 
is active, gentle, and docile, and for draught is better suited 
to the present state of Shetland, than the horse. Both ox and 
cow are often 14 and 16 years old, before they are fattened for the 
knife, and yet the beef is observed to be tender, fine-grained, and 
highly flavoured. Owing to the scantiness of their winter fod- 
der, they are usually very lean, when put to summer grazing ; thus, 
much of the beef is what is termed new. Their food is natural 
pasture, containing many aromatic plants. The breed is a pecu- 
liar one, and the animal having arrived at adult age, the full fla- 
vour is attained, different in this from high bred stall-fed cattle, 
which, though they have reached their full size, have not gain- 
ed in all respects the maturity of their kind. Much beef is 
annually salted and exported. A little nitre is generally used in 
the curing; but it is an injurious addition. Simply strewing a 
sufficient quantity of bay salt, in largish crystals, between each 
layer of beef in the cask, applying pressure, and changing the 
pickle of a saturated strength two or three times, as it becomes 
foul or bloody, seems to be one of the best modes of curing beef, 
and which I myself regularly practise. The flesh of cattle killed, 
when the moon is growing, has been thought to stand curing bet- 
ter than when it is in the, wane ; and there may be reason in this ; 
a more plethoric and sthenic state may be induced in the animal, 
and hence a more tonic condition of the muscular fibre, and 
more vigorous health of the whole system. There are se- 
veral situations where flocks of brood cows, suckling their 
calves, and going out, all the year round, could be kept with 
great advantage ; they would require little more looking after 
than brood mares, and when old they are equally valuable for 
the butcher as when young. Cattle seem constitutionally har- 
dier than horses. Nature has adapted them to a wider geograjhi- 
cal range, while the native country of the horse is limited to a 
warm and dry climate, and he never can be brought to bear with 
impunity so great alternations of cold and moisture. The Shet- 
land poncy is well known and generally esteemed for hardihood, 
strength, and spirit, in which he is surpassed by none of his size.

in any country. He does not arrive at perfection, till eight or nine 
years of age; seldom stands higher than 44 inches, for the 
most part about 38. The general colour is a dark mouse gray, 
and he is covered with long woolly hair, till three or four years 
old. He is singularly free from vice, but is not so docile or sa- 
gacious, as high bred horses. His attachment to the locality where 
he has been born is obstinate, often pining for years of maladie 
de pays, and this instinct, when strongly marked in the lower ani- 
mals, is not usually accompanied with great sagacity. However, 
education and chivalry may have ennobled the horse, his title to the 
brute patrician order seems not an inherent one. Theponejs range 
in herds over the common, in an almost wild state, and have little 
care or food bestowed on them, unless when engaged in labour, 
or during long snows ; a handful of food is, in this latter case, oc- 
casionally given to them, as a condiment to season the sea-weed 
drifted on the beach, and freshened by snowwater, on which they 
must then sustain themselves. Yet, under these circumstances, 
continuing sometimes for months together, they preserve their 
health and plight. If they were stabled, they would lose their 
hardihood, and the habit of catering for themselves, and their keep 
would be far more expensive than the actual farming economy of 
the country could afford. When old, they are never killed, but 
allowed to live as long as they can. 

The sheep is small ; not often horned ; ears pointed and erect ; 
face, back, and tail short ; fine-boned ; legs long ; naturally wild, 
active, and hardy, and little liable to disease ; the colour generally 
white ; sometimes ferruginous, gray, black, and piebald ; the wool 
very soft and often fine. The more damp and mossy the pasture, 
the softer is the wool ; one of the causes of which probably is, 
deficient strength and nourishment ; another, the astringent na- 
ture of the food. Sheep-farming, as a separate object, is now at- 
tracting some attention, although it is not likely to be carried 
on to so much advantage as in the Scottish Highlands. There, 
the sheep-walks are mountainous and inland, naturally dry, and 
contain a greater variety of pasture plants congenial to the breeds 
of sheep suitable for such situations, than can be afforded by the 
comparatively level and damp moors of Shetland, producing chief- 
ly mat-grass and rushes. A serious casualty affecting the value 
of a Shetland flock, arises from the constant vicinity of precipices 
facing the sea, to which sheep are attracted by the tender grass 
growing amongst them, and great losses, by their falling over the

rocks, are often sustained. In the smaller grazing islands the ver- 
dure is luxuriant, consisting chiefly of Jestiicas, plantagos, and 
statice, top-dressed by sea spray and exuviae of sea birds, and in 
these, even the improved Leicester breed of sheep thrives so well, 
as to be the most profitable of any. 

It is likely that our cattle, horses, and sheep were derived from 
Norway; and it might not be fanciful to trace them even to the 
Caucasian range, the original seat of Odin and his people, whence 
they emigrated into Scandinavia with their families and flocks ; 
at least, there is a marked difference between our breeds of these 
animals and other well-defined European races. It might be, in 
many cases, of advantage, not only to preserve in purity, but also 
to trace the origin of, distinct breeds of animals, to facilitate im- 
provement without crossing ; but it is often as difficult to do this, 
as to determine the native country, in the wild state of certain do- 
mestic species. With regard to some of these, domestication may 
have been originally the rule, and the wild state the exception. 
No breeds of these three species of animals can, as a general rule, 
be better adapted to the Shetland Islands than those that are na- 
tive to them ; and, as they are always in great demand, we should 
do well zealously to cultivate them. All that is necessary is 
such a sufficiency of food and care as will not encroach too much 
on their natural habits and hardihood, and a persevering se- 
lection of the best animals for breeders ; yet, if premiums had 
been held out for producing change and degeneracy, it is difficult 
to imagine a course of management better calculated to produce 
them, than that which has mostly been pursued. A pernicious prac- 
tice has too much prevailed, of crossing with larger and incongru- 
ous breeds from Scotland ; and the progeny, as might have been 
expected, displays all the bad points, with few of the good, of the 
parents. A natural but rough antidote to these evils is, in some 
measure, to be found in bad seasons, which fall with fatal severity 
on the degenerate. One very evident and easy mode of improve-, 
ment would be, for proprietors to keep males of a good race aud ma-, 
ture age, in different districts for general use, and insist on all infe- 
rior ones being removed ; and it could be easily so arranged that no 
party could suffer loss. The tenants suppose that every one's business 
is no one's ; and it hence, not unfrequently happens that calves and. 
lambs, especially are wanting, because a sufficient number of bulls 
and rams are not reared, or those that are reared, are too young, or 
of a bad stock. Theannualloss to the country from this source alone,

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



is far greater, than many not attending to the subject could ima- 
gine. 

Hogs are universal ; but with very little trouble, the people miwht 
keep many more than they do. These also are of a very peculiar 
breed, small boned, erect ears, woolly next the skin, active, hardy, 
and easily fed ; and the pork is of very delicate flavour. A strong 
prepossession is by some entertained against their going loose on the 
common, from a:n idea that their rooting on it is injurious. This, 
however, is not always well founded, as might easily be shown. 
Absolute restriction, however, from turning over the arable ground, 
should be rigidly enforced. Far from checking their increase, it 
should by encouraged, as adding greatly to the comforts and re- 
sources of the tenants. 

Geese are kept by several individuals, but large flocks might 
be reared by almost every one. Why they are not, it is difficult 
to say. Perhaps their requiring a little more trouble than is ha- 
bitual, may be the very sufficient reason. 

Land is possessed not by the acre, but the mark, as it seems 
to have been in the parent country, Norway, and others of her co- 
lonies. This word signifies, in the Norse dialect, a coin, a 
weight, a field, and, in the present case, it may be translated 
as meaning a share, or proportional quantity of land. Shetland 
contains about 14,000 marks; and a proprietor is said to be a 
laird of so many marks, not acres. All the land, with the excep- 
tion of the small grazing islands, was anciently divided, as it still 
remains, into districts of unequal extent, termed scattalds, and 
the boundary lines of each defined and recorded. Each of these 
contained a certain number of marks, some greater, and others 
less. The marks or shares jn any one scattald are of equal value, 
though they may be very different, as compared with those of an- 
other; for one district containing 200 marks may be less exten- 
sive and valuable than another containing 100. In. the event of 
dividing a scattald possessed by several proprietors, each receives 
his proportion according to the number of marks or shares in it 
which his rental bears. These scattalds are again subdivided 
into, \st, enclosed and appropriated, and, 2d, unenclosed and unap- 
]ropriated ground. The former contains the arable, grass, and 
meadow lands, which bear a very small proportion to the unenclos- 
ed or commons. This mode of division into districts or scattalds 
was, it appears to me, coeval with the settlement of the first Nor- 
wegian colonists. Each adventurer with his followers fixed him- 
self in a certain situation, and boundary lines between localities.

occupied by independent possessors, were determined, to prevent 
collision and encroachment. The division, again, into marks or 
shares was obviously to facilitate sale and succession. The read- 
er will here observe some curious points of resemblance between 
ancient Scandinavian, and very recently promulgated principles of 
colonization. In certain states of society it is expedient that por- 
tions of land should be held in community ; and, under any circum- 
stances, it is not apparent why joint-stock management should 
not have place in this as in other species of property. This is, 
however, not a favourite doctrine in Shetland, for divisions of the 
commons, without any apparent agricultural object, are yearly tak- 
ing place. As this process is expensive, and often vexatious, it might 
be as well previously to consider, whether more beneficial results, 
with less outlay, might not be obtained by divisions of parts of the 
commons, or by more prudent pro indivlso management of the 
whole, similar to what formerly was here the practice, and what 
has long been in operation under the orderly and well-digested sys- 
tem of rule carried on by the mild and paternal government of 
Denmark in the Faroe Islands. 

Property is in the hands of many individuals : a few heritors 
are comjniratively large ones. The Earl of Zetland possesses a 
considerable entailed estate, which, however, from being much 
scattered over the country, is of far less value than it otherwise 
would be. The great benefit of excambions is here most pal- 
pable. The value of land would be increased by concentration, 
management would be simphfied and abridged, and the expenses 
of compulsory divisions diminished. The resident proprietors 
have been long actively anxious to effect exchanges with this only 
absentee landlord, on principles of equitable and reciprocal ad- 
vantage ; and it is to be hoped that the present worthy represen- 
tative of the family will perceive the propriety of removing an 
impediment to improvement, which has long pressed heavily on 
the islands. 

Long leases have often been proposed as a boon for Shetland 
peasants, and the landlords are quite disposed to grant them ; but 
It may be time enough to appreciate the value of this suggestion, 
when the tenants shall be disposed to accept them, which they are 
not. A more immediate and direct benefit would be produced 
were the landlords, instead of attending chiefly to the extension 
of their properties, to employ a part of the time of their tenants 
for hire, in improving the farms by enclosing, draining, manure-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



collecting, spade-trenching, &amp;c. opening with the mattock the 
subsoil, but leaving it in situ, as I have practised for several years, 
thus at once permanently raising their value, benefitting the te- 
nants, and inuring them to regular and useful land labour. For 
instance, at a small expense each cottar could enclose such an ex- 
tent of ground as might raise so much rye-grass and turnips, from 
seed of his own growth, as would enable him to keep annually 
an additional cow, and do ample justice to all the rest of his live- 
stock ; and if this simple expedient alone were universal, the ren- 
tal of the whole country would soon be greatly increased. It may 
be affirmed, that by this and other simjle and economical improve- 
ments, on which our limits will not here allow us to enlarge, and 
by more persevering industry, the lands already under cultivation 
might be rendered much more productive, without conflicting with 
the general habits and routine of the people ; and such graftings 
on the old system are confessedly to be preferred to uprooting and 
expensive innovations, which too often are found to rest on nothing 
but the love of novelty and generalization. 

Fisheries. — Cod, ling, tusk, saithe, and herring are the spe- 
cies of fish caught to be cured for sale. Ling and tusk have been 
long the staple articles of Shetland export. The home of the lat- 
ter may, in Great Britain, be said to be confined to Shetland, and 
it is a peculiarly rich and highly-flavoured fish. Both these are 
fished with long lines in boats of 18 or 19 feet of keel, with 
a crew of six men. The distance of the fishing ground from 
the land varies from ten to forty miles. The lines are laid 
at midnight, the common bait is the young coal-fish, and the 
season is from the end of May to the middle of August. But 
the fishing should be continued two months later, and then 
during the day alone. Cod and ling then draw nearer the shore, 
and are more numerous and diffused. The favourite bait, herring, 
is then abundant, and danger is diminished. This autumn fishing 
will probably be more valued and prosecuted than it yet is. The 
fish are split, salted in tubs, and dried on the pebbly beaches, 
which are numerous, and exceedingly well adapted to the purpose 
from their smoothness, dryness, and admitting of a constant cur- 
rent of cool air below them. The art of fish-curing in this manner 
is well understood, and the essential principle of pininff or pressure 
is in general duly and even scientifically applied. Since the lands, 
however, have been under the pseudo-free system, and deprived 
of the beneficial superintendence of the lairds, the curing of

fish has been more slovenly, and their character in the market 
lowered. The chief season for fishing cod is April and Maj'. For 
several years, this business has been carried on by numerous small 
decked vessels of from 20 to 40 tons, with hand lines, and shell- 
fish bait, and the fishing ground is the south and south-west 
sides of the coast. The ling, tusk, and cod are also caught by 
small boats with hand lines at all seasons, but in comparatively li - 
mited numbers, and those got in winter are salted in heap till the 
spring drought arrives. The south and north extremities of 
the country are the localities where the saithe  Gadus carho- 
narius are caught; but there seems no reason why they should 
not be sought for with success, around the coast. This is the 
most abundant and generally diffused fish in Shetland, if we 
may judge from the exuberant number of the young pervading 
every part of the shores. From saithe being caught with little ha- 
zard near land during summer, requiring small capital, and always 
selling readily in the home market, it will probably ere long be 
prosecuted as the most profitable and generally attainable branch 
of the fishing. The young of different ages and sizes called sil- 
lacks and piltacks, are really the staff of life to the inhabitants of 
these islands, and they are both palatable and nutritious. The 
supplies of them, during the last four years of scarcity of bread, 
have been providentially most abundant throughout, and but for 
this, notwithstanding the liberal charitable donations from the 
south, famine must have occurred. Skate, haddock, halibut, and 
other kinds of fish are caught for consumption at home ; but they 
are little followed as separate objects of pursuit. 

As far as the fishing by boats is concerned, it will be difficult 
to point out a better mode than the one now in operation. The 
kind of boat is of the old Norway model improved, it is one 
of the finest combinations for rowing and .sailing, and when not 
over-masted, as it always is, and under skilful and intrepid ma- 
nagement, is as safe as an open boat can well be. Boat fishing 
must, of course, often be hazardous here, as it is everywhere else ; 
but it has still advantages which will not permit its disuse. The 
los.ses that occur are mostly from mismanagement, and few acci- 
dents happen to boats in which the art of swimming would not 
be of vital use ; yet hardly a single fisherman acquires it, and an 
object of great moment would be its general introduction. The

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



use of small drove sails would also be highly advisable. From 
the increased number of boats, and the practice of going earlier 
HI the season to the fishing, when the ling are spawning, the fish- 
ing grounds near the shore had become considerably exhausted. 
Proprietors, therefore, very prudently have discouraged this prac- 
tice during the last eight years, and the good effects of this are de- 
cidedly showing themselves. In fishing with decked vessels, 
the sea ground between Shetland and Norway should be carefully 
explored, and there can be no doubt it would amply remunerate 
the expense. 

Herrings have been industriously fished by boats for the last 
twenty years, from the middle of August till the middle of Octo- 
ber ; and to the patriotic Sheriff- Substitute, Mr Duncan, is due 
the credit of first establishing this branch of industry. The em- 
ployment is, however, attended in these islands with more danger 
th an on the Scottish coasts, from the more stormy and irregular 
nature of the climate, the numerous boisterous tide-currents, and the 
smaller extent of land on which, in the event of off shore wind, 
the boats have to lie; neither do the fish appear to be so abun- 
dant or so regular in their movements. Though herrings, as well 
as other fish, are found in shoals at certain seasons, it does not fol- 
low that they so congregate at other periods of the year ; the 
spawning grounds may be viewed as centres ; the feeding ones, 
as circumferences. If they could be fished earlier in the 
seasou, the hazard would be less, and the returns might be 
greater. Sufficient experiments to ascertain this have not yet 
been made, but, no doubt, soon will be, for capital, enter- 
prize, and intelligence, are not wanting in Shetland, for a judi- 
cious development of its marine resources. But enlightened 
views with regard to fisheries have been far from keeping pace 
in any country, with other objects of economical research. 
The experience of the fisherman, the science of the naturalist, 
the aid of the statesman and the merchant, should all be put in 
requisition, to explore and enlarge this fertile source of national 
v/ealth. Periodicals, in which the fisheries occupied a prominent 
place, would be of great use, and it is singidar that the subject has 
been so much overlooked in this age of magazines and reviews. 
A great many erroneous hypotheses, leading to ignorant and per- 
nicious practice, have too long been dominant in our knowledge of 
he habits and history of fish, of which the theory of the annual

jiolar migration of the herring is an instance, and it is not to be 
supposed, that accurate and extensive observation, and cautious 
inference and analogy devoted to the subject, would fail in eliciting 
something like scientific principles, and in establishing most interest- 
ing and valuable practical results. Of all beings, the rude fisher- 
man is the most superstitious and theoretical, and almost all, we 
think, we know of the subject is derived from him. 

Trade. — Much intelligent commercial activity prevails. The 
exports consist chiefly of salt fish, oil, butter, beef, cattle, ponies, 
and hosiery ; the imports are, it may be supposed, very miscella- 
neous. A good many merchant vessels of respectable size, some 
of which have been built in the country, belong to it, and small 
fishing craft are very numerous. Leith is the great depot for 
Shetland produce. 

Manufactures. — Knitting of various articles of hosiery and kelp 
making may be said to be the only native ones. They are especially 
useful as givingemployment to that partof the population which would 
otherwise want profitable occupation ; and, moreover, in the case 
of kelp- making, asubstance becomes valuable, which otherwise would 
be left to waste away on the strand. Kelp was never so important 
an object in Shetland, as in Orkney and the Hebrides ; the shores 
are not so productive of the materials which afford it, nor is its 
quality so much prized ; but there is, doubtless, much yet to be 
learned in its chemistry and manufacture. Since the duty on 
barilla and other substances, in competition with kelp, has been 
taken off, its preparation has been almost laid aside, and its want 
is seriously felt. It is difficult to conjecture what other mo- 
tive, than a reckless adherence to the speculative dogma of Free 
trade, could have induced the British Legislature to inflict so 
severe a wound on the industry and resources of the Scottish 
islands, and which neither equity nor policy can honestly defend; 
much more oppressive and pernicious monopolies may take shelter 
under the mask of commercial freedom, than under the protective 
mantle of a prudent and patriotic government. Free trade is, af- 
ter all, only relative ; it has been imagined and described ; but 
when the globe shall become one vast Utopia, then only can we expect 
that its heau ideal will be realised. Among the advantages which 
Shetland might hope to derive from Legislative favour, a reduc- 
tion of the duties on timber generally, and particularly on boats 
from Norway, would be most valuable, and universally felt. These 
boats are imported in boards, and are of a class not in use in any

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



Other part of the kingdom ; hence no temptation to smuggling 
would exist. Another benefit would be a drawback on the duty 
of a limited quantity of tobacco, tea, and sugar, for the use of 
the fishermen, in the same manner as it is granted to merchant 
seamen. The mail-steamer running all the year throuo-h would 
also be a signal boon, as bringing Shetland completely within the 
vortex of the British market, and no satisfactory reason has yet been 
given why this advantage, often solicited, has been withheld. 
The Isles of Man and of the channel enjoy many peculiar and 
important privileges; distant colonies are pampered; and it might 
not be unreasonable to expect some fostering patronage and com- 
mercial indulgence to be extended to the long neglected Shetland 
Islands.
