<head>NUMBER I. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">LETHNOT</name>. 

(COUNTY OF FORFAR.) 
By the Rev. Mr John Taylor.</head> 



<p>Annexation and Situation. 

*7pHE pariflies of Navar and Lethnot, prior to the year 
1723, were two feparate charges : Before their union, 
the parifh of Lochlee and Lethnot were one charge. The 
mmifter refided at Lethnot, and preached two fabbaths at 
Lethnot, and the third at Lochlee. But, as Lochlee is dif- 
tant from Lethnot ten computed miles, and as the road was 
found always inconvenient, and often dangerous, efpecially 
in winter, it was judged proper by all concerned about the 
year 1723, to disjoin Lochlee from Lethnot, to make the 
VoL  IV « A former 



Statiflical Account 



former a feparate charge, and to annex Navar to the latter. 
Navar and Lethnot, thus united, lie in the county of Forfar, 
the prefbytery of Brechin, and the fynod of Angus and 
Mearns. They are furrounded by the Grampian hills 
on all fides, except towards the eaft, where there is a fmall 
opening, through which the Weft-water iflues, and the plain 
of the Mearns is feen. The only part of the Grampians, 
that lies to the fouth of them, is the hill of Caterthun, re- 
markable for having on its top the remains of a very anci- 
ent fortification. Oppofite to Caterthun, which is the high- 
eft top of a long ridge, running nearly from eaft by north 
to weft by fouth, are the Grampians on the north, nearly 
in a parallel direction to the long ridge of Caterthun, but 
much higher. Along the bottom of thefe, Navar and 
Lethnot are fituated, the breadth of the arable land from the 
bottom of Caterthun on the fouth to the uncultivated parts of 
the higher Grampians on the north, being nearly 3-4ths of a 
mile all along,. and the length about 5 miles. Lethnot, which 
lies eaftward, is bounded on that quarter by the parilh of 
Edzel, and part of the parifh of Stricathrow, on the fouth- 
eaft and fouth by the eaftern part of the ridge of Cater- 
thun, which feparates it from the parilh of Menmuir ; on 
the weft by the Weft-water, which feparates it from Navar ; 
and on the north, by that part of the Grampians, called the 
hill of Wirran, or the hill of fprhigs, (as the word Wirran is 
laid to fignify,) which feparates it from the parilh of Loch- 
lee. Navar is bounded on the fouth and fouth-weft by the 
weftern part of the ridge of Caterthun, which divides it 
from Menmuir ; on the weft it is feparated from the Glens 
of b ern, Tannadice, Cortachy and Clova, by a great extent 
of the Grampian mountains ; and towards the north, others 
of thefe mountains divide it from the parilh of Lochlee. 
But befides that part of the pprilhes, which is fituated as 
above defcribed, there is a confiderable number of fmall 

farms, 



of Lethnot. 



farms, which lie fcattered on the Weft-water and other 
fmall rivulets, extending a good way among the hills in a 
north-weft direction from the church of Lethnot, the moft 
diftant being upwards of five miles from it. 

Soil, Marl, &amp;c— The foil in both parifhes is various, fome 
of it is of a clay nature, fome a rich loam with a till bot- 
tom, and there is fome haugh ground adjacent to the Weft- 
water with a fandy bottom. The ancient name of the 
Weft-water was Dy ; it has its fource among the hills about 
twelve miles north-weft from the church of Lethnot, and it 
receives in its progrefs a great number of rapid rivulets. 
There are appearances . of unfliapely rocks here and there 
on its banks, and at one place there is found limeftone of a 
reddifti fandy nature, mixed with veins of freeftone. The 
farmers quarry the limeftone, and find it to anfwer well 
with their lands. But there is no freeftone quarry within 
the parifhes, and though fome of the rocks, which feem in 
general to be compofed of what is commonly called fcurdy 
Jlone, might anfwer for building, yet there is no quarry of 
them opened for that purpofe. There is in the hill of Wir- 
ran, a fpecies of rock of a bluifh colour, and of a very fine 
texture, very like to that of the fmall blue dates, from which 
the farmers quarry lintels for doors and windows. They 
can have thefe pieces almoft of any length and breadth they 
pleafe ; but as the rock is at fome diftance, it is feldom 
wrought. What is of greater confequence to fome of the 
farms of the parifhes is a vein of clay or rock marl, which 
runs from the eaft end of Lethnot to the weft of Navar, in 
aline nearly eaft by north to weft by fouth. This vein ex- 
tends beyond the boundaries of the parifhes. It is found 
on the lands of Balfour at the diftance of five miles eaft, and 
it is found a little north of the Houfe of Fafque, the feat of 
Sir Alexander Ramfay, at the diftance of feven miles from 

this

Statijlical Account 



this place. A great quantity, no lefs than 300 of our cart- 
loads are neceffary to manure an acre. But when it is put 
on in fufficient quantity, it is far preferable to lime, its vir- 
tue remaining for many years. It is of dhTerent colours, 
fome bluifh, and fome purplifh mixed with veins of a cream 
colour. It effervefces, like limeftone, with aqua fortis, and 
anfwers beft with thin dry land. However it can be of ufe to 
the adjoining farms only, becaufe with refpedt to thofe at 
the diftance of a mile or two from the pit, the expence and 
labour would exceed the profit. It is found at fix, eight, 
and in fome places ten feet below the furface. It is laid on 
ley and fpread in fummer, and continues to incorporate 
with the furface during the winter-rains and froft, and the 
field is broken up in fpring for oats. 

Mineral fprings.- — There is a great number of mineral 
fprings within the parifhes, all of a chalybeate nature ; fome 
of them are ftrong, and prove beneficial in complaints of the 
ftomach and gravel. People of the neighbourhood frequent- 
ly vifit them ; but there is no refort to them by perfons at 
a diftance, though it is believed they would prove as falu- 
tary in fome complaints as the wells of Pananach, which 
are in high repute. 

FiJJj. — In moft of the fmall rivulets, which fall into the 
Weft-water, there is trout of the common kind ; and in the 
Weft-water itfelf, there are three fpecies of frefli water 
trout ; xjl, Thofe of the common kind about eight or nine 
inches long ; idly, The yellowifh trout confiderably larger ; 
and $dly, A fpecies of trout called Par, about the fize of a 
common burn trout, with a fmall head, and fides beautiful- 
ly clouded. Befides the above kinds, there are alfo fea- 
trouts, which come up from the fea in May, from one to 
two pounds weight. There is likewife plenty of fmouts, 

(as  



of Lethnot. 



5 



(as they are commonly called) or fmelts, which are a (len- 
der clear-Jkinned fpecies of trout about eight or nine inch- 
es long : They are fuppofedby fome to be young fea-trout, 
but their flefli is white, whereas that of the. fea-tr.out is red- 
dilh like falmon. 

Dijlempers.—On account of our being furrounded by 
high hills, we are expofed to frequent and ftrong gufts of 
wind, by which the atmoiphere is kept pure and healthy. 
The diftempers moft prevalent are inflammatory and pleu- 
rify fevers, owing to the frequent and hidden changes of 
the weather, and to the peoples being expofed to hard exer- 
cife, wet clothes, and a fudden flopping of the perfpiration. 
There is a diftemper, called by the country-people the leap- 
ing ague, and by phyficians, St Vitus's chuicc, which has pre- 
vailed ocean onally for upwards of 6c years in thefe parifhes, 
and fome of the neighbouring ones. The patient flvft com- 
plains of a pain in the head, and in the lower part of the 
back -, to this fucceed convullive fits, or fits of dancing at cer- 
tain periods. This difeafe appears to be hereditary in fome 
families. When the fit of dancing, leaping or running fei- 
zes the patient, nothing tends more to abate the violence of 
the difeafe, than the allowing him free fcope to exercife 
himfelf in this manner till nature be exhaufted. Another 
diflemper, with which the conftitution of fome families here 
is tainted, is the fcrofula or king's evil, owing very pro- 
bably to cold, and to a poor aliment. But in general the 
climate feems favourable to longevity. Within thefe lafl: 
1 6 years, four perfons have died, who were above 90 ; one 
of them was 106. 

Population. — Dr Webfter's ftate of the population about 40 
years ago was 635 fouls. The number of people has decreafed 
confiderably within thefe lafl 20 years. In 1777 and 1778, the 

number 



G 



Statijlical Account 



number was 555, of whom 268 were males, 287 were fe- 
males, 65 were under fix years of age, 99 were under ioyears, 
50 were Nonjurors, and 2 were Bereans. But in 1790, 
the number was only 505, of which 256 were males, 249 
were females, 62 were under fix, and 98 under ten. There 
are at prefent fix tailors, feven weavers, two fmiths, and 
two wrights, within the pariihes. In 1790, the number of 
Nonjurors, or more properly now, Epifcopalians,was 56. The 
caufe of the diminution of the number of people is, that in 
no lefs than fix cafes, two farms have, within thefe four- 
teen years, been joined into one. Befides the number of 
fubtenants is alfo confiderably diminiflied. There were fix- 
teen houfes, then inhabited by fubtenants, which are now 
ruinous. In fome cafes, the pofleffors, being old people, 
died out ; and in others, the farmers chofe to have their 
pofTeffion of land in their own hand, becaufe they could 
turn it to more advantage ; befides they wiflied to leflen 
the number of their fubtenants, becaufe they found it in- 
convenient to lead fuel to them, and to perform other fti- 
pulated fervices. The diminifhing of the number of fub- 
tenants and the uniting of farms, it is prefumed, is an evil 
not peculiar to this corner. The confequence is, that there 
is, and has been for fome time, a great difficulty in procu- 
ring fervants.

In the year 1778, there were 119 inhabited houfes ; but 
in 1790, the number was only 103. The- number of mar- 
ried perfons or couples in 1778, was 85 ; in 1790, the 
number was 74. There were 15 bachelors, widowers in- 
cluded, keeping houfes by themfelves, and for the moft part 
old men, in the year 1778. The number of perfons of the 
fame defcription in the year 1790 was 13. As to the num- 
ber of children produced by marriages, there are many in- 
flances here, when young people marry, and are in eafy 
circumftances, of their having eight children ; many where 
there are ten children, and fome where there are thirteen. 
Bat when people advanced in life marry, the number of 
children is two or three, and fometimes none. Many of our 
young people remove from the parilhes, but not for want 
of employment. They get higher wages to the fouthward, 
and fome remove for the fake of learning, a particular trade

or art, as their genius leads them. None have periflied 
from want, lince the end of the laft century, when there 
were feven years of general fcarcity, and when fome per- 
fons were found dead with cabbage, kail-roots, &amp;c. in their 
mouths. 

Sheep.— The number of ilheep is about 6770, of lambs 
1256. But as a great- number of lambs perifti through the 
weaknefs of the ewes, owing to fevere .winters and fprings, 
there are brought annually from the fouthern counties about 
678, part of them lambs, :but for the moft part year-olds, 
becaufe thefe laft ftand the winter better. Hence the an- 
nual increafe arifing from lambs produced at home, and 
from thofe brought from the fouth, is about 1934. But of 
thefe generally one third is deftroyed, before they come to 
full maturity, fome by- foxes, fome by fevere winters and 
fprings, fome are amiffing, and many are cut off by a dif- 
eafe, which is here called the Braxes. Hence it happens, 
that the fale of old flieep annually amounts only to 2~3ds of 
1934, that is 1289. The fouth country, or what is here 
called the Yarrow brood, are of a larger fize than the na- 
tive kind, and bring a higher price from the butcher ; but 
their wool is much coarfer. There is now fuch a mixture 
of the two breeds, that, hardly any of the native kind are 
to be found pure. The wool of the native-kind, feveral 
years ago, ufed to fell at 1 s. 3 l.Jer lb., and at.prefentit 
eafily brings that price, when pure ; while that of the Yar- 
row breed brings only iod. ornd. The pound con- 
fifts of 24 ounces Englifli. Many of our farmers begin to 
think that they would have acled more wifely,, had they en- 
couraged their own native breed : for they find, in the 7%/? 
place, that the Yarrow breed requires much more pafture ; 
idly, That they do not ftand the winter fo well ; and, ^dty, 
That their wool is of a much coarfer quality. A wedder

of the native breed when full grown, fells at ios. 6d. or 
lis. and the Yarrow kind brings 14 or 15 s. It is obser- 
ved here, that the nature of the fheep's pafture greatly af- 
fefts the wool. A farm where there is much wet marfhy 
ground, and that rough kind of grafs which grows on fuch 
ground, always produces coarfe wool. 

The fineft wool is produced, where the fheep have young 
tender heath, and thort fweet grafs to feed upon. 

The difeafe formerly mentioned under the name of 
Braxes, in this place, proves fatal to many of the young 
flieep. It feizes them towards the end of harveft, when 
they are in beft condition, and the moll thriving are cut off 
by it. When their bodies are opened, the blood is found 
extravafated in their bowels, and in a putrid ftate. It ap- 
pears to be infectious ; for when the difeafe begins, num- 
bers perilh, and they are cut off by a fhort illnefs. No me- 
thod is found fo effectual for Mopping the progrefs of the 
malady, as removing the flieep to a pafture at fome diftance. 
When the young fheep are carried to a diftant pafture, it 
is fome time before they become acquainted with it, fo that 
for a few days at leaft, they muft be but half-fed. This 
confideration induced an ingenious man in a neighbouring 
parilh, to confine his young fheep a good part of every day 
within their pens, at the time when the Braxes began to 
make its appearance, that they might be prevented from 
filling their ftomachs, when attacked by it, and this precau- 
tion had the delired effecl; in laving their lives. There 
are others who fay, that they have tried this precaution 
without fuccefs. 

Horfes and black cattle. — The number of horfes within 
fheparifhes is 147 ; many of them are of a fmall frze, only 
a little larger than the Shetland breed. The number of 
black cattle is 601. The number of calves reared annually 

Vol. IV. B is

is about 130; but befides thefe, there are between two 
and three dozen fed for the butcher. 

Heritors, farms, l$c. — The heritors of Navar and Leth- 
not, are three in number, none of whom relide. The valu- 
ed rent is L. 103 1 : 13 : 9 Scots : The real rent is about 
L. 410 Sterling. The proprietor of the greateft eftate gave 
leafes (a little after 1760) to all the tenants in the lower part 
of the parifhes for two nineteen years and a life ; and for 
one nineteen and a life, to thofe in the upper or more hilly 
part of the eftate, obliging the tenants to carry on certain 
pieces of improvement fpecified in their leafes. They became 
obliged to build fubftantial houfes on their refpeftive farms, 
to inclofe a certain portion of the farm, to bring in and im- 
prove baulks, and fuch pieces of wafte ground as were fit 
for improvement, and to plant an acre, or half an acre, ac- 
cording to the fize of the farm, of young trees in fome 
convenient place, and to keep a fufRcient fence around them 
till grown up. Some of the tenants have completely ful- 
filled thefe ftipulations. All the farms are fet upon mode- 
rate terms, fome at 7 s. per acre, fome at 5 s. and fome as 
low as 1 s. 4 d. Their fize is very various ; fome confift of 
30 acres, fome of 50, fome of 80 ; there is one of icd acres, 
and another of 160. The rent of thofe farms which He 
in the lower part of the parifhes, is made to rife at the end 
of every nineteen years of the leafe. Thus the farm of 160 
acres, which paid L. 33, for the firft nineteen, pajw now ■ 
yearly during the currency of the fecond nineteen L. 39, 
and is bound to pay for the firft nineteen of the life L. 45. 

All the tenants have already increafed the value of their 
farms very confiderably by improvements, and by bring- 
ing wafte ground into cultivation : But there is ftill a good 
deal of wafte ground on moft of the farms, which will re- 
quire the induftry of many years fully to improve. Moft 
of the larger farms confift of what was formerly two farms.

Agriculture.— -The number of acres arable, may be efti- 
mated at 1200. Of thefe about 400 are allotted to oats, 
200 for Chefter bear, 30 for peafe, about an equal number 
for turnips, potatoes and cabbage ; all the reft lie in grafs, 
about 144 acres being fown with red clover, white clover, 
and rye-grafs. The number of ploughs is 28 ; but about 30 
or 40 years ago, the number was upwards of 40. The caufe 
of the decreafe is, that in many instances, two farms have 
been joined into one fince that period, and befides, in the hil- 
ly part of the pariflies, feveral farms which were formerly in 
cultivation, are at prefent lying in grafs, and meant to be kept 
in that ftate, as pafture for cattle and flieep. Twenty-eight 
ploughs, indeed, are more than fufficient for all the labour ; 
tho' on the larger farms there is work enough for the ploughs 
employed. On a fmall farm of 18 or 20 acres, one plough 
of four fmall horfes is more than enough ; fo that the unit- 
ing of fmall farms, which lie contiguous, may be fometimes 
conlidered as a wife plan, and as tending to the advantage 
of the country, at leaft in refpedt of the landlord. 

"Within thefe laft 30 years, the art of farming is greatly 
improved in this place. It is only about 20 years ago, that 
the farmers began to clean their land by fowing turnip, and 
to fow grafs feeds. Since that period there has been a great 
fpirit of induftry and improvement. As lime anfwers well 
with their land, they have been in the pradlice for feveral 
years of bringing it from a great diftance. Some of them 
bring it at leaft 12 ftatute miles. Hence the quantity of 
grain produced at prefent is far greater than what was pro- 
duced 30 years ago. At prefent the pariflies can fpare an- 
nually, at an average, about 500 bolls, part in oats and oat- 
meal ; but the greateft part, bear in grain, which is carried 
to Brechin and Montrofe. The beginning of our feed-time 
here is very various, owing to the fpring fhow lying long 
aear the bottom of the hills. Generally we begin to fow oats 

before 



12 



Statijlical Account 



before the middle of March, and bear about the middle of 
April. In the years 1782, 1785, 1788, and 1789, April 
was begun, and the firft eight days of it near gone, before 
there was any fowing here. But in 1787, 1790, and 1791, 
fome of our farmers began to fow peafe and oats in Februa- 
ry, and all of them in the firft and fecond week of March. 

The beginning of harveft here is alfo various. Generally 
it begins about the firft or fecond week of September, and 
is finiflxed before the firft of November, and all the corns 
got in. But in the year 1782, there was no reaping till 
the 3d of Oftober, and it was the 20th of November before 
all the corns were got in. Crop 1782 in this place, as in 
the greateft part of the kingdom, turned out very unpro- 
ductive. The fnow and froft came on before the corns 
were ripened. However, with what the people had refer- 
ved of the former crop, and with the fcanty fupply which 
crop 1782 afforded, they were able to fubfift till crop 1783 
came in aid, without feeking any afiiftance from abroad ; or 
at leaft, if a fmall portion of meal was brought from Mon- 
trofe, and fome bolls of feed-oats bought, there was more 
fold out of the parifties, to people who came from Dee fide, 
and other places. It is the praftice of many in thefe parifties 
to have their girnals or meal-chefts always pretty full, that 
they may be prepared againft a bad crop. Experience has 
taught them this precaution, becaufe the harvefts here are 
often precarious, and the corns fuffer either by wind, or by 
the winter coming on before they are fully ripened. There 
is but little flax raifed here. It does not generally ripen fuf- 
ficiently, to tempt a farmer to rife many acres on its culti- 
vation. Yet moft of the farmers in the lower part of the 
parifties fow a peck or two for the ufe of their own families, 
and they reckon it a tolerable crop, if they have between 
two and three ftone after the peck of lintfeed. The ftone 

confifts

confifts of 24 lb. EngHfh, or 1% lb. Arnflerdam. There is 
no common pafture except the hills. 

Difadvantages. — Among the difadvantages to which this 
place is expofed, may be reckoned a long continuance of 
fnow in the fpring, by which the operations of husbandry 
are interrupted, and the feed-time retarded ; and on this 
account, our corns are but feldom fo well ripened as thofe 
in the low country. While good oats in the low country 
yield fixteen pecks of meal per boll, we reckon them good 
here, if they yield fifteen. The winters here are always 
more fevere than in the low country, and our farmers are 
cften interrupted in their operations by ftorms, while thofe 
to the fouthward of the hills can plow and cart. Befides 
they frequently fufFer very confiderably in fevere winters 
and fprings by the lofs of meep and lambs. Our diftance 
from Brechin, which is the neareft market-town being 
five computed miles, and the road acrofs the fteep hill of 
Caterthun, often rendered impaffable for horfes by the 
Ihow, may be reckoned another difadvantage under which 
this country labours. 

Stipend, ifc. — The ftipend is L. 51, 19 s. Sterling, and 
16 bolls oatmeal. The glebe may be eftimated now at 
five guineas yearly. The church is probably two or three 
hundred years old. It was covered with lead until the 
year 1742, and then flated. A minifter of the pariih, fo 
many years ago, that neither his name nor the period of 
his incumbency is remembered, lived and died a bachelor, 
and having money, he bequeathed it to cover the church 
with lead. It is faid, that his body lies interred in a ftone 
coffin in the eaft end of the church. As to the manie, it 
is but a modern edifice. It was built about the 172,3. The 
King is patron of the parifh. 

School. 



14 



Statiflical Account 



School. — There are two fchools within the parilhes ; the 
eftablifhed fchool, and another founded on private donation. 
The parifli fchoolmafter's living confifts of 100 merits Scots, 
paid by the heritors and tenants, fees for baptifms, marria- 
ges, and fchool-fees, and may be eftimated at L. n or L. 12. 
For a few months in winter, .the number of fcholars is 
fometimes above 40, but through the fpring and fummer, 
only about a dozen attend the fchool. Reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, are the only branches taught. The other 
fchool, which is fixed on the Weft-water about four com- 
puted miles from the former-, is kept only during the win- 
ter half-year. This fchool was firft eretted about 1750, and 
a fund of 500' merits Scots, appointed for fupporting a teach- 
er, which fund, about two years ago, received an addition 
of L. 20 Sterling. 

Poor. — Our number of poor at prefent is eight. They 
are fupplied by our Sabbath-colle&amp;ions, and the intereft of 
a fund of L. 460, a provifion abundantly fufficient to anfwer 
all reafonable demands. Our weekly collections have been 
continuing to rife gradually for fome years. Our funds 
being fo confiderable, we judged it improper to apply for 
any of the Government's bounty in 1783. About 50 
years ago, it was common for upwards of 20 young people 
belonging to the parilhes to go a-begging in the winter- 
feafon for want of employment and fupport ; whereas at 
prefent the farmers find it very difficult to procure either 
at home, or from a diftance, a fufficiency of young people 
to ferve them. There is not a perfon belonging to thefe 
parilhes permitted at prefent to go a-begging. 

Prices. — The price of an ox, 40 or 50 years ago, was 
L. 2, 10 ; fuch an ox would now fell at L. 6, 15. An 
old ewe fold formerly at is. 1 d, 5 fuch an ewe would now 

fell

fell at 4 s. 6d. or 5 s. A good wedder fold formerly at 
3 s. 6d. or 4 s. i fach a wedder would now give 11s. Mut- 
ton and beef fold formerly at 1 d. per lb. ; it now fells at 
4 d. Sheep were formerly cotted or lodged in a houfe fum- 
mer and winter, a mode of treatment much againft their 
profperity. Cattle were formerly fed on bear-chaff and 
bear-mag, by which is meant the refufe of the bear which 
did not ftand the wind ; at prefent they are fed on turnips, 
hay and Iheaves of fliort oats. A good hen fold formerly 
at 4d.; fuch a hen would at prefent bring 10 d. Butter 
fold formerly at 4 d. per lb. ; it now brings 9 d. The 
pound here is 22 oz. Amfterdam, or 24 oz. Englilh. A 
ftone of cheefe weighing 22 lb. Amfterdam, or 24 lb. 
Englilh, fold formerly at 3 s. ; it now brings 5 s. and 5s. 6d. 
A boll of oats with fodder fold formerly at* 11s. rfd. ; 
it now fells at 15 s. A boll of bear in grain fold formerly 
at 7s. -, it now fells at 13 s. A boll of oat meal fold for- 
merly at 8 s. 4 d. •, (during the years of fcarcity indeed, in 
the end of the laft century, meal fold at 20 d. per peck ;) 
a boll of oat meal fells now at 13 s. 4 d. Our boll is 
8 ftone Amfterdam. 

Wages, i£c. — A labouring man's wages per day about 
40 years ago, were 2 d. and his meat •, his wages at prefent 
are 6 d. and his meat. The wages of a hireman, that is, 
a man-fervant hired for the half year, capable to hold the 
plough, and work with horfes, were formerly 16 s. 8d. ; 
fuch a man's wages now are L. 3, or L. 3, 10 s. A maid- 
fervant's wages formerly were, for the fummer half year, 
10 s. with bounties, by which is meant, an ell of linen, an 
apron and a ftiirt : Her wages for the winter half year 
were 5 s. with fame bounties ; the reafon why her wages 
were higher in fummer, was, becaufe {he reaped in harveft ; 
a maid-fervant's wages at prefent, for the fummer half year, 

are 



1 6 Statijlical Account 

are L. i, 5 s. with bounties of an ell of linen, apron and fhirt 
befides, me alfo ftipulates for a week to herfelf, during 
which fhe goes to her parents houfe and works for herfelf, 
and is allowed a peck of meal for maintenance during that 
week. Her wages for the winter half year are L. 1, with 
fame bounties, week and meal. A tailor's wages formerly 
were 2d. and meat ; they are now 6d. and meat. A wea- 
ver formerly charged at the rate of 1 d. per ell, for wea- 
ving cloth of a certain fpecies •, he now charges 3 d. per ell 
for fimilar cloth. A pair of coarfe fhoes formerly coft 1 s. ; 
fuch kind of fhoes now fell at 3 s. 

In this place, the common labourers, when married, 
have a fmall fettlement from a farmer, of about one and 
an half, or two acres, fufficient to maintain two cows and 
24 flieep ; the farmer does all neceffary work for the land, 
in way of tilling, harrowing, leading home the corns, and 
bringing a certain quantity of fuel from the hills. The 
fubtenant is always bound to ferve the farmer in harveft, 
and in the winter half year. The encouragement given him, 
upon the whole, is fuch as may enable him to bring up a 
family without afliflance from the poors funds. Though he 
have a riling family of fix children, the eldeft under twelve, 
it would be thought ftrange here, while he, his wife and 
children were well, if he mould defire any fupply. When 
the fcheme of the fituation of the labouring, poor in Eng- 
land is confidered, there occurs only one cafe in which a 
fupply would be judged neceffary here. The cafe is where 
the woman is deferted by her hufband, and left with fix 
children, four of them being too young to earn any thing : 
It is to be obferved that children in this place become ufe- 
ful at eight or nine years of age : During hammer they are 
employed as herds by fubtenants. Thus their parents are 
freed from the charge of their maintenance ; belides they 
get a fmall fee of about j s. It is to be obferved alfo, that a 

woman's 



of Lethnot. 



17 



woman's work in this country turns to more account than 
it appears to do in England, and our mode of living is lefs 
expenfive. Such a woman as is mentioned in the above cafe, 
could gain, in this country, in the way of fpinning, about 
18 d. a-week, and manage her family-concerns. The 
young girls in this country, by the time they are 13 
or 14 years old, can fpin 5 or 6 hafps of yarn in the 
week: A woman that has nothing to interrupt her, 
fpins about 12 hafps; the price for fpinning a hafp is 
3 d. Poor people here, inftead of tea, fugar and butter, 
live commonly on pottage and milk. It is only old, in- 
firm or difeafed people, who are unable to work, and the 
ordinary poor, who receive fupport from the poors funds. 
As for tradefmen and artifans, they have fmall fet- 
tlements from the farmers, of about 2 acres each : They 
are generally bound to reap in harveft, and for fome 
days work in the bufieft time of fummer. Upon the whole, 
by the accommodation of their fmall fettlements, and the 
profits of their occupations, they are enabled' to live com- 
fortably, and to bring up families. The lower clais of peo- 
ple here, as well as thofe above them, are, in general, fober, 
induftrious and frugal; and but few of them fail in early 
life to make provifion for the infirmities of old age. 

Antiquities, &amp;c. — The remains of what is fuppofed to have 
been a Druidical temple, ftill appear near the bottom of 
the hill of Wirran in Lethnot, and it is faid that there 
were formerly to be feen, the remains of other two in Na- 
var. Though at prefent there is but very little wood in 
the parifties, it is plain that there muft have been a good 
deal long ago, becaufe in many places where peats 
Vol. IV. C are 



i8 



Statijlical Account 



are found, large trunks of black oak are alfo difco- 
vered. 

Eminent Perfons. — Among thofe worthy of being men- 
tioned, James Black deferves a place. This man, born in 
1677, though his ftation was originally mean, raifed him- 
felf by his prudence and induftry, and did more fervice 
to his country than many of high rank and opulent 
fortunes. During his life he procured the building of 
the Gannachy bridge on the North Efk, and contributed 
almoft all the money that was neceflary for that purpofe ; 
a bridge which at this day could not he built for lefs than 
L. 160 •, and at his death he left 50 merks Scots as a fund 
for its fupport, befides 1000 merks, for other ufeful and 
pious purpofes, viz. 300 merks towards building a bridge 
at Balrownie, on the road that leads from this place to Bre- 
chin; as alfo 200 merks for the 'poor in the parifli of Fet- 
tercairn, and 500 merks for fupporting a fchool in the 
Weft-water, which has been already mentioned. On his 
tomb-ftone the following infcription is engraved. 

No bridge on earth can be a pafs to heaven, 
To generous deeds let yet due praife be given. 

Fuel. — The general fuel of the parilhes is turf, peat and 
heath. The providing of fuel here, is a work of 
great expence and labour, on account of the fteepnefs 
of the hills, and the diftance of the mofly ground. Ma- 
ny of the farmers, and many alfo of the fubtenants find 
it expedient to bring yearly a few coals from the port o 
Montrofe, diftant 10 computed miles, which may be rec- 
koned equal to 15 ftatute miles. The boll there, weigh- 
ing

ing 70 Hone Amfterdam, cofts about 8 s. On account of 
the high cuftom-houfe duty at Montrofe, our people go 
fometimes to Arbroath, which is at leaft 4 ftatute miles 
farther diftant, where the coals are fold from 18 d. to 2 s.- 
cheaper the boll. It is furely partial, and therefore im- 
politic, to make the duty on coals higher at Montrofe 
than at Arbroath. 

Roads cuid Bridges. — The roads within the parilhes, though 
greatly improved within thefe laft 20 years, are ftill but 
indifferent. The people are very fenfible of the advantage 
of good roads ; this indeed may be always expected to be 
the cafe,- where a fpirit of induftry and improvement pre- 
vails. The ftatute-labour is exacted and allotted to roads 
within the paritb.es, and fometimes to that great road with- 
out the parilhes, which leads to Brechin. There are no 
turnpike roads within the parilhes. There are no lefs than 
7 bridges within the parimes, 2 of them of about 5c feet 
fpan each. There does not feem any occafion for more. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . — Within thefe laft 50 years, 
a great alteration has taken place in the manners, drefs, and 
way of living of the people in this place. About 50 or 60 
years ago, there was neither a fpinning wheel nor a reel 
within the parilhes. The rock and the fpindle were then 
ufed, by which aw oman could fpin at an average only %~

the hand-reel, a machine equally flow for work. A woman 
can with as much eafe at this day, fpin 12 hiers, as a woman 
could have fpun 3^ hiers then. A hier is 240 threads, or 
rounds of the reel, each of them 91 inches long. About 
50 years ago, neither buckles were ufed for flipes, nor metal 
buttons for clothes. There were then very few carts with-

in the parifhes. Loads were then carried on horfeback. 
Prior to the 1745, there was not a tea-kettle within the 
parifties, except the minifter's ; now there is not a farm- 
houfe without one, and feveral of the fubtenants ufe 
the fame piece of furniture. Formerly there was little 
beef or mutton ufed. Even a farmer's family thought 
themfelves fufficiently provided in flefh-meat with one 
old ewe killed about Chriftmas. For fuch a family at pre- 
fent 16 ftone of beef, and 2 good fheep are confidered 
as a moderate provilion. About 20 years ago, neither 
barn nor mill fanners for cleaning victual were to be 
feen ; at prefent each of the three mills has a fet of fan- 
ners, and there are but very few farmers, whofe barns are 
not furnifhed with the fame ufeful machine. There has 
alfo been within thefe 4 or 5 years, a barley-mill erec- 
ted, much to the convenience of the neighbourhood. For- 
merly the people, efpecially fuch as were wealthy, lived 
frequently in fear left their houfes mould be broken, and 
their property plundered ; at prefent they live fo fecure in 
fome places, that, as is faid, they are feldom at the pains to, 
bolt the door under night.

NUMBER II, 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34779">DUNBARTON</name>. 
(County of Dunbarton.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Oliphant.</head>

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, &amp;c. 

THE ancient name of the parifli was Dun britton,i Gaelic 
compound, fignifying " the fortification of the Bri- 
** tons whence it appears that the cattle has given name 
to the parifli. This cattle, fituated on a moft remarkable 
bitopped infulated rocky hill, at the junction of the Clyde 
and Leven, is too well known to be particularly mentioned 
here. The parifli lies in the county of Dunbarton, is the 
feat of a prefbytery, and belongs to the Synod of Glafgow 
and Ayr. The form is nearly circular, extending in length 
from 2 to 3 miles, and in breadth from i to i. Great 
part of the parifli is flat, the remainder afcends gradual- 
ly to the neighbouring hills, with a fouthern expofure. The 
parifli is bounded by the frith of Clyde on the fouth, the 
water of Leven and parifli of Cardrofs on the weft, the parilh 
of Bonhill on the north, and that of Weft Kilpatrick on, 
the eaft. 

Soil, ifc. — The foil is fertile, but rather {hallow. The air 
falubrious, excepting at times when a heavy fog rifes from 
and hovers over the Clyde and Leven. Fevers prevail very 
much. Many die of confumptions, and the natural fmall 
pox is very mortal. The fpreading and mortality of thefe 

difeafes 



22 



Statiftical Account 



difeafes are to be attributed to ill-aired and crowded low 
houfes, and to an over anxiety for conftanc prayers over 
the difeafed. 

Rivers andfifo. — The Levenis navigable bycoafting vef- 
fels above the town of Dunbarton ; fo far up the tides rife. 
Salmon and trout are taken in large quantities. The former 
frequently fells fo high as i s. 6 A. per lb. tron, on the fpot, 
feldom falls below 6 d, and never below 4 d. Through the 
whole fpring feafon, the Leven falmon is excellent, but the 
Clyde is not fifhed before Whitfunday. Trout generally 
fells at 4 d. per pound. Very large eels, and a large fpe- 
cies of flounder, are often caught by the falmon-filhers. 
A fpecies of fea animals, mod deftru&amp;ive of the fal- 
mon, are almoft every fummer feafori found in num- 
bers, playing in the Clyde off the caftle ; they go up fome- 
times two miles higher, but generally keep lower down. 
Thefe are called buckers, pellocks, or porpoifes. The fal- 
mon fifhery employs 16 men. 

Population. — According to the returns made from hence 
to Dr Webfter about 1750, this parifh then contained 1427 
fouls. In 1790, the number of examinable perfons above 
fix years of age was found to amount to about 2000 
(103 above 70 years of age, and two near 100,) of whom 
1850 refided in the town of Dunbarton, and 153 in the 
country part of the parifh. In that year 86 were baptifed 

were buried, and 30 couples married. From the regi- 
flers, it appears, that in 1644, 44 died; in 1654,33, in 
1664,42: In 1690,73 were baptifed, 50 died, and 12 
couples were married. The increafe of population is to be 
attributed to the eftablifhment of glafs-works in the town, 
and of printfields in the neighbourhood. AlmoJl the whole 

of

of the inhabitants are of the eftablilhed church, there not 
being above half a dozen feceders in the parilh. 

Manufacltires. — The minifter's daughters manufacture 
mins thread to a great extent. There is in the town a con- 
fiderable crown and bottle glafs manufactory, which em- 
ploys 130 hands, and pays L. 3,800 per annum, of duties to 
Government. The extenfive printfields in the neighbour- 
ing parilhes employ about 86 inhabitants of the town of 
Dunbarton. 

"Town of Dunbarton. — This town was erected into a royal 
burgh by King Alexander the II. in 122 1 ; it lies on the 
eaft bank of. the Leven, has a good harbour, where large 
brigs lie fafe in all weathers. About 2,000 tons of hupping 
belong to this place, which employ 70 feamen. The town 
is entirely free of all imports or borough taxes ; but is by no 
means in a flourilhing or increaling Itate, owing to the let- 
ters of deaconry preventing (hangers from working at their 
trades, without coitly entries. Several families have remo- 
ved from Dunbarton to Rentou, Bonhill, and other new 
villages, to be nearer the printfields where they are em- 
ployed. There are about 130 handy-craftfmen, freemen of 
the burgh, befides the mafters of the tailor, hammerman, 
ihoemaker, weaver, and cooper trades. 

Heritors, ifc— There are in the parim 52 heritors, about 
40 of whom refide; 21 farmers, befides feveral fmali p or . 
tioners, 130 handicraftfmen, 78 apprentices and journey- 
men, 2 ftudents of divinity, 1 minifter, 7 attomies, and 3 
furgeons.

the ground may be in fown grafs and paflure, about ioa 
acres in growing woods and planting, and there may be 
200 acres of commonty belonging to the town, to which 
the burgeues may fend their cows or horfes for about 7 s. 
a year. The parifh does not fupply the tenth part of the 
provifions confumed in it. Great quantities of corn, meal 
and butter, are imported from Ireland, and of cheefe from 
Ayrlhire. Eggs are generally fold at 4 d. the dozen, butter 
9d. the pound, beef 6d. mutton 6d. hens is. each. 

Wheat is fown in October, November, December, or 
even January, and reaped generally in Auguft. Oats are 
fown from the end of March, to the middle of April, and 
reaped the end of Auguft, September, fometimes not till the 
beginning of October. Barley is fown the end of May, or 
beginning of June, and reaped in Auguft or September. 

Rent. — Houfe rent is not low. The town's fifhing oh 
the Leven yields at prefent a rent of L. 55, and on the 
Clyde, of L. 23 yearly The laft fet. yielded L. 140 a 
year, and thefe fiihings were once let fo high as L. 300 
a-year. Small parcels of land are often transferred. A 
piece of ground of four acres, lately fold here, brought a 
price of L. 472 ; but that was a lingular cafe. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally ufed is coal, brought from 
Glafgow or Knightswocd, four miles below that town : 
A cart of coals, containing 12 cwt. cofts 3s. 6d. ready 
money at Glafgow, pays 1 s. i| d. of freight and dues, for 
deepening the Clyde, and r-|d. cartage from the quay, total 
4 s. 9^ d. Peats are dear, 2 s. the fmall cart, and only ufed 
for kindling the fire. 

Stipend, ifc. — The right of patronage to the church lies 
in the magiftrates and town-council ; the fiipend is, 100 

bolls 



of Dunbar ton. 



bolls of meal, 20 bolls of barley, 6 ftone of falmon, and L. 27 
in money, with L. 7 in lieu of a glebe. There never was 
a legal manfe here. Mr William Blair, who was minifter 
here in 1620, bequeathed a houfe for the refidence of his 
fucceflbrs in office in all time coming, on condition of the 
town-council's upholding the fame. This houfe was after- 
wards exchanged for a better, and the laft for one ftill more 
fo, above L. 150 having been given by the town for the 
excambions. The council alfo pay for communion-ele- 
ments, and for the whole reparations of the minifter's houfe, 
and of the fchool. The church and church-yard walls are 
kept in repair by the kirk-feflion. 

Poor.— The number of poor receiving alms is about 70 -, 
the annual amount of contributions at the church-doors, for 
their fupport, is L. 53 or L. 54 •, the hire of the mort-cloths 
produces L. 7 or L. 8 j about L. 6, 6s. are received hy the 
publication of banns, and about L. 9 from the rent of feats 
in the church. Befides thefe, a large fum was bequeathed 
in 1660, by Sir John Buchanan of that ilk, to the poor of 
the parifli : Several loflea from the principal have been fuf- 
tained, but there ftill remains L. 851, the intereft of which 
(excepting L. 10, paid to two public fchoolmafters,) is re- 
ligioufly applied to the relief of the poor. Sir James Smol- 
let of Bonhill in 1732, mortified 50 merks a-year, to he 
diftributed immediately after the facrament, to fuch of the 
poor as were communicants. The whole annual diftribu 
tions amount to above L. 110. 

Prices of Labour. — Common labourers receive is. a- 
day; carpenters is. 8d. ; mafons fometimes is.:; joiners 
is. 6d. ; tailors 8 d. and victuals •, linen-printers common- 
ly earn 21 s. a-week, not including extra work-, many of 
the glafs-houfe men 25 s. a-week ; girls flowering muflin can 

Vol. IV. D make 



26 



Statijiical Account, Wc. 



make i s. a-day and upwards. Male-fervants wages in ge- 
neral are high •, female -fervants receive generally 30 s. the 
half year, and fome of them more. Common labourers 
may bring up their familiesc omfortably, if;they are induft- 
rious and temperate. 

Advantages and Li/advantages. — It is very advantageous 
to the heritors and their tenants, that being fo near a fea- 
port town, they have high prices, in ready money, for e- 
very thing they raife, and are employed with their horfes, 
almoft as often as they chufe, or can be fpared from hus- 
bandry. There are excellent roads through all the parifh 
made by the military, and no turnpikes, except one on 
the way to Glafgow. School fees are very low, fo that almoft 
every perfon has an opportunity of following any branch 
of learning. Packers fail every day to Greenock and Port 
Glafgow •, and a ftage-coach fets out three, times a-week to 
Glafgow. The chief difadvantage is the high price of 
fuel. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatio?is. — The people are very fond of 
a fea-faring life-, many enlift in the army, chiefly in the 
artillery, and in the highland regiments. The advantages 
of fociety are enjoyed ; but here, as in many other pla- 
ces, a murmuring fpirit often appears, and a difpofition 
to cenfure public meafures. Many of the people are, 
expenfive, efpecially in the article of whilky. There 
are three fairs held in this paruh, at which there ufed to be 
expofed great quantities of linen-yarn ; numbers of fheep, 
cows, horfes, and great herds of highland cattle are ftill fold. 
There is plenty of free ftone, both of a white and red co- 
lour. The fli ore is flat and fandy, not a flone to be feen a- 
long it, except fuch as have fallen from the cattle-hill. The. 
common fea-weed is often ufed for manure, by the farmers 
neareft to the coaft.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7852284">TULLTNESSLE</name>. 
(County or Aberdeen.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Marshall.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, l£c- 

TULLYNESSLE, the ancient and modern name of 
the parifh, is evidently derived from the Gaelic, in 
which language Tulfy fignifies " a dwelling," efile "upon 
" a Hoping bank," correfponding to the local fituation of 
this place : Perhaps, however, it may have originally been 
called "TullytCeffeU that is, " a dwelling on the burn of 
« Effet," a fmall ftream in the parifh. Tullynefsle lies in 
the county and Synod of Aberdeen, and Prefbytery of 
Alford; is about 4 miles in length, and 2f in breadth ; being 
bounded by the pariihes of Keig, Alford, Forbes, Clatt, 
and Leflie. The appearance of the country is hilly, or 
rather mountainous ; at leaft it is bounded by a pretty ex- 
tenfive chain of mountains. The foil in general is a loam, 
very capable of improvement, and the arable land is com- 
pofed of gentle Hopes upon the declivity of hills, with fome 
interjected flats. The hills are in many places ftony, but 
none of them rocky •, their foil is, for the moft part, dry 
and barren, covered with heath. The air is pure and 
healthy, confecpently few epidemical diftempers appear. 



Rivers, 



28 



Statiftical Account 



Rivers. — The parifti is bounded on the fouth fide for a- 
bove a mile by the river Don, which here is of considera- 
ble breadth, but (hallow, with a quick current. AH the 
neighbouring ftreams abound with fine trout, and a good 
many falmon are caught in the Don, though, owing to the 
erection of cruives near its mouth, they are not fo plenty 
as would otherwife have been the cafe. The pari(h is very 
partially expofed to land floods. 

Minerals. — There is abundance of very good moorftone, 
which drefles remarkably well for building ; there are 
quarries of blue moorftone or granite, fimilar to thofe about 
Aberdeen ; likewife there is a white moorftone of a very 
fine grain, which can be hewn for moft purpofes to which 
freeftone is applied, but this kind is only found in fingle 
blocks, in a very broken irregular quarry. A grey mi- 
caceous flag-ftone of a good fize is alfo to be got in the 
parifti. 

Animals. — The common breed of black cattle in this 
parifh is a middling, or rather fmall fized, hardy kind, 
weighing from 18 to 30 ftone Amfterdam ; they improve 
very much when carried into richer pafture, and con- 
fequently bring good prices from the drovers, who begin 
to pick them up early in fpring, and continue buying 
through the fummer. Mr Leith of Whitehaugh, who 
farms a great portion of his own eftate, nearly one third of 
the parifti, has, for feveral years paft, been at uncommon 
pains to improve the breed of cattle, and has now fo far 
attained his purpofe, that moft of the gentlemen and fub- 
ftantial farmers in the neighbourhood have thought it 
worth while to poflefs themfelves of a few of his breed, 
which are of a pretty large fize, very handfome, and re- 
markably well horned. There may be in the parifti 390 

head 



of Tullynefsle. 19 

head of cattle, 695 flieep, and 85 horfes. Of wild animals, 
there are plenty of hares, a few deer of the roe kind, and 
too many foxes. The hills abound with groufe and plover, 
the flat parts of the country with patridges, fnipes, wild 
ducks, and almoft every kind of birds commonly found in 
the north of Scotland but neither raven, rook, nor jack- 
daw, have been allowed to breed in the pariih for feveral 
years pall. 

Population. — About 1750, according to the returns made 
to Dr Webfter, the number of the inhabitants of this pariih 
was 269. They have fince increafed ; for in January 1791 
the number was found to be 188 males, 208 females, 396 



individuals, of whom there were 

Under 10 years of age, - 55

all of the eftablilhed church. The annual average of births 
is 3, of deaths 3, and of marriages 2. The population 
has, however, diminilhed of late years, partly owing to fe- 
veral of the inhabitants having been allured by manufac- 
tures to remove to Aberdeen, partly by feveral of the 
young men going fouthward in queft of bufinefe, and better 
wages ; and partly to the union of farms in one diftricT: of 
the pariih. There are but two heritors in the parifli, one 
of whom relides. 

Crops, Rent, ifc— Oats are generally fown from the "be- 
ginning of March till the middle of April, then barley, till 
the beginning or middle of May. The crops are in general 
reaped from the end of Auguft, to the middle or end of Oc- 
tober. The pariih fupplies itfelf fully with provifions, and 

generally

generally fends to market a good deal of meal, as alfo cheefe, 
butter, poultry, and eggs. The rent of 2-3ds of the pa- 
rifh occupied by tenants, may amount to L. 254 : 10:4 
in money, and 140 bolls of meal. The beft infield land lets 
at an average for about 16s. 8d. the acre j inferior about 
10 s. and outfield from 2 s. 6d. to 5 s. according to its qua- 
lity •, but, in general, the tenants pay in meal, in place of 
money, for the outfield grounds. Land is fold at an ave- 
rage at 25 years purchafe; but no change of property has 
taken place in this parifh for many years, or is likely to 
happen for many more. 

Prices, Wages, ifc. — It may without exaggeration be af- 
' ferted, that the prices of provifions are double, if not triple, 
of what they were about 30 years ago. About that time, 
an ox fold for 20 s. which now cofts at leaft L. 5, or L. 6; 
flieep, 3 s. to 4 s. for the beft wedders ; now the common 
price is from 6 s. to 10 s. 6 d. ; 2 s. 6d. to 3 s. for the beft 
ewes and lambs ; now they fetch from 5 s. to 7 s. or more. 
Hens then fold for 3 d. now 6 d. ; eggs 1 d. the 14, now 2 d. 
the dozen ; meal was fold in general for 6 s. 8 d. the boll, 
now it fells from 10 s. to 12 s. 

The ordinary wages given to labourers when hired by the 
day are 6 d. ; tailors 5 d. or 6 d ; wrights 8 d. ; mafons 1 s. 2 d. ; 
all exclufive of victuals. The annual wages of men-fer- 
vants employed by farmers, are in general above L. 5 ; of 
women-fervants, from L. 2, to L. 2, 10 s. Thirty years 
ago, the wages of the former run from L. 1 : 6 : 8, to L. 1, 
13 s. 4 d. Harden cloth fold for 2-j-d. the ell, (it now fells 
for 8 d. or 9 d.,) andlhoes for 1 d. the inch in length. 

Condition of Labourers. — Thofe labourers who continue 
able to work, may and do bring up their families tolerably 

well.

well. All have a kail yard ; almoft all a fmall piece of 
ground in tillage. The ftraw of the crop maintains a cow- 
in winter, which grazes with the farmers cattle during the 
fummer, and many of them have alfo a few fheep kept 
upon the farm, or by fome perfon in the neighbourhood, 
for a mere trifle. A good deal of money is gained by knit- 
ting ltockings, the general employment of the women : 
Young children might alfo be employed to advantage in 
that branch ; but as there are few inclofures, moft of them 
are occupied in looking after every fmall parcel of fheep or 
cattle, during 34ths of the year. Hence a labourer's, fa- 
mily, while in health, rarely needs affiflance. 

Implements of Uujbanilry. — There are a great many 
ploughs, owing to the number of -fmall farms, each of which 
mufl maintain a plough drawn by fmall fleers, or fometimes 
by an intermixture of cows and horfes. The larger farms 
are plowed by 8 or 10 fmall oxen; and the number of 
ploughs in all are between 30 and 40. There are about 
the fame number of carts, fuited to the fize of the horfes ; 
but it is not above 30 years fince carts began to be ufed in 
the parifh. 

Stipend, Poor, Uc. — The value of the living, including 
the glebe, is only about L. 54 a-year ; part of it is com- 
pofed of the vicarage-teind, which is paid to the minifler 
in kind. The church Was rebuilt about 12 years ago, and 
the manfe was built in 1724. The Earl of Fife is patron. 
The number of poor receiving flated alms is 4, though 
there are others who get occafional fupplies. The annual 
amount of contributions for the fupport of the poor, is about 
L. 4, 10 s. befides the interefl of L. 40.

MifceUaneous Obfcrvations.—The general fize of the peo- 
ple is from 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 10 inches, a few are 
below, but many above thofe fizes. They are (lender, ac- 
tive and hardy, differing confiderably in make and figure 
from the people on the fouth of the Grampians. They are 
indubious, humane, ceconomical, and enjoy the com- 
forts of fociety in a reafonable degree, and in proportion 
. to their rank and circumftances. Their condition might, 
however, be meliorated, if the proprietors would give longer 
leafes ; oblige the tenants to adopt more modern and pro- 
ductive plans of farming ; furnifh them at firft, with turnip 
and grafs feeds; bind them toinclofe, and improve a certain 
portion of ground annually, and allow them the expence of 
the inclofures at the expiry of their leafes. The roads are 
in better repair in this than in molt other parifhes ; the 
ftatute labour has hitherto been exacted in kind ; and al- 
though a commutation has been propofed, it has not, in ge- 
neral, been agreed on as the moft proper mode for this 
country.— The bear crop in 1782 was tolerably good, but 
oats and potatoes almoft totally failed. The principal he- 
ritor took a good deal of trouble in procuring vi&amp;ual, as 
alfo grain and potatoes for feed ; hence the parifh was as well 
fupplied as any in the neighbourhood. The fuel generally 
made ufe of, is turf and heath from the hills, there being 
very little peat to be got in the parifh. Heath is particu- 
larly ufed in kiln-drying, brewing, and baking. About 30 
years ago, charred peat was fo univerfally ufed by the 
blackfmiths, that few could work with any thing elfe. But 
now they ufe coal only, over all the country.

»Hp HE ancient and modern name of the parifh is the 
fame. It is derived from the principal village or 
town in it, and fignifies the " fummit of the rifing ground j" 
which defcribes exa&amp;ly the fituation of the village, which 
is built on the ridge of an eminence in the middle of Stra- 
thern, and commands on the N. and E. an extenfive pro- 
fpe&amp; of the adjacent country. The parifh has united with 
it, that of Aberuthven, which lies upon the E. Aberuthve7i 
fignifies the " mouth of the Ruthven," and it is in this parifh 
that the fmall river of Ruthven difcharges itfelf into the 
Earn. The annexation of the two parifhes feems to have 
taken place fome confiderable time before the Revolu- 
tion, and the diftin&amp;ion of the two, is now fo much for- 
gotten, that they never go by any other name than that of 
Auchterarder. Auchterarder is fituated in the county of 
Perth, in the prefbytery of Auchterarder, and in the Sy- 
nod of Perth and Stirling : It is of an irregular form ; its 
greateft extent from E. to W. is about 5 meafured miles, 
and from N. to S. nearly the fame ; it is bounded on the

on the E. by Dunning, and on the S. by Glendovan and 
FoiTaway. The greateft part of the parifh is a flat and 
level country, lying on the fouth of the river Earn •, it al- 
fo includes in it fome part of the Ochil hills, particularly 
CraigroITie, one of the higheft of them. Thefe hills are 
all green, and good fheep-pafture. Almoft the whole of 
the low part of the parilh is arable, and a good, though 
not a ftrong foil ; on the banks of the Earn it inclines to 
a loam, but in general it is dry and light, requiring fuch a 
ftimulus as lime or marl, and rewarding well whatever ex- 
pence is laid out in that way. It may be farther obferved, 
that the northern declivity of the hills is arable a confide- 
rable way upwards, and there is the ftrongeft reafon to be- 
lieve that in former ages the hills have been plowed in 
many places to the very fummit ; the ridges are ftill plain 
and diftincl:. 

Air. — The air is dry and good in fummer, but rather 
moiit and damp in winter, as is the cafe in the greateft 
part of Strathern, particularly in the neighbourhood of the 
Ochils. In the winter months the fun has not influence 
fufHcient to diffipate the vapours which are attracted by 
the hills, and the moft frequent winds blowing from them, 
muft necefTarily occafion a moifture in the air. This, one 
mould think, would give rife to rheumatifms, and fimilar 
diforders, as it does in fome inflances ; yet it cannot be 
faid that rheumatifm is a prevalent diftemper here ; and it is 
remarkable that of late years fcarcely an inftance of a per- 
fon afflicted with the ague has occurred ; the diforder 
which has been moft prevalent and fatal for fome years 
paft, is a fever of the nervous kind. 

Rivers.— The Earn, which bounds the parifh on the N. 
produces falmon, and the large white and yellow trout ; 

it 



of Auchterarder.

it beautifies the parifli as well as the adjacent country, but 
is fometimes prejudicial to the neighbouring tenants, by 
overflowing its banks in the harveft. The Ruthven, 
which takes its rife in the hills, about 3 miles beyond the 
weft boundaries of the parifli, is a beautiful little river, and 
particularly ufeful to this parifli it runs with an uniform 
and conftant ftream through the whole length of it from 
the S. W. to the N. E. and turns the 11 mills in the 
parifli, to be afterwards defcribed ; it abounds with a fpe- 
cies of trout peculiar to itfelf, of a fmall frze, but remark- 
able for flavour and delicacy. 

Stone and Slate.— ■The parifli, and particularly the neigh- 
bourhood of the village of Auchterarder, abounds with a 
hard and durable ftone, which, lying in thin and regular 
ftrata, is very fit both for building houfes and dry-ftone 
fences ; the quarries in the neighbourhood of the town 
alfo afford grey flate in abundance, which makes a roof 
greatly preferable to thatch, but heavier than the blue 
llate. 

Population. — The antient ftate of the population cannot 
be afcertained with any degree of exa&amp;nefs ; the number 
of people feems to have been increafmg by flow degrees 
till the prefent time ; the return to Dr Webfter was 1194, 
they amount at prefent to 1670 fouls, of which 805 are 
males, and 865 are females ; 798 relide in the villages of 
Auchterarder, Berland-park and Miltown, and 872 in the 
•country : The average number of births cannot be afcer- 
tained with great exa&amp;nefs, owing to fome diffenting pa- 
rents neglecting to get their childrens names inferted in 
the parifli-regifter, or refufing to pay the clerk's dues ; but 
making allowance for that omiffion, the annual average of 
births, for the laft ten years, is 38 j for the ten years from 

1770 



36 



Statijlical Account 



1770 to 1780 is 40 •, and for the ten years from 1760 to 
1770 is no lefs than 48 ; a confiderable number of the 
married women in the parim being now advanced in life, 
accounts for this diminution in the annual number of births. 
The annual average of burials for the laft ten years is 36, 
and of marriages, 11. The number of fouls under ten 
years of age is 341 ; from ten to twenty, 342 ,- from twen- 
ty to fifty, 681 ; from fifty to feventy, 266 ; and from fe- 
venty to a hundred, 40. The number of heritors and 
feuars is 52; the four principal heritors do not refide in 
the parim. The number of farmers and occupiers of land 
is 82 ; of weavers, 49 •, of mechanics, 78 ; of male-fervants, 
109; of fe male-fervants, 120. Befides the Eftablilhed 
Clergyman, there is one Relief Minifter, who refides in 
the parifli; one writer, and one furgeon. The number 
of fouls in the Eftabliflied Church is 1 1 76, and of Seceders, 
including thofe of the Relief perfuafion, 492 •, there are 
only two Epifcopulians. 

The population of the parim is not materially different 
from what it was 5, 10, or 25 years ago-, but is rather on 
the increafe, owing principally to the acceffion of inhabi- 
tants to the villages from other parifhes. The piopor- 
tioa of the annual births to the whole population, is as 1 to 
38 ; of the annual marriages, nearly as 1 to 151 ; of the 
annual deaths, nearly as 1 to 46 ; of bachelors to mar- 
ried men, including widowers, as 1 to 5. Each marriage 
produces at an average, nearly 4 children. There are no 
uninhabited houfes ; of inhabited houfes there are 303, and 
the number of perfons, at an average, to each inhabited 
houfe, is upwards of 5. 

Produce, &amp;c. — The parifli produces wheat, oats, barley, 
peafe, hay, potatoes, and turnip, with the common kitchen 
herbs and roots. The different kinds of fir, the oak, am, 

elm, 



of Aucbterarder. 



37 



elm, leech, alder, birch and elder grow in it ; but there 
are no extenfive plantations of any of thefe kinds. A few 
hundred acres have of late been planted with the common 
fir. Befides the domeltic animals, the numbers of which 
in the diftrict could not be afcertained, as the tenants (hew- 
ed an averfion to difcover their ftock, there are plenty of 
hares and patridges ; there are the hedge-hog, otter, pole- 
cat and fox. The fheep-farmers ufed formerly to keep 
up their flock by purchafmg hogs every year at Linton 
market ; but they have now begun, and it is believed with 
fuccefs, to rear their own lambs, and of courfe they re- 
quire a fmaller fupply from the fouth country. Horfes 
and black cattle are reared on almoft every farm of the 
parim. In general, it may be obferved, that oats and bar- 
ley are the principal productions of the parim. Every 
farmer fows a proportion of peafe and lint-feed, and plants 
potatoes ; feveral of them fow turnip, and this crop is be- 
coming every year more ' frequent, becaufe its value is 
better known \ all of them lay down a greater or lefs 
quantity of ground in artificial grafs, which, after being 
cut for two or three years, partly for immediate ufe, and 
partly to be made into hay, is afterwards paftured for two 
or three years more. Wheat is fown in fome farms in 
the low part of the parilh, and might with equal advantage 
be fown in others ; but it is thought to be a crop rather 
too fevere for the greateft part of the foil, and a good crop 
of barley is considered as not lefs profitable, becaufe it im- 
poverishes the ground lefs. 

It is to be doubted whether the parifh fupplies itfelf in 
the article of flour ; but there can be no doubt that it ex- 
ports a confiderable quantity both of barley-grain and oat- 
meal, and raii'es a great deal more beef and mutton than it 
confumes. The tenants generally begin to fow peafe and 
oats about the middle of March, if the weather prove fa- 
vourable, 



Statijlical Account 



vourable, and conclude the making of their barley fowing 
about the 25th of May. Harveft commonly begins, in the 
low part of the parifh, the firft or fecond week of Septem- 
ber, and in the hills extends to the end of Odtober or be- 
ginning of November. 

There is only a fmall quantity of ground occupied by 
woods and rivers, and none at all by forefts, lakes or mar- 
flies. There are a few hundred acres in common on the 
weft end of the village of Auchterarder, called the moor 
of Auchterarder, to which the cows of the inhabitants go 
to pafture. In its prefent ftate it is of no great value ; 
were it improved, and the fouthern part efpecially is very 
capable of improvement, the value of it would be vaftly 
increafed. There are alfo feveral hundred acres upon the 
hill of Fofswell (part of the Ochils) in common among the 
neighbouring feuars : Both commons may perhaps contain 
12 or 14 hundred acres. Very little land lets above, or e- 
ven ..at 20 s. the acre, except in the immediate neighbour- 
hood of the town. Marl has been found in different parts 
of the parifh, but as the parcels hitherto difcovered have 
been in no great quantity, they are already exhaufted. 

Advantages and Difadvantages.— .The parifh has a pe- 
culiar advantage in the fmall river of Ruthven, which runs 
through it from one end to the other ; and at all feafons of 
the year, conveys fuch a quantity of water, as is fufficient 
to turn the machinery of any ordinary mill. Befides four 
corn-mills, there are already erected on it, three lint mills, 
two oil-mills, a paper and a fulling mill ; and, with little 
cxpence any kind of mill might be ereded on it, which 
does not require a great weight of water. It is perhaps alfo 
an advantage to the parifh, that the direct road runs through 
it, which leads from Perth, Aberdeen, and the Eaft country, 
to Stirling and Glafgow. 

The 



of Auchterarder. 



The village of Auchterarder labours under the difad- 
vantage of not having a conftant fupply of water. The 
ftream which runs through it being brought a conliderable 
way from the town, is dry in the fummer-feafon ; and the 
greateft part of the inhabitants are then obliged to bring 
their water from an inconvenient diftance. Pit- wells have 
been funk in different parts of the town, but without fuc- 
cefs. A propofal has been lately made for bringing in 
pipes from the fountain-head ; but to this fcheme the con- 
fent of the Honourable Proprietor of the eftate of Perth is 
requifite, as the fpring lies in his ground ; this, with his pe- 
cuniary aid, has been folicited, and both it is hoped will be 
granted : The advantage to the town in general, and to 
his feuars in particular, would be unfpeakable. But without 
the affiftance of others, the inhabitants are unable themfelves 
to accomplifh fo expenfive a work, as to bring water, even 
in wooden pipes, from the fountain-head to the bottom of 
the town, which is a diftance of nearly 2 miles. 

Price of Promifions and Labour. —The price of beef and 
mutton, about 50 or 60 years ago, was 9 d. or 10 d. a 
ftone ; of barley and oat-meal, 8 s. 4 d. Butter fold at 
4d. a-pound, and cheefe at 2d.; hens at 3d. or 4d. a-piece. 
At prefent beef fells at 3 ,d. a-pound ; mutton at 4 d. du- 
ring the fummer •, veal and porkj in their feafon, at 4 d. 
Butter commonly fells at 8 d. a-pound, and cheefe at 4 s. 3d.

The generality of labourers, along with their dwelling-

which encreafes their means of fubfiftence. / 

Poor, Church, Stipend,] Ifc. — The number of the poor 
is 13. They receive a weekly allowance ; but befides thefe, 
there are others who get occafional charity, as their circum- 
flances may require. The annual amount of the collec- 
tions at the church-door, of the intereft of mortified mo- 
ney, and of proclamation-dues, is about L. 40 Sterling. 
The church was built in 1784. The value of the ftipend, 
including the glebe, is about L. 90 Sterling. The EarJ of 
Kinnoul is patron. 

Pillages. — There are 3 villages in the parifh ; the prin- 
cipal of which is Auchterarder, and which was once, 
perhaps, of greater note. That it was a royal burgh, and 
fent a member to Parliament, cannot be doubted. Its 
name is to be feen in the old rolls of Parliament ; and a 
great number of the houfes hold burgage to this day. How 
it came to lofe its privileges is not certainly known. Auch- 
terarder confifts-of 'one ftreet nearly a mile long, and has 
in it about a hundred houfes : Many of them have been 
lately rebuilt, which adds much to the improvement of 

the 



of Auchterarder.

the town, and the accommodation of the inhabitants. Be- 
fides four fairs every year, there has been a yearly tryft 
held the beginning of Oftober, fince the year 1781, at 
which there has been always a great mew of black cattle. 
The prefent number of inhabitants is 594, and the popula- 
tion of the place is apparently on the increafe ; for there 
have been of late, feveral new houfes built, and more are 
building. Belides the Eftablimed Church, there is a Relief 
Meeting in the town. About 20 years ago, a confiderable 
manufacture of yarn and narrow linen-cloth was carried 
on in Auchterarder. It was fold bleached and unbleached, 
and exported to Glafgow : But this trade is now in a great 
meafure extinft. Sale linens are ftill manufactured in the 
town and neighbourhood ; and linen, of a fabric peculiar 
to the place, and which goes by its name. At a little 
diltance from Auchterarder, is a village called the Borland 
Park, built by Government for the accommodation of the 
foldiers who were difbanded after the war in 1763, and con- 
tains 140 inhabitants, who are moftly weavers. Moft of 
the foldiers who were planted in it, left it very foon after- 
wards, though the terms of their fettlement were very ad- 
vantageous, either from diflike to the place, or more pro- 
bably to their new mode of life. On the fouth of Auch- 
terarder, and along the fide of the Ruthven, is Miltown, a 
fmall village, containing 64 inhabitants. Here there is a 
diftillery, conlifting of two 40 gallon-ftills. 

Antiquities. — In the neighbourhood of Auchterarder, 
and on the N. of the town, are the remains of an old cattle, 
faid to be a hunting feat of King Malcolm Kenmore; ad- 
joining to which is a fmall copfe wood, which common- 
ly goes by the name of the King's Wood. The tenant has 
been unluckily allowed to grub up the wood, and to build 
a farm-houfe with the ftones of the cattle ; and there are 

F 2 now 



44 



Statijiical Account 



now but inconliderable veftiges remaining of thefe vene- 
rable antiquities. A little to the northward of the caftle, 
are the remains of a Popifh place of worlhip, commonly- 
known by the name of the Old Kirk, or St Mungo's Cha- 
pel. This was formerly the parilh-church •, and the 
church-yard was the burying ground of the parifh : Many 
of the inhabitants ftill retain burying places in it. There 
are fome traces of encampments on the S. E. of the village 
of Auchterarder, at the foot of the Ochils. Perhaps they 
were out-pofts of the Roman camp at Ardoch ; what- 
ever they were, it feems probable the Romans were in this 
neighbourhood ; for in digging the foundation of the church 
lately built in this place, a coin was found, of the Emperor 
Titus Vefpafian, perfectly diftinft. About 12 or 14 years 
ago, there was found in a marl-pit, in the parifh, a pair of 
large horns, fuppofed to be of the Elk, or Eurus, which 
were fent to Edinburgh, and are now in the cuftody of the 
Antiquarian Society. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The people are, in general, 
much difpofed to induftry. They are ceconomical, and yet, 
in general, by no means difinclined to humane and chari- 
table a&amp;ions. Their condition would be benefited, could the- 
price of fuel be rendered cheaper. Perhaps there are no means 
of doing this, but by making the communication ealier to 
the coal which is the fuel they mult now chiefly truft to. 
In confequence of the aft of Parliament, lately obtained 
for erefting tolls upon the roads within the county of Perth, 
it is propofed to make a toll- road to Blairiugone. If this pro- 
pofal fhould be carried into execution, it will no doubt ren- 
der the co munication ealier; and it is to be hoped, alfo 
make the neceffary article of coal cheaper. Coal is brought 
from Blairingone and Dollar, about 12 miles diftance, and 
is fold here at i^d. a-ftone,Tron weight; at the coal-hill 12

ilone cofts 4 d. Were the two-handed fpinning wheel more 
generally ufed, it would probably contribute in fome mea- 
lure to better the circumltances of the lower clafs of people, 
as well as to increafe the materials of the linen-manufac- 
ture. There are but one or two fuch wheels in this pa- 
rim ; and it is but little ufed in many parts of the country. 
It might alio be for the interefts of the lower clafs of peo- 
ple, and efpecially the women, were they more employed 
than they are, in manufactures for which they are qualified. 
The great demand for men for all kinds of work, has raif- 
ed their wages to an exorbitant height ; while in this part 
of the country, at leaft, the wages of female-fervants are 
barely fufhcient to fupport them, when in health : They 
cannot afford to fet apart any provifion for ficknefs or old 
age, without the utmofl parfimony. 

The roads in the parifh and neighbourhood, are but in 
an indifferent ftate. They are kept in repair by means of 
the ftatute-fervices, which of late have been commuted for 
money at the rate of 8 s. the plough-gate. But though the 
roads, fince that time, are better than formerly, they are 
far from being good and this fund will probably be infuf- 
ficient to make them fo. The fize of farms in the parifh are 
fmall, and their number has of late neither increafed nor de- 
creafed. A conliderable part of the parifh is inclofed, and 
the people feem to be fufficiently convinced of the advan- 
tages of inclofures. Property in land does not change 
often. Two fmall eftates were fold lately at upwards of 
30 years purchafe. 

In the years 1782 and 1783, the price of meal was not 
fo high as in many other diftri&amp;s ; and meal was always to 
be had. The bounty of Government was of fervice, though 
it was late in arriving ; and the kirk-feffion, by laying out 
a part of their funds in purch'afing meal, furnifhed the 

poorefl:

pooreft clafs of people with it at a lower rate than the mar- 
ket-price. 

The alteration in the drefs and manner of living of the 
inhabitants, within thefe 30 or 4c years, is not a little re- 
markable. Every body is now decently and comfortably 
clothed, which perhaps was not the cafe then ; and there 
is now four times the quantity of butcher-meat ufed. , A- 
bout 25 or 30 years ago, there was but two fixpenny wheat- 
en loaves brought from Perth, to two private families, in 
the week : There is now a baker in the village, who fells 
bread to the amount of L. 200 a-year, and about L. 80 
worth is brought every year from Perth. It muft, how- 
ever, be obferved that the parifties of Blackford and Tri- 
nity-Gafk are in part fupplied from Auchterarder. A 
houfe in the village of Auchterarder, confifting "of 4 apart- 
ments, with a garden, lets for about L. 4 ; and feparate 
rooms, with a fmall garden, let from 20 s. to 25 s. There 
are about 100 ploughs in the parifh ; many of them are four- 
horfe ploughs, and the reft two-horfe ploughs. Sometimes, 
but rarely, 2 oxen are ufed, inftead of 2 horfes, next the 
plough. In the low part of the parifh the tenants are im- 
proving the breed of their horfes, and among them the two- 
horfe plough generally prevails. There are about 250 An- 
gle horfe carts, and not one double horfe cart. An opinion 
prevails, which is probably true, that the horfes are more 
equally wrought, in thefe rough and unequal roads, by 
each having his own cart.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1978003">ABERLEMNO</name>, 
(County of Forfar.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Mitchel.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

ABERLEMNO is faid to derive its etymology 
from aber in the Gaelic language, lignifying the 
" mouth of" or "above," and from the fmall river 
qf Lemno, which takes its rife in this parifli, and falls 
into the river South-Elk, about a mile N. from the church. 
The names of moil places are faid to be derived from the 
Gaelic language. This parifli is fituated 12 or 13 miles from 
the fea-coaft, in the county and prefbytery of Forfar, and 
Synod of Angus and Mearns. Its form fomewhat re- 
fembles an oblique triangle. The extent of it from E. to 
W. is about 6 miles; and from N. to S. about 5. It is 
bounded on the N. by the pariflies of Carrarton and Tan- 
nadice ; on the N. W. by the parilh of Oathlaw ; on the 
W. and S. by the parifli of Refcobie ; on the S. E. by Gu- 
thrie, and on the E. by Brechin. The foil, in general, is 
fertile, the low grounds deep, the high grounds fhallow and 
rocky. The appearance of the country, in this parilh, is 
various ; m fome places flat, in others hilly ; the hills are 
covered with heath. A large traft of ground upon the

veft 1774.

Church, Stipend and School. — The church was repaired 
in 1774, and the manfe built in 1782. The ftipend, in- 
cluding the glebe, is between L. 86 and L. 96 Sterling.

The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 merks ; the number of 
fcholars generally about 40. Englilh and writing are 
taught for is. 6d. the quarter; arithmetic and Latin, for 
2S. 6d. The emoluments of femon-clerklhip may be a- 
bout L. 4 or L. 5 Sterling, yearly. 

Trice of Labour and Provifons. — The wages of a day- 
labourer in hufbandryare 1 s. without victuals, and 8d. with 
them. A male labouring fervant's wages are from L. 5 to 
L. 8 a-year ; a female's, L. 3 ; a good labouring married 
fervant receives as wages about L. 6 Sterling in money, a 
houfe and yard, the value of which is between 20 s. and 
30 s. ; he gets a cow maintained through the year, and his 
fuel brought home : All which generally enable him to 
bring up a family- A carpenter's wages are 10 d. or is. 
and his victuals-, a mafon's is. 4d. or is. 6d. wichout 
victuals ; a tailor's 8 d. with victuals. — The price of pro- 
vilions is doubled lince 1745 : Butcher-meat is 4d. the lb.; 
ducks and hens, 8d. each ; butter 8d. the lb. ; cheefe 6 s. 
or 7 s. the Hone. 

Farms, Itfc. — The farms, in general, are from 50 to 250 
or 300 acres ; few are more extenlive, and fome are 
fmaller. Their number is not diminilhing. By a late re- 
gulation, the half of each farm fhould be in grafs. Oats 
and peafe are fown in March and April ; barley in April 
and the beginning of May ; and wheat generally in Sep- 
tember and October. The greateft part of the land is 
inclofed ; the people being convinced of the advantage of 
inclofing. The loch of Balgavies has, for many years, fur- 
niflied much marl for manure. The rent of the belt arar 
ble land may be about L. 1 the acre ; but what the farmers 
chiefly ftudy is the bringing up of black cattle. The land-

rent of the parifh is fully L. 2000 Sterling. The number 
of ploughs is 48, each of which is generally drawn by 
four horfes ; the number of horfes 161 ; of carts 90. 
There has been little fale of land from time immemo- 
rial. 

Mifcellaneous Olfervatiojis. — The air, in moft places is 
healchy. There is plenty of moorftone, free-ftone and 
ilates ; many of which laft, are fent to London and 0- 
ther places. Coal, peat, turf, broom and furze, are ufed 
for fuel. Coal from Fife cofts 6 d. the boll, /. e. 7 ftone 
weight. Peat is got from a neighbouring parifh, at about 
2 s. the cart-load. There are 2 chaifes in the parifh. 
Two obelifks remain, one in the church-yard, another 
on the highway from Brechin to Forfar, about 8 or 9 
feet high ; they were eredted in memory of the total de- 
feat of the Danes, and have fome rude hieroglyphical 
fculptures *. A few tumuli have been opened in this 
neighbourhood, in one or two of which was found a 
rude kind of ftone coffin, containing a fmall quantity of 
black earth, with fome bones almoft entirely confumed. 
In 1777, there was a cut made the whole breadth of this 
parifh, from the church fouthward ; and a bridge built 
"by private fubfcription, to conned! the road from Forfar 
to Brechin with that to Arbroath. The ftatute-labour 
has been, for the moft part, commuted. The principal 
manufacture is linen. Few inlift in the army. The peo- 
ple are induftrious, ceconomical, and, in general, humane 
in their difpofition. There is a great alteration for the 
better, in the manners, drefs and ftyle of living within thefe 
40 years. The parifh always fupplies itfelf with provifions 

and

and fometimes exports large quantities of grain. There 
are two inns on the great road between Brechin and For- 
far, for the entertainment of travellers. Few fervices ard 
performed by tenants or fubtenants, excepting the carriage 
tof the landlord's coals.

i PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5309119">DRUMBLADE</name>. 

(County of Aberdeen.) 

By the Rev. Mr George Abel.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, ifc. 

THE ancient name of this parifh was Drumblait, the 
modern is Drutnblade, which fignifies in Gaelic, 
u hills covered with corn," of which there are feveral in 
the parifh. Drumblade lies in the county and Synod of A- 
berdeen and the Prefbytery of Turriff. Its form fomewhat 
refembles the body of a fiddle - 7 the length from N. to S. is 
from 5 to 6, the breadth from E. to V/. from 4 to 5, and the- 
circumference about 18 miles. It is bounded by the pa- 
rifhes of Forgue, Inch, Gartly and Huntly ; by the two 
laft of which, it is interfered in fome places. The furface 
is compofed of fmall hills and vallies, fome of the former 
are covered with fir, but moft are arable. The vallies pro- 
duce excellent crops where properly cultivated. The foil 
of the laft is a deep loam, and that of the higher ground is 
thin, but fertile •, the air tolerably falubrious, and the peo- 
ple generally healthy. 

Animals. — The quadrupeds are horfes, black cattle, flieep, 
hogs, foxes, hares, polecats and badgers. Birds are groufe, 
partridges, plovers, a few wood cocks, &amp;c. The cattle 
are not of an uncommon fize, though they are very hardy 
and ferviceable. Some cows bred here have fold at L. 8, 

antf 



Statijiical Account, &amp;c. 53 



and oxen at L. 16; but the common prices are greatly be- 
low thefe fums, ordinary cows felling from L. 4 to L. 5, 
and oxen from L. 6 to L. 10. 

Minerals. — There is plenty of coarfe. lime-Hone, of free- 
ftone, (called here paify-whin-,) of moorftone, and indica- 
tions of flate ; there being inexhauftible quarries of that 
article in the neighbourhood. Some few chalybeate fprings 
are to be met with, but weak and little ufed. 

Population. — According to the returns made from hence 
to Dr Webfler, the number of inhabitants in this parifh 
about 1750, was 11 25; this has fince diminimed, as in 
1790 there were only 886 individuals, of whom 427 were 
males, and 459 were females. Of the total number, 812 
belonged to the Eftablifhed Church ; 40 were Seceders ; 
30 of the Epifcopal perfuafion, and 4 Papifts. The annual 
average of births is 23I-; of deaths 20-3^-; and of mar- 
riages 4^. The population in 1782, was 876; in 1783, 
892 •, in 1784, 887; in 1786, 914 ; in 1787, 903 •, in 1788, 
874. The caufes of thefe alterations are young men, fuch 
as mafons, ihoemakers, wrights, Haters, &amp;c. going abroad 
to improve themfelves in their refpedtive crafts •, and to 
the enlifting of fome in the army, particularly in the artil- 
lery. There are 200 inhabited houfes ; the property of 
which is divided among four heritors, only one of whom 
refides. 

Produ&amp;ions, ifc. — The parifli produces all the ordinary 
kinds of vegetables in the fields and gardens; fupplies itfelf 
with provisions, and exports meal, bear, and oats. Sowing 
and reaping depend much upon the feafons. Peafe and 
oats are fown (if the ground be (fry and fit for the feed) 
from the ift of March to the middle of April ; barley and 

common 



54 Statiflicctl Account 

common bear from the M period till Whitfunday. Bar- 
ley, bear, and Peebles, or early oats, are reaped from the 
end of Auguft to the middle of September, common oats 
to the end of Oftober ; and fometimes in very late feafons, 
and backward weather, the harveft continues till the be- 
ginning, nay middle of December, as in 1782. There 
may be about 400 acres in plantations. Each farm 
has a proportion of pafture-ground fet apart for the 
cattle and iheep ; and it muft be acknowledged there is 
too much wafte ground. There are fome inclofures in the 
parilh; but the greater! part of it is uninclofed, as the 
people, though fenfible of the benefits of inclofing, cannot 
afford the outlay of money neceffary for that purpofe. 

Rent,Wages, Beft arable or meadow ground lets in- 

general at i 4 s. or 15 s. the acre ; inferior, from 5 s. to 10s. 
The rent of the whole parilh is above L. 1622. Landed 
property is . not often changing. The daily wages of a 
labourer in hufbandry are 9 d. ; in harveft from 1 s. to 
I s. 3 d. ; of a carpenter is.; of a mafon 1 s. 3 d. ; of a 
flater 1 s. 2 d. ; of a tailor ic d. When men and women 
are employed for the whole year in huibandry, the wages 
of the former are from L. 4 to L. 6, and of the latter, from 
L. 2 to L. 2, xos. exclufive of viduals and lodging, with 
which they are alfo fupplied by their mafters. None have 
been obliged to leave the parilh for want of employment, 
The fuel commonly ufed is peat, turf, heath, broom, whins, 
(all found in the parilh), and Englifh coal, landed at Banff 
or Portfoy. There is a very fine clay, of a yellowifli 
brown colour, (called here clay-marl), to be got in great 
quantities, in which very little fand appears. It is only 
ufed as a compoft for manure, or is laid upon grafs-ground 
with little propriety or'judgraent. 



Church, 



of Dnnnblade. 



55 



Church, Stipend, Poor, \£c. — The church was rebuilt in 
1773. The former church had been built in the year 11 10, 
as appears from raifed figures upon one of the keep-ftones 
of the eaft end ; and the appearance of the work feemed 
to confirm its antiquity. The value of the living, includ- 
ing the glebe, is L. 67 : 15 : 8. The Earl of Kintore is 
patron. The number of poor receiving fupport from the 
funds, on an average of 5 years, is 12. The laft year's a- 
mount of the contributions, and the produce of alms, lega- 
cies, and all the other funds deftined to their ufe, was 
L. 24 : 10 : 5. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The general fize of the peo- 
ple is from 5 feet 5 inches, to 5 feet 10 inches. They are 
not remarkably indolent; but with regard to induftry, there 
is room for improvement. They are oeconomical, live fo- 
berly, and rather poorly, but feem tolerably contented with 
their condition 5 are humane, and difcover their humani- 
ty on every occafion. The having a little more the com- 
mand of money at firft fetting out in the world, 
might greatly meliorate their condition. The roads in 
this parilh are not in good repair, on account of the clay 
foil, the want of gravel, the great length of highway, and 
the fmall number of people to look after it. The ftatute- 
Jabour is, however, exafted, and but in very few inflances 
commuted. There are no turnpikes ; the general opinion 
feemmg to be againft them. 

Antiquities,- There are three tumuli in this parifh ; the 
largeft, Meet-hillock, is near Slioch, where King Robert 
Bruce encamped, when he came N. in purfuit of fome of 
the adherents of Cummine Earl of Badenoch, after defeat- 
ing that nobleman at Inverurie. A fmall hill above that 
tumulus is called to this day Robin's Height, and had on the 

top 



Stati/iical Account, tfc. 



top large ftones, with infcriptions on them, now all broken 
down and carried away ; at leaft none are at prefent co be 
feen above the ground. Tradition reports, that thefe three 
tumuli were raifed by Bruce's army, as polls of communi- 
cation for his foldiers ; and the orders were given by the 
King at Meet-hillock. None of them have been opened. 

Famine in 1782. — The crop in 1782 almoft totally fail- 
ed; of courfe the year 1783 would have proved calami- 
tous in the higheft degree, had there not been a very large 
fupply of peafe procured from Norfolk, which was fold out 
twice a-week, at prime coft, in the fmalleft quantities called 
for. There was alfobarley brought from Aberdeen, and re- 
tailed in meal by private adventurers. During this period 
none died of want; the people were more healthy than ufual; 
and the women in general exerted themfelves fo much in 
fpinning, and fitting up at their work every other night, as 
to produce double the ufual quantity of linen yarn, thus con- 
tributing more to the fupport of their families than the 
men. NUM.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3986">SKENE</name>. 
(County of Aberdeen.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Hogg.</head>



<p>Name, Situation, Soil, 13c, 

According to tradition one of the progenitors of the 
prefent laird of Skene is faid to have killed a boar 
that endangered the King's life, Malcolm Kenmore, with a 
knife or dagger, called in Gaelic, a Skian, and received 
as reward the greater part of the lands in the pa- 
rim. Hence the name of the family of Skene, and that of 
the parilh. The parifh is fituated in the county of Aber- 
deen, and lies from 6 to 12 meafured miles N.* W. from 
the town. It is in the Synod and Prefbytery of Aber- 
deen. Its extent in circumference is nearly from 20 
to 24 meafured miles. The form is nearly oval; 
the length is 6, and the breadth from 3 to 4 meafur- 
ed miles. It is bounded on the E. by the parilhes of New- 
hills and Peterculter; on the S. by Peterculter; on the 
W. by Echt and Cluny 5 on the N. W. by Kemnay ; and 
on the N . by Kintore and Kinellar. The appearance of the 
country is hilly and rocky. The nature of the foil is va- 
rious ; the predominant quality is that of gravel. Some 
fpots are fertile enough, others very barren. The air is 
fufficiently dry and healthy. The moft prevalent dif- 
■tempers are fevers. The Jparim abounds with mineral 
Springs. Thefe might be rendered ferviceable in fcorbutic

and fcrophulous difeafcs ; but they are rarely applied to 
for relief. The tendency which the lands have in general 
to minerals, operates to their disadvantage; being inimical to 
vegetation, and quickly confuming manure of every kind. 
There is a lake of confiderable extent, the lake of Skene, 
about a meafured mile in length, and fomething more 
than 3-4ths in breadth. It is vifited, efpecially in winter, 
by duck, geefe, and occafionally by fwans ; pike and eel 
in great abundance, and of confiderable fize are found m it. 
The pike is good, I believe, at all feafons, it can be caught. 
The eel is in greateft perfe&amp;ion towards the end of Sep- 
tember, and beginning of Oaober, when it quits its fum- 
mer-quarters, and proceeds down the burn which flows 
from the loch. A canal from the lake to Aberdeen, fit 
for navigating boats of an ordinary fize, has been projected. 
The feheme is certainly practicable, and would, if carried 
into execution, be of confiderable advantage to this parifli, 
nnd the country around it. A cut of about 16 meafured 
miles in length, through a country fufEciently flat for the pur- 
pofe, is all that would be required, without, I fliould think, 
the aid of almoft a fmgle lock. But the country muft be far- 
ther advanced in cultivation, before fuch a feheme. I fuf- 
peft, can or will be attempted. The hills are in general 
.^reen and rocky. Moorftone and granite are to be found 
in abundance, and are ufecl in building. 

Population.— The population does not appear to be ma- 
terially different from what it was 10 or 20 years ago. 
That it is on the increafe, manifeftly appears from the re- 
gifters of marriages and baptifms, which have been accurate- 
ly enough kept. The population, according to Dr Web- 
fter, was 1251. About the 1777, it was 1306. In 1787, 
it was 1256. The amount at prefent, is 1233, of which 
572 are males, and 661 females. There are no towns nor 

village?

villages in the parifh'. The annual average of births from 
1740 to 1750, was 39; from 1760 to 1770, 30 ; from 
1780 to 1790, 19. The annual average of deaths from 
1760 to 177c, 30 5 from 1780 to 1790, 25. The annual 
average of marriages from 1760 to 1770, 15 ; from 1780 
to 1790, 9. The rule for afcertaining the population of 
any parifh or diftrift, (W», by multiplying the number of 
births by 26, and the number of deaths by 36), does not 
appear to be at all accurate ; nor has it nearly anfwered in 
any inftance that I have heard of, where it has been tried. 
The number of fouls under 10 years of age, amounts to 
235 ; from 10 to 20, is 274 ; from 20 to 50, is 460 ; from 
qo to 70, is 158 ; above 70, and below ico, is 106. There 
were formerly 51 farms, or rather ploughs, in the parifh. 
The number is now diminifhed. A farmer's family, at an 
average, may confitt of from 6 to 9 perfons. There are 2 
or 3 merchants, and 14 or 15 tradefmen. A very confi- 
derable proportion of the prefent inhabitants of the parifh 
are natives of other parifhes. The whole parifli is of the 
Eftablifhed Church, except 1 Seceder, and 9 Roman Catho- 
lics. The proportion of the annual births to the whole popu- 
lation is nearly as 1 to 65 of the annual maariages to the 
whole population as 1 to 137 ; of the annual deaths to the 
whole population nearly as 1 to 49. At an average, 
each marriage may be faid to produce from 4 to 6 child- 
ren. 

ProduBums Agriculture, I3c.—0n the lands belonging to 
Skene only have trees been hitherto raifed. No plantations 
have till of late been made, and even. that to no great extent, 
nor improvements indeed of any kind, owing to invincible 
obftruclions. Confidering the great quantity of wafte land 
in the parifli, fit only for bearing trees, the neglect of culti- 
vating them is much to be regretted. Trees of all kinds 

H 2 tend 



6° Statvftical Account 

tend greatly to beautify a country, and prove ultimately 
highly uleful and profitable. Am, plane, pine, common 
fir, willow, larix, are the kinds of trees which are princi- 
pally produced. The larix is only of late introduced ; and 
it leems to thrive better, and advance fafter than any other 
tree. It is attended with this fingular advantage too, that 
it thrives almoft in any foil, and in any fituation. Horfes, 
black cattle, and fheep, are the animals which the parifh 
produces. The number of cattle amounts to 1 185 ; of fheep 
to 1 205 •, of horfes, to 1 99. The number of acres may poffibly 
be, at an average, above 8000 : Of thefe, about 2300 are cal- 
led infield; about 3056 outfield; about 1640 pafture-ground; 
J34 mofs, and about 520 moor-ground. The greater part 
of the arable ground is employed in railing oats and bear. 
A middling farm will fow about 36 or 40 bolls of oats, 
and from 4 to 6 bolls of bear. Wheat, rye, hemp, flax, 
are not cultivated in this corner. About 64 acres only 
are employed in railing turnip and potatoes. The artifi- 
cial grafles occupy about 490 acres. The parifh for the 
molt part fupplies itfelf with articles of provifion, and 
rarely imports or exports. Oats in general are fown 
towards the middle and end of April, and reaped 
in O&amp;ober. Bear is fown about the beginning of May, 
and reaped in general in September. Turnip are fown to- 
wards the end of June. About 135 or 140 acres are em- 
ployed in railing foreft-trees. The valued rent of the pa- 
rifh is L. 2500 : 16 : 8 Scots. — The neighbourhood of 
Aberden is advantageous to the parifh, where it finds a 
ready market for every article of produce ; and has but a 
moderate diftance to carry lime, &amp;c. in return, for manu- 
ring its fields. Among its difad vantages, are to be num- 
bered its difficulty of improvement, (being in general full',

«f both rocks and ftones, and a confiderable part of it wet 
and fpongy), the fmall progrefs which agriculture hath hi- 
therto made, and I may add the quantity of mofs in the pa- 
rifli. The laft affertion may appear paradoxical. It is ne- 
verthelefs true : For till the lands belonging to the town of 
Aberdeen were feued, the greater number of the fubtenants, 
and many even of the tenants upon thefe lands, employed 
a great part of their time in digging and driving peat to 
Aberdeen, to the almoft total neglecl: of the cultivation of 
their fields, without deriving in return any proportionable 
compenfation. 

Stipend, Church, Poor, &amp;c. — The ftipend, includ- 
ing the glebe, is from L. 70 to L. 80 Sterling. Mr Skene 
of Skene is patron. When the church was built nobody 
knows. It is very old, and has not been repaired for a 
long time paft. The manfe was built in the year 1779. 
There are 4 heritors in the parifli, two of whom only re- 
fide, and one of thefe but occafionally. The number of 
poor receiving alms is at prefent 24. The annual amount 
of the contributions for their relief is about Jj. 11, 10 s. 
Sterling. The produce of legacies is L. 6, 10 s. Sterling. 

W ages, Fuel, 1$c. — The wages of a day-labourer, in huf- 
bandry and other work, are from 8 d. to i"s. ; a car- 
penter's from is. to is. 2d.; a mafon's about is. 6d. ; 
a taylor's about 8d. or 9 d.; a fmith's about 1 s. id. or is. 
2 d. The only fuel ufed in the parifli is peat : The mof- 
fes in this country, in general, are full of the roots of 
trees •, an evident proof, that it has been formerly much 
more covered with wood than it is at prefent. The 
irees commonly found in our moffes are oak, aller, elm,^a- 

zel

zel and common fir ; the oak predominates. The ufual 
wages of male-fervants are from L. 4 to L. 6 a-year, and 
of female-fervants from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling. The kind 
of plough, generally made ufe of, is the common Scotch 
plough. There are 140 carts ; only 1 chaife. 

Antiquities. — Befides 2 Druidical temples, pretty en- 
tire, and a number of barrows or tumuli, there are, 
on a moor covered with barrows, about an Englilh. 
mile S. of the church, evident traces of an encampment \ 
near which is a very large collection of ftones or a cairn. 
About 3-4ths of a mile N. E. of the church, on the top of 
a hill, are the remains of a wall, which appear to have 
been formerly reforted to as a place of ftrength. 

Mifcellaneom Obfervations. — The fpirit for induftry feems 
at laft to be roufing. Improvements of every kind are 
progreffive in their nature, and require time and encourage- 
ment to bring them to any degree of perfection. They 
are on their progrefs northward ; and he who mail ac- 
celerate it, well deferves to be accounted by his country a 
public benefactor. The (late of the roads is only tolerable j 
there are no turnpikes, and the opinion of the country 
feems, in general, to be againft them. Several bridges, 
that were very much wanted, have been erected. In-, 
clofing of.land is going on faft ; the rent of infield land, in 
general, may, at an average, be 14s. or 16 s. the acre; 
outfield about 2 s. 6d. pafture 6d. The rent of a mid- 
dling farm may be, at an average, from L. 25 to L. 30 
Sterling. The number of farms in the parifh is diminifh- 
ing. The improvements carrying on by one heritor, and 
the feuing, of late, of the lands belonging to the town of 

Aberdeen, 



of Skene. 



Aberdeen, may be affigned as the caufe ; by which laft, 31 
ploughs have been reduced to 14 5 but the rents have con. 
fiderably encreafed, and a fpirit of improvement has been 
excited. The fituation of the parifti in 1782 and 1783 
was, as I have been informed, very wretched ; and had 
not the peace, at that critical period, taken place, a fa- 
mine, it is believed, muft, in this country in general, have 
inevitably enfued. The peafe, which had been bought up 
for the ufe of the fleet, were imported in great quantities 
into Scotland; and this fupply, along with the laudable ex- 
ertions of communities and individuals, proved, under Pro- 
vidence, the means of faving the country.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010405">ABERLOUR</name>, 
(County of Banff.) 

By the Rev, Mr James Thomson.</head>



<p>Name, Skuatiori, Extent, Surface and Soil. 

r T^ HE ancient name of this parith was Shirdujlan, fo 
called from its tutelary faint, Duftan. Its modern 
name is Aberlour, derived from its local fituation ; being 
fituated at the mouth of a noify burn, where it difcharges 
itfelf into the Spey. It lies in the weftem part of the 
county of Banff, about 20 computed miles W. of the coun- 
ty-town, .10 S. of Elgin, and 12 S. E. of Forres. It 
gives name to the prelbytery to which it belongs, being 
the prefbytery-feat; and pertains to the Synod of Murray. 
The figure of the parilh refembles a wedge, being broad- 
er at the weft end, and growing gradually narrower 
towards the E. Its length from E. to W. is about 6 
Scotch miles ; its breadth from S. to N. at the weft end, 
about 5 Scotch miles ; about the middle, between 2 and 3, 
but at the eaft end it will not exceed an Englifh mile. 
It is bounded on the S. and S. E. by the parilh of Mort- 
lack, from which it is feparated by a fmall rivulet and a 
range of hills called the Convals ; it is bounded on the E. 
by the parilh of Eoharm, from which it is divided by a 

fmalji 



i 



of Aberlonr.

J'mall river called Fiddich; .on the N. by the parifh of 
Rothes, from which it is feparated by the river Spey ; 
on the N W. by the parilh of Knockandow, from which 
it is alfo feparated by the river Spey ; and on the W. 
and S W. by the parilh of Inveraven, from which it is 
divided by a hill called the Drum of Carron, the fmall 
water of Tarvey, and the hill of Allachoynachan, upon 
which the battle between the Earls of Argyle and Huntly, 
commonly called the battle of Glenlivat, was fought, 
The appearance of the parifh is various ; that part of it 
which lies N W. N. and E. and runs along Spey and Fid- 
dich, is flat ; that which lies towards the S E. and 
S W. is hilly. In the middle of the parifh Hands the 
high mountain of Belrinnes, from the top of which you 
can, in a clear day, fee as far S. as the Grampian hills, and 
as far N. and E. as the mountains of Rofs, Sutherland and 
Caithnefs. The foil towards the river is light, and when 
you dig to any depth, a flratum of fand. That which is 
towards the hills is deep, and a clay bottom. But both the 
one and the other are abundantly fruitful when properly 
clutivated. 

Rivers, &amp;c— Befides the Spey and Fiddich, there are 
a good number of fmall rivulets or burns, which abound 
with trout and eel, as do Spey and Fiddich ; in the for- 
mer of which confiderable numbers of falmon ufed to be 
Caught; and for a liberty of catching them with rods, 
dikes or cairns, the tenants, along the river-fide, paid to 
their refpe&amp;ive heritors a certain yearly tent, which was 
called water-rent. But, of late years, the quantity of fal- 
mon caught within the bounds of this parifh is greatly di- 
minifhed, in confequence of a procefs between the Duke of 
Gordon and the upper heritors, wherein it was found, 
that the Duke had a title to raife cruives acrofs the river, 

Vol. TV. j ,

Statijtical Account 



under certain regulations, and with what they call the Sun- 
day's fleep; the few that are ftill caught are fold within the 
parifh, in the beginning of the feafon, at 4d. the lb. and 
not below 2d. at any feafon. Within thefe 24 years paft, 
there have been more frequent overflowings of the Spey, 
than are remembered before that, by the oldeft man alive, 
and whereby the adjacent fields have been much damaged. 
In September 1768, efpecially, the river rofe about 18 
feet perpendicular above the channel, overflowed the 
fields, carried along with its ftream the cut corn, and 
large trees torn up by the roots, buried the corn which 
w r as not cut under a bed of fand above 30 inches deep, 
and left the falmon dead on the fields, at the diftance 
of above 100 yards from the bed of the river. There 
have been fundry extraordinary fvvellings of the river 
lince that time, but never to fuch a prodigious pitch, al- 
though the rains have been greater, and of longer dura- 
tion, in the low country ; from which it has been con- 
cluded, that the inundation in 1768 was occafioned by 
water-fpouts on the hills. 

Produce. — Though the parifh is rather calculated for grain 
than for pafture, it rears fufficient black cattle, fheep 
and hogs ; not only fupplying itfelf, but fending to 
market. Some of the beft farmers alfo bring up horfes 
fit for faddle and draught ; and although the diftricl: can- 
not be faid to be famous for breeding horfes, black cattle 
or fheep of fuperior qualities, yet there are, of each kind, 
fome raifed, which are efteemed very handfome, and well 
fhaped, for which the owners draw for horfes from L. 15 
to L. 20 Sterling ; for cows from L. 5 to L. 9 Sterling, 
for oxen from L. 8 to L. 12, and for fheep ten guineas 
the fcore. And as the parifh has thefe ufeful animals, it 
wants not thofe that are noxious ; fuch as, foxes, badgers, 

otters, 



of Aberlour. 6 J 



otters, Sec. It is alfo ftored with fowls and birds. Be- 
ing a highland country, abounding with woods, and al- 
moft furrounded with hills, there are muirfowls, pa- 
tridges, plovers, fnipes, lapwings, cormorants, hawks, 
magpies, and woodcocks at their feafon ; fometimes 
eagles are feen upon Belrinnes, and fome of their feathers 
are found there •, the night owl alfo fhows itfelf. The 
migratory birds are the cuckoo, which appears in the 
beginning of April, and difappears in Auguft ; the lap- 
wing, about the month of March, and is feldom feen 
after the end of July ; the fwallow about the firft of 
June, and difappears in the end of July ; the wood- 
cock about Odtober, and is fcarce feen after April. — The 
parifh produces grain of all forts, with any due culture ; 
and not only fupplies itfelf, but fells oats, meal and 
barley, fometimes to the highlands, and fometimes for 
exportation. It has alfo abundance of barren timber, ef- 
pecially oak, allar and birch, which grow naturally in large 
woods, and fome plantations of firs are lately planted. There 
are alfo fruit-trees, fuch as apple, pear, cherry trees, Sec. 
in fome gardens. Turnip and potatoes begin now to be 
raifed on every farm, though, being but lately introduced, 
in fmall quantities. The practice of planting cabbage in 
the fields has not got in here ; nor is it likely that it will 
be introduced foon, as almoft all the fields are without 
any fence ; and winter herding is not practifed. There 
is alfo fome flax raifed, but no hemp; and no great quan- 
tities of fown grafs. 

Population — According to Dr Webfler's ftate of the po- 
pulation, the number of inhabitants was ioio. There are, 
at prefent, about 920 fouls ; about 450 males, and 470 fe- 
males. The births and deaths bear not the ordinary pro- 
portion to the population. By fumming up the baptifms 

and 



68 



Statijlical Account 



and burials for 20 years, it appears, that the baptifms are ? 
at an average, 25, deaths 13, and marriages 8. Though 
there are fcarce any remarkable for longevity, yet the 
people are generally healthy, and, a few excepted, who are 
carried off by fmall pox and confumptions, arrive at 
the age of 70, 80, and not a few at 84. The whole 
are of the Eftablifhed Church, except about 10 or 11, 
who are Roman Catholics. The inhabitants, except a ve- 
ry few fervants and cottagers who come from Strathfpey 
and Badenoch, are natives, defcended from anceftors who 
have lived in the parifti for many generations ; and as there 
are very few who come from other places, fo there are 
as few who leave the pariih : For fince the year 1782, 
when there were whole families emigrating from the neigh- 
bouring parifhes to North America, none, except a few 
afpiring young men, who have had a more liberal education 
than their neighbours, have left this parifh, and gone, fome 
to London, fome to the Weft India Iflands. There is but 
one rending heritor. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, is'c. — The church feems to be 
very old, -and was repaired in 1 786. The ftipend till the 
year 1772 was only L. 50 ; but at that period the Earl of 
Fife, as patron, without any application from the incum- 
bent, or any in his name, with a generofity worthy of his 
Lordfhip, propofed an augmentation of the ftipend, and 
defired the incumbent to name what augmentation he 
thought the minifter of Aberlour ought to have ; who, 
with the advice of the prefbytery, propofed L. 8 : 6 : 8 
Sterling, of money, with 18 bolls of oat-meal, at 8 ftone 
the boll, which his Lordfhip agreed to, and obtained a de- 
creet, without any expence to the incumbent : So that, at 
prefent, the ftipend is L. 58 : 6 : 8 of money, and 18 bolls 

of 



of Aberlour. 



6 9 



of meal, with about a litttle more than 5 acres of arable 
ground for a glebe, little more than an acre of grafs, a 
manfe, garden ^nd offices. The funds for the poor are 
not great, though the number on the poor's roll is con- 
fiderable, there being juft now about 30. There is a mor- 
tification of 3-1- bolls of meal, at 9 ftone the boll, payable 
yearly ofF a fmall farm. One hundred merks, befides, 
were mortified by a farmer of the name of M'Erron -, 
another hundred merks by one of the name of Green ; 
both which fums, with any favings made in years of 
plenty, are lent out upon intereft, and amount now to 
about L. 80 Sterling of capital. The annualrent of this, 
with the above mentioned mortified meal, the weekly col- 
lections, amounting to about 2 s. Sterling, at an average, 
each Sabbath, with the produce of the mort cloth, and 
any fines for immoralities, are all the funds for aflifting this 
numerous roll. Indeed, in 1782, it was necefTary, by rea- 
fon of the fcarcity, to diminifli the capital ; but fince that 
time it has been raifed to what it is at prefent. 

Price of Provijtons and Labour. — The prices of victuals 
and clothing are greatly raifed within thefe 20 years paft. 
Meal, which before that period, would have been bought 
at 8 s. 4 d. the boll, now fells at 11 s. or 12 s. ; beef, which 
formerly fold at i4-d. a-pound, now gives 3d. or 4 d. ; 
" eggs, which were bought at id. for 14, coft now i-£ d. 
for 12; and fifti, which would have been bought at 5 d. 
the dozen, now coft is.; fo in proportion with refpedl: 
to every fort of provifions. The fame proportion holds 
with refpeft to clothes and ftioes ; yet the people feem fa- 
tisfied with their condition, live very comfortably, being 
generally very induftrious, and receive a proportional high 
price for any commodity they bring to market ; and the 

labouring

labouring people and fervants have nearly double the 
wages of what they had about 20 years ago. A day- 
labourer gets his vi&amp;uals and 6d. a-day, at anyfeafon; 
in harveft, 10 d. and is. A man-fervant, who can only 
drive a cart-horfe, is allowed L. 4 yearly; and he who 
can plow and fow, gets L. 5 or L. 6. A woman-fervant 
gets L, 2 a-year.

(County of Dunbarton.) 

By the Rev Mr George Drummond.</head> 

<p>Nai?ie, Situation, Soil, &amp;c. 

r TH H E ancient name of the parifli was Rojfnachoich, 
which is a Gaelic word, lignifying the " Virgin's 
" Promontory." The parilh is fituated in the moft wefterly 
part of Dunbarton-fliire, in the Synod of Glafgow and 
Air. It is a peninfula, nearly in the form of a parallelo- 
gram, being about 7 miles long and 2 broad, and is bounded 
on the land-fide towards the N. by the parifli of Row, on 
the W. by Lochlong, on the S. by the frith of Clyde, and 
on the E. by Gairloch. It is a continued ridge of riling 
ground, without any high hill or mountain, although fome 
parts of it are rocky. The higher grounds are covered 
with heath ; but the lands near the ftiore are green. The 
foil is various, part of it being fertile, and part barren ; 
part of it deep, and part fliallow. The air is naturally 
dry, but is frequently moiftened with fliowers. It is in ge- 
neral healthy. There are feveral fmall rivulets ; but, from 
the fituation of the parifli, no large rivers. We have a lake 
of about a mile in circumference, that abounds with perch. 

Coa/l,

Coaji, FiJJjeries, l£c. — The extent of coaft is about 1 3 
miles. The fliore is in fome places flat and fandy, but 
in general rocky and low. The filli commonly caught 
are herring, cod, mackerel, fkate, flounders and t falmon. 
Salmon are fold from 1 d. to 3 d. a-pound. The other fifln 
are fold by guefs or number, according to their fize. The 
falmon and herrings are caught with nets ; the other filh 
with lines. Greenock and Glafgow are the markets in 
which the fifli caught here are generally fold. There is a 
ftrong current in the Gairloch, between the parilhes of Rofe- 
neath and Row, oppofite to the church of Row, where there 
is a ferry. There are two bays on the coaft, one called Call- 
wattie, and the other Campfoil ; in which laft there is good 
anchorage, and fafe harbour for fhips of any burden. In 
the Duke of Argyle's park there is a remarkable rock^ 
which, though now at a confiderable diftarice from the 
Ihore, bears evident marks of having been walked by the 
fea. Its greateft perpendicular height is 34 feet. It is 
called Wallace's Loup, i. e. Leap, front a tradition, that the 
renowned Wallace, being clofely purfued by a party of his- 
enemies, jumped down this rock on horfeback, and efcaped 
unhurt •, but his horfe was killed by the fall, and was bu- 
ried at the foot of the rock, where his grave is fliewn. 

Produce, Rent, i£c. — The average produce of an acre is not 
eafily eftimated, both from the farmers being backward ir? 
difclofing their affairs, and from a want of knowing the 
number of acres in the parifh. The parifh could fufHcient- 
ly fupply its inhabitants with provifions, if they were not 
obliged to fell the produce for ready money, in order to 
pay their rents : When this is the cafe, they are under the 
neceffity of buying provifions again- for their own fupport; 
the purchafe-money for which arifes from the profits of 
the berring-filhery. The land-rent of the parifh is about 

L. 1000' 



of Rofeneath.

L. iooo Sterling. The annual rent of a cottage and yard 
is from 10 s. to 20 s. One falmon-fiihery, with a piece of 
ground, lets for L. 30 a-year. The Duke of Argyle has 
difcovered a Hate-quarry in this parifh, which at prefent 
promifes pretty well. Several thoufand Hates are already 
dug out, formed, and fliaped for ufe*

There are 98 houfes in the parifli, all which are detach- 
ed, there being no towns nor villages. The proportion of 
bachelors to married men and widowers, is as 2 to 3. Each 
marriage produces, at an average, nearly 3 children. The 
decreafe in the population, from what it was 40 years ago, 
is not to be afcribed to the attraaion of neighbouring manu- 
fadures, but is owing partly to one proprietor having taken 
into his own poffeffion fome farms upon which feveral 
families formerly lived, and partly to fome other farms 
being let to fewer tenants ; yet, even at prefent, we are 
flocked with inhabitants. 

Church, School, Poor, &amp;c— The church was rebuilt in

been taught for feveral years. The number of poor is 13. 
The annual amount of contributions for their relief, in- 
cluding the intereft of the parochial funds, is L. 18 Ster- 
ling. 

Price of Provifwns and Labour, ifc— The F efent current 
prices of beef and veal, are from 5d. to 7 d. the pound ; 
formerly they were from ai d. to 4d. the pound ; mutton 
and lamb, at prefent, from 4 d. to 6 d. a-pound •, formerly

prefent 3 d. formerly if d. the pound. Barley fells now 
at 15 s. a-boll, Dunbarton-mire, 8 ftone the boll, which is 
a peck and a half larger than Linlithgow meafure, for- 
merly it fold at 9 s. or 10 s. ; oats, at prefent 13 s. a-boll,

victuals, are from 10 d. to 1 s. and is. 2d.; a carpenter or 
wright, 2 s. a-day ; a mafon, 2 s. a-day ; a tailor, 8 d. a-day 
and his meat. Peats are the common fuel ufed here ; fome 
few families ufe coals, which are brought by water down 
theriver Clyde, from the neighbourhood of Glafgow. 
The price of them at the fliore here, including freight, &amp;c. 
is 5 s. the cart. The cart mould be 1200 weight. Peats 
are fold at 6 d. the creel. The average expence of a com-

mon labourer and his wife may be eftimated at L. 1 1 Ster- 
ling yearly: Many of them have aftually brought up 
pretty large families upon the wages they receive, and that 
without running much in debt. 

Mifcellaiteous Obfervations. — There are no ale-houfes, but 
plenty of whilky-houfes, here, which are rather unfriendly 
to the morals of the people. Twelve new houfes have 
been built within thefe 10 years ; for each of thefe, ex- 
cept 3, an old houfe has been pulled down. There are al- 
moft no cottagers employed in agriculture, unlefs by the 
Duke of Argyle. It is difficult to fay whether it is better 
to employ them or hired fervants. It is believed, that the 
cheapeft and moft expeditious method of carrying on work 
in this part of the country, is letting it by the piece, when, 
it can be done fo; For thefe 20 years and upwards, no perfon 
whatever, refiding within this parifh, has been imprifoned, 
except one poor man a fhort time for a fmall debt. Here rats 
cannot exift : Many of thefe have, at different times, been 
accidentally imported from veflels lying upon the fliore ; 
but were never known to live 12 months in the place. 
From a prevailing opinion, that the foil of this parifh is 
hoftile to that animal, fome years ago, a Weft India planter 
actually carried out to Jamaica feveral calks of Rofeneath 
earth, with a view to kill the rats that were deftroying his 
iugar-canes. It is faid this had not the defired effect ; fo 
we loft a very valuable export; Had the experiment fuc- 
ceeded, this would have been a new and profitable trade 
for the proprietors ; but perhaps, by this time, the parifh of 
Rofeneath might have been no- more.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">DRAINY</name>. 

(County of Elgin.) 

By the. Rev. Mr Lewis Gordon.</head>

<p>Situation, Extent, Name and Soil. 

THE parifh of Drainy is fituated in the Synod of Mo- 
ray, the county and prefbytery of Elgin, and about 
6 meafured miles from the royal borough of that name. 
It is a peninfula, ftretching E. and W. along the coaft, a- 
bout 2 meafured miles in its greateft breadth, and 4 in its 
greateft length ; bounded on the N. by the Moray frith ; 
on the S. by the lake of Spynie, which feparates it from 
the parifh of Spynie ; on the E. by the river of Loflie, 
which divides it from the parifhes of St Andrew's and Ur- 
quhart ; and on the W. by the parifh of DufFus. Drainy 
confifts of the 2 ancient parifhes of Kinneddar and Ogftown, 
which were united foon after the Refloration. It obtained 
its name from a new centrical church being built, in con- 
fluence of this annexation, on the lands of Drainy, which 
probably were called fo from draining the neighbour- 
ing fwamps and marfhes. In general, this part of the coun- 
try is low and flat. There are only two fmall eminences 
that deferve the name of hills. Scarcely one half of the 
i'urface is arable, the greateft part confifting of barren moor- 
ground, covered with fhort heath, or coarfe benty grafs. 
The land under cultivation is very fertile, part of it being 

a

Statijlical Account 



a rich loam or clay, and part a light, black, or fandy 
foil. 

Rent, ManufaBures, l£c. — The valued rent is L. 3044, 
1 7 s. 4 d. Scotch ; and the real rent may be eftimated at about 
L. 1200 Sterling, though this niuft depend on the price of 
grain. There is only one rending heritor, who poflefles 
two-thirds of the property ; the remaining third belongs to 
the only other heritor. It is a great misfortune that no 
manufactures have been eftablifhed here, as fcarcely any 
part of Scotland is better adapted for them. The women 
fpin linen-yarn •, by which, with the greateft application, 
they can only earn from 2 d. to 3 d. a-day •, and even this 
yarn, except what is neceffary for our own confumption, is 
exported (unwrought) to Edinburgh, Glafgow, or the N. 
of England. The 2 hills, mentioned above, abound with ex- 
cellent quarries of white and yellow free-ftone, which is 
not to be found any where elfe in the Moray frith. About 
20 mafons, including apprentices, and nearly double that 
number of labourers, are conftantly employed in quarrying 
and drefhng ftones, to fupply the demand for that article 
from this and the neighbouring counties. 

Village of LoJJiemouth, Imports and Exports.— The princi- 
pal village here is Loffiemouth, a fea-port belonging to

tants. There are no veffels belonging to the place, except 1 
I floop and 2 fifliing-boats. But during the laft year 49 
veffels, from 55 to 60 tons burden, at an average, entered 
this harbour. The imports and exports were as follow s

Exports were 20 cargoes barley and oats, at an ave- 
rage, about 400 bolls each, and an inconfiderable quantity 
of peltry. The quantity of corn formerly exported from 
this county, was reckoned, at an average, 20,000 bolls 
yearly. But it is probable this exportation will, in future, 
be fomewhat reduced, as the fmuggling of foreign fpirits is 
now, in a great meafure, fupprefied, and whifky is fub- 
ftituted in their place. Twenty licenfed ftills are at pre- 
fent employed in this county ; and a coniiderable quantity 
of the fpirits is manufactured, and confumed in the high- 
lands of Moray and Invernefs-ihire. 

Fijhing Towns. — There are other 2 creeks in the parilli 
that admit boats, Caufea and Stotfield ; at the latter there 
are at prefent .3 fiftiing-boats, which, with the 2 at Loflie- 
mouth, are a vaft benefit to the town of Elgin, and to the coun- 
try at large, in fupplying white fifti. The rent derived from 
thefe fifliing-boats is L. 5 Sterling each yearly : But the 
proprietors are obliged to furnifh a new boat every feventh 
year, which cofts, when rigged and complete, from L. 18 
to L. 20 Sterling. The fifh commonly taken on this coaft, 
are cod, fkate, hollibut, haddocks, whitings, faiths or cud- 
dies, with plenty of crabs and lobfters ; but none of them

in greater quantity than to anfwer the demand for home 
consumption. 

^ River and Lafos.— The river Loflie has its fource in the 
hills of fDallas ; and, after a courfe of near 26 meafured 
miles, difcharges itfelf into, the fea at the town of Loflie- 
mouth, in the N. E. corner of this parilh. It is too fmall 
to be navigable beyond its mouth, and its bed too fandy to 
be favourable to falmon ; yet about 3 or 4 fcore of that fim 
have fometimes been taken in a feafon, at its entry into 
the fea. It abounds with excellent red fpotted trout, from 
I lb. to 3 lb. and even fometimes 4 lb. in weight, called 
here phinnocks. — The loch of Spynie is a beautiful piece 
of frefh water, about 1 mile broad and 3 miles long, which 
difcharges itfelf into the river Loflie, about a mile from 
the fea.- It abounds with eel and pike, and water-fowl of 
•various kinds ; fuch as, fwans, geefe, duck, teal, &amp;c. This 
loch, at fome former period, appears evidently to have form- 
ed a bay of the fea, and to have been connected with ano- 
ther loch in the parifh of Urquhart, called Cotts, which is 
only half a mile diftant. The mouth Of this bay is formed 
by 2 banks of hard gravel about 500 yards afunder, and 
the water of Loflie pafling through this opening, feems, in 
a feries of ages, to have carried down fuch a quantity of 
fand, as to have at length feparated thefe lochs from each 
other, and fliut up their communication with the fea. The 
beds of fliells all around the loch of Spynie, and the names 
of places in the neighbourhood, clearly prove that it has 
formerly been conne&amp;ed with the fea ; and there are alfo 
fome written evidences of the fame fad. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, School, Ifc. — The church was 
built more than 100 years ago, and looks tolerably decent 
without, but is very naked and ill finimed within. Our 

churches 



of Brainy . 8 1 

churches are, in general, exceedingly cold and dirty, and 
there is little hope of this evil being foon remedied. The 
patrouage belongs to the family of Gordonflon. The 
flipend is 72 bolls of barley and oats, and L. 50 Sterling of 
money, with L. 2, 10 s. for communion-elements. The 
manic and offices are new ; the glebe and gardens contain 
about 5 Scotch acres. The old church of Ogftown is now 
converted into a burying place for the family of Gordon- 
flon, and was rebuilt fome time ago with great tafte, in 
the ancient Gothic flyle. The veftiges of the old church 
are to be feen in the church -yard at Kinneddar, and adjoin- 
ing to thefe the remains of an old palace or caftle belonging to 
thp Biihop of Moray, where he refided before the caftle of 
Spynie was built. - - The parochial funds are very inconfi- 
derable, the whole income not exceeding L. 20 Sterling ; 
and this fum, out of which the falary of the feffion-clerk,, 
beadle, and other parochial charges, muft be paid, is all 
the provifion for 40 or 50 poor.— At the parifli-fchool, 
about 30 or 40 children are inftrudted in Latin, Englifh, 
" writing and arithmetic. The falary of the fchoolmafler is 
12 bolls barley, befides the emoluments arifing from the 
office of feffion-clerk, which is commonly conjoined with 
that of fchoolmafler, and amounts to L. 3 Sterling, exclufive 
of a few trifling percmifites.

The number of inhabitants has not varied much for thefe 
laft 20 years; vibrating generally from 1020 to 1050. 

In general, the climate of this country is mild and whole- 
fome. There is more dry weather in the narrow flip a- 
long the Moray -fliire coaft, than in moll other parts in 
Scotland, owing to the land being very low and plain, 
and the clouds being attracted by the high hills to 
the fouthward ; fo that often in fummer, when this parilh. 
is burned up with drought, rain falls in abundance in 
the high country. One happy confequence of this pe- 
culiar fituation is the goodnefs of the harvefts ; even in 
1782 the greateft part of the crop here was got in without 
damage. — There are no extraordinary inftances of lon- 
gevity here, nor are there any difeafes peculiar to this di- 
ftricl:. Agues were very common about 25 or 30 years a- 
go, in the marfliy parts of Drainy and DufFus, but have 
for fome time paft totally difappeared. The complaints 
that prevail moft among the lower claffes of people, are 
obfiinate coughs and colds, attended with pain of the breafl, 
difficulty of breathing, and fwelling in the extremities, ef- 
pecially in the winter-feafon, and are very fatal. They 
feem to be occafloued by the coldnefs and dampnefs of 
the houfes, and the great fcarcity of fuel, for there are no 
peats nearer than the diflance of 10 meafured miles. If 
the attention of Government could be awakened to the 
many evils ariling from the impolitic tax on coals, and 
could be prevailed upon to fubftitute fome other revenue 
in its Head, it would be of effential benefit to the North of 
Scotland in general, and to this province in particular. 

Produce, Rent, "Sc— All the kinds of grain raifed in 
Scotland fucceed here ; but barley is the principal crop. 
Flax is alfo cultivated, but to no great extent. Potatoes 
thrive admirably well in our light ground, and ferve for

the fubfiftence of the poor, at leaft a third part of the year. 
Agriculture is the chief employment of the people ; 
yet the modern improvements in hulbandry are only in 
their infancy, lnclofures are yet far from being general. 
The introduction of turnips and fown grafles promifes to 
be of infinite advantage, as proper food for our cattle was 
fcarce both in fummer and winter. There are in the pa- 
rifti in all about 96 ploughs ; the number of horfes is from 
300 to 400 ; the black cattle about double that number ; 
fheep from ijoo to 200c, and from 20 to 3c fwine or 
hogs. — The rent of land, when paid in grain, is from a 
boll to a boll and a half of bear or oats, Linlithgow meafure, 
the Scotch acre ; but it is the practice here to allow 
5 firlots of oats to a boll, being nearly equal to an Englifli 
quarter. Lands, when fet for money alone, give from 
15 s. to 20s. and 21 s. the acre. — In fome part of this pa- 
rilh the teinds are drawn in kind, that is, the tenth mock 
or fheaf is carried off" the field before the corns are 
Hacked, and this is commonly reckoned equal to a third 
of the rent actually paid. 

Prices, Wages, &amp;c. — The price of bear and oats for 
thefe laft 10 years, has not been lefs than 15 s. the boll, at 
an average. Beef and mutton commonly fell in the Elgin 
market from 3d. to 4c]. the lb. Amfierdam weight; geefe 
from is. 6 d. to 2 s.; hens and ducks from 8 d. to pd. 
each ; eggs ifd. the dozen. — The ordinary wages of male 
day-labourers here, without victuals, are 8d. in fummer, and 
of females 4d. ; but both get higher wages in harveft. Men- 
fervants employed in hulbandry commonly get from L. 5 
to L. 8, and women-fervants from 30s. to 40s. a-yeajr, and 
their victuals. Victual at the Reformation was converted 
at half a merk Scotch the boll. 



Minerals^ 



of ~D rainy. 



Minerals, Rocks, i$c. — In the Coulart hill, between Lof- 
fiemouth and Stotfield, there are appearances of lead : Ma- 
ny detached mafles of ore are to be feen in the rocks. 
Some adventurers, however, lately came from England, 
and after fpending above L. 500 Sterling, could difcover 
no vein of ore worth the expence of working. The hill 
of Caufea, or Cave-fea, conliits of one uninterrupted mafs 
of free-ftone, more than a mile long, divided into horizon- 
tal ftrata of different' degrees of thicknefs and hardnefs, 
• but generally foft and friable. This hill forms a very 
bold ihore ; and the violence of the winds and furge, has 
cut and excavated the free-ftone rock fo as to form many 
curious arches, caves, and pyramids, of various liz.es and fi- 
gures. Thefe rocks are covered, in fummer, with different 
kinds of plants of variegated colours, and are frequented by 
crows, pigeons, gulls, and other birds, in prodigious num- 
bers. In the fummer time, the noife of the fea below, the 
varied cries of the birds, the beauty of the flowers, and the 
grandeur of the rocks-, all heighten the fcenery of the place. 
There was alfo at Lofliemouth, in a natural cave, a fmall her- 
mitage, not exceeding 10 feet fquare, called St Gerardine's 
Cave, which commanded a view of the fhore as far as Cul- 
len, and was adorned with a handfome Gothic door and win- 
dow; but thefe artificial decorations were pulled down about 
25 years ago, by a rude ftripmafter ; and in the courfe of 
working the quarries, the whole cave has fince been totally 
deftroyed. There was a fpring in the rock above the her- 
mitage, called St Gerardine's Well 3 but neither this, nor 
any other fprings in the parifh, have acquired fame for 
their medicinal virtues. 



Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The inhabitants of this pa- 
rifh, like all others employed in hufbandry, are robuft and 
healthy. Their general charader is that of a fober, honeft, 

peaceable 



86 



Statiflical Account 



peaceable people, regular in their attendance on the ordi- 
nances of religion, rather grave than lively, feldom in- 
dulging themfelves in any relaxation or diverfion, except- 
ing the young people, who fometimcs take a dance at 
Chriftmas, or at a penny -wedding*. Crimes of great e- 
normity are unknown here. There has not been an in- 
ftance of filicide during the 22 years of the prefent mini- 
fter's incumbency; nor has any native of this parilh 
been hanged or banilhed, in the memory of man. This 
regularity of conduct muft in part be afcribed to the 
poverty ' and depreffion of the people ; for the fituation 
of the fmall tenants in this country, in general, is far from 
being comfortable. Few of them have any capital to be- 
gin the world with ; and fewer have any inclination to a- 
dopt the modern improvements in hufbandry, while the 
rents of their farms, and the wages of their fervants, have 
of late been confiderably advanced. The lafl article, in 
particular, is nearly doubled within thefe 20 years paft. 
One advantage they derive from their vicinity to the fea, 
in being fupplied from the fhores with a conliderable quan- 
tity of fea- weed, which is a valuable manure. 

It is perhaps a fingular circumftance, that, in this parilh, 
there is no lawyer, writer, attorney, phyfician, furgeon, 
apothecary, negro, Jew, gipfy, Englifliman, Irifliman, fo- 
reigner of any defcription, nor family of any religious feet 
or denomination, except the Eftablifhed Church. 

There are 4 ale-houfes, and fewer would hardly accom- 
modate the neighbourhood, as there is generally a refort of 
ftrangers to fea-port towns. There can be no doubt but 

an 

• A penny-wedding is when the expence of the marriage entertain- 
ment is not defrayed by the young couple, or their relations, but by a 
club among the guefls. Two hundred people of botli feses, will fon-.'- 
times be convened cn an occafion of this kind.

an increafe of them would prove a real nuifance, and con- 
tribute materially to corrupt the morals of the people. 

The only language here is Scotch ; but the pronouncia- 
tion is gradually approaching nearer to the Englifli*. 
Gaelic is not fpoken nearer than 20 miles ; and very few 
of the names of places here feem derived from it. 

There are no bridges in this parilh, excepting a fmall 
one of 3 arches on the outlet from the loch of Spynie ; 
nor is there any on the river Lome below Elgin, though 
much wanted. The roads here are all made by the fta- 
tute-labour ; and though better than they were formerly, 
are ftill far from what they ought to be : And this is the 
more inexcufable, as they are more eafily made here than 
in moft counties in Scotland. On the highland road to 
Edinburgh, a traveller meets with no turnpikes or tolls till 
he arrives at Perth. 

I have often thought, that the deftruction of grain by 
pigeons was much greater than commonly fuppofed. 
There are 4 pigeon-houfes here , each of which, at a mo- 
derate computation, confumes 20 bolls of corn annually.

            PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011351">ARDERSIER</name>. 

(County of Inverness.) 

By the Rev. Mr Pryse Campeell.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil and Surface. 

A RDERSIER is written Ardnafeer in the charters 
Xl of the parifli. According to tradition, it obtained 
its name from a great number of carpenters being drowned 
in the ferry, oppofite to the point of Arderfier ; this ac- 
cident happened, it is faid, in the year in which the Ca- 
thedral at Elgin, and that at Channonry or Fortrofe, were 
built. In the Gaelic language, faor is " a carpenter,'' and ard 
is " high." That part of the parifli adjoining to the fea, and 
by which it is warned, is exceeding high, upwards of 100 
yards, and it is probable enough that the parifli might 
have received its name from fuch an accident ; but it is 
fully as natural to conclude that it obtained its name from 
its high fituation, and that Ardna faor (Ardnafeer) is a 
corruption from ard'n Fhaobhair, which fignifies " the 
*« high edge" or « height of the edge," i. e. of the hill. 
The parifli is in the prefloytery of Nairn, and Synod 
of Moray. Its length is two and a half miles, and 
breadth the fame. It is bounded by the parifli of Petty, 

on 



Statiflical Account, &amp;c. 



89 



on the W. and S. ; by the parifh of Nairn, on the E. ; 
by the Moray frith, on the N. The greateft part of the 
old cultivated land lies high, but much of what is not in 
culture is low. There is a great variety of foils ; deep 
black mould, ftrorrg' clay, light black mould, and mallow 
fandv foil. The parifh in general is very t fertile. The 
more very fandy and flat from Invernefs to Nairn. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, according to 
the oldeft people now alive, would not exceed 300, 60 or 
even 50 years ago. Dr Webfter's ftate was 428; the a- 
mount of the inhabitants now is 802. Males 385 j fe- 
males 417. In the village of Gampbelltown, which owe9its 
birth to the garrifon of Fort-George, there are 293 fouls. 
The garrifon of Fort-George, exclufive of the marching 
regiment ftationed in it, but including 3 companies of* in- 
valids, confifts of 496 fouls, of whom are 246 males, and 



250 females.

None are under any neceffity to leave the parifh for 
want of employment, but many go fouth in fummer and 
harveft, owing to the difference of wages. 

Agriculture, Isfc. — Of black cattle there are about 300 ; 
horfes, 100 ; fheep, about 50c. The parifh contains 
1985 acres, exclufive of the king's farm ; in railing corn

and undergrafs, about 1018 acres; in. muir, 966; under 
artificial grafs, about 168. It fupplies itfelf, and exports 
about 300 bolls. The rent of the parifh, including the 
farm fold to Government when the garrifon of Fort- 
George was built, is L.365 ; the rent of that farm feparate- 
ly is L. 50. The rent for an acre of the bell arable land is 
30 s. ; of inferior land, is from 5 s. to 7 s. 6 d. This pa- 
rifh is moftly in the poiTeffion of 1 farmer, but the greateft 
part he fubfets into farms from 20 to 30 acres. Great 
quantities of fea-ware fit for manure are fometimes thrown 
in by the tides. There are fcarcely any inclofures except 
a few of feal or earth. The common people are inimical 
to them, as they are almoft to every proper method of 
cultivating their land. In 1782 and 1783, the people were 
in a miferable fituation, many of them would have perifhed, 
had it not been for the grain imported from other countries : 
The boll of Englifli peafe, barley and rye, fold for 28s. 

Church, Stipend and Poor. — The church and manfe, 
which are in a ruinous date, were built with clay in 1769. 
The ftipend is 80 bolls of barley, and L. 10 of moneys 
the glebe is worth L. 8. Mr Campbell of Calder is patron. 
The number of poor is 50 •, the only fund for their relief 
is the annual collections, which amount to L. 15. 

Mifcettaneous Obfervations. — The parilh has its advan- 
tages and difadvantages. Its vicinity to Fort-George, 
where every thing may be fold, is a particular conveniency, 
and the ware obtained from the Ihore is of great value. 
The difadvantages are want of woods and ftones. The 
air is extremely fharp ; in winter very piercing. The 
Gaelic and Englifh languages are fpoken equally well. 
The names of all the towns are derived from the Gaelic j

-» gal's town," &amp;c The common price of beef, veal, mut- 
ton, lamb, pork, is 3d. the lb.; agoofe 2 s. ; a duck 6d.; 
a chicken 3d. j a hen 6d. ; butter 8d. the lb. 17^ oz. to the 
lb.-, cheefe 5 s. the ftone ; wheat 24 s. barley 16 s. and 
18 s. oats 16 s. the boll. Labourers in hufbandry receive 8 d. 
a-day. By the better fort, coal is the fuel made ufe of, by 
the country-people peats and turf. The average price of 
coal the barrel is as. ; peats 8d. the load, about 70 peats 
to a load. The coal is brought from Sunderland and New- 
caftle. The mofs is 3 miles diftant, and is almoft exhaust- 
ed. Male fervants for labouring receive L.4 and L. 5 a- 
year, female from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2. The Scotch plough 
is ufed by the common tenants ; the Englilh plough, and 
Lord Kaimes's plough with a chain, by the principal far- 
mers. There are 8 boats, from 5 to 8 tons burden, em- 
ployed in white and herring fifhing ; the herrings are 
chiefly fold to fifhing buffes. Befides herring, the fifti pro- 
duced on the coaft are, haddocks, cod, falmon : The prices 
have been high and variable for 6 years back, owing to 
fcarcity : They are fold to the inhabitants of Fort-George, 
Invernefs, and the country around. Eight feamen enter- 
ed into the navy laft war ; 4 have entered this year. The 
roads are exceeding good. The ftatute-labour is exacled. 
Where this parifli is divided from that of Nairn, there is a 
ftone about 6 feet high and 3 broad : This ftone in the 
-Gaelic language obtains the name of claoch na cabbac ; in 
the Englifh, or rather Scotch, " cabbac ftone." Cabbac or 
cabback, signifies a cheefe. The report of tradition is, 
that it was erecled there over a chieftain who fell in a 
fcuffle which originated about a cheefe, in the toWn of 
Invernefs; the death of one of the chiefs put an end to 
vthe battle, where the ftone is erecled. This ftory is told 
iby the oldeft people in the country, and obtains credit.

Hp HE name of the pariih, (fometimes corruptly fpelled 
-*- Teliti), is Gaelic, and fignifies " a country of brooks 
" or waters;" in which, indeed, this fmall diftricl a- 
bounds. It is fituated in the prefbytery of Bun- 
dee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. It lies alon^. 
the fouth fide of the Seidlavv hills, and is about 3 Eng- 
lilh miles from E. to W.; and from 2 to 1 N. and 3. ex- 
clufive of two fmall farms which run out about 2 miles 
farther to the N. ; and a third entirely detached from it on 
the W. It is is bounded on the W. by the parish of Auch- 
terhoufe ; by thofe of Glammis and Kinnettles on the N. ; 
by Inverarity and Murrofe on the E. ; and on the S. by 
Mains and Strathmartine. Its boundary on the N. is, for

of firs, containing not lefs than 150 acres. » The fummit of 
the higheft, called Craig Owl, is found, by actual meafure- 
ment, to be 1100 feet above the plain ; but the plain itfelf 
is full 500 feet above the level of the fea. There is fome 
grey Hate, a good deal of moor-ftone, and plenty of free- 
ftone. The laft, however, lies rather deep, and is fome - 
what difficult to be got at. 

The cultivated part of the parifh forms a plain gently 
declining towards the S. ; of a foil light and gravelly towards 
the hill, rather fitter for pafture than tillage, black, deep 
and rich, fometimes inclining to clay in the middle ; in the 
fouthern parts rather marlhy, and moftly ufed as pafture, 
or natural meadow. The great fault of the foil in general 
is an excefs of moifture, owing partly to the vicinity of 
the hill, but chiefly to a ftratum of clay, or rather clay and 
gravel, which runs immediately under the whole of it. 
The air is rather moift and cold, yet not, upon the whole, 
unhealthful. Sickly people from other quarters, fometimes 
find a fummer's relidence in it beneficial. The rheuma- 
tifm is the only diftemper remarkably prevalent. It may 
in part be owing to the nature of the air ; but more pro- 
bably to the damp earthen floors, and infufficient doors 
and windows of the greater part of the houfes. 

Population.— The, population of this parilh, according to 
the return made to Dr Webfter, amounted to 755 fouls. 
At prefcnt the number of fouls is 802 ; of families 158, 
perfons to a family, 5. The people live all of them in 
fingle houfes, or in hamlets. The increafe in the popula- 
tion is to be afcribed to the ereaion of fome new farms. 
Several young people every year move to the fouthward, 

to

to learn the handicraft trades. The annual average of 
births is 23; of marriages, 6; of burials, 18. A woman, 
about 20 years ago, died here, at the age of 102. There 
are 5 heritors, only one of whom refides. The number 
of confiderable farmers is 13. Befides thefe, there may 
be 15 or 16 who poffefs from ic to 30 acres each, and 1 
or 2 horfes. The other great clafs of inhabitants is wea- 
vers, of which there are about 90 employed in the manu- 
facture of coarfe linens, which find a ready market at Dun- 
dee. The flax is moftly foreign, and brought from the 
town juft mentioned ; but the far greater part of the yarn is 
fpun in the pariih. Two families of Independents are the 
only diflenters from the Eftabliihed Church. 

Cultivation, Produce, ifc. — Water has been long ufed as 
a manure in feveral parts of this county, and in other quar- 
ters of the kingdom ; but as the fubjecl of watering in 
general, is either altogether omitted, or but (lightly men- 
tioned by feveral of our belt writers on hulbandry, the fub- 
fequent account of the mode of watering land, adopted 
by Mr Scrymfoure of Tealing, may be of fome utility. 

Mr Scrymfoure waters no lands but fuch as are of a dry 
black or loamy foil. Sand can receive but little benefit 
from water, as it cannot retain it for any time. Clay 
is rather chilled, and (efpecially if the following feafon 
prove remarkably dry) too much hardened by it. 
He does not water any field till it has been at leaft 
two years in grafs. Perhaps the year before it is bro- 
ken up, is the moll proper for the operation. He finds 
the fpring and autumn to be the fitteft" feafons for it. If it 
be done in the fpring, it fhould be before the grafs has made 
any confiderable advances, otherwife that crop will be apt 
to fuffer by it. If in autumn, it will be proper to 
draw off the water before the ftrong frofts fet in. Pre- 
vious to the operation, it is neceflary to fpread the mole- 
hills 



of dealing. , 95 

hills with grear care •, as alfo with the foot, to prefs down 
the run of moles, fo far as it can be difcerned, as it is verj 
apt to draw off the water in an improper direction. The 
procefs commences with the drawing of water-furrows. 
Firft, one broad and deep furrow is drawn in the crown, 
and from end to end of the head-ridge, on the higheft fide 
of the field. This is to ferve as a channel for the whole 
water you intend to make ufe of; and muft be enlarged to 
a fufficient capacity with the fpade, if it cannot be done 
with the plough. If the ridges be level, another furrow is 
drawn parallel to the firft, of equal length to it, and a- 
bout 8 or ic yards diftant from it ; and furrows in this 
manner are drawn down through the whole field. The 
more the ground Hopes, the more numerous thefe furrows 
muft be ; and care muft always be taken, that the fward 
turned up by the plough, be thrown upon the lower fide. 

The water is then brought in at the higheft corner of 
the field, and allowed to run in the channel or great fur- 
row, for the breadth of 4, 5, or perhaps 6 ridges, ac- 
cording to the quantity of the ftream. It is then dammed 
up, when upon a fmall opening being made in the lower 
fide of the furrow, oppofite to the crown of each ridge, 
it pours itfclf in an equal manner into the field be- 
low. It is foon intercepted by the next furrow, which 
ferves not only as a channel for it, but as a dam-dike to 
make it fpread itfelf over a confiderable part of the ground 
immediately above : When it begins to overflow, let fmall 
apertures be made in the furrow oppofite to thofe men- 
tioned before, and for the fame purpofe. In this manner 
is it fent from furrow to furrow, till it reaches the loweft 
fide of the field. When the firft 5 or 6 ridges are done fuffi- 
ciently, (that is, when they are faturated with the water, 
which may be known by the foft fwelling of the ground, 

and 



9 6 



Statijlical Account 



and the bright verdure of the graft), open the main fur- 
row againft other 5 or 6, and thus go along the whole. 

When the ridges are much raifed in the crown, as is ftill 
the cafe in many parts of the country, the furrows mud 
be made in a different manner. One communicating with 
the firft or great furrow muft be drawn down the crown of 
every ridge, unlefs it was cloven when laid down. in graft. 
From this again, at every 6 or 8 yards diftance, others muft 
be made, pointing obliquely down the fides of the ridge, 
till they meet and form an angle with others drawn in the 
fame manner on the next ridge, taking care, as in the cafe 
above mentioned, that the plough throw the earth toward 
the lower fide. The water is then let down into the 
crown -furrows, and flopped at proper diftances, fo as to 
make it fpread over both lides of the ridge. 

It would be vain to attempt to give directions for eve- 
ry particular fituation or furface of ground. The great 
general rule is to draw your furrows in fuch a manner 
as to diftribute the water equally and plentifully over 
every part. By attending to this, and taking a careful 
furvey of the field, an intelligent ploughman will very 
foon fee what he has to do. This alfo is to be attended to, 
after the water is brought upon the ground, and it will re- 
quire a daily vifit from a careful hand with a fpade, to re- 
move obftruftions that may have dropt into the furrows ; 
to place others properly; and to lead the water to fuch 
heights and dry fpots as may have been overlooked. Mr 
S. fometimes employed a man for this fole purpofe. It 
is ever to be kept in mind, that it is only when made to 
ftand or ftagnate on the ground, that water operates to ad- 
vantage : But whether this be by depofiting on the foil 
fuch rich particles, as make the immediate food of plants, 
or by diffolving and macerating it ; or which is moft pro- 
bable, 



of Tealifig. gy 

bable, by both thefe means, it is not neceflary here to 
determine. Indeed Mr S. is inclined to think that it ex- 
cites a proper fermentation, and the foftnefs which the 
foil thereby acquires and preferves for a confiderable time 
after, together with fome other circumftances, feems to fa- 
vour the fuppofition. 

While the ground is under water, and even for fome 
days after it is laid dry, no cattle of any kind mould be 
allowed to fet foot on it. The water mould be withdrawn 
rather gradually as otherwife, at leaft in a dry feafon, 
the grafs will be a little apt to decay. There is no ftri- 
king difference between the effects of water which runs 
from pools, or foft water of any kind, and thofe of hard 
water immediately from the fpring. The former is, no 
doubt, preferable, but the latter will ferve the purpofe ve- 
ry well ; and this feems to be agreeable to the experiments 
of Dr Home. — Such is the method of watering land, 
which Mr S. has followed with great fuccefs for nearly the 
fpace of fifty years. There is one inclofure of his which, 
by this management, was brought from an cxhaufted Hate 
into good heart, and preferved an uncommon degree of 
fertility for a fucceffion of crops (one of them wheat) with- 
out fallow, lime or marl, and with very moderate affiftance 
from dung. 

With refpedl to the fubjecT: in general, it may be ob- 
ferved, that water not only ferves to enrich the land for 
future crops of corn, but alfo generally fecures an early 
and a large crop of grafs the year in which it is applied, 
a matter of confiderable importance, efpecially in a dry and 
backward fpring. Perhaps the only, inconveniency at- 
tending it is its encouraging weeds of a certain kind, fuch 
as, thifUes, ragweed, &amp; c . ; but this appears to be fully ba- 
lanced by the deftruftion it occafions to weeds of another 
VoL ' IV « N kind ,

kind, fuch as commonly infeft dry lands, but never thri ve 
in water. 

As to grain and other crops, it appears from feveral 
circumftances, that wheat was cultivated long ago to a 
confiderable extent. The culture of it was revived about 
10 or 12 years fince •, when, after a very fair trial by a 
number of hands, it was entirely given up as unprofitable. 
It was found to ripen late and to impoverifli the foil. 
Oats, barley, and a few hailing peafe, are the oi ly kinds 
of grain raifed at prefent. About 20 acres may be em- 
ployed in the culture of flax. Turnip and potatoes are 
raifed on every farm, as are alfo clover and rye-grafs. 
Some yams have been planted within thefe few years, 
and the farmers feem to approve of them. 

Of foreft-trees the afii, fir, elm and beechj thrive well. 
Oaks of a large fize have been dug up in fome moffy parts 
of the plain, and fome that have been planted of late are 
fufficiently forward, Fruit-trees grow much to wood, 
and it muft be owned difficult to raife fruit : The dif- 
ficulty however is fenfibly decreafing, both the air and 
foil becoming more kindly by draining and planting the 
latter, particularly on the eaft. 

The number of horfes is about 200, about one third of 
which may be reared in the parifli. Black cattle being 
ufed in labour now, there are about 30 kept for that pur- 
pofe ; cows about 300. With regard to fheep, it is re- 
markable, that about 25 years ago there were 12 fmall 
flocks in the parifli, but that now there is not a fingle ani- 
mal of the kind, fave a few kept by a gentleman moftly 
for the ufe of his own family. They were found deftruc- 
tive to the fown grafs, and liable to perifli for want of pro- 
per Ihelter. Young black cattle have been, with great ad- 
vantage, put in their place.

that they reap rather later than fome of their neighbours. 
Harveft commonly begins about the 10th September. 
There are about 280 acres in wood; arable inclofed, 550. 
The land-rent is about L. 1400. 

Church crnd Stipend, School and Poor.— -The church is of 
very ancient foundation, having been firft built by Boni- 
face, a legate or rather miflionary from Rome, about A. D. 
690. The prefent fabric, however, bears no marks of 
antiquity, and is but indifferent both as to ftyle and con- 
dition. A few fragments of carved ftones feem to indicate 
that the original church was an elegant Gothic ftru&amp;ure. 
The ftipend is about 2000 merks Scots, exclusive of the 
manfe and garden ; as to the glebe, it would be, as it gene- 
rally is in the country, rather a difadvantage, if the incum- 
bent had not been fo lucky as to get a fmall farm. The 
Crown is patron. ,

The average number of fcholars at the parochial fchool 
is only about 30, owing to the badnefs of the roads here 
in the winter-feafon, and the nearnefs of the Ikirts of the 
pariih to the fchools of the parifhes around. The quarter- 
ly payments are, for Englifti, is, 6d. ; for writing, 2 s.; 
for arithmetic, 2 s. 6d. The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 6 
Sterling, and as feffion-clerk he receives L. 2, with about 
L. 1 more in perquifites for baptifms and marriages. 
His whole emoluments, exclufive of a houfe, garden 
and fmall glebe of about an EnglHh acre, do not exceed 
L. 1 7 Sterling. The number of conftant poor is 4 ; of 
thofe who receive occafional fupplies, 5.

Wages, iic. — Common wages of a day-labourer in huf- 
bandry, 8d. and victuals; in time of harveft, is. a man, and 
o,d. a woman, befides victuals. About 40 years ago, wa- 
ges were 6d. or 4d. and victuals. As a child, in this part 
of the country, commonly finds employment at 8 or 9 
years of age, a labourer has feldom, entirely at leaft, upon 
his hands above 3 children at once ; that number he brings 
up without affiftance. The incumbent does not remember 
any man's afking affiftance from the poors funds on account 
of the number of his children, however great, if he and 
they were in health. If they are all well, his wife, be- 
fides taking care of her family, may earn a fhilling a- 
week by fpinning ; nay, provided they have a cow, which 
is generally the cafe, fhe may earn other two lhillings in 
the fame fpace by the fale of butter for 3 months in the 
year. When a ploughman does not eat in the family, he 
is allowed for victuals 6 bolls and a half of oatmeal in the

year, and a Scotch pint of milk a-day : Of the meal he 
can ealily fell one boll after fupplying himfelf. The wa- 
ges of a good ploughman, in general, are from L. 8 to 
L. 9 Sterling, annually ; thofe of a maid-fervant, including 
her bounties, as they are called, L. 3. The prices of molt 
kinds of provifions are double of what they were 30 years 
ago ; oat-meal, however, has rifen little more than one 
fourth. 

Antiquities. — On the farm of Prieflown, near the Glam- 
mis road, was difcovered fome years ago a fubterraneous 
building of a very irregular conftru&amp;ion. It was compofed 
of large flat ftones, without any cement, and confifted of 
2 or 3 apartments,, not above 5 feet wide, covered with 
ftones of the fame kind. Some wood-alhes, feveral frag- 
ments of large earthen vefiels, and one of the ancient hand- 
mills called querns, were the only things found in it. It 
was moftly filled up with rich black earth. A little weft- 
ward from the houfe of Tealing, about 60 or 70 years ago, 
was difcovered an artificial cave or fubterraneous paflage, 
fuch as is fometimes called by the country people a weenv 
It Avas compofed of large loofe ftones ; was about 4 feet 
high, and as many wide, and was faid to be traced up to 
a confiderable length. There were found in it a broad 
earthen vefiel, and an inftrument refembling an adze, both 
of them formed very neatly. It ftill exifts, but is co'vered 
up. On the farm of Balckembeck are feveral great round 
ftones placed in a circle, evidently the remains of a Drui- 
dical temple. In two fandy hillocks, within thefe 20 
years, were found ftone coffins, containing the ikull and 
bones of a human body, with urns of earthen ware and 
afties m them. About 30 years ago there was found in 
the mires, a vefiel fomewhat refembling a kettle, about 
9 feet m diameter, and 1 foot deep. Its materials (brafe

mixed with fome other metal) and its elegant fhape, gave 
it much the appearance of an antique vafe. It was melted 
down, but its fubftance is ftill preferved in the form of 3 
modern pots. It is pretty plain from Tacit, in Vit. Agric. 
that the Romans were well acquainted with the country 
between the Grampian mountains and the frith of Tay. 

Miscellaneous Obfervations. — The people, in general, are 
of the middle fize. They are exceedingly induflxious, 
oeconomical, rather plainer in drefs than their neigh- 
bours, and not fond of a military life. Generally they 
are charitable and very helpful to one another. The 
condition of the people, for the moft part, is rather 
more than tolerable, and they are apparently contented 
with it. It might, however, be, in fome meafure, improved 
at nogreat expence, by making their cottages more comfort- 
able and convenient, by railing better fences round their 
gardens, and introducing among them the culture of a 
few more nourishing vegetables. 

The roads, in general, are bad, and have been much ne- 
glected. An a£t, however, has been lately obtained for 
turnpikes throughout the county, and is already begun to 
be put in execution, but many people think they will 
prove too expenfive. 

The rent of the greater part of the open land is about 
9 s. the acre. Some, however, in the hands of the fmaller 
tenants, gives from 15 s. to 20 s. Inclofed ground lets 
from 15 s. to 25 s. according to its quality. The farms are 
from about 100 to 150 acres two farmers, however, pof- 
fefs conliderably more. The number of farms is rather 
increafing, and many cottars and fubtenants have, within 
thefe 20 years, been put immediately under their lairds. 

About 



of Tealing, 



About one fixth of the arable land is inclofed, and all 
Che irniers, it is believed, are convinced of the advantages 
of inciofing. The fences are moftly of ftone. 

The people have improved much in drefs and manners. 
Among the men, inftead of the bonnet and coarfe home- 
made woollens, the hat, Englifh cloth and cotton fluffs, 
are much worn, and almoft every ploughman has his filver 
watch. The women flill retain the plaid, but among the 
better fort it is now' fometimes of filk or lined with filk, 
and numbers of them, on occasions, drefs in ribbons, prin- 
ted cottons, white {lockings and lafting Ihoes. The la- 
bouring fervants, formerly ignorant and lazy, are now 
generally fkilful and laborious. The wages both of men 
and women are doubled. The Sunday's collection, and 
all the poors funds, are doubled. The land-rent is more 
than doubled. The farmers live in a much more fociable 
manner, and entertain with great hofpitality. Their 
houfes, formerly covered with thatch, are now generally 
flated, and contain 2 floors. There are fome among them 
that flill adhere to the old method of farming, yet a con- 
fiderable number are well acquainted with the principles 
of the new hulbandry, and pradlife accordingly. They 
fallow ; they manure with compoft, marl and lime, fome 
of the laft brought even from England ; and they crop 
judicioufly, 

The heritors, notwithstanding the difadvantage moft of 
them lie under by rending at a diftance, have all done 
fomething in the way of improvement. As Mr Scrymfoure 
of Tealing refides on the fpot, his improvements have 
been extenfive in proportion: He has, within thefe 30 
years, planted about 260 acres of moor-ground with trees 
of different kinds; among which are many thoufand 
larches, (a tree which thrives here beyond moft others) ; 
ir.clofed and properly fubdivided upwards of 300 acres 

of 



i°4 Statijlical Account 

of arable with good ftone fences, and near 100 acres of 
pafture and meadow ground with hedge and ditch ; erec- 
ted 3 confiderable new farms ; let a number of convenient 
poffeHions to the manufacturers at very reafonable rents ; 
doubled his rents upon the whole ; and all without bring- 
ing any incumbrance upon his eftate : He keeps a confi- 
derable farm in his own hand, and excites his tenants to 
the practice of good hufbandry by his own example. 

The fuel commonly ufied is turf, which is brought from 
the neighbouring hills. Coal is likewife tranfported from 
Dundee, and its ufe is greatly increafing. There are from 
40 to 50 ploughs made after the beft form. 

In this parifh there are ftill fome cottagers on almoft 
every farm. Farmers differ fomewhat in their notions 
about employing them. It is generally allowed, that 
turning off cottagers has an immediate tendency to make 
a fcarcity of hands, and of confequence to raife wages •, and 
that where there are no people of this defcription,~it occa- 
fions one confiderable inconvenience in the time of harveft, 
as then the corns muft be cut down chiefly by flrangers, 
who, in tedious harvefts and rainy weather, are a heavy 
burden on the farmer. Cottagers, after all, are generally 
in a poor and dependent fituation, and perhaps little vil- 
lages of manufacturers and tradefmen, immediately depen- 
dent on the land-owner, might anfwer the purpofes of the 
farmer equally well, would be happier in themfelves, and 
of greater advantage to their country.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5211216">DALLAS</name>. 
(County of Elgin.) 

By the Rev. Mr David Milne.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, ifc. 

HP HE name of this parifh is derived from Dale uis, i. e. 

A ' Watered Valley.' Dallas is in the prefbytery of 
Forres, Synod of Moray, and county of Elgin. It is 12 
miles from E. to W. and 9 from N. to S.. ; the form is o- 
val. It is bounded by the parifhes of Rothes and Birnie, 
on the S. E. and E. ; of Elgin, on the N. E. and N, ; of 
Baflord and Edenkillie, on the N. W. and W. ; and of 
Knockando and Cromdale, on the S. W. and S. It is fur- 
rounded by hills, fo as to form a valley or ftrath, almofl 
equally divided from S. W. to E. by the fmall river Loffie, 
and interfered by feveral burns or rivulets, falling from the 
furrounding hills into Loffie. Thefe burns partly bound the 
parifti on the E. and N. and partly fall into Loffie within 
the bounds of the pariffi. The furrounding hills are cover- 
ed with heath. The foil is black and moffy, excepting 
fome fields or haughs on the Loffie banks. 

Fine fmall trout are found in Loffie during the fummer. 
In September and Oftober, finnac or white trout are got, 
from 1 lb. to 3 lb. and a few fmall falmon. 

The fields on Loffie banks are very fubjed to inundations. 
Thefe do much damage, by breaking through and carrying 
away the belt of the foil, notwithstanding the attention and

pxertions of the proprietor and his tenants. In fummer alfoj 
and harveft, the corns and grafs within reach, are hurt by 
gravel and fand left upon them. The moft remarkable in- 
undations were in 1768, 1782, 1786, and 1789. 

Population. — rShaw's Hiftory of Moray, publifhed 1775, 
reckons the catechifable perfons about 500. Dr Webfter's 
ftatement, about 40 or 50 years ago, is 700. The prefent 
incumbent found the number of fouls in July and Auguft 
1778, to be 917 : Of whom 84 were under 6 years of age; 
434 were males, 483 females. In 1788, the number amount- 
ed to 888, of whom 426 were males, 462 females.

wards of 20 young men, fince the year 1778, particularly 
fincethe years 1783 and 1784, have emigrated to America 
and other foreign parts. A few have gone into England. 
Some families and fingle perfons to the fouth of Scotland, 
and families alfo and unmarried perfons into the neighbour- 
ing towns for employment. There are not above fix or 
eight uninhabited houfes at moft, fince the year 1778, and 
only a few ere&amp;ions have been made fince that period ; 
but a great many fome years before.

Produce, ISc. — Potatoes are raifed for family life, and a 
few garden and field turnip, principally for the fame pur- 
pofe. Natural oaks, birch and allar, apple, pear, plum, 
gean and cherry trees grow in feveral places, and fome large 
inclofures of planted firs, of a pretty old Handing, large 
enough for deals, farm-houfe couples, &amp;c. 

Barley^ rye, and oats, are raifed in the parifh. Very lit- 
tle flax is cultivated, and a few fields are laid down in grafs„ 
. Ever fince the prefeht incumbent was fetfiled, (1778,) un- 
lefs in a few inftances, the crops have been found infufficient 
to maintain the inhabitants or their cattle. Living, how- 
ever, in the vicinity of Elgyn and Forres, they are em- 
ployed in carrying peats twice a-week to market. This 
enables them to purchafe fome additional provifions for 
their families, and alfo corn, or corn and fodder in the 
feafon, when a deficiency at home requires a fupply. Sow- 
ing does not become general till towards the middle of 
April. The climate admits not of it earlier : And the 
tenants, doubtlefs, owing to the poverty of the foil, think 
they have the cleaner crop the later fown. Of courfe, 
it is the middle or rather the end of November before 
all the corns are got in. From is. to 15s. may be 
the rent of each acre, from the leaft improved miur to the 
highefl cultivated field. Every parilh in the north of 
Scotland, doubtlefs, fufFered by the failure of crop 1782; 
among which, it may be conceived, this parilh had its me- 
lancholy fhare. A liberal ftiare of bounty-meal was, at that 
period, allowed for the indigent in the parilh. The firft 
'and fecond moieties, gratis, came molt feafonably in fum- 
mer 1783, or before the corns were ripe. The third and 
laft moiety from Government, at 6|d. a peck, came alfo 
feafonably a fhort time thereafter.

MifceUaneous Obferoations. — The air is fharp and dry. 
The inhabitants are generally healthy. The fmall-pox is 
become lefs fatal by means of inoculation. 

There are fome chalybeate fprings, but feldom reforted 
to. — The parifli abounds in grey flate quarries. There 
is likewife a freeftone quarry of excellent quality. 

Towards the top of the eall gable of the church, in a 
niche on the outfide of the wall, ftands a ftone weather- 
beaten effigy, of about 4 feet high and 2 broad, of a 
faint, called Michael, to whom the church is faid to be 
dedicated. In the middle of the church-yard, there ftill 
remains, entire, a neat erect well cut ftone pillar, ancient- 
ly the crofs, to which are ftill brought the cattle and effects 
of fome bankrupts. A large fquare ftone, above ground, 
is the pedeftal. The capital a Jieur de luce, covered with 
mofs, emblematical of a hoary head, and the whole 
height from the ground 12 feet. 

Each tenant has a hotfe, for the moft part, bought at 
market-, many have 2, fome 3 or 4. Several farmers have a 
flock of goats for the accommodation of tender people in 
fummer. The parifli is fufficiently flocked with black 
cattle of the common Scotch breed. There are a great 
many flocks of fheep of a very hardy kind and tolerable 
fize, commonly called Badenoch, from whence every year 
a fupply of lambs is brought. The lambs are bought 
for about 4 s. 6d. or 5 s. a-piece, and, when 4 or 5 years 
old, are fold from 8s. to 123. each. 

The latenefs of the harveft, the fcarcity of grain, and the 
overflowings of Loflie, may be reckoned among the greateft 
difadvantages of Dallas. Among its advantages may be 
ranked the falubrity of the air, inexhauftible moffes, the vi- 
cinity to Elgin and Forres for the fafe of peats, and to mar- 
kets for the fale of cattle : Good pafture for fheep, goats 
and black cattle : Timber from the woods for many imple- 
ments 



of Dallas. 



mcnts of hufbandry, and for building farm-houfes : Fuel for 
their families, and minds flrangers to luxury and extrava- 1 
gance. The cart-load of peats on the ftreet brings only 
from 8d. to iod. in fummer, and from led. to 14 d. in 
winter. They are of an excellent quality, but the load is 
fmnll. Thefe bring always ready money, and enable the 
people to buy the family neceffaries when required, and to 
pay the landlord at the term. 

The Englifh language is fpoken throughout the parifh ; 
yet, as is the cafe inmany other places, the names of the 
farms appear to be of Celtic derivation. 

The inhabitants are much inclined to induftry and fruga- 
lity. They are alfo difpofed to adls of humanity. A good 
many weavers are conftantly employed in making coarfe 
cloth, commonly called plaiden, from the produce of their 
fheep, which, in the fummer markets, is fold for from 9 d. 
to 1 s. the Scots ell. By that, and other fources of induftry, 
they ars enabled to fupport their families and pay their 
rents. There are fome cart and cart-wheel wrights, with 
fome carpenters for making flakes or paling for folding 
cattle in fummer, and inclofing fields. 

Their drefs and manners are confiderably improved with- 
in thefe few years. It is thought, and earnefty to be wifh- 
ed, that their condition may be meliorated. This, it is 
believed, might be done, by introducing and encouraging a 
flocking manufa^ory, or fome fuch ufeful and accommoda- 
ting employment, efpccially to occupy the young. 

Laft fummer a petition was tranfmitted from the inhabi- 
tants of Kellas to the Honourable the Society at Edinburgh, 
requefting a Society School for that quarter. Thefe fami- 
lies lie at. a great diflance from the parochial fchool. Ac- 
cordinglv, a fchool was appointed to be fettled there,

and a teacher entered at Martinmas laft, who, ever fince,' 
has had a full attendance, and is affiduous. 
, There is great occafion for a bridge over the impetuous 
river Lome. In particular, over that river, where a public 
road from Forres and the low country crofles, leading to 
the pariflies of Knockando, Aberlour, Inveraven, &amp;c. 
The roads are in bad repair. The ftatute-labour is but 
irregularly called for, and ill executed, as there are no gen- 
tlemen of property refiding in the parilh. Turnpikes would 
be altogether inefficient in Dallas.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1810528">K1RKHILL</name>. 

(County of Inverness.) 
By the Rev. Mr Alexander Fraser.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, and Soil, 

KIRKHILL confifts of two united parilhes, called Ward- 
law and Farnua. Wardlaw is the name of the hill on 
which the church was built, and is a corruption of the 
Gaelic Bar-tla, that is " kindly fummit." Farnua or 
Fearnaie, as it is called in Gaelic, is probably derived from 
the word /earn, fignifying " allar," becaufe the parifli did 
and (till does abound with allar trees. The name of the united 
parifhes in Gaelic is Cnoe-mhoir, or " Mary's hill." It is 
the fame hill otherwife called Wardlaw, as this laft term 
is expreffive of its fituation, fo the former is of its dedi- 
cation to the Virgin. In the neighbourhood it is called, 
by way of eminence, the Hill : Hence, the Englifh tranf- 
lation of it is Kirkhill. * This parifh is about 8 meafured 
miles long and from i to 3 miles broad. It is bounded on 
the E. and S. by the parifh of Invernefs, on the W. by the 

parifk 



112 



Statijiical Account 



parifh of Kilterlity, on the N. by the parilhes of Kilmo- 
rack, Urray and Kilternan, being feparated from the three 
laft mentioned, by the river Beuly and the Moray frith. 
It is fituated within the county of Invernefs, in the prelby- 
fei-y of Invernefs and Synod of Moray. For 4 miles it 
is a narrow flrip, on the declivity of a hill, inclining to the 
Moray frith, with a N. W. afpeft. Beyond thefe 4 miles 
the frith contracts and the country enlarges ; but inftead of 
forming a plain, a ridge of rifmg ground projects into the 
plain, which divides it into two valleys ; the fummit of this 
ridge is Wardlaw or Mary's hill. The foil is various. 
In the two valleys and along the frith, that part of the 
land which connedts the two valleys, the foil is a ftrong 
rich clay, which by proper culture might be made very 
fruitful ; for fuch parts of it, as have been well cultivated, 
produce equal, perhaps, to any foil in Scotland ; but when 
ill managed, the crop is precarious. If the beginning of 
the feafon is very dry, the clay binds fo faft as to flint the 
growth of the corn 5 if, on the other hand, the feafon is 
wet, the coldnefs of the clay chills the feed. On the rifing 
ground next the plain, the foil is a rich loam, which com- 
monly yields a good and fiire crop. • Higher flill, the foil 
is light on a gravelly bottom, but fharp, and in good fea- 
fons produce a tolerables crop. 

Climate and Mineral Spring. — The climate, when com- 
pared with many places in the fame country, is mild and 
temperate ; much lefs rain falls in this parifh, than in the 
height of the neighbouring parifh of Kilterlity. The mofl 
prevalent difeafes among the poor, are fuch as proceed 
from cold, as coughs, dyfenteries, and afthmatic complaints. 
In the fpving of 1783, a pleuritic fever raged, which cut 
off many. It was generally attributed to cold, contracted 

by 



of KirkhilL 113 

by cutting down the preceding crop fo late in the feafon. 

There is a chalybeate fpring in this parifli at Achnagairn. 
It was once much frequented, and thought to be very falu- 
tary for complaints of the ftomach : But it has been quite 
negledled for fome time paft. The water, when taken up 
at the fountain is quite clear, nor will its colour alter by ly- 
ing ; but if a little rum or tea is poured into it, in a few mi- 
nutes it turns black as ink. By this experiment, the ftxength 
of the mineral is difcovered, for the ftronger the mineral is, 
the blacker will the colour be. 

Hills, Rivers, ifc. — The hills that run along the S. E. of 
the parifli, are pretty high, and covered with heath. The 
pafture they afford is miferably fcanty, the furface being 
ccnftantly carried off for fuel. There are fome natural 
woods of birch and alder, and fome hundreds of acres of 
planted fir. Indeed, all the various trees planted for ufe or 
ornament in Great Britain, have been fuccefsfully introdu- 
ced by fome of the proprietors. The river Beuly runs 
along the N. W. boundary of the parifli, for about 2 or 3 
miles. It is navigable at high water, by fhips of about 50 
tons burden, fo far as the village of Beuly, in the parifli of 
Kilmorack. It produces abundance of excellent falmon, and 
feveral kinds of trouts. The falmon fetch on the fpot 3 d. 
the pound. Some years ago they fold for 1 d. They are in 
feafon from February till the end of Auguft. During the 
fpring they are kitted and fent to the London market. Af- 
ter fummer commences, they are faked and fent to'foreign 
places. A very fmall proportion is/old in the country. 
Herrings are taken in the frith, within this parifli, in fmall 
quantities by fet nets : Their feafon is from September to 
February : If any remain after that time, they are poor and 
mfipid. If the people who fifli them take more than ferves

their own families, they fell them in the parifli, or at In- 
vernefs, when plenty,^at the rate of twenty fcore for 6 d. 

Birds, Beqfls, &amp;c. — The hirds that commonly frequent 
the fliores of this parifli are of the web-footed kind. The 
wild-goofe, cormorant, fcale-drake, duck, teal, widgeon, fea- 
magpie, and fwan, are rare. The gulls here are of t! ree 
different fpecies. There are the crane, curlew, plover, half 
plover, fandy lark, page plover ; of all which only the duck,, 
fcale drake, widgeon and plover, neftle in the parifli. Land 
birds, larger than a common fparrow, are, the lark, boun- 
tain, thrufh, fieldfare, flailing,. blackbird, fnipe, quail, land- 
rail, partridge, moorfowl, black game. Rooks and wood-pi- 
geons are fo numerous as to be a feriousevil to the farmer; 
crows and magpies are exceedingly numerous likewife. Mi- 
gratory birds are the lapwing or green plover, cuckoo, blue 
and grey fwallow, ftone-chatter, and night-hawk. The 
lapwing appears in March, the cuckoo in April, fwallows 
and ftone-chatters in April or May, the night-hawk in 
May or June : He makes a chattering noife the whole night, 
and lives upon the butterflies or moths that fly about during 
the night. All thefe difappear in October. The wood- 
cock appears the end of Ocfober or beginning of November, 
and difappears in February. The fnow-birds appear ii* 
flocks in November or December, as florm fets in, and dif- 
appear in February, as the weather turns mild. The black- 
bird was once migratory, but for 10 years paft he remains 
with us throughout the year. Whether this indicates that 
our climate is grown colder than it was formerly, I will noc 
pretend to fay. The number of flieep may be about a 
iooo ; of which about 200 are of the Bakewell breed, 
the reft of the old Scots flieep, fmall frzed, with fliort wool, 
unequal as to its quality, fome of it being fine, and fome 

of it coarfe. The black cattle may be about 800. They 

are

are of various kinds ; but, in general, thej are larger than 
the old hig hland breed, that are fit to lie out during the 
winter. The number of horfes may be about 400, and are 
of various fizes. 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter about 40 or 50 
ye trs ago, was 1360. In the year 1673, the examinable 
perfons in the parifh of Wardlaw, were reckoned by the 
then incumbent about fix or feven .hundred. If Farnua 
bore the fame proportion to Wardlaw then as now, both pa- 
rifhes might contain 850. About 30 years ago, by a lift of 
the late incumbent, the examinable perfons in the united 
parifh were about 950. Every year fince 1773, a new lift 
was made by the prefent incumbent ; the examinable per- 
fons were never much above 1000, nor below 950, till 4 
years ago, when their number increafed. By an exacT: fur- 
vey made in the clofe of the year 1789, the examinable 
perfons were 1190, of whom there were 489 males, 701 fe- 
males, the proportion of males to females being nearly as 
5 to 7. Under 9 years of age, not entered on the lift, were 
380, making for the number of fouls 1571. The reafons 
for the increafe of examinable perfons, I take to be thefe : 
Firft, about 4 years ago, feveral fmall farms were thrown 
into a few large ones ; the greater part of thofe farmers 
who were difpofTefTed, remained in the parifh as cottagers, 
while other perfons were brought in to manage the large 
farms. Again, feveral gentlemen in the parifh have a tafte 
for improvements, as planting, ditching, by which they give 
conftant employment to a number of labourers, fo that per- 
fons of that defcription crowd in from other places. The ave- 
rage of births for the lafl 7 years is nearly 40, of which there 
are 20 males and 20 females. The males and females are al- 
moft equally balanced. The whole number of births for the 

lafi

laft 7 years flood thus : Males 138, females 139. By the 
lift of examinable perfons, the proportion of males to fe- 
males was as 5 to 7. The decreafe of adult males is owing 
to their leaving the parifti. Numbers of young men go to 
the fouth of Scotland, as handicraftfmen, or labourers : Se- 
veral enlift in the army, and fome go to the Weft Indies, 
while the women remain. The average of deaths may be 
about 20 ; but this cannot be fo exa&amp;lv afcertained, as feve- 
ral from this parifh a*e buried at Invernefs or Kilterlity, 
and fome from both thefe parilhes are buried here. By the 
regifter, 30 died in 1783, but then a pleuritic fever cut off 
a third more than commonly die. In 1790, 30 perfons 
likewife died ; but the fmall-pox, meafles, and hooping- 
cough raged at the fame time. In feveral of the interme- 
diate years, not above 10 died. The average of marriages 
may be about 6. 

Proprietors, Tenants, and Rent. — There are 6 proprietors 
and one feuer, of whom 5 have their occafional or conftant 
refidence in the parilh. There are about 60 tenants, of 
whom 8 pay from L. 30 to L. 60 Sterling rent ; the reft 
may pay from L. 10 to L. 15 Sterling. Befides thefe there 
are cottagers, who pay for fmall crofts from 5 s. to L. 5. All 
thefe cottagers are either handicraftfmen or labourers : Fre- 
quently one man has three occupations ; he manages his 
croft, works as a labourer in fummer, or while the weather 
is good, and as a weaver, tailor, Jhoemaker or carpenter in 
winter, or when the weather is bad. There may be of this 
defcription, labourers without a handicraft, 34 ; handicraftf- 
men, 77; male fervants, 134; female fervants, 104;, 
houfehold fervants are included. About 10 years ago 
cottagers were employed in [agriculture, but now hired' 
fervants. Several houfes have been built within that pe- ' 

riod,

riod, perhaps 50. The valued rent of the parifh is L. 2068, 
10 s. Scots. The real rent may be about L. 2000 Sterling. 
The rent of land varies. Such farms as have been given in 
leafe about 30 years ago, may pay from 7 s. to 10 s. for the 
acre of arable ground. Farms that have been lately let, pay 
from 15 s. to 20 s. the acre. 

Crops. — The principal crops in the parifh are barley and 
oats ; peafe is not fo common. Lint is fown in fmall quan- 
tities for family ufe. The common tenants and cottagers 
raife a great many potatoes in proportion to their acres, de- 
pending upon them chiefly for fubfiftence. The proprietors 
and gentlemen tenants follow the Norfolk method of huf- 
bandry. They fow wheat, turnip, andgrafs-feeds. They 
ufe the Engliih plough, drawn by two horfes, without a 
driver. The farms in the hand of the proprietors and bet- 
ter tenants, are inclofed ; the reft of the parifh is open. 
Wheat is fown from the middle of Oclober to the middle of 
November ; oats and peafe in the end of March and be- 
ginning of April; barley from the end of April to the be- 
ginning of June ; lint the beginning of May ; turnip from 
the middle of June to the middle of July. The harveft is 
feldom begun before September ; and if the crop is got in 
about the middle of Oftober, they reckon it in good time. 
A greater quantity of every fpecies of grain than is necef- 
fary for the maintenance of the inhabitants is raifed ; at the 
fame time, virtual gives a high price, and meal is fometimes 
fcarce, becaufe the barley is wholly confumed by thediftil- 
leries. 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor, h?c— The church was firft 
built on Wardlaw or Mary's hill in the year 12 10. The 
patron is Frafer of Lovat. The living confifts of j chalders 
tf victual, half barley, half oatmeal, and L. 50 Sterling of

money, with 50 merks Scots for communion-elements. 
The glebe confifts of 7 Scots acres. The manfe was built 
in 1775. The church was begun building in 1790. It is 
not yet finifhed. It has been removed about two gun- 
fhots from Mary's hill. There are no diffenters of any kind 
within the bounds of this parifh, except fix Catholics. 
There are two fchools in this parifh; one of them is a paro- 
chial fchool, the other is planted by the Society for pro- 
pagating Chriftian Knowledge. The emoluments of the 
parochial fchool are aoo merks Scots of falary, one milling 
the quarter for every fcholar taught to read ; one (hil- 
ling and fixpence the quarter from every fcholar taught 
writing, arithmetic, and Latin. The Society fchoolmafter 
has a falary of L. 12. the children of the poor are taught by 
him gratis. At each of thefe fchools there are from 60 to 
80 children. The number of poor on the parifh roll is 50. ' 
The fund to provide for them is not above L. 10, arifing 
from the weekly colle&amp;ions, the hire of a mortcloth, 
and the intereft of L. 50 due the feffion by bond. The 
greater number of thofe on the roll can provide for them- 
felves in part, by their labour. Few if any on the poors 
roll beg from door to door, yet the parifh is infefted with 
beggars from other places. 

Prices and Wages. — The price of grain and provifions has 
advanced confiderably of late years. Ten (hillings the boll 
was reckoned the average price, 40 years ago, for barley and 
peafe, for 5 firlots of oats and 9 flones of oatmeal. For the 
laft 7 years, at an average, barley has fold at 18 s. •, peafe, 
oats, and meal at 16 s. Other provifions as under,

Farm fervants hired by the year, receive from L. 4 to L $ 7 
and 6 bolls meal, unlefs they board in the houfe ; fecond 
clafs of men fervants receive from L. 3 to L. 4 yearly, 
and 6 bolls meal. Boys receive from 30 s. to L. 2, and 4 
bolls meal for victuals ; but generally they have their meat 
with the houfehold fervants. Female fervants for the farm, 
from li. 1 to L. 2. Labourers hired by the day get 8 d. ; by 
the piece, they commonly make from 10 d. to 1 s. 6 d. From 
the frugal manner in which they live, a labourer, if fober 
and induftrious, may fupport himfelf, his wife and 3 or 4 
ehildren. 

Manners and Morals. — The people of this parifii, in ge- * 
neral, are fober and induftrious, free from grofs crimes, 
tradable and fubmiflive. They, as well as the people of 
the neighbouring pariihes, have made a greater progrefs in 
civilization within the lafl 50 years, than for feveral centu- 
ries before. This is owing, firft, to the decline of the feu- 
dal fyftem. Before the year 1745, thatfyftem hadconfider- 
able influence. Every chief confidered himfelf as an inde- 
pendent prince, who might commit depredations on hia 
neighbours territories, as avarice or animofity dictated. 

The 



120 Statiftical Account 

The clans, like the fubjefts of independent nates, living in 
the clofe neighbourhood of each other, were animated by 
conftant jealoufy and mutual hatred. They neglefted in- 
duftry, becaufe they held the fruits of their labour by a 
precarious tenure. They made little account of good mo- 
rals, fince it could not defend them from their lawlefs 
neighbours, nor at all times fecure the favour of their 
chief. But when the feudal fyftem received an irrecover- 
able blow, by quelling the rebellion, and by the jurifdiftion 
aft, the people began to feel the force of the laws of their 
country, in punifhing the guilty and defending the in- 
nocent. They were excited to induftry, by the profpeft of 
enjoying what they acquired. They were taught morali- 
ty, by the moll obvious (though not the molt important) 
argument, that it afforded the beft fecurity to their per- 
fons and property. Another caufe of this progrefs is the 
influence of religion. No doubt the ordinances of religion 
were diipenfed previous to the year 1745 ; but it is only 
fince that period the people have begun to refpeft them. 
Before that fera, they confidered themfelves as a race of 
warriors, and that religion was beneath their notice, or in- 
confiftent with military prowefs; fentiments carefully in- 
culcated by thofe who had occafion for their fervices. Be- 
fides, religion has been confiderably aided by literature fince 
the aera mentioned. The lower clafs have been more gene- 
rally taught to read. In learning to read, the principles of 
Chriftianity have been inculcated. Much praife in this re- 
fpect is, in a fpecial manner, due to the Society for propa- 
gating Chriftian Knowledge. 

Antiquities and Language. — There are remains of two 
Druidical temples, but they are much defaced. In the moor 
between Achnagairn and the ferry of Beuly, through which 
the public road goes to the northern counties, are many 

fmatf

fmall fumuli of earth mixed with ftones. The tradition 
is, that fome of the neighbouring clans having made a 
fudden irruption, into the country, in the fpring, when 
the people were employed at their ploughs ; thefe having 
no time to provide themfelves with arms, unloofed the 
oxen, took the yokes in their hands, and with this armour 
fell upon the enemy with determined fury, fo that numbers 
were killed on both fides. The flain were buried in the 
field, and the tumuli mentioned were raifed •over their 
graves. The moor from this event has been called Blar- 
na-cui-flich, that is, " the battle of the wet yoke." The 
language chiefly fpoken by the common people is Gaelic ; 
although a great many of them, from their being taught to 
■read Englifh at fchool, can tranfaft ordinary bufinefs in 
that tongue. All the names of places are obvioufly derived 
from the Gaelic. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervaiwns.'—By the fpkited exertions of. 
individuals, and the generous relief afforded by government, 
oatmeal, which fold at Inv.ernefs and in this parifh the be- 
ginning of fummer 1783, at the enormous price of 30s. the 
boll, was reduced before the end of fummer, below 14 s. 
befides fupplying the poor gratis. How different was .the 
fituation of this country during the fcarcity in King Wil- 
liam's reign ! The people were left to their own exertions ; 
when one crop failed, they had no refource for feed, but to 
fow the damaged corn of their own growth. This occafion- 
.ed the failure of a fecond and a third-crop. I am informed

; ring the fcarcity mentioned, four families inhabiting a 
place called Clunes, in Kiltarlity parifh, on the borders of 
this parifh, fubfifted for two years on the herbs they could 
colleft in fummer, and gathered the feed of the wild muf- 
xard, with which their fields abounded, and ground it into 

V0L IV - QL meal,

meal, fo as to afford them a fcanty fubfiftence in winter. 
But the third crop failing, they could fubfift no longer : Ac- 
cordingly, they deferted their habitations in one body, and 
came down to the plain below, where they fet upa lamen- 
table howling; and having wept till they had no further 
power, they difperfed themfelves to beg or ferve, as they 
mould find a reception, the wife feparating from the huf- 
band, the mother from the children. 

A difadvantage much felt in this pariih, is the fcarcity of 
fuel. The common tenants and cottagers depend chiefly 
on turf, the peat mofles being almoft exhaufted. The pro- 
p rietors and better tenants burn coals from Sunderland or 
Newcaftle ; but the high price, owing to the duty on this 
article, puts them beyond the reach of the poor. Many dif- 
advantages arife from the late diflillery-law. The con- 
fumpt of barley makes the price of grain very high for 
the poor, confining the fale of the fpirits diftilled to a 
particular diftrifr, while every pariih within that diftricT: 
has the fame privilege of diftilling, is in facl: confining 
what is diftilled within the pariih to the confumpt of 
that pariih; if fuch a limitation deftroys the benefit of any 
manufacture in a great meafure, much more fo of this. The 
abundance of fpirits without a market has lowered the price. 
So that they fell fometimes at 9 s. the Scots gallon; an Eng- 
lifh pint may be had at 4 d. in the alehoufe. This is too 
ftrong a temptation for perfons having the fmalleft inclina- 
tion to drink. Hence, too, alehoufes or dram-houfes, as 
they ought be called, are multiplied ,• and each of thefe 
may be confidered as feminaries of vice and idlenefs. 
About two years ago, there were 8 alehoufes within this 
parifh ; but the Juftices of the Peace, confcious of their hurt- 
ful tendency, fhut them all up, except two, that are at con- . 
venient diftances upon the public road. 

Digging J 



of KirkhilU 



Digging pits for gravel to mix with dung is an uni- 
verfal but pernicious practice in this parifli. It not only de- 
forms the country, and deftroys the natural pafture, but ren- 
ders the land for ever incapable of improvement, where 
pitted, with little or no benefit to the land on which the 
gravel is laid. Cutting feal and divot is another hurtful 
praftice, though not peculiar to this parilh, but it would be 
extremely oppreflive in proprietors to prohibit it altoge- 
ther, without giving the poor a fubftitute for building and 
thatching their houfes.

    PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6060004">INVERARITI</name>

(COUNTY OF FORFAR.) 
By the Rev. Mr John WEBSTER.</head> 


<p>Situation and Extent. 

INverarity is in the prefbytery of Forfar, and Synod 
of Angus and Mearns. It is bounded by the parifh of 
Kinnettles on the W. ; Murrays on the S. ; Carmyllie on the 
E. ; and by Forfar on the N. The parifh is about 3 miles 
fquare. 

Agriculture, Rent, Wages, &amp;c- — Here and in the neigh- 
bourhood, there is a growing fpirit for agriculture. Marl 
is the chief manure. It is brought from the diftance of 5 
miles ; and from 40 to 50 bolls are put upon an acre. Its 
effects are moft fenfible and beneficial upon light dry land; 
and if laid on in a greater quantity, it will operate power- 
fully, even on a foil that has a tendency to be moift. For 
the firfl: feafon it does little good ; but afterwards its effects 
will continue for 6 or 7 years. At the end of that time, the 
marling operation may be renewed, but it is pretended, the 
quantity off marl ought to be diminilhed in proportion to., 
the number of times that the field has been marled. The 



of Inverarity* 



125 



jnoft approved method, is to mix it with earth and dung, 

about 1 part marl, 1 earth, and 2 dung. This comport, by 

fpreading it equally, prevents dangerous effects ■, and alfo 

caufes it to work fooner than when marl is laid on by it- 

felf. What in fome meafure may have retarded the pro- 

grefs of agriculture here, is the old fyftem of bondage and 

cottagers, which ftill prevails. This practice has continued, 

on account of very long leafes having been formerly given. 

Of cottagers, there are to the number of 60 families, and the 

bondage in which they are held by the great farmer, has 

evidently an effect in rendering them lefs induflrious ; not 

having the command of their own time, they are brought \ 

not to know its value, and from being idlers when 

paying bondage abroad, they learn to be lazy at home ; be- 

fides, as they hold their cottages from year to year, every 

little improvement they mould make, would render them 

only more dependent on their mafter. As the old leafes 

of the great farms expire, thefe cottagers are getting leafes 

from the proprietor. From this, and the aboliftiing of per- 

fonal fervices, it is not doubted but their lituation will be 

improved, and the molt powerful motive be given to excite 

their induftry. 

There are but few inclofures in this pariih in proportion 
to the extent of arable ground. Corn therefore is princi- 
pally cultivated. Where a field has been under cultivation 
and inclofed, it may let from 18 s. to 21 s. the acre ; where 
it is otherwife, it will not give above 15 s. The valued 
rent is L. 2987 : 6 : 8 Scots ; the real rent about L. 2000 
Sterling. 

Labourers get a milling a-day without their victuals ; 
farm fervants have from L. 8 to L^io the year, and maid- 
fervants from L. 3 to L. 4 ; and the wages of all of them are 
ftill gradually rifing, which mews that both manufactures 
and agriculture are in a thriving condition. 

Plantations. 



126 



Statijlical Account 



Plantations. — The want of inclofures has had the fame ef- 
fect here, as in other places, of retarding the plantation of 
trees : A circumftance to be regretted, as woods and hedge- 
rows add to the beauty, and improve the climate of a coun- 
try. It gives pleafure to mention, that the principal pro- 
prietor is bufy in planting the whole of his wafte lands, 
which mult eventually turn to good account. An acre of 
land will contain 1500 trees at 6 feet diftance. In 20 years, 
each of thefe may fell for 2 d. ; and this amounting to 
L. 12. ic s. yields a rent of 10 s. yearly. In planting wafte 
lands, efpecially on the declivity of a hill, it would be a 
good practice to lay two furrows together with the plough ; 
which would give the trees planted between them a greater 
depth of foil ; and what is of ftill greater advantage, the 
ground would be kept dry, and the trees, on that account, 
thrive much better. 

Birds of Pajfage, i£c. — Dotterels, rails and woodcocks, 
vifit this parifh. At their firft appearance dotterels are ve- 
ry tame •, but after having been fhot at they become re- 
markably wild. They have become much rarer, fince the 
country was improved. Woodcocks come here in the end 
of September, and remain till April ; one of them built a 
neft in this neighbourhood ; but the neft and eggs were de- 
ftroyed. We have a few groufe; and which are confider- 
ably larger in lize than upon the Grampians.

There are 169 families, 5^ to each family. Thofeof 10 
years and under, are to thofe above that age as 2 tp 9. 
There are 1 Roman Catholic; 7 Epifcopalians ; 33 Seceders. 
The population from 1716 to 1770 is calculated from bap- 
tifms, and burials being multiplied by 26 and 36, and the 
half of the whole producl being taken for the number of 
fouls required, that of 1780 and 1789 is afcertainedbyattual 
enumeration. It mould thus appear, that the population of 
the parifh during the prefent century has been very much 
the fame : Many caufes may have contributed to this ; the 
number of large farms, of fmall pofleffions, and of cottages 
continued nearly equal ; and, though our increafed wealth 
fhould have produced more children, yet having no trading 
village to keep them at home, thofe who were not 
needed for the ufual domeftic purpofes, may have gone in 
fearch of employment to the many manufacturing towns, 
with which we are furrounded. From the cottagers being 
in more eafy circumftances than formerly, it is probable 
there may now be a greater proportion of fouls under 12 

years 



Statijlical Account 



years of age ; but the higher wages of labouring fervants 
having led the farmer to do more work with fewer hands, 
the one circumftance may counterbalance the other, and 
therefore may have kept the population of the parifli al- 
moft ftationary. 

Poor, Ifc. — Families who occafionalJy need relief from 
the poors fund, have been gradually diminifliing, and 
beggars have become exceedingly lefs numerous ; at prefent 
we have not one belonging to the parifli; but in 1741 the 
kirk-feflion gave 32 of them a badge and a licence to beg. 
Later than that period the heritors were obliged to affefs 
themfelves for fupporting the poor ; now our weekly col- 
lections are more than adequate for that purpofe. At the 
interval of every 20 years there was, at an average, col- 
lected each Sunday,

Were we therefore to judge of the wealth of the pariih 
by this ftandard, we would conclude, that it had increafed 
in the proportion of 1 to 21 : This eftimate would, how- 
ever, be too high ; becaufe as there was formerly a much 
greater number of parochial beggars, thofe who had to 
give more charity in private, might give lefs in public : 
Yet allowing for this, and comparing what was given at 
different periods for the relief of families, who may be 
fuppofed to have been in fimilar circumftances, the wealth 
of the parifli muft be 8 or 10 times greater than it was in 
the beginning of the prefent century. Our former poverty, ■ 
and indeed the poverty of the country in general, is flxong- 



of hwerarity. I2 p 

ly marked by the defcription given of thofe who folicited 
charity as beggars: — Stranger gentlemen,— poor gentle- 
men, — diflreffed gentlemen, — are the appellations very 
frequently given them ; and what mult have been the po- 
verty! what the fpirit of the times! when, as the record 
informs us, a gentleman accepted a fourpence, and a young 
gentleman, recommended by a nobleman, was relieved by 
a fixpence ! 

Antiquities. — The only antiquity worth mentioning is a 
Roman camp called Taerfauds, in the moor of Lower. It is 
nearly a reftangular parallelogram, about 300 by 700 yards. 
There is another camp, Battledykes, about 8 miles to the 
north of this, in the parilh of Oathlaw, and, from the traces 
of a via militaris extending between them, it is probable that 
thefe two encampments were connected together. Neither 
hillory nor tradition give any diftincT: account of either of 
them. Some antiquaries fuppofe them to have been built by 
Agricola in his 6th campaign, when he obtained his viftory 
over the Caledonians, under Galgacus their chief. 

CharaBer of the People.— Thzy are, in general, indubious 
and fober ; pleafed with their fituation, but not without am- 
bition to improve it; remarkable for their attendance at 
church ; and improved both in their moral and religious cha- 
racter.

By the Rev. Mr William Bethune.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, cjc. 

THE name of this parilh feems to be of foreign ori- 
gin} as are almoft all the names of farms, places and- 
parifhes in the weftern iflands. The places whofe names 
terminate in Nefs,. or Nifti •, as Hunilh, Troternifh, Vater- 
nifh, &amp;c fignify promontories, or head lands, projecting 
into the fea ; yet thefe names have no affinity to the Gae- 
lic language, in found or meaning ; nor any relation, as far 
as can be known, to the local fituation. or appearance of the 
places, and may be words of the Pictifh, or more probably, 
of the Danifli language, as would appear from a well 
known cape in Norway being called the Nefe. Duirinilh 
is lituated in the county of Invernefs, in the prefbytery of 
Sky, and Synod of Glenelg. Its extent from N. to 
S. W- namely, from the point, of Vaterniffi to the point of 
Idrigil, is 17 computed miles. Its breadth from Lindale 
to the weftern fhore, 13 miles. It is bounded on the E. 
by the parifh of Sniford, on the S. E. by the parifh of 
Bracadale, on the N. W. and S. W. by the fea or" 
ChanneJ, which feparates this country from the Long

Jlland, and which is about 18 miles broad. The ground 
dbout the lochs or branches of the fea, which run far into 
the country, defcends in fome places with a quick, and in 
other places with an eafy flope towards the fea. The pro- 
montories or head-lands are rocks of immenfe height ; the 
moors in mod places are deep and wet. The foil in fome 
parts is a light black loam, in fome places of a reddifh gra- 
velly appearance ; and though moftly thin and ftony, it is oqi 
the whole fertile and produftive. The air is very moift and 
foggy ; the weft and fouthweft winds bring floods of rain, 
owing probably to ( the vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. 
The moft common diftempers are rheumatifms, fciaticks, 
colds, nervous fevers and dyfenteries, owing, it is prefu- 
med, to the wet and rainy climate. The extent of the fea- 
coaft of this parilh would meafure upwards of 60 miles ; 
the ftiore is in general ftony, and in many parts very high 
and rocky. 

Fiji?, Kelp, Harbours, is'c. — The fifli which frequent the 
coaft are herrings, ling, cod, Ikate, mackerel, haddocks, 
flounders, fye and cuddies. Herrings and ling are export- 
ed ; and when fold in the country, a .barrel of fait herrings 
brings about 16s. and ling L. 13 the ton. The parilh. 
exports about 20 tons of ling yearly at an average. There 
are likewife fome feals, otters; and whales of a large fize 
are often feen in the Channel, between this and the Long 
Ifland. Every fpecies of fea-weed is reckoned -moil excel- 
lent manure, though it is thought to burn and wafte the 
foil, when it is not mixed with earth, and it is reckoned 
more profitable to convert it into kelp, than into manure. 
There are fome kelp-mores, and the parilh makes about an 
hundred tons annually. The tide of flood in this channel 
runs north and by eaft, and oft" the heads flows with great 
rapidity, perhaps at the rate of 5 miles an hour in fpring

tides. One light-houfe has been eredled lately in the ifland 
of Scalpa in Harris, which is reckoned of great utility to 
the numerous /hipping that frequent this channel, in their 
voyages to and from the Baltic. The harbours of the pa- 
rim are Loch Arniford, Loch Bay, Pottech, Dunvigan 
Loch, and Loch Harlofh. As the coaft is very bold and 
high, with a great depth of water, it feldom happens, that 
any veflel is wrecked upon it. About 30 years ago, a vef- 
fel belonging to Aberdeen, laden with ftaves, was caft a- 
way upon the coaft of Ramfaig, in this parifli, and two of 
the hands were drowned. The furviving part of the crew 
were treated by the people with the greateft humanity, 
and the cargo was preferved with the utmoft care, for the 
benefit of the underwriters. This forbearance, however, 
may be rather afcribed to the attention and authority of the 
gentlemen, than to the humanity of the common people. 

Hills. — The moft remarkable mountains in the parifli, 
are the two Hallivails, fituated within a mile of each other, 
of an equal height, being about 3 quarters of a mile high, 
the top of each is a flat or a table land, and, like twins, 
they exaclly referable each other ; fo that they are fuch fure 
land-marks, as no feaman can miftake. The hills are all 
covered with heath, with a few green fpots here and there, 

Population. — -The population of this parifli, and of the 
whole ifland, is increafing, and has been increafing for at 
leaft 80 years back. The old people affirm, that they 
remember lands which lay wafte in feveral diflri£ls, not 
only of this parifli, but in feveral parts of the ifland, for 
want of inhabitants to occupy them. Of late, the inhabi- 
tants have multiplied fo much, that from Auguft 1771, to 
October 1790, eight large tranfports have failed from this 
ifland with emigrants, to feek fettlements in America ; the 

M 



of Duirini/Jj. 



*33 



lalt of thefe tranfports failed on the 6th of this month (Oc- 
tober 1790) from Loch Bracadale. Thefe 8 fhips have, at 
a very moderate computation, carried away from this ifland 
2400 fouls, and L. 24,000 Sterling, Ihip-freights included. 
From the year 1772 to 1775, 204 males, and 207 females, 
emigrated from this parifh to America, exclufive of thofe 
■who have gone in the two laft fhips ; yet the population 
appears to be as great as in 1772. This increafe of popu- 
lation may be attributed to a more judicious and rational 
treatment of children and women in child-bed, than was 
formerly obferved ; and above all, to the inoculation of the 
fuiall-pox, which has been univerfally practifed in this 
ifland for 30 years part, and has been the means of prefer- 
ving many lives. The number of fouls in this parifh at 
prefent, amounts to fully 3000. The return to Dr Web- 
fter, about 40 years ago, was only 2568. Though there are 
no extraordinary inftances of longevity, yet feverals in this 
parifh arrive at a good old age. There are at prefent two 
men, one of them 88, the other 95, and two women, one of 
them 93, and the other 97 years. In every diftria of the pa- 
rifh, there are fome weavers, male and female, a few tailors, 
a blackfmith in every barony, fome boat-builders and houfe- 
carpenters. Every farm keeps boats, and the people go a- 
filhing for their own ufe, or when they fee an appearance 
of herrings. There are very few bred feamen, but all ex- 
pert rowers, good hardy watermen, and flailed in making 
a boat with fails. There are 4 ltudents from this parilh 
who attend the Univerfities of Aberdeen. There are *j 
eftabliflied clergymen in this ifland, viz. 5 on Lord Mac- 
donald's eftates, and 2 on Colonel Macleod's. All the in- 
habitants of Sky are Proteftants, of the eftablilhed Church 
of Scotland, a very few excepted, who are of the Church 
of England ; yet thefe perfons are endued with fuch libe- 
rality of feiitiments, and fo free from bigotry, that they

frequent the eftablifhed Church, and communicate at the 
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Marriages here produce, 
in general, from 5 to 12 children, and upwards. The cot- 
tages are full of inhabitants. 

Produtliom, ifc. — The utmoft that the whole ifland can 
do in the very beft feafons, is to ferve the inhabitants with 
meal. In unfavourable feafons they buy large quantities 
of imported meal. Oats and potatoes are planted in March 
and April, barley is fown in the beginning of May, and 
reaped in Auguft. In wet feafons the oats are not cut 
down till O&amp;ober. The rent of the parifti may be about 
I. 1700 yearly. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, l£c. — The church was lately re- 
paired. The ftipend is L. 50, with L. 10 yearly compen- 
fation for manfe and glebe. There is no manfe in this pa- 
rifti, nor were there ever any manfes in Sky, till of late 
two manfes have been built. As there are no markets for 
provifions in the ifland, were the minifters confined to a 
manfe and glebe, they could not procure the neceflaries of 
life ; therefore they thought it more eligible to poflefs farms, 
and to accommodate themfelves as to houfes in the beft 
manner they could. The Laird of Macleod is patron of 
the parifh. — The number of poor on the lift, who are re- 
lieved in times of fcarcky, is 63. Many of thefe do not go 
about for alms, but relide moftly in the houfe of fome rela- 
tion. There are no other funds for the fupport of the 
poor, but the Sunday collections, and the fines of delin- 
quents, fo that they are chiefly fupported by the charity of 
the parifhioners. In a year of fcarcity, however, the fef- 
iion make a fliift to buy 10 bolls of meal for their relief. 
In fummer

bolls and 3 firlots, 'which was a moll feafonable relief ta 
the poorer fort of people. 

Price of Provifions and Labour, i£c. — As there are no 
flelh-markets, if a perfon is difpofed to eat beef, he muffc 
buy a whole cow ; if he would wilh to have mutton, he 
mull buy a fheep. A cow cofts from L. a, 10 s. to L. 3,. 
10 s. a fheep 6 s. Butter, when it can be procured, from 
10 s, to 1 as. cheefe 4s* the ftone weight. Domeflic men- 
fervants yearly wages are from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, exclu- 
five of 4 pair of fhoes to- each. A grieve (or overfeer) has 
from L. 4 to L. 7, befides his fhoes. Women -fer van ts have 
from 8-s. to 20 s. befides 3 pair of fhoes. When a man- 
fervant marries, and engages in fervice for a year, he has 
for wages as much ground as he can labour, grafs for a 
milk-cows, a dozen of fheep and 2 horfes, and a days in 
the week to do his own work, befides his victuals every 
day he works to his mafter. Every married labourer in 
this country has a fmall portion of land, he raifes a little 
flax, and has a few fheep, fo that his wife furnifhes hinx 
with his whole wearing apparel. Were he to buy yearly, 
as he would require, a bonnet at 1 s. 6 d. 3^ yards of coarfe 
cloth for a great coat, at 2 s. 6d.the yard, 5 yards of the 
fame for a jacket, waift-coat and 2 pair of breeches, 4 pair 
of fhoes at as. 6 d. each, 3 pair of hofe, and fo in propor- 
tion for his wife and children; alfo 12 bolls of meal for 
himfelf, wife and children, at 17 s. the boll, f barrel of fait,, 
at 5 s. f flone of iron at 2 s. together with fome other un- 
avoidable little charges, it would be. found that the yearly 
expence of a labourer and his family in the Ifle of Sky,, 
could not be much lefs than L. 20 Sterling.

ehapels, one in Trumpar in Vaternifh, and another in Glen- 
dale*

dale. There are alfo the ruins of feveral towers, reported 
by tradition to have been built by the Danes. Thefe 
towers feem not to have ever exceeded 20 feet in height. 
They are circular in their form, and were built in a very 
fubilantial manner, with large ftones, without any cement. 
They had an inner wall, very neatly built, with an empty 
fpace of about 5 feet in breadth, between the two walls, 
with openings through the inner wall, into the void fpace 
or interval between the two walls. They do not appear 
to have been ever roofed ; but the two walls were joined 
to each other at the top, by long flag-ftones laid acrofs be- 
tween the two walls, and covered with earth. The void 
fpaces between the walls, probably were intended for places 
of flielter and repofe, and for preferving arms and provi- 
fions from the weather ; and as every one of thefe towers 
is built in fight of one or more of the fame, it is natural to 
think that they were intended for places to make fignals 
from by fmoke and fire, upon an alarm, or the fight of an 
enemy, and likewife for defence j for as they are all built 
upon eminences, a few men could defend one of them a- 
gainft a thoufand, before the invention of cannon and gun- 
powder. There are two tombs in the parifli. In one of 
them, about 70 years fince, an urn was found, containing 
fome allies. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — As to the fize of the people, 
they are of a low ftature, the men in general from 5 feet 
4 inches, to 5 feet 8. There are very few men who are 
6 feet high ; they are however active and lively. The 
common people of Sky are blefled with excellent parts ; a 
liberal fliare of flrong natural fenfe, and great acutenefs of

PARISH or <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415696">KIRKINNER</name>, 
(county of wigton.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Graham.</head> 

<p>Situation, Surface, Soil, Air, Ifc. 

A Neighbouring parifli, Kircowan, is faid anciently to. 
*■ have made one parifli with Kirkinner ; and that of 
Longcaflle, now forming the S. W. corner of this parifli, 
has, in later times, been united to it. Kirkinner, from. 
S. E. to N. W. is about 9 Scotch miles, and about 8 from 1 
N. E. to S. W. ; from E. to W. about 6 miles ; and from 
N. to S. not quite 4. On the N. and N. W. it is bounded . 
by Wigton, Penningham, and Kircowan; by Mochrum, , 
on the W. ; by Glafferton, on the S. W. ; and by Sorbie, . 
on the S. ; on the E. and N. E. by the Frith of Cree, be- • 
tween this parifli and Kirkmabreck, in the ftewartry of : 
Galloway. The appearance of the country is hilly, but 
110 where mountainous. Its foil is generally thin and light, . 
the courfe land of Baldern excepted, which is a deep and 
rich clay, lying along the frith of Cree, which, fo far as 
this parifli goes, has a very flat clay or fleetchy fliore, with 
the hills or rifing grounds, generally at the diftance of a 
mile, or a little more from the tide. This carfe ground 
excepted, and about half a mile up from it, the parifli does

r.ot appear to have been naturally very fertile. But, by 
the benefit of fea-fhells, lime, and marl, the foil has been 
much improved, and ftill goes on improving. In the carfe 
of Baldern, lies an abundant treafure of fea-lhells, which 
the proprietor however referves for the ufe of his own e- 
ftate, in this and two neighbouring parifties. For the reft 
of the parifli, they are brought from the other fide of the 
Frith, and landed at Wigton, for I s. 6 d. or I s. 8 d. the 
ton. But where the land-carriage comes to exceed 3, or 
at utmoft 4 miles, our farmers prefer lime imported in 
fhells, from Whitehaven, or its neighbourhood. In fome 
places marl has been found, but it begins to be exhaufted. 
Our marl is of the fhell kind, found in bogs or mofs, but 
never, I think, in mofles of great extent. It feems to be 
agreed that the fubftance of the mar], is the fhells of the 
■frefh water wilk. I have feen a thin ftratum of it, begin 
to form at the bottom of ponds of Handing water. Our 
hills, in their natural ftate, were covered with furze and 
broom ; but, from the application of the above manures, 
the furze and broom begin to difappear •, though both are 
ftill troublefome to the farmer. The air is rather dry than 
moift, compared with that of the more northerly counties 
•of the weft of Scotland, and deferves the character of 
healthy. I have not obferved any prevalent diftempers. 
There is only one mineral fpring, and I am well affured it 
has been of ufe to remove complaints of the ftomach, and 
frequently proved a cure for the ague. We have many 
fprings of foft and light water, which I believe contribute 
much to the health of the inhabitants. 

The river of Bladnoch is the boundary between this 
parifh and Wigton, and between this parifh and Penning- 
ham. It produces very good falmon, but not in great 
quantities, from 3 d. to 4 d. the pound, and none is ex- 
ported. The tide goes up this river but a little way above 

ihe 



Statijlical Account 



the town of Wigton. Between this parilh Sorbie and 
Glafferton, on the S. W. lies the lake or loch of Dowal- 
ton, about 2 miles long, by 1^ broad, containing pike and 
herring ; and a little ifland on the Kirkinner fide of it,, an 
bout 30 acres arable. I wilh I could fee it ftocked with 
Shetland fheep. The extent of wafte ground along the frith 
of Cree, is about 3 miles. A fewfmall cod. and haddocks, 
fkate and foals, are taken there, and fold in the market of 
Wigton, from 1 d. to i£ d. a pound. None exported. The 
hills were formerly covered with furze or broom, now 
with good crops or pafture. Our moft valuable ftone is 
gray whinftone, ufed in building, principally for doors, 
corners, and windows. 

Population, i$c. — With refped to the ancient population, 
little is known. It is to be obferved, however, that there 
have been many houfes, where now there are none, and 
probably the tenements of land, as they were called, were 
fmaller, and more numerous ; confequently this parilh, 
wherein, to this day, there is not a village, might perhaps 
be more populous than it now is, at leaft than if was 10 or 
12 years ago. From the regifter of births, for 10 years 
down, from 1695 inclufive, the average was between 23 
and 24 for the 10 following years, it is between 28 and 
29. After that, the regifter begins to have been ill kept, 
down to the 1734 ; of which year, and the five following,' 
the average of births is not quite 24. From that time, 
down to the year 1780, the regifter has been fo ill kept, J 
that it cannot be depended on. The annual average of 
births fince that year, appears to be very nearly 29. Ac-4 
cording to Dr Webfter's returns, the number was 792. | 
The prefent population is 1152 ; males, 563; females, ] 
589. No regifter of deaths has ever been kept. But from 

aU 1

all information that can be obtained, the annual average 
appears not to exceed 14 ; fo that we are manifeftly a nur- 
fery, as I fuppofe all other country parilhes are, for cities 
and great towns, whofe induftry hath hitherto been fo 
much cheriihed, even at the expence, fometimes, of our 
radical and more valuable induftry on the foil, and the 
firft care of its productions, fo little underftood or valued 
by the luxurious citizens who live by them. But a wifer 
policy begins now, I think, to take place, or at leaft to 
be meditated. Marriages, in 11 years, have been 77. 
But frequently one only of the parties has refided in the 
parifti. There is one woman at prefent alive in this pa- 
rifti, faid to be feveral years above 100, and another known 
to be 9,8. The number of farmers, who rent lands in til- 
lage, is about 50. There are, befides thefe, a conuderable 
number who pay rent for fmall fpots of land, either imme- 
diately to the proprietors, or by fubtacks to principal te- 
nants, but who depend upon their induftry as day-labou- 
rers, or as handicraftfmen, for their fubfiftence. The fa- 
milies of this clafs are about ao. About 2000 acres of our 
beft land, is in pafture. Each confide rable farmer, befides 
fervants who live in his houfe, has generally a married fer- 
vant, to whom he gives a houfe, a fmall garden, and a cow's 
grafs, with ftraw for her fodder in the winter, and allows 
him to plant, in ground prepared and dunged for his own 
ufe, 3 or 4 bufhels of potatoes ; and belides other indi- 
gencies, L. 4. or L. 5 in money. The money- wages, and 
other articles allowed to fuch a fervant annually, may be 
eftimated between L. 12 and L. 14. 

The number of families is 238. Upwards of 30 of thefe 
have come into the parifli within thefe 12 years laft paft, 
owing to the divifion of one large farm into 13 or 14 fmal- 
ler poffeffions, and to feveral fubtacks on another farm, 
which had long lain in pafture 5 alfo to feveral fmall leafes 

of

of ground for houfes and gardens, with fometimes from iz 
to 20 acres, for tillage and pafture. So that the increafe 
of inhabitants in that time, feems to be nearly 200. There 
are 10 weavers, 7 tailors, 7 carpenters, 3 ftioemakers, 10 
houfehold fervants. Befides the married fervants above 
mentioned, I reckon one male and two female fervants for 
each of the 50 farmers, and a boy between 12 and 16 
years of age. The other 20, who poflefe very fmall farms, 
have the work of the farm chiefly performed by themfelves 
and their children. There are Irifh families about 27, and 
9 or 10 fingle men, employed as day-labourers. Not one 
half of the inhabitants, above the age of 20 years, have 
been born in the parifli. The people are not now, in any 
fenfe, as formerly, adfeiti glebce. As tacks of land are com- 
monly for 19 years, that' period changes a great propor- 
tion of the inhabitants. This has of late been remarkably 
the cafe in this parifli and neighbourhood ; becaufe the 
rents of lands have been greatly raifed, and it is obferved 
that tenants feldom agree to a great increafe of rent, for a 
farm they have formerly occupied. There are 1 0 heritors, 
2 of whom only relide ; one writer ; neither phyfician, 
furgeon, nor apothecary. There are between 90 and 100 
Seceders, 6 or 7 Roman Catholics from Ireland, and the 
reft of the inhabitants of the Eftabliflied Church. There 
are not quite five inhabitants to a houfe. 

Between 40 and 50 perfons emigrated from this parifli 
to America, in the year 1775, with a view to fettle there 
as planters or artifans. 

Agriculture, i£c. — The fummer ftock of black cattle, 
which is the chief article, without reckoning calves, may 
may be about 2700. They are of a very good kind gene- 
rally, but rather remarkable for lhapes and beef, than for 
milk. Horfes, of all ages, about 250. No conflderable 

flocks 



of Kirkinner. 



*43 



flocks of flieep are in the parilh. The farmers, however, 
generally keep as many as fupply them with wool and 
mutton for their families. About a third of the arable 
land is commonly in crop, where the land is leafed for til- 
lage. The farmers, after marling or liming grounds that 
have been well relied, take a crop, fometimes two, of bar- 
ley or bear, then a crop or two of oats, and with the third 
or fourth crop lay down with rye-grafs and clover ; but in 
general only for pafture. The dung is either laid upon 
their lee-lands, before they break them up, or is ufed for 
raifing potatoes, which are now generally horfe-hoed, 
unlefs where new ground is to be taken in by planting 
them in lazy beds. Confiderable quantities are exported 
to Whitehaven, Liverpool, and fometimes even to London. 
Very few of our farmers raife turnips or cabbages j the 
reafon probably is our diftance from any confiderable mar- 
ket for flail- fed cattle. Hardly any wheat is fown in this 
parifli. There is either in the foil or in the climate, more 
probably in the latter, fomething unfriendly to that grain. 
Even when tried by our beft farmers, it has always pro- 
ved of a very inferior quality. It often fmuts, and our 
harvefl is generally too rainy to fave it well. The parifh 
does much more than fupply itfelf with provifions. Be- 
fides what it fends to the neighbouring markets of Wigton 
and Newtonflewart, it exports confiderably, chiefly to 
Whitehaven and Liverpool, but fometimes alfo to Clyde, 
barley, bear and oats ; and fends yearly to England, from 
30 to 35 feore of bullocks to the St Faith's and Hampton 
markets. Thefe bullocks are not all reared in the parifh 
but are all grazed in it for a year or 6 months, before they 
are driven to England. The time of fowing oats general- 
ly commenceth about the 10th March, and that of reaping 
about the loth Auguft. No grounds lie wafte or in corn- 
won. We have no natural wood, and not much planta- 
tion.

tion, unlefs within thefe laft 15 or 20 years. There is 
fome fhell-marl, but our marl-pits are nearly exhaufted. 
There is one farm in the parifh employs 3 ploughs, j or 6 
more employ 2 on each. The greater part of the reft, each 
of them one. Some few fmall farmers join 2 or 3 toge- 
ther, to make up horfes for a plough, fo that in all there 
are about 55 ploughs employed. We have three kinds of 
ploughs in ufe : The Scotch plough made lighter than for- 
merly; the Carlifle plough, and the chain-plough. We 
have no waggons, but two carts may be reckoned to each 
plough. The land rent of the pariih may be about L. 5300, 
There lias not been much change in landed property for 3* 
years back. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, l£c. — The church is old, and bears 
no date. The manfe was built in 1731. The ftipend is 
L - 75 » the g leb e about 9 acres of very bad foil. The 
Crown and Mr Agnew of Shuchane are vice patrons. Sir 
William Maxwell of Monreith claims likewife a vice, 
The poor on the roll are 17. Some others receive occa- 
fional affiftance. The funds for their relief are chiefly col- 
lections, and voluntary donations of the heritors. There is 
only L. ao Sterling of fund belonging to the poor of this 
parifh, L. 10 of which was a legacy, and the other L. 10 
faved in good times. There is no market within the pa- 
rim. Wigton is the neareft market town. 

Prices, Wages, ifc. — An able labourer's day's wages are 
I s. mafons and carpenters 1 s. 6 d. tailors 1 s. The fuel 
commonly made ufe of is peat, from mofs within the pa- 
rifh, at 3 d. the fack of 8 bufhels in the mofs, the carriage 
in proportion to the diftance. We have no coal but by 
water-carriage, and paying over and above a very hard du- 
ty. The income of fervants in hufbandry may be from 

L. 12 



of Kirkinner. 145 

L. 12 to L.14, houfe, garden, &amp;c. included, together with 
any little thing their wives can add to it, which in this 
part of the kingdom is really a fmall matter, as there are 
no manufacturers eftablilhed in the neighbourhood. The 
wuges of male-fervants in the farmer's family are . from 
L. 7 to L. 7, I os. a-year, of female -fervants from L. 2, 10 s. 
to L. 3. Such fervants have it in their power to fave a 
little money, which, however, the love of finery and of 
fairs often prevents. 

Antiquities. — The veftiges of two ancient camps are ob- 
fervable, one of them diftincl enough. Both are circular, 
therefore not Roman ; but there is no tradition concerning 
them. There have been fome ancient coins found at dif- 
ferent times, turned up by the plough or the fpade, in a 
farm called Burnefs, belonging to the Earl of Selkirk. 
In a farm of Sir William Maxwell's, a large cairn of ftones 
being removed to build fences, a collection of human bones, 
half burnt, were found fome years ago, in an oblong fpace, 
formed with ftones fet on edge, and covered with a flat 
ftone above, without any infcription. In fummer 1789, 
there was difcovered an urn, and fome bones, bearing alfo 
marks of being partly confumed with fire. There were in 
the place, as they defcribe it, two cavities, one oblong, in 
which was an earthen urn, the other lefTer and ftmare, in 
which were the bones. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — Our principal object is agri- 
culture. Nothing is manufaftured for any diftant market. 
The people are generally prudent and ceconomical, yet hu- 
mane and generous to the extent of their ability. On the 
whole, we enjoy a reafonable degree of the comforts and 
advantages of fociety, and the body of the people do not 
betray any difcontentment with their fituation and circum- 

VoL ' IV - T fiances.

fiances. Yet it is unqueflionable, that the comforts of the 
labouring poor, and even of thofe immediately above them, 
are diminifhed by the increafing weight of taxes ; particu- 
larly by that upon malt, of which they are not infenfible, . 
though they fubmit to it, as to an evil they cannot remedy. 
In the courfe of the few years I have been among them, , 
many have found it neceflary, from the high price of malt, , 
to give up the ufe of malt liquor, even in the winter fea- • 
fon, when milk is not to be had. Statefmen have no op-- 
portunity to obferve fuch things ; but, perhaps, they are : 
not unworthy of their attention. It were much to be wifh- . 
ed, that they who labour the foil, could be allowed to tafte 
a little more of its fruits than what is abfolutely neceflary 
for a mere fubliftence. Our hired fervants enjoy the plen- • 
ty of their mailer's family ; but it is our poor houfeholders 
of the labouring clafs I would (if I could) plead for. 
They merit every thing of their country. While they 
toil for the prefent generation, they rear, nurfe and edij- • 
cate labourers, artifans and defenders for the fucceeding j , 
and this at the expence of hard drudgery, even to the lail : 
llage of exiltence, with few rewards but thofe of family- • 
affections, when they are fo happy as to enjoy them. 19 
is not thus I preach to them, becaufe I would neither ex- 
cite nor fofter difcontent in their breafls ; but it is thus, , 
methinks, that the minifters of a benevolent religion fhould ; 
preach to fenators and to ftatefmen. 

Are there means by which the condition of the people 1 
could be ameliorated ? is the mod amiable of the Statiftical . 
Queries. I hope there are, though I may not be well qua-|j 
lifted to point the.m out. The introduction of the coarfe 
woollen manufacture is that which fhould feem to bid the 
faireft for the better providing of poor families. Small at-  j 
tempts of this kind have been made, but hitherto have al- *■ 
ways foon failed. It mull ever be difficult to introduce { 

manufacturers 



of Kirkinner. 



147 



manufacturers in a lituation fuch as ours, where our new e- 
itablifhments mull rival old ones in neighbouring diftri&amp;s. 
But, perhaps, the greater!: barrier againft houfehold indu- 
ftry and manufacture among us, is the fcarcity of fuel in 
many parts of the country. A human being pinched with 
cold, when confined within doors, is always an inactive be- 
ing. The day-light, during the winter, is fpent by many 
of the women and children in gathering elding, as they call 
it, that is, flicks, furze, or broom, for fuel, and the even- 
ing in warming their fliivering limbs before the fcanty fire 
which this produces. Could our Legislators be conducted 
through this parifli in the winter months ; could the Lords 
and Commons, during the Chriftmas recefs, vifit the cot- 
tages of the poor through thefe parts of the united king- 
dom, where nature hath refufed coal, and their laws have 
more than doubled the price of it, this would be Shake- 
fpeare's " wholefome phyfic and would, more than any 
thing elfe, quicken their invention to find ways and means 
of fupplying the place of the worft of taxes.

(county of Perth.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Smith,</head> 


<p>
Name, Situation, Village, Soil, ifc. 

THE parifli of Rattray is faid to have taken its name 
from the ancient family of Rattray ; it is about 4 
miles long, from S. to N. •, near ^ miles, from E. to W. \. 
lying in the prefby tery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and 
Stirling : Bounded on the W. and S. by the water of 
Cricht, which feparates it from the parifli of Blairgourie - y 
on the E. and N. by the parifli of Benderley. Eafter 
Bleaton, which belongs to the parifli of Rattray, lies at 7 
miles diilance from it. Rattray is a village containing 
nearly aoo perfons r who are manufacturers of coarfe brown- 
linen cloth. The lituation is pleafant ; a fine fouthern 
expofure above the river Cricht. The foil, fliarp and dry, 
produces good oats and grafs, with fome wheat, the culture 
of which laft has been but lately introduced. The lower 
part of the parifli is moftly arable ; the higher, partly ara- 
ble, partly pafture. The land rent is about L. 1600. The 
inhabitants of the village are fober and diligent. There 
are 3 alehoufes in it but the morals of the inhabitants (a 



14S 



of Rattray. 



149 



few individuals excepted) are not affected by them. As 
the air is pure, and the foil dry, the inhabitants are heal- 
thy j no epidemical diftemper is known. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, according to 
Dr Webfter, was 751. At prefent, 500; which is con- 
fiderably lefs than when I knew the parifh in 1756. There 
were then many more fmall tenants than there is now. The 
ground was let out in fmall farms or pendicles, and many 
who had thefe, were weavers ; but of late, fome of the 
proprietors have let their ground in larger farms, and many 
of thefe fmall tenants have been removed. The annual 
number of marriages, is 10 ; baptifms, 20 ; and deaths, 20. 
In the parifh-are upwards of 42 weavers, 22 of them in 
the village ; 16 feuers. In the village 6 tailors, 5 fhoe- 
makers, 4 wrights, 2 fmiths, 2 mafons, 3 flax-d Tellers, 
about 60 Seceders, 3 lint mills for dreffing flax, a confider- 
able quantity of which is raifed, (one of thefe mills is foon 
to be turned into a mill for fpinning cotton), 3 bleachfields, 
2 diftilleries. 

Church, Stipend, School, &amp;c. — The church and manfe 
are old, and not in good repair. The glebe nearly 6 a- 
cres. The ftipend L. 65. Earl of Kinnoul, patron. There 
are 5 heritors. The falary of the fchoolmafter is L. 8, 6 s. 
* 8 d. and the perquifites amount nearly to the fame fum ; 
the number of fcholars about 40. 

Ruins.— To the S. E. of the village, there is a riling 
ground, known by the name of the Caftle Hill, upon 
which the veftiges of a very large building are to be feen, 
which was called the Caftle of Rattray, and was the refi- 
dence of the family of Rattray, of great antiquity, accord- 
ing to the account given of it in the Baronage of Scotland. 

About 



I 5° Statijlical Account 

About 2 miles N. of the village, is Craighall, which almoft 
exceeds defcription. The houfe ftands upon the point of a 
rock, above the river Cricht, at leaft 100 feet in height. 
It was a place of ftrength. The river, and that high rock, 
defended it upon the N. and W. fide. There is no way to 
it, but from the S. There are round towers at each fide 
of the houfe, and the veftiges of a ditch. Above the river, 
S. E. from the village, in a beautiful fituation, is a Drui- 
dical temple, much defaced, and many of the ftones carried 
off. The farm upon which it has been built, is called 
Standing Stones. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. —There is at a little diftance 
from Rattray, a cafcade or fall of water, about 10 feet 
high, over a rugged rock, which forms a pool below, where 
falmon are caught. It goes by the name of the Keith 
Fifhing, and rents at L. 30 a year. The mode of fifliing 
is curious : They make what they call a drtmuck, refem- 
bling thin wrought mortar, which they throw into the 
pool, to difturb the clearnefs of the water. The fifliers 
Hand upon the point of the rock, with long poles, and nets 
upon the end of them, with which they rake the pool, 
and take up the fifli. Sportfmen look upon the water of 
Cricht, as one of the fineft rivers for rod-fifhing, both for 
trout and falmon. — The moffes are moftly exhaufted, which 
renders fuel expenfive. Coals, from Dundee and Perth, 
are the principal fuel made ufe of here, which takes up 
much time, as the carriage is both long and expenfive.

By the Rev. Mr Donald Mitchell.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, River, Surface, 13c. 

' I ' HE name Ardclach is Gaelic, and fignifies « a ftony 
J- ' high ground.* The parilh is fituated in the extre- 
mity of the county of Nairne, and lies S. E. of the town 
of Nairne, in the prefbytery of Nairne, and Synod of 
Moray. It is bounded by Auldearn, Nairne, Calder, 
Moy, Duthel and Edinkelly, and reckoned about 10 or 12 
miles long, and between 7 and 8 broad, divided by Find- 
horn river, which is not navigable ; neither is there a pof- 
libility of rendering it fo. During the fummer months, 
fome falmon pals up from the fea, feveral miles above Ard- 
clach, in this water. No other kind of fifh, but trout, is 
to be found in it. This river is rapid, and frequently im- 
paffable every where, excepting at Dulcy bridge, on the 
highland road leading from Fort George to Edinburgh 
There are two boats on this water within the parilh and 
one on the poft road; but owing either to the mifmanage- 
ment of the boatmen, or temerity of the people, many 
hves are loft. During the incumbency of the prefent mi-

nifter, no lefs than 23 perfons have been loft between Dui- 
cy bridge and the poft-road. The lofs of lives from this 
caufe claims attention ; and the only method that can be 
pointed out, to prevent it, is to erect a bridge between the 
two boats, which would render the communication both 
fafe and eafy. This parifh is a hilly mountainous diftrict, 
covered with heath, and furnifhes little of any other kind 
of pafture. There is much wood in it, confining of firs, 
birch, and what is called weeping birch, alder, hazel, afh 
and fome oaks. The birch, alder and afii, are manufactu- 
red for labouring utenfils. The woods and hills abound 
with moor-fowl, wood-cock, partrides, hares, foxes and 
fome deer. The otter and wild cat are frequently feen on 
the water's fide. 

Agriculture, 13 c. — The quantity of grain produced, gene- 
rally ferves the people; but in the years 1782 and 1783, they 
felt the effects of thefe feafons of fcarcity ; however, none 
periflied from want. The principal crops are black and 
white oats, Scotch bear, rye and potatoes. The foil feems 
to be unfit for any other kinds, being fliallow and thin, 
covered with Hone, with a hard gravelly bottom. There 
is feldom above the third return, and the crop is much ex- 
pofed to froft. It is fuppofed lime might improve the foil; 
but the tenants are in general fo poor, that they cannot af- 
ford the expence of it. Attempts have been made to dif- 
cover limeftone within the parifh, without fuccefs. The 
method of labouring feems to have undergone little altera- 
tion for centuries back. The farmers ufe the fmall Scotch 
plough, drawn by 4 or 6 black cattle, and 2 fmall horfes, 
or by 4 horfes and 4 black cattle. From the moft accurate 
accounts, there are about 300 horfes, 1000 black cattle, 
and 2000 fheep, of the fmall Scotch breed ; a larger kind 
of thofe lafl have been tried, but it is generally thought a 

mixed

mixed breed anfwer beft. — The rental produced before the 
Court of Teinds, in a procefs of augmentation in the year 
1786, was 283 bolls victual, and L. 543 : 8 : 5 in money. 
Since that period, there has been an increafe of rent in fe- 
veral parts of the parifh, and the heritors propofe giving 
leafes in general for 19 years. The fole dependence of the 
tenants is on their cattle. From their want of leafes, as 
well as the barrennefs of the foil, they found it their inte- 
reft to rear as many black cattle as they poffibly could. It 
is fuppofed there are about 2000 acres of arable land, and 
4000 acres confifting of mofs and moor, a very fmall part 
of which feems to be improvable for corn-lands. 

ManufaElures. — The principal manufactures are plaiden, 
which is reckoned the beft in the country, and coarfe tar- 
tan, with a kind of broad cloth and duffle. Within thefe 
5 years wool has fold at 18 s. the ftone. Attempts have 
been made to raife flax, without fuccefs. There are no 
lefs than 5 licenfed diftilleries, which are fupplied with 
barley and malt from the low country. Their licenfes are 
below L. 40. It might be thought that the diftilling of fo 
much whiiky, would be attended with the worft of confe- 
quences to the morals of the people.; but this has not pro- 
ved to be the cafe. As this parifli abounds with mofs for 
peats, and mofs-fir, a confiderable number were in ufe of 
making whiflcy in a fmuggling way, and fo had an oppor- 
tunity of drinking more than was proper for them ; but 
fince the eftablifhment of licenfed diftilleries, this practice 
has been checked, and the people are become more fober 
than formerly. There is no inn within the parifli, but one 
at Dulcy bridge, on the highland road to Edinburgh. 

Prices and Wages.— The neareft markets for butcher- 
meat are Forres and Nairne, about 12 miles diftant from 
Vol. IV. U this

this place, and meat of all kinds is commonly fold there at 
3 d. and fometimes 4 d. the pound. Fowls are fold within 
the parifli at 6 d. the loweft, and eggs at 2 d. the dozen 
The wages of domeftic men-fervants are L. 5 and L. 6 in 
the year, of women-fervants L. I, 16 s. and L. 2. Day-la- 
bourers have 8 d. a-day, with their victuals ; and till of 
late they were fatisfied with 6 d. 

Population, life—The air appears to be healthy. Many 
ftill alive are paft 70, and fame paft 80 years of age ; and it 
is faid there have been inftances of a few arriving at 100. 
From the lift given to Dr Webfter, the number of fouls 
then was 1163, in 1781 it was 1167, at prefent 1186. 
The proportion of males to females is as 18 to 20, There 
are 4 heritors, none of whom refide. No Diffenters. Many 
perfons emigrated from the parifh a fliort time before the 
American war. There are no uninhabited houfes ; the 
houfes in general are built of feal, and of fome ftones in the 
foundation. As the people have feveral burying places 
without the parifh, deaths cannot be exactly ascertained ; 
but for fome years back, it is believed they have not ex- 
ceeded 24 in the courts of the year, and births are between 
30 and 40. St Anthony's fire is a difeafe peculiar to the 
people of this place, both young and old. The fmall pox 
is frequently fatal here as in other places, and has been re- 
markably fo this feafon, to children and fome advanced in 
years. The moft effe&amp;ual way to remove their prejudices 
againft inoculation, would be for the heritors to defray the 
expence for a limited period. 

Churchy Stipend, Poor, School, ifc.—The church is faid 
to have been built in 1626, and was rebuilt about 30 
years ago. The manfe was built in 1744. The ftipend 
is L. 55 : 16 : 9 Sterling, and 31 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 pecks oat-^

meal. The glebe is between 4 and 5 acres arable, with 
little grafs. Mifs Brodie Q f Lethen has the right of patron- 
age. — There is no fund for the poor, excepting the weekly 
collections, which amount to about L. 3 or L. 4 yearly. 
The number of poor on the roll is 35, though many more 
might be added. This fum, joined to the collections made 
when the Sacrament is difpenfed, furnifli but a fcanty al- 
lowance. The ordinary method by which the poor in this 
country procure a fubfiftence is by begging. — The falary of 
the parifti fchool is L. 10 Sterling, and the number of fcho- 
lars in winter is about 40. There is befides a Society 
fchool in a diftant part of the parifli, for reading and wri- 
ting, where the number of children this winter have been 
upwards of 40, and another called a Spinning-fchool, to 
which Mifs Brodie of Lethen pays about half the falary, 
the reft is paid by the Society, making in all L. 10 Ster- 
ling. Mifs Brodie likewife gives the perfons who have 
tharge of this fchool fuel gratis.

<p>Situation, Surface, Soil, and Minerals.

■T^HE parifti of Udny was an ereftion from the neighbour* 
-■■ ing parifhes of Logie Buchan, Ellon, Tarves, and 
Foveran, in the end of the 16th, or beginning of the 17th 
century. One eftate pays ftipend to the minifter of Logie 
Buchan, and five eftates to the minifter of Ellon ; a full 
evidence that thefe eftates were taken off thefe two pa- 
rifties. It is fituated in the county and Synod of Aberdeen, 
and prefbytery of Ellon. In extent 5 computed miles 
fquare. It is bounded on the N. and N. W. by the parifti 

of 



of Udny.

of Tarves ; on the W. by Bourtie ; on the S. W. by 
Kiethhall ; on the S. by Newmacher •, on the S. E. by 
JBelhelvie ; on the E. by Foveran ; on the N. E. by Logie 
Buchan and Ellon. The general appearance of the coun- 
try is pretty flat, with fmall eminences or little hills, co- 
vered with fhort grafe. The foil is in general a deep loam, 
with a confiderable proportion of wet ground, partly on a 
clay bottom. There are fmall dreams of water in the val- 
leys, from which the lands rife gently on each fide, and 
are tolerably fertile. The air is healthy. Agues are fcarcely. 
known. There are quarries of granite for building, and 
abundance of ftones in the fields. At Pitmedden there is 
a limeftone quarry, which was formerly wrought, but now 
difcontinued, on account of water breaking in upon it. 
Upon the Mains of Udny, is another. The lime is fold at 
I s. 4f-d. the boll flacked lime, confining of 4 firlots, 32 
Stirling pints in each. The demand for this lime, will be 
principally from the diftricT: of Garioch, where they have 
no lime-quarries. The Englifti fliell-lime fold at New- 
burgh at 2 s. 8 d. the boll, yielding 3 bolls flacked, is found 
by the farmers here to be much cheaper. 

Population. — The numbers of the people, according to 
Dr Webfter, were 1322. The amount of the prefent po- 
pulation, in January 1791, is 1137 fouls; of whom, 571 
males, 566 females.

I Aver. 8. j Average, 12. 

By the above lift, the annual average of births, is 20. 
But as parents fometimes negleft the regiftrating their 
childrens names, it may be called 2a. 

Probably 3 more may be added to the average of bu- 
rials, on account of fome parimioners here being buried in 
different church-yards ; fo that the anaual average of 
deaths, of parilhioners, is 1 j. 

The number of fouls under 10 years of age, is about 
202 ; from 70 to 80, about 23 ; from 80 to 90, 5. 986 
are of the Eftablifhed Church ; 107 Epifcopalians ; 35 Se- 
ceders ; 4 Quakers ; and 5 Roman Catholics. Number of 
inhabited houfes, 259 ; about 47 perfons to each. No towns 
nor villages. There are 1 1 heritors, 2 of whom only re- 
fide ; 9 lhoemakers, 10 fmiths, 4 tailors, 7 wrights, 4 
weavers, 2 mafons, 1 flater, who are employed in work- 
ing for the inhabitants of the parifh, have crofts of land, 
and are confequently in part occupied in hufbandry. The 
other inhabitants are farmers, and their fubtenants. The 
population feems to be lefs than it was fome years ago. 
In 1768, there were about 11 16, above 7 years of age; in 

1780, 



-of Udny. I59 

1780, 1034; in January 1791, only 900. As peats and 
turf are the ufual fuel, I afcribe this diminution to the ma- 
terials becoming fcarcer ; from which feveral of the fub- 
tenants have removed to the neighbouring pariflies, and 
particularly to Aberdeen, where the different manufactures 
eitablifhed there, afford them occupation. The proportion 
of annual births, taking the average of 5 years to the 
whole population, January 1791 is as 1 to 52 nearly; of 
annual marriages, as 1 to 142 ; of annual deaths, as 1 to 
76. In autumn 1790, a putrid ulcerous fore throat, in. 
this and fome neighbouring pariflies, proved fatal to many, 
as appears by the above lift of burials for that year. 

Agriculture, l£c. — The late "proprietor of the lands of 
Udny, who was one of the Commiflioners of Excife, was 
perhaps the firft gentleman in this part of the country, 
who raifed abundant crops of red clover and turnips upon 
his fields. His farm here, of above 400 acres, he im- 
proved at a very confiderable expence. From 200 to 250 
acres are inclofed by a neat ftone fence, two rows of elms 
or beeches, and a hawthorn hedge. He reared riding 
horfes of an excellent breed, and cattle of a much larger 
fize than fuch as were in this country formerly. Ten or 
twelve cattle were ufually fattened by the turnips, and fold 
for the Aberdeen market yearly.— The rending heritors 
• occupy part of their own grounds, on which they are car- 
rying on improvements. One of them has a fmall farm in 
excellent order, producing abundant crops of grain, fown 
grafs, andtwrnips of an excellent fort, and' early. Ano- 
ther heritor, who occafionally refides, has improved his 
eftate at a confiderable expence. It is now inclofed by 
ftone fences, and produces abundant crops of grain, and 
large quantities of hay. The valued rent of the park is 
L.5831 Scots; the real rent/about L. 2100 or L.2200 

Sterlings 



Statijlical Account 

Sterling, partly paid in viftual, partly in money. Infield 
land, in fmall parcels, kts at L. i the boll's lowing ; mea- 
dow, at 7s. or 8 s.; outfield, from 2 s. to 4 s. ; but in 
large farms, the rent is not near fo high. The lands are in 
general uninclofed. Property, in land, has not fhifted 
much for fome time. Thirty years purchafe, when the 
eftate is low rented, is the common price. Barley, oats, 
peafe, turnips, potatoes, clover and rye grafs, with fmall 
quantities of lint, are the produftions of the parifli. There 
are very few trees. At Knapornay, and upon the Mains 
of Udny, are fome inclofures of Scotch fir, fit for ufe. At 
Udny, are allies, elms, beeches, and planes, of considerable 
fize. Thofe few proprietors who refide in the parifh, and 
12 or 13 of the farmers, have fields of fown grafs and tur- 
nips. They purchafe lime for their grounds, and have a 
proper rotation of crops ; but among all the others, the 
old mode of farming prevails, via. Eaoh year they manure 
with the dung of their cattle one third of what is called 
infield ground, in which bear is fown ; then follow two 
fucceffive crops of oats, by which means the ground is never 
cleaned of weeds. They fold their cattle on the outfields, 
and take 3 or 4 fucceffive crops of oats. The great pro- 
duce of the parifh is oats, made into meal by the farmers ; 
part of it is paid in rent to the proprietor of the land, and 
the remainder fold at Aberdeen. Much more grain is pro- 
duced in the parifh than is annually confumed in it. The 
farms are univerfally thirled to a mill, and obliged to pay, 
fome the nth or 12th, many the 16th or 20th part of the 
produce to the tackfman of the mill, whether the corns 
are carried to the mill or not. — Formerly there were 80 
ploughs in the parifh. Ten or twelve oxen were then ge- 
nerally ufed in a plough. Horfes being feldom ufed, un- 
lefs during fpring, after a fevere winter •, the farmers fome- 
times then yoked their horfes in a plough. Now there are 

about 



of Udny. 



about 20 farmers in the parifh, who ftill ufe 10 oxen in 
the plough ; 10 or n farmers, ufe 6 or 8 oxen. The o- 
ther ploughs are drawn by 4 horfes, or by 2 or 4 cattle, 
with 2 horfes going before them. There are about 87 
ploughs in the parifh, in all. — V ery few Iheep are kept ; 
not having extenfive pafturage for them. The farmers 
find it more profitable to rear cattle. They all have cows ; 
and the butter of this parifh has been long famous for its' 
excellent quality. It is generally fold in the Aberdeen 
market at 8 d. the pound, 28 ounces Averdupois for the 
pound ; or faked for the inhabitants of Aberdeen, at that 
price. The cheefe is fold there, from 4 s. to 5 s. the ftone 
28 pounds Englifh the ftone. Cows of a middling flze 
generally yield of milk from 6 to 8 Scotch pints the day, 
and their produce for a feafon (J. e. butter and cheefe) may- 
be reckoned in value, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling, from 
each cow. Some farmers have cows of a larger fize, which 
give from 10 to 11 or 12 Scotch pints in the day. One 
keeps 14 Targe cows, the milk of which, after the cream 
is taken off, is fent every day to Aberdeen, (8 miles di- 
ftant), and fold from 1 d. to 1^ d. the Scotch pint. The 
butter made from thefe cows, was 2 ftone weight the week, 
and fold at 9 d. the pound. — Oats are fown in the month 
of March, and firft part of April, and reaped in September 
and October. Bear is fown in April, and firft part of May, 
reaped the end of Auguft and month of September. Tur- 
nips are fown in the middle, or towards the end of June, 
and ufed dufing winter. The parifh does much more than 
fupply itfelf in provifions, befides meal and bear. Fat cat- 
tie, a few fheep, poultry, chiefly hens and ducks, are fold 
at Aberdeen.

and fomctimcs 5 d. or 6 d. The day's wages of a labourer 
in hufbandry are 9 d. in fummer, and 7 d. in winter, or in 
fummer 6 d. with victuals ; of a carpenter 1 s. mafon 1 s. 
6d. tailor 6 d. with his victuals. The ufual wages of a 
man-fervant employed in hufbandry are L. 5 a-year, when 
hired for harveft L. 1, 10 s. Sterling; of a woman-fervant 
are from L. 2, 5 s. to L. 2, 10 s. Sterling a-year, when hi- 
red for harveft 16 s. 8 d. or 18 s. 4 d. receiving their vic- 
tnals in the houfe. The farmers are obliged to hire fer- 
vants for the whole harveft, as day-labourers cannot be 
procured. The wages of a man in harveft for a day are 1 s. 
with his victuals. The fuel generally ufed is peat or turf. 
The calling, drying their peat and turf, and driving them, 
employ the farmers fervants and horfes during a great part 
of the fummer, and prove a great obftacle to the improve- 
ment of their grounds. The farmers are far from being 
in comfortable circumftances. Few of them have at firft 
money for purchafing a fufEcient flock of cattle,, and are ne- 
ver able to improve them. By following the old mode of 
farming, as above mentioned, though they work hard a- 
long with their fervants, and live with great fobriety, they 
can fcarcely pay their rents, and the wages of their fer- 
vants, which have of late rifen fully one-third more than 15, 
or 20 years ago. The women and children #re employed 
in working ftockings for the marmfafiirers in Aberdeen. 
They or their fervants come once a-fortnight to different 
parts of the parifh, give wool to be fpun,, and worked on 
the wires into ftockings. A woman gains from 1 s. 6 d. to 
2 s. a- week. Some few fpin lint, by which a little more 
may be gained. It is not eafy precifely to afcertain the 
expence of "a common labourer when married. He has a 
boll's fowing or two from the tenant ; it is plowed to him ; 
his cow kept in fummer with the farmer's cattle ; and the 
ftraw of his corn from his croft maintains the cow during 

winter-

winter. He has liberty to caft turf for himfelf, and fometimes 
a few peats. He works to the farmer in harveft, attends 
the plough during winter and fpring, at which time he ei- 
ther receives his victuals in the farmer's houfe, or has al- 
lowed him 2 pecks of oat-meal a-week. What time he 
has to fpare in fummer, from Whitfunday to harveft, he 
works for day's wages to different perfons. His wife and 
children weave ftockings, as above mentioned, until the 
boys are fit for herding cattle. What is thus earned, if he 
and his wife are induftrious, and his family keep in health, 
maintains them in a fober way. Oat-meal, cabbages, 
greens, potatoes, whey, and fometimes part of the milk of 
his cow, are their daily fare. Beer or ale they can feldom, 
tafte. One great hardlhip is, that after having improved 
his fmall croft, it is fometimes taken from him. He pof- 
fefles it only from year to year, and is therefore obliged to 
remove from place to place. 

Stipend, Church, School and Poor. — The value of the li- 
ving, converting the meal paid in ftipend at 10 s. the boll, 
the barley at 1 2 s. and the glebe at the common rent of 
ground here, is about L. 70 or L. 71 Sterling. Mr Udny 
of Udny is patron. The church was at firft built about 
1600, was partly rebuilt in 1760, and received a. partial re- 
paration in 1786, but is by far too fmall for the accommo- 
dation of the parifh. A new manfe was built in 1759, 
and was confiderably enlarged and repaired in 178 1. A 
new fchool-houfe was ere&amp;ed in 1786. — The fchoolmafter's 
falary is L. 11 Sterling. There are generally from 30 to 
40 fcholars, and at prefent 11 boarders, at 13 guineas a- 
year, for board and education. — The number of poor is 
from 20 to 22. None of them go about as beggars, but 
we have a confiderable number of fuch from Aberdeen and 
neighbouring places. Th« annual amount of the funds fox

their relief is from L. 28 to L. 30, arifing from fome fmall 
mortifications, and the dues of mortcloths j but principally 
from the colledions in the church. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.— -The people in this parilh are 
fober, induftrious, and feemingly contented with their fitua- 
tion •, yet there are many things which would contribute to 
better their circumftances. In particular, the taking off 
the duty on coals, by which they could fupply themfelves 
with fuel, with much lefs labour and expence, and. be able 
to employ the fummer in bringing lime, and inclofing 
their fields ; whereas at prefent the fummer is wafted in 
procuring peats and turf. The high duties on malt and 
leather, fall heavy on thofe who have large families. If 
the proprietors of eftates, inftead of taking grajfums at the 
end of 19 years, by which their tenants are impoverifhed, 
would alk a moderate rife of rent, give them long leafes, 
encouragement for building tolerable houfes and inclofing 
their ground, abolilh the multures at mills, fo that pay- 
ment could only be exacted for work, and oblige the te- 
nants to fubfet their ground to fubtenants for a certain 
number of years, and if the public roads, which are exceed- 
ingly bad, vyere under better management, and kept in 
proper repair, the fituation of all ranks would be confider- 
ably improved. — None have died from want ; nor have 
murders, fuicides, or atrocious crimes been committed for 
many years part. None have been baniflied from the pa- 
rim, nor obliged to leave it- for want of employment, as 
there is a fcarcity of hands for work in hufbandry. Such 
as have removed, have had a view of better encourage- 
ment at Aberdeen, or in the neighbouring parifties. 
Crops 17S2 and 1783, being very deficient, many of the 
farmers were then obliged to difpofe of their oxen ; and 
have not yet recovered the lofs then fuftained, nor 

been 



of Udny .

been able to keep fo good cattle, or fuch a number of them 
as formerly. Crop 1782, from want of funlhine to ripen 
it, and by intenfe froft and fnow, which came on before it 
could be cut down, was exceedingly deficient. The inha- 
bitants of this parilh bought bear and peafe imported at A- 
berdeen, by which, with their own fcanty crop, they {up- 
ported themfelves. The church-feflion purchafed fome meal 
and grain, which they caufed make into meal ; this was 
fold in fmall quantities, to the pooreft of the parifliioners. 
Thirty bolls of meal, and 2 bolls of peafe, granted by Go- 
vernment in 1783, proved a ufeful and feafonable fupply to 
many, fo that no perfon died for want ; but, as I have al- 
ready mentioned, many of the farmers were confiderably 
impoverilhed by thefe two deficient crops.

<p>Situation, Surface, Sail, &amp;c. 

ORmistoun parifh is fituated on the weft Ikirts of the 
county of Eaft Lothian, in the prefbytery of Dal- 
keith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. Its form is 
very irregular, refembling in fome meafure a horfe's Ihoe, 
winding about the parifh of Pencaitland on the N. W. and 
S. The length is about 5 miles, the breadth very diffe- 
rent at different places, being from 3 miles to about half a 
mile. It is bounded by the parifh of Tranent on the N. 
by Pencaitland on the E. by Humbie on the S. and by Cran- 
fton on the W. The appearance of the country in general 
is flat. It is inclofed with hedges of white thorn, mixed 
with fweet briar, honeyfuckle and hedge-row trees. A

Agriculture, iSc. — Beft lands let from L. i, ios. to L. I, 
15 s. the acre. In general, there are but few cattle bred 
here, except what the farmers have occafion for in the 
working of their farms, which they labour moftly with 
horfes. The cattle they do breed are excellent, both horfes 
and cows. Every farmer fupplies his ftock of horfes from 
his own breeding mares, which he covers with ftrong made 
ftallions from the north of England, of the draught kind ; 
and fometimes with ftrong made horfes of the road or hunt- 
ing kind. One farmer here thinks the beft breed comes 
from a ftout blood ftallion with his own working mares. 
Our cows are a mixture of the Holdernefs kind, with that 
of this country. They are fhort horned and handfome, 
fatten well, and give much milk. We have had frequent 
inftances of 20 Scotch pints in the day. That quantity in- 
deed is rather extraordinary, but from 10 to 15 is com- 
mon. Provifions of all kinds, fifh excepted, abound in this 
parifh ; and belides, it fends out fupplies to the metropolis, 
and neighbouring towns. — We fow in the months of March, 
April and May, and generally begin to reap in the firfl: 
week of September. There are employed in the parifti at 
prefent about 25 ploughs. The farmers deal much in the 
different kinds of fown grafs, viz. clovers, rye-grafs, tre- 
foil, rib-grafs, firfl for hay, and then for pafture. The 
ploughs in general are of Small's conftru&amp;ion. They have 
a caft yetland mould-broad, which is curved, and about f- 
inch thick at the under edge, tapering upwards to about 
•| inch at the higher edge. They have plated or winged 
focks of iron, fhoes and earth-board of the fame metal, 
with a kneed coulter. Some have a chain fixed to the 
under fide of the beam behind, and to the muzzle before,

by which the plough is directed. A well made improved 
Scotch plough is alfo ufed by the farmers here. Both in- 
ftruments perform well in the hands of a Ikilful plough- 
man, who takes care to apply them to foils to which they 
are adapted. — The Earl of Hopetoun has valuable woods 
in this parifli, confifting of about 70 Scotch acres. 

Population. — It does not appear that the population of 
this parifli has either been much increafed or diminifhed 
for at leaft 100 years paft. The return to Dr Webfter was 
810. There are at prefent 193 families, 132 married wo- 
men, 398 above 7 years of age, and 141 below 7 years of 
age. The amount of the whole 864, including all fefta- 
rifts. The annual average of births for 10 years, begin- 
ning with 1709, is 26; for 10 years, beginning with 1734, 
is 28; and for 10 years, beginning 1775, is 27. If the 
idea were juft, ' That the population of any diftricl: or 
' country may be known with fufficient accuracy, by mul- 
« tiplying the births by 26,' the prefent population of this 
parifli would be 702, but which is 162 lefs than it really 
is. Multiplying our births by 32, correfponds with the 
ftate of our population' as near as can be. Multiplying the 
births by 26, may perhaps afcertain the population of large 
cities and manufacturing towns, which are always unfa- 
vourable to the rearing of children ; but, in my opinion, it 
cannot be applied with exa£mefs, to healthy lituations in 
the country. In general, throughout Scotland, it is not a 
regifter of births that is kept by the clerk of the parifli, 
but a regifter of baptifms. On this account, children who 
are not baptifed (as feveral are not) are not regiftered. 
Children alfo, whofe parents are unable or unwilling to 
pay the dues to the clerk, are generally not regiftered ; fo 
that from thefe, and various other circumftances, I am far 
from thinking that the regifter of baptifms in Scotland is 

to 



of Ormijloun, 



to be depended upon, for bringing out an exa&amp; ftate of the 
population of our country. A few perfons have emigra- 
ted in queft of better encouragement. There are 193 in- 
habited houfes, and the number of perfons at an average to 
each houfe is 4^. 

Prices and Wagesi — The price of beef, mutton, pork and 
lamb 50 or 60 years ago, was from i£d. to 27 d. the Dutch 
pound. Few calves are, or ever were fed in this pariih. 
Other articles were proportionably low. The prefent ave- 
rage price of beef, mutton, pork and lamb, throughout the 
year, is about 3-f-d. Wheat and other grain has advanced high 
this year ; but the average price is, wheat L. 1, is. the boll, 
barley 17 s. oats 14 s. and peafe 12 s. ■ In hufbandry, the 
wages of labourers, by the day, are from 9 d. to 1 s. j of 
wrights, 1 s. 4 d. ; of brick-layers and mafons, from is. 8 d. 
to is. xod. ; tailors, fmiths and weavers have not advan- 
ced their wages fo high as others mentioned above. Com- 
mon labourers, when married, receive the fame wages with 
thofe mentioned above. If the man is fortunate in having 
a frugal and induftrious wife, he is able to maintain and e- 
ducate his family very well. 

Village of Ormijloun. — The village of Ormiftoun is the 
only one in this pariih which deferves the name. It con- 
tains between 500 and 6co perfons, who enjoy almoft eve- 
ry natural and moral advantage for domeftic comfort. In 
refpeft of health, the fituatfon is very favourable. The 
village (lands upon gravel, and confifts chiefly of two rows 
of houfes of two ftorfes, the one fronting the fouth, and the 
other the north, with a broad airy ftreet between them. 
In the middle of the ftreet is a crofs, of which there is no 
tradition 5 but from its ancient appearance, it is evidently a 
relick of Popery. The houfes on both fides of the ftreet

are flieltered by trees, which grow in the hedge-rows of 
the adjacent inclofares, but not fo much as to prevent a 
free circulation of air. Of this laft circumftance the Earl 
of Hopetoun is fo attentive, as to give orders to thin his 
trees when they are hurtful to the inhabitants. This is 
chiefly a farming village. Though attempts have been 
made, the linen manufacture never fucceeded here. At pre- 
fent we have two diftilleries, and a ftarch-work, employ- 
ing between 30 and 40 hands. 

Antiquities. — On the top of Dodridge Law, the higheft 
ground in this parifh, about 2 miles S. from the church, 
there are to be feen the remains of what is faid to have been 
a Roman camp. But the late Dr Henry of Edinburgh 
feemed rather to think, it Danifh. 

Eminent Men. — This parifh gave birth to the Cockburns 
of Ormiftoun, a Proteftant family at the Reformation, and 
Whig afterwards. Cockburn, Lord Juftice-Clerk, was e- 
minent as a judge and lawyer. John, his fon and fucceffor, 
no lefs fo as a ftatefman and patriotic reprefentative of his 
country in the Union Parliament, and in feveral fucceeding 
Parliaments. He was for a confiderable time one of the Lords 
of the Admiralty. In this high ftation he diftinguiflied 
himfelf by his abilities and attention in promoting the ge- 
neral commerce of Britain, and preferving unfullied the ho- 
nour of the Britifh Flag. About the year 1740, he reti- 
red from public bufinefs, to fettle on his own eftate, which 
he confiderably improved, but to which he did not confine 
his attention ; for wherever his prefence was neceffary to 
excite a fpirit of improvement in agriculture and the linen 
manufacture, there you found Mr John Cockburn. He 
contributed to erect the firft bleachfield in Scotland ; and 
it was by his example and influence, that the firft vigorous 

exertions 



of Ormiftoun* 



171 



exertions were made in the making and repairing of high 
roads in this neighbourhood. Thus, from feeble begin- 
nings, works of public utility became general through the 
county. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — The people in general are 
ceconomical, but for their circumftances have rather too ex- 
penfive a tafte. — Property in land has been more fixed in 
this parifti than in moil others. The eftate of Ormiftoun 
has only once changed its proprietor for feveral hundred 
years. In the year 1747, the late Earl of Hopetoun being 
then proprietor of three farms in the parifh, purchafed the 
whole, fo the prefent Earl is now fole heritor and pa- 
tron of the parifh. The roads in general are in bad repair, 
and fome bridges are wanted. The badnefs of our roads, 
however, is not owing to careleffnefs, but to the deepnefs 
of the foil, and the fcarcity of proper materials for repair- 
ing them. I defpair of feeing them much altered for the 
better, till a proper turnpike-law is obtained. — In the fcan- 
ty years of 1782 and 1783, the poor no doubt fufFered ; 
but from the humanity of the Earl of Hopetoun, not fo 
much as might have been apprehended. — Near the village of 
Ormiftoun, on the fouth, is a bridge of two arches, built 
many years ago over the Tyne, a very fmall river indeed 
at this place, but by additions which it receives in its courfe 
to the German Ocean, which it enters about 20 miles N. 
E. from Ormiftoun, near the feat of the Earl of Hading- 
ton, it is greatly increafed. Its fource is about 8 miles 
fouthward in the moor of Middleton, a high ground, and 
connected with hills of confiderable extent and height. — 
The year 1735 or 1736 was marked by a confiderable 
land-flood. In the month of June, when the day was ftill, 
and clear fun-fhine, not a drop of rain having fallen either 
on that day or the preceding, a fea of water came rolling 

along 



172 



Statijiical Account 



along the plain, through which the Tyne runs, covering 
the adjacent fields with about 3 feet depth of water. It 
certainly proceeded from a water-fpout, falling on the high 
grounds, near the fource of the river. The fudden melt- 
ing of fnow, and heavy falls of rain, are alfo frequently the 
caufe of floods in our river ; but the valley being flat, little 
damage is done. — In the month of September 1787, I ob- 
ferved, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, a complete 
rainbow ; the moon fhining bright in the eaft ; no wind 5 a 
little rain gently falling in the weft, and the arch appear- 
ing between me and the rain. The colours were variega- 
ted, but all faint. — In Lord Hopetoun's garden at Ormi- 
ftoun Hall, there is a remarkable yew tree. Its, trunk is 
11 feet in circumference, and 25 feet in length; the diameter 
of the ground overfpread by its branches is 53 feet; and 
there is about the 20th part of an Englifli acre covered by 
it. This tree is ftill growing in full vigour, without the 
leafl fymptom of decay in any of its branches, which in- 
crease yearly in length about an inch. There is no tradi- 
tion that can be depended upon, for exaflly afcertaining its 
age ; but from the beft information, it cannot be under 200 
years old. It feems rather more probable to be between 
300 and 400 years old. </p>

PARISH of <name ref="NA">CUSHNIE</name>, 
(COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.) 

By the Rev. Mr Francis Adam.</head> 

<p>Name, Situatio?i, Soil, is'c. 

£Jv$hnu, or Coufhnie, is faid to fignify in the Gaelic, 
" Hoarfroft." The pariih lies in the county and Sy- 
nod of Aberdeen, and preibytery of Alford. It is fmall, 
irregular, and mountainous. Bounded by the parilhes of 
Tarland on the S, ; Forbes and Kildrummie, on the N.; 
Coldftone, on the W. ; Leochel, «n the E. ; Towie, on 
the N. W. ; Alford, on the N. E. ; and Coul, on the 
S. E. The foil is but indifferent, and fomewhat inclined 
to clay; the air, although moift, is tolerably healthy; 
and the hills are covered with heath. The weather is much 
more fevere than in its neighbourhood, occafioned, no 
doubt, by its fituation ; being in the bofom of a large 
open glen, and pretty high. There is very little wood, 
and no mineral, excepting a quarry of good building ftones,' 
near the Church, eafily wrought. A fmall rivulet iffues 
from the glen, in the weftern extremity of the pariih 
which is pretty well ftored with burn-trout, and runs eaft' 
v/ard, until it meets with the burn of Leochel, where 

they

they take a more northerly courfe, until they empty them- 
felves into the Don. 

Population, $Sc. — According to Dr Webfter, the num- 
ber of fouls, about 40 years ago, was 500. The amount 
at prefent is, by aftual enumeration, 207 males, and 223 
females ; total 430. At an average of 20 years, from 1731 
to 175 1, there have been 16 births yearly; but from 
1770 to 1790, 11 baptifms only appear from the records ; 
and from 1785 to 1790, only 4 marriages yearly. 

The inhabitants are in general healthy, and live to a 
confiderable age ; fome to 80, and even 90 years, but few 
beyond that period. Nor have there been any murders or 
fuicides, or any banifliments ; and but very few emigra- 
tions. Neither have any -died from want, to my know- 
ledge, in the parifh. 

The proportion between the births and whole popula- 
tion, is as 1 to 40 nearly ; between the marriages and po- 
pulation, as 1 to 107 •, and each marriage, at an average, 
produces about 4 children. The number of heritors is 4, 
none of whom refide. There are 7 Seceders, and 4 Epif- 
copalians. 

Agriculture, ifc. — The farms are generally fmall, from 
L. 5 to L. 6 Stirling yearly rent, and uninclofed. Nor 
are the farmers- convinced of the advantages of inclofures. 
The rent of the beft arable ground, is from 18 s. to 20 s. 
each acre; and the worft, from 8s. to 10 s. the acre. 
There are in the parifh, about 34 ploughs of arable ground, 
and 24 carts. The old Scotch plough is generally ufed as 
molt proper for ftiff and ftony ground. We generally fow 
in the months of March and April, and reap in September 
and October ; and the parifh does, for the molt part, fup- 
ply itfelf with provifions. Gur exports are very trifling ; 

fometimes 



of Cujhnie. jy^ 

fometimes a little oat-meal and bear, and a few black cattle. 
The land rent of the parifh is about L. 456 Sterling, con- 
verting the vicinal at 10 s. the boll. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, &amp;c. — The church is covered 
with heath, and was built in 1637, and the manfe in 1724. 
The value of the living, including the glebe, is L. 49 : 6 : 8 
Sterling, converting the vidtual at 10 s. the boll. In the 
year 1782, about 20 perfons were on the poors roll, which, 
in 1790, were reduced to half that number. Our annual 
contributions, with the intereft of legacies, feat-money, 
&amp;cc. after deducting feffion-clerk and officer fees, amount 
to about L. 7, 2 s. Sterling. 

Wages, l£c. — A common day-labourer earns 6 d. ; a 
mafon, is.; a carpenter, from 6 d. to 8 d. ; and a tailor, 
6 d. a day, exclufive of maintenance. I cannot pofitively 
afcertain the expence of a labourer, when married ; but it 
is well known that fuch have great difficulty in rearing 
their families, as it is only for a few months in fummer 
that they can get employment ; and were it not that the 
women make fomething by knitting ftockings, and that 
the female children are employed in that way as foon as 
capable, it would be abfolutely impoffible for them, with- 
out afliftance, to make a fliift to live. The fuel is turf 
and peat. The annual wages of a man fervant, employed 
inhuftandry, are from L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling ; thofe of a 
woman, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling ; and for boys, from 
30 s. to 40 s. Sterling, exclufive of maintenance. 

MifceUaneous Obfervations.— The men are by no means 
fond of a military life. The women are employed in fpin- 
ning and knitting; and, for the molt part, both fexes are 
yiduftrious and economical. The ftature of the men is, 

from

from 5 feet 4 inches, to 6 feet •, and that of the women, 
from 5 feet 2 inches, to 5 feet 8 inches. It is difficult to 
fay whether the people are, on the whole, contented with 
their fituation. If I may hazard an opinion, I think they 
are not. The ihortnefs of their leafes, their high rents, 
and the exorbitant wages of the labouring fervants, render 
the fituation of the farmers very irkfome. I obferve that 
even the prices of the fhoes worn by the country people, 
although the deareft article of wearing apparel, are but a- 
bout thrice the price for which they were bought about 
40 years ago ; whereas the fees or wages of labouring fer- 
Vants have ftill increafed in a greater degree fince that pe- 
riod. The flioes are as 1 s. to 3 s. Sterling; but the wages 
as 15 s. to L. 3 Sterling. I obferve, however, that the 
common people live rather better, and drefs to more ad- 
vantage than in former times; although every article of 
wearing apparel, particularly that moft necefTary one, fhoes, 
are at leaf! thrice the price for which they could have been 
procured about 40 years ago. This is no doubt, in fome 
meafure, owing to the increafe of manufactures, and value 
of cattle, which generally fetch triple, if not four times 
the price they gave in former times. Superftition feems 
alfo, if I miftake not, to lole ground, and the manners 
of the people are fomewhat more polifhed. Natural chil- 
dren are by no means fo frequent here, as formerly ; al- 
though delinquents are much lefs harlhly dealt by. — 
The ftatute-labour is generally exacted in kind, but the 
roads are very indifferent. There are no turnpikes ; nor 
do the people know enough about them, to form a judg- 
ment of their utility.— In 1782 and 1783, the crop was 
remarkably deficient, and the oat-meal very bad ; info- 
much, that had it not been for the importation, numbers 
would have periflied. I myfelf had fcarcely a boll of meal 
for every 5 bolls of raw or undried oats, The bear was 

the

the only grain on which we could have any dependence ; 
and even this was fo much inferior to former years, as to 
be, as well as the oats, unfit for feed. So that we were 
obliged to get our feed from more early places ; and fuch 
as did not, turned out to be great lofefs. 

Englifh is the only language now known in the parilh, 
the Gaelic having ceafed to be underflood.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7321735">R Y N D</name>, 
(county of Perth.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Taylor.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, Surface, ifc. 

TH E name, in Gaelic, is faid to fignify ' a point and 
both the parifh and the eftate of Rynd, probabl/ 
took this name from the point of land where the rivers 
Tay and Earn meet, about half a. mile below the church. 
The parifh is fituated in the county of Perth, in the pref- 
bvtery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. It ex- 
tends from the point mentioned, more than 4 miles along 
the river Tay, and meets the parifh of Perth at Orchard- 
nook. It is about a mile in breadth ; the line that divides 
it from the parifh of Dumbarnie on the one fide, being 
nearly parallel to the winding courfe of the Tay on the 
other ; fo that the form of the parifh is nearly oblong, ha- 
ving the church (very inconveniently for the bulk of the 
people) placed almoft in one of the angles. It is bounded by 
the parifhes of Perth and Dumbarnie on the W.; by that of 
Abernethy on the S. from which it is feparated by the ri- 
ver Earn; and on the E. and N. by the parifhes of St Ma- 
dois and Kinfauns, from which it is feparated by the Tay.

In general, the foil is fertile. The ground is flat for about 
a mile and a half from the river Earn to the eaft end of 
the hill of MoncriefF, and the foil a deep clay. A narrow 
ftrip of the fame clay foil lies all around the eaft end of the 
hill, by the fide of the Tay, up to Orchardnook ; and from 
this ftrip the ground rifes by an afcent fo eafy, that it is 
all arable. The foil upon this riling ground is light and 
fharp, but abundantly fertile, when properly laboured and 
limed. There are befides fome haughs, ciofe by the rivers 
Tay and Earn, lying about 30 feet lower than the flat 
clay foil mentioned above, and fome iflands in the Taj% 
belonging to the parilh, all of a rich loamy foil, which, 
when the tides are kept off (as has been endeavoured to be 
done) by banks, have yielded the moft luxuriant crops, 
without any manure, for feveral years. The air is rather 
moift, but not unhealthy. Agues have been lefs frequent 
than in fome places where the air ftiould feem to be drier, 
owing perhaps to a ftream of air which is generally found 
upon the banks of rivers. 

Population.— The. return of the number of inhabitants to 
Dr Webfter was 498 ; in 1766, it was about 450 ; at pre- 
fent it is 495, although the farmers who have come into 
the parifti fince that time do not keep up fo many cottar- 
houfes ; and in fome cafes two farms have been turned in- 
*to one. The annual average of births is about 16 ; of 
marriages about 4. There are under 10 years of age 126; 
between io and 20, 97 ; between 20 and 50, 182 ; between 
50 and 70, 77 5 above 70, 13 5 in all 495 ; of whom, males, 
235, females, 260 ; married above 20, including widowers 
and widows, 190-, unmarried above 20, 83; the average 
number of children to each family is 6\. A perfon named 
Laurence Kinmont, died here in the year 1757, aged 11 1 ; 
?cd there have been feveral inftances of lives between 80 

and

and ioo, within this century. There are 3 heritors, one of 
whom refides in the parifti. There are 22 handicraftsmen, 
about 30 fifhermen, and 1 ferryman. About 160 are of 
the Eftablifhed Church, and about 270 Seceders. There 
are 86 inhabited houfes. The average number to each 
houfe is computed to be 5 inhabitants. 

Agriculture, l$c. — There are 5 principal farmers, who 
poffefs from 200 to 360 acres each, which they labour with 
a plough for about every 40 acres ; there are 10 other far- 
mers, who poffefs from 30 to 60 acres each, which they 
labour ufually with one plough ; and, in general, their fa- 
milies confift of a man for every plough, a boy or 2 to 
take care of their cattle, and 2 or 3 maid-fervants. They 
have befide as many hands as are neceffary to threfh out 
their corns, who are generally their cottagers, and are em- 
ployed in threfhing through the winter. The farmers have 
generally one part of their land, about a 6th, in fallow, an- 
other in wheat, another in peafe, another in barley, another 
in clover and rye-grafs, and another in oats. But this pro- 
portion is fometimes varied, commonly for the fake of ha- 
ving a greater quantity of wheat, which, befides being 
fown conftantly after the fallow, is fown alfo fometimes af- 
ter peafe, and fometimes after grafs. As the principal far- 
mers labour in a very fuperior flyle, and raife as much out 
of their ground as is done perhaps any where in the ifland, 
the parifh does much more than fupply itfelf with provi- 
fions, and very confiderable quantities of all kinds of grain 
are annually exported, but chiefly of wheat and barley. 
About 10 acres may be fown in flax, which they raife for 
their own ufe, and about as many in potatoes and turnips. 
They have not much in pafture, as they feed their horfes 
with grafs in the houfe, and fend their young cattle to other 
places for pafture through the fummer. Oats and peafe 

are

are fown in March, barley and grafs in May, and wheat in 
the end of September and October. Wheat harveft com- 
monly begins about the middle of Auguft, fooner or later 
according to the feafon. The average rent of land the acre, 
may be about L. i, 4 s. The greateft part of the parifib. is 
inclofed with quickfet hedges ; but the farmers begin to 
complain that they harbour vermin, which deftroy the crop, , 
and prevent a free circulation of air, fo neceflary for win- 
ning it in harveft. In the hilly part of the parifh, there 
are about 30 acres, confuting of fome wafte ground, which, 
though moftly covered with heath and whins, yields fome 
pafture, and of feveral rocky hillocks, fome of which are 
planted with Scotch firs, in a very thriving condition. There 
are befide two fields in the low part of the parifti as yet 
wafte, containing about 20 acres ; but they belong to two 
of the principal farmers, who are about to break them up. 
The land-rent may be about L. 1600 Sterling. The rent 
of the fiftiings may be about L. 300. There are about 112 
horfes, and 400 black cattle. 

Price of Labour, ifc. — The price of labour in all the ope- 
rations of hufbandry has increafed about one half within 
thefe 40 years. A man-fervant's wages in the year being 
now about L. 8, and a woman's 50 s. when maintained in 
the houfe. A labourer's wages for a day, without victuals, 
are is. A man, during harveft, gets 20 s. and a woman

6 s. 8 cl. ; the one half paid by the heritors, and the other 
by the tenants. His perquifites are, i s. the quarter for 
Englifli, i s. 6 d. for writing and arithmetic. The kirk- 
feflion give him 30 s. a year, as their clerk, and for teach- 
ing fuch poor fcholars as they fhall appoint. He has 6 d. 
for every baptifm, and 1 s. for every marriage. Befides, 
he is appointed collector of the aileiTments for the poor, for 
which he is allowed 20 s. a-year. He has for common 
more than 40 fcholars, part of whom are from the adja- 
cent parts of the parifhes of Perth and Dumbarnie. His 
whole income may amount to about L. 19 Sterling. The 
number of the poor is 8 at an average. The annual fum 
diftributed to them, is about L. 21 ; which is made up by 
afleffing the parilh, according to law, as the other funds 
fall lhort of what the poor require. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfewations. There is a fteel mineral 

fpring, in appearance very ftrong ; but it has never been 
reforted to. — The common fuel is coal, which is moftly 
brought by water carriage. Some broom and whins are 
likewife ufed by the common people. The parifh being 
furrounded by the rivers Tay and Earn, is a conhderable 
advantage to the farmers, both for importing lime, &amp;c. 
and exporting their grain. The roads and bridges are 
good. They were made, and are kept in repair by the 
flatute-labour, which is partly exacted in kind, and partly 
commuted. There are no turnpikes. — The ruins of a nun- 
nery at Orchardnook remain, about a mile W. from the 
caftle of Elcho, clofe by the Tay. It is faid to have been 
founded by David Lindfay, anceflor of the Earls of Craw- 
ford, and his mother Catharine Abernethey, a co-heirefs 
of Alexander Lord Abernethey, who was proprietor of 
Elcho in the reign of Robert Bruce. The ruins lie in the 
middle of a large orchard, and from the ground which

they occupy, the nunnery would appear to have been a 
pretty extenfive building. The lauds at that time are faid 
to have belonged to the monaftery of Dunfermline. 

There is a tradition, that, in fome very remote period, 
the river Tay had its courfe on the north fide of the Carle 
of Gowrie, by the foot of the hills : That fo long as the 
river kept this channel, St Madois and this were one pa- 
rilh : That after the Tay took its prefent courfe, by the 
weft end of the Carfe, the people ftill continued to crofs 
the river in boats to the church, which, the tradition fays, 
ftood at that time farther down, and nearer to the paint 
where the rivers Tay and Earn meet ; until one Sunday, 
the boat was overfet in a ftorm, and all the people in it 
perifhed : That in confequence of this, St Madois was e- 
rected into a parilli by itfelf ; and the church of Rynd re- 
moved farther up, to the place where it now ftands. In 
confirmation of, at leaft, one part of the ftory, two known 
facts are alledged, that a field in the farm of Eafter 
Rynd, before it was inclofed, and put into its prefent form, 
was called the Kirkland ; and that in tilling this field, fome 
freeftones, that feemed to have been ufed in building, had 
been turned up by the plough. There is certainly not a 
ftone of any kind to be found in all the low flat ground 
that lies between the rivers and the foot of the eaft end of 
the Hill of MoncriefF, the whole being one continued mafs 
of clay, for about 30 feet deep, intermixed with many 
ftrata of fand, of different thickneffes, and in feveral places 
with beds of hard mofs, which the rivers fometimes wafh 
down from their, banks, and which the common people 
ufe for fuel. 

With refpecl to farmers, it is manifeft that the employ- 
ing cottager fervants, and the employing unmarried houle 
fervants, have each their peculiar advantages and difad- 
vantages -, and it is hard to fay, which of them ought to 

be

be preferred, or whether any one of them mould be uni- 
verfally adopted in preference to the other. Much per- 
haps will depend upon circumftances, in any particular 
cafe. But the fa£l is, the principal farmers in the parilh 
have come more into the way of employing cottagers with- 
in the laft 6 years, inftead of unmarried fervants, as for fe- 
veral years before. Thefe cottagers, however, are all 
hired for the year, and do not work by the day, or by the 
piece. With regard to the country in general, no doubt 
the effecT: of employing cottagers will be to increafe popu- 
lation, particularly the number of labouring fervants ; and 
in confequence of this, their wages will be kept more mo- 
derate, and the farmer will more eafily procure fuch un- 
married fervants as he may wifh to have. The other me- 
thod has evidently all the oppofite efledts. 

There are two alehoufes upon the public road, and 
chiefly fupported by travellers, and by the fifliers, during 
the time of the falmon filhing. In general, the morals of 
the people can hardly be faid to fuffer from them. At the 
fame time, it mufl be acknowledged, that they give more 
eafy and frequent opportunities of tippling to thofe who 
are addicted to that vice.

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, &amp;c t 



JT is faid that an Abbot of Dunfermline built a fummer- 
houfe near the place where the church of Abbot's Hall 
now (lands, and called it the Hall of the Abbot. Abbot's 
Hall is in the county and Synod of Fife, and preflbytery of 
Kirkaldy. Its form is very irregular, being interfered in 
feveral places by the neighbouring parifhes. In the broad- 
eft and longeft corners it may be about 2 miles each way. 
. It is bounded by Kirkaldy on the E. Kinghorn and Auch- 
tertool on the W. Auchterderran on the N. and the frith 
of Forth on the S. The general appearance of the coun- 
try is very pleafant; it is flat for about near half a mile 
north of the coaft; from thence rifes into pretty high 
grounds, or beautiful banks, Hoping gently. The air is 
dry and healthy. The foil, immediately by the town, is 
light and fandy, but very fertile, efpecially in fhowery 
fummers. It can fcarcely be hurt by rain, but eafily by 
drought. As it rifes northwards, it is deeper and ftronger,

but thin and cold on the north Ikirts. The extent of fea- 
coaft is about half a mile, lying along the weft fide of the 
Bay of Kirkaldy. It is very flat and fandy, but exceed- 
ingly pleafant ; moft of the towns and villages on the coaft 
are pleafantly fituated. — The lands of Abbot's Hall, which 
belong to Mr Fergufoa of Raith, abound in coal ©f diffe- 
rent feams, it is faid, fome 3, 5, and/even 14 feet. Part 
of the crop-coal only was wrought about 40 years ago. 

Population. — The ancient extent of the population is not 
ealily traced, but was much lefs than at prefent. The re- 
turn to Dr Webfter, about 40 years ago, was only 1348 
fouls. In 1 791, the total population is 2136; males 1061, 
females 1075. The number of inhabitants in the town is 
1660, in the country 476. The annual average of births 
is 50, of deaths 44, of marriages 22. Under 10 years of 
age there are 249 males, 239 females ; only a few perfons 
are between 80 and 90. There are 6 heritors, 2 of whom 
refide. Farmers 25, their families about 2cc ; 8 principal 
manufacturers, befides a few fmaller- ones ; apprentices 50 ; 
feamen about 10 or 12 ; male houfehold-fervants 63 ; fe- 
male 60 ; merchants 12. The great bulk of the inhabitants 
are tradefmen, being wholly employed in manufactures. 
Families of gentry 3 ; 1 in the town and 2 in the country. 
One minifter of the Eftabliflied Church, and a perfon who 
preaches to a fmall Cameronian meeting. The number of 
the Eftabliflied Church 1338, of Seceders 798. Within 
thefe 20 years, the population of the town is increafed be- 
tween 300 and 400 ; but the country part of the parifti is 
decreafed above 100. The increafe of the former is owing 
to the manufactures, and the decreafe of the latter to a 
coal-work being entirely given up, and 7 or 8 farms being 
taken into one. Batchelors 27, married men 187, widow- 
ers*

duces 3 children. 

Agriculture, fcfc— Extenfive plantations have been fo- 
feveral years, and are fiffl carrying on by Mr Fergtafon of 
•Raith. There being in this parim about 143 acres occu- 
pied by plantations, little or none of thefe grounds are a- 
rable, and are fo fieep that they are lit for nothing elfe. 
The number of horfes, cows, cattle and young beafts -may- 
be about 1250. The acres in the parim are about 3165. 
In corn 530, in turnip and cabbage 85, in potatoes 84, in 
wheat 85, in barley 250, in peafe 176, in fown grafs 164, 
in common pafturage 1278, for feeding cattle 300, in fum- 
mer fallow 70. Gats and peafe are fown from the begin- 
ning of March to the middle of April ; barley from the 
beginning of May to near the end of it -, wheat in Sep- 
tember and October, and turnip from the middle of July, 
&amp;c. They reap fometimes in the end of Auguft, and the 
beginning of September. The parim imports articles of 
provifion. The valued rent of this parifli is L. 798 =9:9. 
The real rent maybe about L. 3165. The arable land 
near the town is about L. 3, 10 s. the acre. Beft pafture 
upwards of L. 2, 10 s. On the north ikirts of the parifh, 
fome as low as 5 s. the acre. In general, the fize of farms 
is from 200 to near 300 acres. The rent about L. 200. 
There may be a few fmaller. The number of farms is 
decreafing confiderably, owing to their being larger. Ex- 
cept the land immediately by the town, the parifh is whol- 
ly inclofed, and the farmers are fo much convinced of the 
adtantage thereof, that they do not think they would be 
able to pay their advanced rents, if it were not fo. There 
are 50 ploughs, of which the one half is the old Scotch 
plough, improved by being made lighter, and the other 
half the Englifh plough made by Small, or after his con-

ftru&amp;ion. There are alfo 50 carts in the country part of 
the parifh, and 20 more in the town ; 3 carriages, 1 of 
which is a coach, and the others 2 four-wheeled chaifes. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The ftipend, except 100 
merks in money, being paid in visual, varies with the 
prices. It is 46 bolls of barley, 34 of meal, and 36 of oats; 
but taken at the lateft valuation, of L. 100 Scots the chal- 
der, including the manfe and glebe, which is 6f acres, 
may be about L, 80. Mr Fergufon of Raith is patron. 
A new, larger, and more elegant church was built 4 years 
ago, in the fame place where the old Hood. The firft 
manfe in this parifti was built in the 1772, the minifter ha- 
ving till then only an allowance of L. 5 for a houfe. — The 
falary of the parochial fchool is about L. 7 ; perquifites a- 
rifing from baptifms and proclamations about L. 5 ; from 
the feflion and at the communion L 2 ; L. 5 for teaching 
poor fcholars, being the intereft of L. 100, mortified about 
30 years ago, by a Mr Dundas, who lived at Raith. The 
number of fcholars at an average is about 60. There may 
be 2 or 3 fmall private fchools in the town. — There are 6 
poor on the roll, and feveral others are fupplied according 
as their need requires. The annual amount of the contri- 
butions for their relief, arifing from the collections at the 
church, the intereft of money, &amp;c. is about L. 50 ; and the 
parifti is well able to fupply its own poor, were they not 
oppreffed with vagrants from almoft every quarter, efpe- 
cially from the North, going to and from the Infirmary at 
Edinburgh. 

Prices, Wages, %3c. — The prices of provifions are near 
double what they were 30 and 40 years ago. Beef, mut- 
ton, veal, lamb, and pork, &amp;c. are 4-fd. and 5 d. the pound, 
according to the different feafons, all Troy or heavy weight.

they work out, 6 d. and their meat ; but they moftly work 
in their own houfes, at fo much the piece. The only fuel 
is coal, price paid on the fpot, 6d. the load, weighing 22 
itone. On different coal-hills the weight is different, and 
fo are the prices. Some within half a mile, 2 and 3 miles,

ably in their fituation, and bring up large families in ge- 
neral. Their children coft them little, and as foon as 
they can do any thing, are employed in manufactures ; 
their wages are exceeding good, and double of what 
they were formerly. The wages of male-fervants are L. 6 
and L. 7, of female L 2, 10 s. and L..3 a-year. There are 
but about 8 livery-fervants, and their wages vary from 
L. 10 to L. 20, L. 30, &amp;c. according to their llations, &amp;c. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In general, the people are of 
the middle fize. The greater! height which any have at- 
tained, is about 6 feet 2 inches. They are very much dif- 
pofed to induftry. — In the town are 3 principal manufac- 
tures, under the name of Checks and Bed-tikes. Thefe 
employ between 200 and 300 looms in the parilh, and a 
great number in the parimes around. Two of thefe have 
each an extenfive bleachfield near by, where they whiten 
their own yarn. Beiides thefe, are a few who do a little 
in the fame branches. There are befides 5 cotton manu- 
factures of the name of the Spinning Jeanies, the heavy 
parts of which are driven by a horfe-engine. Thefe em- 
ploy near 200 hands, feveral of whom are children, &amp;c. 

Other buildings are prefently ereaing for the fame, &amp;c

The roads are tolerably good. There are only 2 fmall 
bridges, which feparate the parifh from the neighbour- 
ing one on the weft, both in good cafe, and lately 
repaired, made and kept by the county. The ftatute- 
labour is exafted partly in kind and partly in money. — 
Though the harveft was late in 1782, and the weather very 
unfavourable, fo that the prices rofe much above what they 
uled to be, yet it was not fo feverely felt in this part of 
the country as in fome others, owing partly to the drynefs 
of the fituation, and to a considerable quantity of corn being 
imported ftraight from the Baltic into the harbour of Kirk- 
caldy, &amp;c. The poor had very liberal fupplies. Mr 
Fergufon gave L.50 to be diftributed among them, and 
the feflion,. at the defire of the heritors, lifted L. 40, and 
difpofed of it to the fame purpofe, over and above their or- 
dinary diftribution. — There are 4 brewers in the town. 
Thefe keep decent houfes, and good company. But there 
are feveral that are commonly called Tapfters, becaufe they 
fell ale to thefe brewers, that are nuifances to fociety. — 
Within thefe 20 years, above 100 new houfes have been 
built in the town. About the one half of thefe are on new 
foundations, and the other on old ones, made much larger 
and better ; and in the country part of the parilh are up- 
wards of 20. Some ftill employ cottagers, and others do 
not, preferring hired fervants to them, and confequently

<p>Name, Situation, l$c» 

nnHIS parifh and that of Roflie were united in 1670, 
and the church of Roffie is now a ruin. Inchture, or 
Inchtower, feems to have got its name from Handing on a 
riling ground. It is allowed* that fome time ago the river 
Tay ran on the north fide of the Carfe of Gowrie, and 
joined the river Earn at a place called Invergowrie, about 
2 miles W. from Dundee. Several towns, fituated upon 
the higher grounds between thefe rivers, are hence called 
Inch this and Inch that, Inchmartine, Inchmiehael, Megg- 
inch, Inchture, &amp;c. This parifh lies in the county of 
Perth, in the prefbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus 
and Mearns, extending from S. to N. about 4 miles, and 
from E. to W. about 3. It is bounded on the E. by the 
parifh of Longforgan •, on the S. by the rivers Tay and 
Earn, which now run in one channel ; on the W. by the 
parifhes of Errol and Kinnaird ; and on the N. by the pa- 
rifh of Abernyte, and a part of Longforgan parifh.. 

Population,

Population. — In the village of Inchture are 84 families, 
and about 360 fouls. There is a probability that this vil- 
lage and parifh will foon become more populous. In the 
courfe of thefe 17 years paft, it has increafed about 24 
families ; and as the turnpike-road between Perth and 
Dundee, which is juft now making, goes through this 
town, Lord Kinnaird, who is fole proprietor of it, intends 
to enlarge and improve it. There are only other 5 villages 
in the parifh, and in them are about ico families, and a- 
bout 640 fouls. So that, in the parifh, there are in all 
about 184 families, and 1000 fouls ; of thefe, about 250 
under 10 years of age. The return to Dr Webfter was 
893 fouls. The number of males and females is nearly 
equal. Some years ago, this parifh was more populous 
than it is at prefent ; but the decreafe has been owing to 
fome lands being converted into pleafure grounds. In fome 
years of late, there have been 18 or 19 marriages ; at a 
medium, thefe laft 16 years, there have been 14 yearly. 
There have been, in the fame fpace of time, at a medium, 
39 baptifms. In the fame fpace of time, there have been, 
in fome years, 20 deaths ; but the medium for the laft 7 
years is 18.

Heritors, Rent, Culture, "iSc. — The heritors in this pa- 
rifh are 3 in number, one of whom only refides at prefent. 
The valued rent is L. 593, 13 s. Sterling. The real rent 
may be about L. 6000 Sterling. The number of acres of 
arable land, 3000. All the ground in this parifh is ex- 
ceeding rich, and well improven, chiefly by lime, which 
fuits beft with a clay foil. The farms in general are ex- 
tenfive, fcarce one of them lefs than 100 acres, fome of 
them 200, and one about 300. Farms, of late years, have 
been let at 40 s. and 45 s. an acre -, and 3 years ago, a 
large farm, confining of about 300 acres, above 50 s. In 
general, the rents are paid, part in victual, and part in mo- 
ney. The farmers here are wealthy, and live genteelly. 
They fend only 1 man and 2 horfes to a plough. Wages 
to a good ploughman, are from L. 8 to L. 10 a-year ; a day- 
labourer gets o/d. or 10 d. a-day, and his meat*, in harveft, 
1 s. a day, or L. 1, 1 s. for the whole harveft-work ; a wo- 
man gets 15 s. for harveft. Womens wages are yearly 
about L. 3. There ape but few manufacturers, the farm- 
ers choofing rather to let their houfes to day-labourers. A- 
bout 40 or 50 years ago, oxen were much employed in 
ploughing, but now horfes only. The parifh is reckoned a- 
bout 60 ploughs -, but at particular feafons, nearly 80 are 
employed. The farms are generally divided into 6 parts, 
wheat, barley, beans or peafe, oats, clover-grafs, and fal- 
low. Ground properly fallowed and limed, often pro- 
duces 1 5 bolls of wheat the acre ; the average produce of 
whole farms is 10. Threfhing mills are of late a very 
great improvement. There are five of them in this parifh. 
One goes by water, and will threfh 30 bolls in an hour, 
and alfo feparates the corn from the chaff. The other 
mills, which require 3 or 4 horfes to drive them, can threfh 
25 bolls in an hour. A mill employs 6 or 7 men to feed 
the mill, as they phrafe it, carry off the ftraw, &amp;c, and

I to drive the horfes. There is at Polgovie, a town in 
this parifh, a pier and harbour for {hipping, where a veffel 
of 60 or 70 tons can get in ; there great quantities of vic- 
tual are fliipped, and a great deal of lime and coals is un- 
loaded. 



Stipend, Poor, School, 13 c— The church and manfe here 
are both old. The (Upend is near 13 bolls wheat, 46 bolls 
barley, 36 bolls meal, and 34 bolls oats, and near L. 11 
money. By the annexation of the glebe formerly at Rof- 
fie, to the glebe here, it is about 11 acres, including the 
garden. The King is patron.— The poors fund is above 
L. 200 Sterling. There are not many poor, and none of 
them are allowed to travel as beggars. — The fchoo}mafter's 
falary is L. 80 Scots ; the fcholars feldom fewer than 60, 
and at certain feafons of the year, betwixt 70 and 80! 
His income, by his falary, feffion-clerk fee, fcholars, and 
perquintes in the parifh, I fuppofe amounts to between 
L. 27 and L. 30 a-year. He has a large commodious houfe. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. There is not, properly 

ipeaking, an inn in the parifh. Only one perfon at pre- 
fent makes malt and ale, and there are 6 more that have 
licences to fell ale and Britifh fpirits. In general, the 
people here are fqber and induftrious. Almoft the whole 
houfes in this parifh, have been built anew within thefe 
16 years parr. The farmers houfes are elegant, in compa- 
rifon of what they were of late years, and moft of them 
are covered with blue flate. The lower clafs of people are 
likewife much better lodged than they formerly were. 
In the village called Balledgarno, Lord Kinnaird built 
houfes to accommodate 18 families, each of them having 2 
fire apartments, in the courfe of laft fummer, all covered 
with blue flate, and there is not more than the third part 



of Inchture.

of his Lorduiip's plan yet executed. All the remaining 
old houfes are to be pulled down, and a neat large village 
erected, which, when completed, I fuppofe will accommo- 
date 60 or more families. The farmers here rather chufe 
jo employ their cottagers, than hired fervants. — The ague, 
which, not more than 30 years ago, was a very frequent 
difeafe, is now not more fo than in other parts of the 
country, which is to be attributed to the ground's being 
greatly drained.

bounded by the river Tweed ; on the S. W. by the pa- 
rishes of Ladykirk and Whitfome ; on the W. by Edrom ; 
on the N. W. by Chirnfide ; on the N.. by Foulden ; and 
on the N. E. by Mordington. The general appearance of 
the country is flat. On the banks of the Whittader, there 
are fome rocks, but of no great height. The foil on the 
banks of the Tweed and Whittader, is deep and loamy 
but towards the middle of the parifli, it is thin, on a ftrong 
clay. The air is fometimesmoh% but generally dry, and 
the people remarkably healthy. They were formerly 
much afflicted with the ague, but are now much more fub- 
ject to confumptions. The Whittader, a fmall river that 
bounds the parifli on the N. produces a few falmon, and - 
great plenty, as well as great variety, of trout. The Tweed

produces a great quantity of falmon, gilfes, and whitliag 
trout, the laft of which are carried to London alive, in 
wells in the Berwick fmacks, and weigh generally about 
3 lb. Ten boats or cobles are the higheft number allowed 
to be kept on this fide the river, in the pariih.. The fal- 
mon are 6f the greateft value in the months of January 
and February. One falmon, from the fifliing of New- 
water, in January 1791, not 2 (tone weight, fold for 
L. 3 : o : 2, at Berwick, for the London market. The rent 
of the fifliing waters is upwards of L- 200 a year, and about 
12 men are employed. The tide flows to Norham caftle, 
which is 10 miles from Berwick. A boat of 30 tons can 
come up the river to New-water Ford, which is 6 miles 
from Berwick. — There is great plenty of moorftone and 
freeftone on. the banks of the Tweed and Whittader, moft 
excellent for building, and of a fine white colour. The 
haugh-lands on the Tweed and Whittader, are fometimes 
flooded, when there is any remarkable fall of rain or fnow. 

Animals, Agriculture, Ifc. — The cattle are of the Tees- 
water breed, large and handfome ; and when properly fed, 
will weigh upwards of 100 flone Englifli. The flieep are 
alfo of a large kind. Wedders are often fold, when 2 
years old^ for L. 1, 15 s. the head, when fliorn ; and their 
fleece is worth 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. One proprietor has juft 
now fold 50 wedders at L. 105, after they were fliorn; 
their fleece, for the 2 years, worth 12 s. Wool is fold at 
15 s. and 16 s. the flone, 241b. to the Hone. Ewes are 
fold for breeding at L. 2 a head, and great prices are given 
for the hire of rams of the Leicefterfliire breed, for the 
feafon. Hog-fheep, before they are fliorn, are fold at L. 1, 
L. 1, 4 s. and L. 1, 7 s. the head, for the Yorkfliire mar- 
kets. There are about 170 horfes, befides young ones. 
About 3000 fheep at the Martinmas, 2000 more of lambs

at the Whitfunday ; and upwards of 450 cattle. — There 
are about 5200 acres of land in the parifli. The one half 
of it in corn and turnips, the other half in hay, pafture, 
and wood. About 200 acres of wood. The annual rent 
of the parifli, land, mills, fifliings, &amp;c. is L. 4000 Ster- 
ling. The rent of the befl arable ground is L. 2, 2 s. the 
acre. Considerable farms are let at L. 1 ; inferior lands, 
at 10 s. and 15 s. Many of the farms are of that fize, as 
to let at L. 300 and L. 400 yearly. One reckoned worth 
L. 500 a-year, was rented, lefs than 40 years ago, at L. 50 
or L. 60 a-year. There are 50 ploughs, all of them the 
chain plough, drawn by 2 horfes. The land in the parifli 
is all inclofed. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter, the number of 



fouls was 751. The prefent Hate of population is as 

follows : — 

From 10 years and under, - 234 

From 10 to 20, - - 172

proprietors. There are about 12 farmers, befides feveral 
carters, who occupy fmall portions of land, and who are 
employed in driving lime and coal. There are about 20 
handicraftsmen, 8 or 10 apprentices. — There is no other 
kind of emigration but that which takes place at the Whit- 
funday, when there is a removal of many hinds, herds, 
and cottagers, into neighbouring pariflies ; whofe places are, 
at the fame time, filled up by others of the fame defcrip- 
tion, who are aduated by an unaccountable delire to change 
their habitations, though they feldom ameliorate their- fitu- 
ations. Nothing but the expectation of better pafture for 
their cow, can be afligned as a reafon ; for their gains, as 
they are called, which are, fo many bolls of corn, pota- 
toes planted, and lintfeed fowed, &amp;c. are the fame every 
where in this corner of the country. 

Stipend, Poor, lie— The value of the living, including 
the glebe, is about L. 115 Sterling. The King is patron. 
The church was rebuilt in 1765, has lately been ceiled, 
plaftered, and flagged, and is now a very handfome coun- 
try place of worfhip. The manfe is new built, and, for 
tiie credit of the heritors, a very good one.— There are 
only 9 perfons on the poors roll ; 2 or 3 more receive oc- 
casional charity. The weekly colledions don't exceed 
L. 10 a year. The half of which is appropriated to the 
lupport of the poor. That, with 3 months cefs, amount- 
ing on the whole to about L. 25, is equal to all the de- 
mands of the poor at prefent. There is befides the inte- 
reft of a mortification of L. 100 Scots. 

Prices, Wages, ifc— The price of beef and mutton, is 
from 3| d. to 4 | d. the pound, 16 ounces to the pound ; 
Yeal, from 4 d. to 6d. j lamb, 5 d. ; pork, which is bought, 
felted, and fent to London by the coopers at Berwick, ge-

Berwick boll; barley, 18 s. ; oats, 15 s.; and peas, L.I, 
4 s. All the above articles, 30 years ago, fold at lefs 
than half the price. The wages of day-labourers are ge- 
nerally 1 s. a-day in fummer, 1 s. 6 d. in hay and corn 
harveft, 8 d. and 9 d. in winter ; carpenters and mafons, 
13. 6 d. The wages of lingle men fervants, L. 6, 10 s. to 
L. 7 the year ; women, L. 3, 3 s. to L. 3, 10 s. The only 
fuel is coal, brought from Northumberland, between 8 and 
9 miles diftant, at 2 s. 6 d. and 3 s. the load ; the hire, 
2 s. 6 d. in fummer, and 3 s. in winter. 

Mifcellancous Obfervatiom. — The ftyie of living among 
the poor people here, is very different from that in Eng- 
land ; and the earnings of the women, added to thofe of 
the men, make a more confiderable fum than that ftated 
in the account of the poor in England ; and hence the in- 
duftrous and oeconomical among them, bring up their fa- 
milies, when in health, very decently, without any aflift- 
ance from the parifti funds. The people are all of the or- 
dinary fize, except the parifti fchoolmafter, who is com- 
puted to be 7 feet 4 inches high ; his trunk is very large, 
his legs long, but not well made ; there appears a weak* 
nefs in them, and in his knee joints, fo that he walks 
badly. He is very unwieldy, looks unhealthy, and is only 
25 years of age. He is very gentle in his manners, good 
humoured, and obliging. He teaches Latin, mathematics, 
arithmetic, writing, and Englifti, very well ; has a very 
numerous fchool, above 60 fcholars, and gives very gene- 
ral fatisfadtion. — The people are in general very fober, in- 
duftrous, and oeconomical. There is a moft material change 

to 



of Hutton, 



to the better, both in living and drefs, within thefe 20 
years. There is no remembrance of a murder or a fuicide 
having been committed. — The roads are tolerably good. 
One, which leads to Berwick from the weft part of the 
country, is excellent. The crofs roads will foon be good, 
as the funds are confiderable, there being above L, 80 Ster- 
ling collected annually for ftatute-labour. The produce of 
one toll already in the parifh, and another foon [to be erect- 
ed, will be above L; 300 Sterling a-year. — In the year 1782, 
meal was fold to the poor people at reduced prices, for 
which the opulent chearfully contributed. — Mr Philip Red- 
path, the late minifter, was a man of great worth and 
learning, and well known for his translation of Boethius.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6408207">KILSPINDIE</name>, 
(county of Perth.) 

By the Rev. Mr Anthony Dow.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, Air, Ifc. 

r | *HERE were originally two pariflies, Rait and Kilfpin- 
die, and the walls of the church of Rait are ftill Hand- 
ing. I have not been able to learn, at what time the two 
were united; only this much I have been able to trace, 
that it mnft have been prior to 1634. Kil is Gaelic, and 
always fignifies a burying place or tomb. When a faint 
was buried, the place was generally called by his name, 
with the fyllable Kil prefixed. The parilh is fituated in 
the county of Perth, in the prefbytery of Perth, and Synod 
of Perth and Stirling, about mid-way between the two 
towns of Perth and Dundee, the road between thefe two 
places running through the fouth fide, of the parifli for 3 
miles. Its form is oblong; in length from S. E. to N. W. 
about 5 miles; in breadth from S. W. to N. E. about 3^. 
The parifli is bounded on the S. E. by Errol, on the S. W. 
by Kinfauns, on the N. W. and N. by St Martin's and 
Collace, and on the E. by Kinnaird. Though the church 
and manfe are fituated in the Carfe of Gowrie, yet a very

fmall proportion only of the parifh lies in the Carfe. It 
moftly extends acrofs the hills to that part of Strathmore, 
which goes by the name of Stormount. The hills are ge- 
nerally barren ; in many places the furface is covered with 
a fliort heath, wet, and full of thofe whiteifh or gray whin- 
ftones, which indicate a poor, unkindly bleak foil. The 
bottom is a very bad fort of clay, commonly called by the 
farmers here Mortar or Till. But though in general the 
fummits of the hills are barren and heathy, there are many 
pleafant little fpots in hollows and glens, where the foil is 
good and fruitful in a high degree. All thofe parts of the 
hills which Hope towards the Carfe, are well cultivated, 
and to the very fummit ; producing crops of every kind 
that is to be found in the low country, and nearly of equal 
quality ; flax, potatoes and turnip, in much greater perfec- 
tion. That part of the parifh which lies in the hollow of 
the Carfe, is generally very wet, but of a deep rich foil, a 
mixture of clay and mofs, producing in good feafons, and 
when well managed, very luxuriant crops. The air is to- 
lerably dry and healthy in general. In fome of the lowed 
parts, it is rather moift and damp, but among the hills very 
cold and penetrating. In the hollow grounds, all through 
this Carfe, the ague was formerly a very prevalent diftem- 
per, but is now hardly known, owing, no doubt, in fome 
meafure, to the draining of the grounds. Rheumatifm is 
the moll common complaint. 

Population, &amp;c. — I have reafon to believe the numbers 
were formerly much greater than now. The return to 
Dr Webfter was 828. No farther back than 30 years, it 
is known to many of the inhabitants, that in one diftrid 
there were between 20 and 30 families more than are now 
upon it. Inftead of being divided into fmall fpots, pen- 
dicles, or farms of a few acres, it is at jprefent in the hands

of one or two farmers. On one or two more farms, the 
number of cottagers has alfo been diminiflied. The num- 
ber of fouls I found in Auguft 1789 to be 718. Males 
340, females 378. In one village are 170, and in another 
60 fouls.

Average of deaths for 7 years, from December 1783 to 
December 1790, is 17 or 18. Average of marriages, from 
1770 to 1780, is 6. From 1780 to 1790, 8. Taking the 
average of births for the laft 7 years, from December 1783 
to December 1790, the number is exa&amp;ly the fame as for 
the laft 5 years, 19, and of burials, as above, 17 or 18. 
The reafon why the average of deaths goes no farther back 
than to 1783, is becaufe there has been no regifter of thefe 
kept, previous to the aft in 1783, appointing a tax of 3 d. 
to be levied on each burial, &amp;c. The births mentioned 
are not exadfly thofe within the pariftt ; for all the children 
that have been baptifed here, whether born in it or not, 
have their names inrolled in the regifter here ; fo alfo it is 
with regard to burials. With refpeft to marriages, they 
are all recorded, whether only one or both parties have 
been within the parilh. Hence all thofe marriages, where 
the parties have been proclaimed in two different parities,

age, only I above 90. There are 7 heritors, none of whom, 
refide; 15 farmers, employing each 2 ploughs, or more; 
7 or 8 fmaller farmers, who have only 1 plough ; 45 wea- 
vers, all employed in working fale linen, commonly coarfe, 
what is called Omaburgs ; they all work for fome manu- 
facturer, either in Perth or Dundee, and do little on their 
own riJk ; 4 blackfmiths, with 4 apprentices ; 3 fhoema-

ing fervants, male and female. Threfhing mills having be- 
come already wonderfully common through this country, 
fewer cottagers are employed in the barns, threfhing, &amp;c. ; 
14 families are Seceders (Burghers and Antiburghers) •, 2 
or 3 Epifcopalian Nonjurants, who all now attend in the 
Eftablilhed Church, lince the death of their clergyman ; 
only 1 Roman Catholic •, 65 bachelors, taking all the un- 
married men above 21 years of age; 115 married or wi- 
dowers. Each marriage produces 3 children alive, at an 
average ; but if all thofe dead were to be included, the ave- 
rage would amount to 4. Only 2 uninhabited houfes be- 
fore Martinmas laft; 149 inhabited houfes, not quite 5 to 
each. 

Agriculture, is'c. — Between 2000 and 30CO acres are fup- 
pofed to be employed in railing corn, &amp;c. and farms are 
from 4, 5 and 6 ploughs, to little pendicles of 2 acres ; 
which laft are ploughed, &amp;c. by the great farmers, the fub- 
tenants being bound for harveft work in return. From the 
beginning of February to April, peafe and beans are fown j 
from the end of April to the end of May, barley; wheat

in the end of September, October, and beginning of No- 
vember. It is generally obferved of the Carfe farmers, 
that they continue fowing wheat as long as the feafon will 
allow ; but I have never feen any fpring-wheat here. This 
laft autumn there has been more wheat fown in this Carfe, 
than ever was known in one feafon in the memory of man. 
Autumn 1789 was remarkably wet and rainy, and the far- 
mers could not in many places catch a fingle day to fow 
even their fallowed ground. They depend upon their 
wheat .crop for paying the landlord, and they feem deter- 
mined to make up in this, what they fell fhort in laft fea- 
fon. The wheat harveft generally begins the end of Au- 
guft, and continues all September ; oats, barley and peafe 
in September and October; and beans in October, or be- 
ginning of November frequently. Carfe ground lets from 
L. 1, 15 s. to L. 2, 15 s. the acre ; hill ground from 15 s. to 
L. 1, 15 s. The fize of farms is very different, frpm 40 to 
250 acres, and their number is greatly diminiftied. Ploughs 
are between 60 and 70, drawn by 2 horfes, all over the 
low grounds ; but through the hills, by 2 horfes and 2 oxen, 
except on 3 farms, where the 2 horfe-plough is ufed. The 
plough which is now univerfally ufed here, is much after 
the make of Small's. On one or two of what are called the 
Brae- farms, that is, the farms on the flope of the hills, 
where the ground hangs, they often yoke 3 horfes a-breaft. 
The middle horfe, the leading one, being before the 2 fide- 
horfes, by the length of the head and neck, which makes a 
very ftrong plough, but kneads the ground very much for 
the 6 laft ploughed furrows of a ridge. The grounds are 
generally uninclofed ; there are no ftones to build fen- 
ces ; and hedges neftle fuch a number of fmall birds, that 
they are generally difliked. No body fends out cattle with- 
out a man or a boy to attend them. The people feem fo 
much accuftomed to open grounds, that they feldom think

of inclofures. However, the farmers are all convinced of 
the great utility of inclofures, and would univerfally prefer 
an inclofed and fubdivided farm, to one wholly open. 

Stipend and Poor. — The average value of the living here 
is about L. 77 Sterling. The glebe lies detached in feve- 
ral different places, and fome part of it is a rugged bank ; 
but there are 6 or 7 acres of it of a tolerably good foil, 
that might give L. 1, 15 s. or L. 2 the acre. — There are on- 
ly 2 old men, without wife or children, who are wholly 
fupported by the parifh, though 9 other poor families re- 
ceive occafional relief, for which the collections at the 
church have hitherto been fufficient. 

Prices, Wages, &amp;c. — Beef generally fells at 4 d. the pound, 
veal 5 d. mutton 3 d. fowls 1 s. and is. 2d. butter 9 d. 
wheat L. x, 1 s. barley 14 s. oat-meal 14 s. the boll. Day's

veft, without diet. When they receive their diet, the wages 
are from 8 d. to 1 s. Fuel is whins, broom, and coals from

men-fervants, with all their enormous fees, are difobliging, 
perverfe and obftinate, refufing to work more than 6 hours 
in the forenoon, and 4 in the afternoon. They have no 
idea of fubmitting to any little (Economical employment at

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.— The roads are at prelenf: 
very bad and narrow. They have never been fufficient- 
ly made ; but now worfe than ever, as the new turnpike- 
road, in a very different direction, engages the whole at- 
tention of the gentlemen. Till lately, the ftatute -labour 
was all exa&amp;ed in kind, but now is generally commuted ; 
no turnpikes as yet, though we expect, enough of them 
foon. Of late, there has been in this, as in fome other 
counties, a fort of outcry againft turnpikes, though I be- 
lieve the moft fenlible and confiderate are ready enough to 
agree, they may turn out much to the advantage of the 
country in general, and to the intereft of the farmers in 
particular. — The vulgar in moft. part of this country, and 
particularly here, have an utter diflike to all regular phy- 
ficians and furgeons, though in general, their faith in drugs, 
quack medicines, and old wives noftrums, is moft implicit. 
In my attendance upon the iick, my firft emeftion has ge- 
nerally been, when I found the diforder dangerous, whe- 
ther a phyfician had been called ; and. though I have al- 
ways advifed it, I do not remember that in any inftance I 
have fucceeded. — Common people in the Carfe are in ge- 
neral rather tall, ftrong and clumfy in perfon ; dull, obfti- 
nate, rude and unmannerly ; fond of drefs to an extreme ; 
live well. The better fdrt of farmers, luxurious and expen- 
five in their mode of living, without the leaft claim to neat- 
nefs or elegance. — The numbers of wild geefe, that come 
down in flocks from the high grounds, about the end of 
harveft, are very remarkable. More than icco have been 
l'een in one field. A few ftraggling geefe have been killed 
in the hills. — There is a hill of gravel, a little to the S. E. 
of the village of Rait, upon the top of which, there are evi- 
dent marks of fome old fort or entrenchment. It is much 
impaired, and on one lide wholly ruined, by the encroach- 
ments of a fmall ftream that runs at the bottom of it. The 
common people have no tradition with regard to it.

By the Rev. Mr Robert Hannah,</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, Rivers, ifc. 

THIS diftrift is compofed of two parifhes, Strickath- 
row and Dunlapple, united in 16 18. The name, 
Strickatbrow, according to fome, is a Celtic compound, fig- 
nifying the ' ftrath or valley where the King fought.' This 
parifh lies in the county of Forfar, prefbytery of Brechin, 
and Synod of Angus and Mearns, and is bounded by the 
parifhes of Dun, Brechin, Menmuir, Lethnot, Edzell, 
Fettercairn, Marykirk, and Logie. It is about 7 miles in 
length, and 2 in breadth, lying S. E. and N. W. ; is low 
in the middle, but rifes to each extremity, and compre- 
hends the whole breadth of Strathmore in this place. From 
the manfe, which is fituated in the centre of the parifh, 
the profpeft is every way extenfive, particularly towards 
the eaft, extending in that direction upwards of 20 miles. 
The parifh is not much inclofed, but the face of the coun- 
try is uncommonly pleafant. The foil is various ; on the 
S. it is clay, pretty deep ; in the middle, black earth, fharp, 
but not deep, with a channel bottom ; on the N. it is

partly clay, and partly loam, and the hills on either fide 
are covered with heath. The air is generally dry, and 
wholefome ; though there are in feyeral places, marfhes 
and wafte grounds. The parith is remarkably well wa- 
tered. A large rivulet, called the Crook, enters it on the 
W. ; on the N. it is bounded by a confiderably larger 
ftream, called the Weft-water, which, about half a mile 
from the church, joins one ftill larger, called the Eaft- 
water j and thefe foon joining the Crook, they form alto- 
gether the river Northelk. Thefe waters are well fup- 
plied with trout, and in the Northelk there is a confider- 
able falmon-fiftring. 

Agriculture, \s!c. — The produdtions of the parifti are 
principally oats and bear, (commonly called Chefter), with 
fome barley and wheat. Of this laft very little is raifed, 
partly owing to the lightnefs of the foil, and partly to an 
opinion that two crops of other grain are more profitable. 
The return is various, according to the quality of the foil, 
and the ftate of improvements, though it generally is from 
6 to 10, and may be eftimated, at an average, 7 after 1. 
In 1784, a field, containing 7^ acres, yielded upwards of 
90 bolls meal ; it was indeed the firft crop after lime, and 
that year the crop was good every where. Flax, for which 
the foil feems to be generally adapted, is raifed to a con- 
fiderable extent, and is ufually the fecond crop after ley. 
Eight pecks of feed are fown on each acre, and the return 
is 32 ftones dreffed lint, but this depends on the ftate of the 
ground. An acre of lint, fold on the foot, brings from 
L. 10 to L. 14. The flax, which the farmer raifes and 
fpins in his own family, brings him about L. 1, as. the 
ftone ; when he gives it out to be fpun, he pays at the 
rate of 1 s. 1 d. the fpindle. A farmer of this parifh has 
attempted to raife white clover feed, and for 2 years paft 

has

has furnifhed the country with feed, reckoned fuperior in 
Quality, and better adapted to the climate than what is 
imported. The common mode of farming here, is half 
grafs and half crop, with a field of peas or turnips, but 
there are many exceptions. The rotation is, I. oats ; 2. 
bear or barley; 3. oats ; 4. a green crop ; 5. bear or bar- 
ley, along with 12 pounds red, and 4 pounds white clover 
feed, and half a boll of rye-grafs feed the acre. As foon 
as harveil is got in, the ground is fallowed or ribbed ; and 
March is generally well advanced, before any feed is fown, 
but this depends on the feafon. All hufbandry work that 
requires draught, is performed With horfes, and the ordi- 
nary fort of plough is ufed. Horfes, cows, flieep, fwine, 
&amp;.c. are generally of a middle fize, but the breed of horfes 
and cows is fenlibly improving. Black cattle, of a year 
old, will bring from L. 2 to L. 3 each ; this article, and 
grain, form the two principal commodities of the parifh, 
and for thefe there is generally a ready market, the town 
of Brechin being at the diftance of 3 miles, and Montrofe 
7 miles from this parifti. New leafed farms pay at the 
rate of L. 1, 1 s. the acre of arable land, but this is reck- 
oned dear, the old leafes being confiderably lower. Tradef- 
men and others who choofe a fmall piece of ground for 
their convenience, pay from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 1, 10 s. an 
acre. The rent of land has advanced very confiderably 
fince 1 75 1 ; in that year a farm was rented at 12 bolls of 
meal, 12 bolls of oats, and L. 4 : 13 : 6 in money, making 
altogether fomewhat lefs than L. 20 ; now the fame farm 
is divided into 2, one of which pays L. 86, and the other 
L. 44 a-year. The valued rent is L. 2614: 16: 11 Scots. 
The real rent cannot eafily be afcertained. 

Minerals, Fuel, l£c. — In the S. E. part of the parim is 
a large bed of limeftone, which has been wrought for fe-

veral years, and fells at the rate of i s. 10 d. the bolL The 
coal with which the lime is burnt, is imported at Montrofe 
from the frith of Forth ; the ufual price of that neceflary 
article is no lefs than 8 s. 6 d. the boll, or 72 ftone, for 
Scotch coal, and 1 s. 6 d. the barrel for Englifh coal. This 
parifti producing fcarcely any peats, the fuel chiefly ufed 
is turf and broom. — Stone abounds here, but it is of a red- 
difli colour, and either very foft, or fo hard as to refill the 
chiflel. — There are 2 mineral fprings, impregnated with 
fteel, but too weak to produce any effect. 

Prices of Provi/ions and Labour. — In 1751, feed-oats 
fold at 13. s. 4 d. and meal at 12 &amp;. 4 d. the boll, butter at 
4 d. the pound, eggs 2 d. the dozen, an ox at L. 2. The 
wages of men fervants were L. 1 : 13 : 4, and of women 
fervants, L. 1 a-year, and a day-labourer got 2 d. a-day 
and vi&amp;uals. In 1790, feed-oats and meal were fold, the 
former at 15 s. and the latter at 13 s. 4 d. barley at 14 s. 
and bear at 12 s. the boll, butter at 7 d. a-pound, eggs at 
4 d. a dozen, an ox at L. 6. The wages of men fervants 
have advanced to L. 7, and of women fervants to L. 3 a- 
year, and a day-labourer now has 9 d. and victuals. A 
girl that fits at her wheel will earn 6*d. a-day, at the 
rate of 1 s. 1 d. the fpindle. 

Population. — According, to. Dr Webfter's returns, about 
the 1750, the numbers were 529. In 1790, they were 
6^2 -, 269 males, and 403 females. The caufes of this in- 
creafe are faid to be improvements in agriculture, and the 
extenfion of trade. By the regifter for 10 years preceding. 
1790, the births were 143, the burials 120, and the mar- 
riages 56. But there is reafon to think that the births and 
marriages are not fo fully inferted as the burials, many 
choofing rather to forego the advantage of having their mar- 
riages- 



of Strkkathrow. 213 

riages and the births of their children regiftered, than pay 
the tax ; whereas, in the cafe of burials, the mortcloth is 
always employed, for the hire of which the clerk muft ac- 
count to the feflion. The number of children produced 
from each marriage, at an average, is between 4 and 5. 
In 1790, the number of deaths was confiderably greater 
than ufual, occalioned by the ravages of a nervous fever, 
and which raged moil in marftiy places. There are in the 
parilh, 8 heritors, 3 of whom refide -,27 farmers, and 16 
families of tradefmen. 



Stipend, Church, Poor, l$c. — The ftipend is L. 32a, 17 s. 
4 d. Scots, including L. 30 for communion elements, 13 
bolls of oats, 23! bolls of meal, and 23-f- bolls of bear, the 
whole not exceeding, at an average, L. 65 Sterling a-year. 
Of the above, there is a part paid out of the neighbouring 
parifh of Brechin. The manfe was built in 1748; and, 
as this diftrift is compofed of two united pari£h.es, the mi- 
nifter has two glebes, one of 5, and the other of 3 acres, 
though, as the latter lies at the diftance of 2 miles from 
the manfe, it is of little value. The church is little better 
than a heap of ruins, and has all the marks of great anti- 
quity. In Popifli and Epifcopal times, it was the church 
of the Chantor of the Cathedral of Brechin. In the church- 
yard are 3 graves, which, according to tradition, are the 
burial places of 3 Danifh Generals. — Befides families who 
receive occafional fupplies, there are 10 poor on the roll ; 
one of thefe is a lunatic, and for fome years coft the parifli. 
L. 10, but the expence is now reduced to L. 7 a-year; the 
others are maintained in their own houfes. The funds a- 
rife from the weekly collections, which, on an average, 
are 4 s. 7 d. the profits of the mortcloth, and the intereft 
of L. 187 capital ftock, amounting altogether to about L.22 
a-year. 

Roads. 



214 



Statijlical Account 



Roads. — The great roads from Brechin to Aberdeen., 
and from Brechin to Glenefk, pafs through this parifh, and 
are in tolerable repair •, but the road from hence to Mon- 
trofe, and the private roads, are a difgrace to the country. 
In 1789, an of Parliament was obtained to repair the 
roads in this county, by which the ftatute -labour is con- 
verted into money, at the rate of L. 1, 4 s. for every L. 100 
Scots of valued rent. The fenfe of the parifhioners of 
Strickathrow, with refpect to this act, is, that commuta- 
tion of labour into money is an advantage both to them 
and to the roads, provided the fum is moderate j but in 
the prefent inftance it is deemed too high. 

Antiquities, and Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is 2 
place in the parifh called Blackdikes, which is thought to 
be a corruption of Battle-dikes. This conje&amp;ure is ftrength- 
ened by there being the remains of a camp of an oblong 
figure, 2 fides of which are ftill vifible, lying in the neigh- 
bourhood, in the parifh of Brechin. N. W. from this en- 
campment, at the diftance of about 3 miles* are 2 hills, 
forming a part of the Grampian Mountains, called Cater- 
thun, or 4 the Eaft and Weft Cater,' the one furrounded 
with an immenfe aflemblage of ftones, the other with an 
earthen rampart, both being in a favourable fituation for a 
camp. It is very ftrongly conjectured that this is the place 
mentioned by Tacitus, where the engagement between A- 
gricola and Galgacus, General of the Caledonians, hap- 
pened. Under this head, it may be mentioned that, ac- 
cording to fome writers, the church-yard of Strickathrow 
was the fcene of the abjeft furrender of the Crown of Scot- 
land, by John Baliol, to King Edward I. in 1296. — Na- 
ture has denied coal to this parifh, and that want is more 
fenfibly felt by a tax of 2 s. the boll upon importation. 

Coal, 



of Strickathrow 



Coal, however, is reckoned the cheapeft fuel to be pro- 
cured, peats being very dear. — The grain produced here 
is of an inferior quality, and fells lower than what is 
raifed in the more foutherly part of the county. Short 
leafes may alfo be ranked under this head, though they 
are not peculiar to this parilh.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2240072">JOHNSTON</name>, 
(COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Sibbald.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil and Climate. 

nr^HE moll general and probable account is, that the pa- 
rifh was fo called, from its having been the immemo- 
rial refidence and property of people of that name. John- 
Itons have been the principal, and almoft fole proprietors, 
and long ago were the only inhabitants of the panfh. It 
is fkuated in that part of Dumfries-mire, known by the 
name of Annandale, and belongs to the prefbytery of Loch- 
maben, and Synod of Dumfries. Its length is 4 miles, and 
breadth 3, except towards the N. W. from the church, 
where it extends to the diftance of 5, and in one place 6 
miles. On the N. it is bounded by Kirkpatrick-Juxta, 
on the E. by Wamphray and Applegarth, on the S. by 
Lochmaben, and on the W. by Kirkmichael and Clofeburn. 
The appearance of the country is flat, with a gradual afcent 
towards the weft. Owing to its flatnefs, this, and a confi- 
derable tract of no ghbouring country, running from S. to 
N. has got the name of Bale; and either becaufe the river 
Annan runs along it, or becaufe the town of Annan is at 

one 



of Johnjlon. 217 

■one end of it, it has been called ^7inandale. The foil is 
chiefly of three kinds. The higher lands are generally 
-deep mots or clay, and on the banks of Annan the land is 
light and fandy. Great part, or rather moft of it, is rich 
and good, though till of late much neglected, and needs on- 
ly culture to make it produce the moft luxuriant crops. 
Rains are moftly from the fouth, and in great quantity, 
yet the air is not unhealthy to the natives, though delicate 
ftrangers complain of it, and indeed generally fufFer much 
from it upon their firft fettling here. Notwithftanding the 
great rains and frequent fogs, the ague feldom appears. 
We have fometimes putrid fevers, owing perhaps in fome 
meafure to the carrion on which our neighbours in the 
mountains chiefly fubfift : For when the ftiepherds meet 
with a dead ftieep, if it will but carry home, it is generally 
ufed for food ; and from habit, they prefer it to found and 
wholefome mutton. Confumptions are likewife frequent ; 
but the moft common ailments are rheumatifms and ner- 
vous complaints, . efpecially in the decline of life. 

River Annan. — In the river Annan, which bounds us on 
the eaft, there is abundance of yellow and fca trout, com- 
mon and fpotted eels *, roches, pars, and falmon from 30 to 
40 pound weight. When large quantities of fnow upon 
•the neighbouring hills happen to be fuddenly thawed, the 
Annan fometimes overflows its banks, and does confider- 
able damage. When a melting of the fnow, and heavy fall 
of rain come together, they generally produce an inunda- 
tion of this fort, which is frequently much increafed by a 
ftrong fouth wind, which blowing in oppofition to the ri- 
ver, dams up its waters. It feldom overflows from rain a- 
4one. The moft remarkable inftances of the fwelling of

the Annan ever remembered here, were in Auguflt 1782, 
Auguft, September and Oftober 1790. 

Population, i£c. — From what can be learned, this part of 
Annandale was once more populous than at prefent. The 
decreafe is owing to feveral farms being united, and good 
arable land turned folely into pafture, on the largeft eftate 
of the parifh. Of late, however, the farms there have been 
divided and fubdivided, and the good effects of this judi- 
cious plan are beginning to appear. Land which from ne- 
gledf, rather than any deficiency of foil or climate, was co- 
vered with heath, now produces mod plentiful crops. The 
fubdivifion of farms has enlarged the number of families, 
and the cultivation of the land now going brifkly on, has 
increafed the number of inhabitants at large. The return 
to Dr W ebfter, about 40 years ago, was 494. The num- 
ber of inhabitants at prefent is 565 ; males 293, females 
272 ; under 10 years of age, 140 •, from 10 to 20, 86 ; from 
from 20 to 50, 246; from 50 to 70, 79; from 70 to ico, 
14. The oldeft perfon is a woman, aged 96 -, the reft are 
all below 90. Indeed, there are only other 2 who exceed 
80. There are 38 farmers, 5 weavers, 2 fhoemakers, 2 
blackfmiths, 4 tailors, 3 wrights, 1 miller, 5 mafons, 7 ap- 
prentices, 5 female houfehold fervants. The farmers, at 
an average, have a male and female fervant each, befides a 
boy or a girl for taking care of their cattle. One ftudent 
of medicine. Only one foreigner, native of Jamaica. One 
born in England. The heritors are 4 in number, 2 of 
whom are what are called portioners, having a fmall pro- 
perty. One of thefe portioners is the only refiding heri- 
tor. The Earl of Hopetoun's.. refidence here is always

ceders.

ccdcrs. Houfes are 122, all inhabited; at full 4, perfons 
to each. 

Agriculture, \3c. — The field productions are chiefly oats, 
fome rye, a little bear and barley, and here and there a 
few ridges of peas. No wheat nor beans ; nor have tur- 
nips, till of late, been fown in the fields, though now be- 
coming common. Every farmer raifes potatoes for the ufe 
of his family; generally fome likewife for feeding fwine 
and black cattle, but chiefly the former. A few years ago 
there were no fruit-trees in the parifh, nor are there yet 
any deferving the name. A very fine young orchard is 
now planted at Raehills, at the manfe, and fome other places. 
Foreft-trees are nearly as fcarce -, but from the names of 
many places, fuch as Loch wood, Woodend, &amp;c. where 
there is now very little wood,, it is evident, that this, like 
moft parts of Scotland, once abounded in trees. Befides 
former plantations, 150 acres were planted laft winter by 
the Earl of Hopetoun. Sheep, which were once fo plenty, 
are now reduced to about 1500, and fuceeeded by horfes 
and black cattle. The iheep are moftly ftill the common 
black faced Scotch fiieep. Indeed the only exceptions are 
thofe at Raehills, part of which are of Spanifh breed, and 
the reft a crofs breed, known in this country by the name 
of Long Sheep. Cows and horfes are rather more nume- 
rous than formerly, there being 295 cows, and 11 1 horfes, 
the latter almoft folely for hulbandry, with a few young 
ones, partly for fale, and partly to keep up the old ftock. 
Befides the milk-cows already mentioned, there may, at an 
average, be 450 black cattle, part fattening, but moft only 
rearing. There is a ftrong prejudice prevails all over this 
country againft horned cattle. They bring at leaft 10 s. 
a head lei's than thofe 'without horns, of the fame weight 
and quality, probably beeaufe the age of horned cattle can- 
not

Statijlical Account 



not be mifreprefented ; whereas a dealer can affert thofe 
without horns to be of any age that beft fuits his purpofe. 
There are 6 labouring oxen at Raehills. During the 5 laft 
years, there have been annually ploughed, at an average, 
850 acres, moft of which is employed in railing oats. Per- 
haps an 8th or 9th part is fown with bear, barley, rye, 
peas, &amp;c. Next to oats, bear is the ftaple grain here. 
Rye holds the next place. Our peas and flax take but 
little room. The land on which they fow bear, barley 
and rye is generally the potato and turnip ground of the , 
preceding year. The fowing of grafs is a new piece of 
huftmndry with us, and is ftill in its infancy. There were 
40 acres fown with artificial grafles laft feafon. As the 
land is only beginning to be improved, the paftures are but 
poor, and muft be extennve ; they comprehend all the re- 
manent parts of the parilh, excepting what is taken up by 
roads and plantations. The commonty, which was very 
confiderable, was divided net long ago. In ordinary fea- 
fons, the farmers are employed from the middle of March 
to the middle of April, in fowing oats •, in the end of April 
they plant potatoes. Such as fow barley and grafs-feeds, do it 
early in May, though fometimes the grafles are fown later. 
T'oWards the middle of July, they begin to cut their rye -grafs 
and clover. Meadow hay is about a month later in ripening. E 
September is ufually the harveft month for barley and oats ; 
but in fome untoward feafons, there is often a good deal to 
cut down at the commencement of October. The whole 
rental is faid to be at prefent about L. 1300 ; but owing to 
the improvements now going on, it muft foon be more than 
double. Beft arable and pafture land is faid to rent from 
8 s. toi2s. the acre; inferior, from 3 s. to 6s. Average 
fize of farms is 160 acres, and their number is much in- 
creafed thefe laft 10 years. Moft of our farmers have 2 
ploughs a-piece ; one ftrong and heavy, for breaking ley„

heath, &amp;c. and another lighter, for ploughing ftubble, fal- 
lowing, &amp;c. They are all the common Scotch plough, ex- 
cepting 2 or 3 belonging to Lord Hopetoun, with pot-me- 
tal glebe boards. Thefe can never be common here, as our 
land is ftony and uneven. In general, the farmers have a 
carts each. At Raehills (fo called from its having been 
long ago kept as a deer park by the family of Annandale) 
there are a few deer r between 20 and 30, lately placed there 
by the Earl of Hopetoun^ About as many goats are to be 
feen in an adjoining pafture. A great part of the parilh 
has been inclofed lince the prefent Earl came to the ma- 
nagement, and it is his Lordfhip's intention foon to inclofe 
moll of the remainder. The people are not very fond of in- 
clofures, as they think it trou'olefome to keep their cattle off 
the young hedges, and complain that thefe inclofures oblige 
them to take round about roads, every time they ftir from 
home. But they will foon be univerfally fenfible of the 
advantages to be derived from them. The more confide- 
rate are fo already. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The value of the living may 
be about L. 80 Sterling a-year, manfe and glebe included. 
The patron is the Marquis of Annandale ; but the Earl of 
Hopetoun, as curator at law, prefents in his name. The 
church was buity: in 1733, the manfe in 1735, and has much 
need of being rebuilt. — We have two public fchools, one in 
the eaft, and the other towards the weft end of the parifli. 
The matters in both are very well qualified to teach the 
branches of education they profefs, viz. writing, reading, a- 
rithmetic and book-keeping. The fcholars in each are about 
30 in winter, and 20 in fummer. Their falaries are different, 
the one having 200 merks, the other 150. Their fees for 
reading, 1 s. a quarter, (and although they write, pay no 
more), arithmetic is. 6 d. for a courfe of book-keeping

themfelves as entitled, in name of the furviving poor, to

have left, although we do not require them on admiffion 
to lign any deed to that purpofe. What they leave is fel- 
dom claimed by the feffion, but being for the moft part of 
little value, is commonly given to fuch of their indigent re- 
lations or neighbours as were kind and attentive to them 
in their laft illnefs. Befides the refources already men- 
tioned, it may be proper to ftate, that few years pafs with- 
out moft generous and well judged prefents to our poor from 
the Hopetoun family. Nor is this the only parilh which 
experiences their bounty. Wherever they have property, 
and in many parifhes where they have none, the poor are 
the objects of their frequent beneficence. 

Prices, Wages, is'c. — There is no market for butcher- 
meat in the parilh. The ordinary way of being provided 
in it is, for a family, or different families united, to buy a 
whole bullock, or fheep, or fow, &amp;c. Of the two market- 
towns neareft us, the one is 6, and the other 10 miles off. 
When we do fend to either of thefe, we generally pay for 
beef and mutton 6 d. the pound, Englifh weight ; lamb is 
commonly a little dearer. The following articles can be 
had in the parifh : geefe at 3 s. each, ducks 6 d. hens 6 d.

pound, fweet milk ditto 6 d. Scotch weight. Barley and 
oats always fluctuating ; average price of the former, L. 2, 
10 s. ditto of the latter, L. 2, 2 s. the Moffat boll. — The or- 
dinary hire of a day-labourer is 6 d. in the fliort days, and 
8d. when the days are long, with their meat, or 10 d. and 
I s. without victuals ; tailors 8 d. though till of late only 
6 d. with viftuals •, carpenters and mafons 1 s. a-day, 
with meat, or 1 s. 6 d. without it. This fo long as there 
are 12 hours of day-light; when lefs, their wages are redu- 
ced 2 d. a-day. For peat and hay-making, men 8 d. wo- 
men 4 d. with their meat. — The fuel commonly made ufe 
of is peat and turf ; thefe are to be had in great abundance 
in the parilh. The average expence of a labourer, who has 
a family, is about L. 15 a-year. Houfe-rent is from 12 s. 
to L. 1. His wages, and other advantages, enable him, 
with ceconomy, to bring up in a very decent manner a fa- 
mily of 5, 6, or even more children ; for befides what he 
earns, his wife has it often in her power to pay their houfe- 
rent, by working occafionally to the farmer from whom 
they rent it. The farmer too conliders it as his own inte- 
reft, to allow them as much ground for potatoes, as their 
allies, &amp;c. can manure, to lead out their afhes, and to plant, 
and in harveft to raife their potatoes with his own plough. 
A part of his agreement with them likewife is to bring 
home their peats ; for this he is recompenled by occafional 
labour, which feldom prevents the cottager from earning his 
day's hire. — Another circumftance in favour of fuch fami- 
lies is, their being foon relieved from the burden of fup- 
porting their children ; for although we have no manufac- 
tures for the employment of very young ones, yet fo foon 
as they reach 7 or 8 years, they can all be employed, at 
Jeaft during fummer and harveft, in tending cattle ; for this

they receive board and lodging, and an hire proportioned 
to their age, and the number of cattle they have to attend,

hufbandry, L. 3, or L. 3, 10 s. There are but very few 
fervants kept folely for domeftic purpofes. 

Ruin. — The only ruin worthy of notice is the caftle of 
Lochwood, which was the refidence of the family of An- 
nandale. It is fkuated in the north end of the parifli, com- 
mands a very extenlive profpedt, especially towards the 
fouth, and is faid to have been built in the 14th century. 
It mull formerly have been a place of great ftrength, ha- 
ving had prodigioufly thick walls, and being furrounded 
by unpaffable bogs and marflies. It was this circum- 
ftance made King James VI. fay, that  the man who built 
« Lochwood, though outwardly honeft, mull have been * 
' knave in his heart.' 

Eminent Men. — This parifli has the honour of having gi- 
ven birth to Dr Rogerfon, firft phyfician to the Eraprefs of 
Ruflia. His father was one of the Marquis's tenants, and 
rented one half of the farm of Lochbrew, in the fouth end 
of the parifli, where the Doftor was born. The other half 
was at the fame time rented by William Halliday, another 
farmer, whofe fon, Dr Matthew Halliday, is likewife one 
of her Imperial Majefty's phyficians. 

Mifcel!a?ieous Obfervatiom. — The inhabitants are rather 
above the middle fize ; but I never heard of any of them 
exceeding fix feet two inches. Their drefs, diet, and 
lodging, are much amended within thefe twenty, or even 
ten years. They feldom live beyond their income. 

Sympathy 



of Johnjlon. 



Sympathy is a finking feature in their chara&amp;er. Before 
the Union, and for fome time after it, the inhabitants of 
Annandale, like other Borderers, were riotous and quarrel- 
fome. Now they are a fober, harmlefs people, and by the 
encouragement given them, have of late become induftri- 
ous. Emigration was frequent till within thefe 9 years ; 
but there is now employment found both for the parifhion- 
ers and for ftrangers. Only 2 have inlifted in the army 
fmce the 1785. None have entered into the navy, nor 
gone to fea. They are beginning to tafte the fweets of in- 
duftry and aclive virtue, and it feems hardly poffible to de- 
vife a better plan for ameliorating their lituation, than that 
which Lord Hopetoun is carrying on. Not very long ago 
this pariih could not fupply itfelf with provifions ; at pre- 
fent there is abundance for home confumpt, and a little for 
exportation. Forty-three new houfes have been built with- 
in the laft 10 years. — Moft of the landed property in this 
country is entailed, and therefore never in the market. — 
The great road through this parifli from Moffat to Dum- 
fries, is in good repair. Statute-labour is commuted. No 
turnpikes in the pari/h. St Ann's bridge over Kinnel wa- 
ter, 13 miles from Dumfries, and 8 from Moffat, was built 
by the prefent Earl of Hopetoun, in 1782. — One of the 
chief difadvantages is the great difiance from coal; the 
neareft fuel of this fort is at Sanquhar, at leaft 30 miles off, 
and the road very bad. Douglas coal is farther off; but as 
the road to it is better than that to Sanquhar, it is found 
eafier both for men and horfes to bring coal from thence. 
There is plenty of mofs in the parifh ; but every thing con- 
fidered, peats are always got at a great expence, and in wet 
feafons can hardly either be fufficiently dried or brought 
home. Lime is 18 miles diftant.—There are no profeffed 
inns or ale-houfes ; but there are 4 houfes in different quar- 
ters, where ale and fpirits can be bought by retail. Few

Cottagers are never employed in agriculture, but on parti- 
cular occalions, when more hands are required than the 
farmers can afford to keep through the year- No eagles 
have ever been feen in this parifh, though in the High- 
lands, in the near neighbourhood, they are fometimes to be 
met with. We have partridges in great abundance ; in 
the weft end of the parifh groufe are common ; the black- 
cock too, has there fometimes been feen. We are likely 
to have more of thefe fome years hence ; for, according to 
naturalifts, corn and young plantations always attraft them. 
Herons are to be feen through the whole year on the 
banks of the Annan. Befides the cuckoo and fwallow, vre 
have an annual vifit from the bullfinch, who makes great 
havock of goofeberries and currants in May. The wpod- 
Jark and fieldfare are very common. </p>

(county of fife.) 

By Michael Greenlaw, D. D.</head> 



<p>Name and Situation* 

THE name is faid to exprefs fome thing indelicate to 
be explained. The parifti lies in the prelbytery of 
Cupar, and Synod of Fife, about 6 miles weft of the eaft 
end of the Ochil Hills, which run from the mouth of the 
Tay weft, to within a mile of Stirling. It is from S. to 
N. about 3 miles, and from E. to W. about 2. It is 
bounded on the E. by Balmerino and Kilmeny, on the 
N. by Flilk, on the W. by Abdie and Dunbog, and on 
the S. by Monimail and Moonzie. 

Agriculture, ^.—Farming in this parifti and neigh- 
bourhood is advancing faft in improvement, confidering our 
thin fharp foil. For many years paft, there was only rough 
bear, and no barley. But barley now is the ftaple grain. 
' It is faid that Fife exports about 30,000 bolls of it yearly, 
befides what it confumes. And it is neceflary to import 
6000 bolls of -oats or meal a-year. The farmers find it 
more profitable to raife barley than oats. For I boll of

wheat fown in this parifh about 30, or even 20 years ago, 
there are, at a moderate computation, 10 fown now. For- 
merly too, it was full of blacks, and needed to be walhed 
before it was fent to the mill ; now, by the attention paid 
to the feed, and the preparing of the ground, good wheat 
is produced from 8 to 12 bolls, after i, without any blacks 
at all. The rents of many farms are doubled, and fome 
tripled ; yet the tenants pay them, ride better horfes, wear 
finer clothes, and entertain their friends better than be- 
fore. Several tenants in this parifh are become proprietors, 
by mere fuccefs in farming, and have far more general 
knowledge too than they had 30 or 20 years ago. There 
is 1 flock of fheep, about 13 fcore ; the wool fells at be- 
tween 16 s. and L. 1 the ftone. The farmers have accefs 
to lime, within 10 or 12 miles. The roads are good, and 
without turnpikes. 

Population. — The population of this parifh is diminifhed 
one-fifth in the period of thefe 35 years paft; which is ow- 
ing, probably, to 1 village being allowed to go to decay,, 
the union of farms, and the ufe of two horfe ploughs*

The number of births, in proportion to the number of 
inhabitants, is increafed. From a comparifon of the num- 
ber of births from 1726 to 1736, when the parifh was 
more populous, with that from 1776 to 1786, when it was 
lefs fo, the proportional inereafe was found to be about 
one-tenth. The air is good, and the fituation dry ; the 
practice of inoculating children for the fmall-pox, is alfo 
favourable to population. The people are in more eafy 
eircumftances, which encourages matrimony. 

Stipend, ifc. — The ftipend is between -L. 80 and L. 90 
Sterling, with 3-j- acres of glebe, of a thin foil. Colonel 
Baillie is patron. There are 7 heritors, 5 of whom refide. 
— The weekly collections for the poor are very fmall ; but 
the poor are few in number. — The fchoolmafter's falary is 
80 merks, with the intereft of 2000 merks ; the perquifites 
are very trifling, and the number of fcholars fmall. 

Antiquities. — There is a little hill near the church, with 
the veftiges of a Roman camp upon it. It has 2 lines of 
circumvaUation j the one is much wider than the other, 
as an outwork, within a mile of the Tay. There is ano- 
ther of the fame kind, on a higher hill, weft of the former ; 
it is likewife within a mile of the Tay. This hill is feen 
from the north windows of the Old Town of Edinburgh. 
The lines about thefe camps are rough ftones. The higheft 
of thefe hills is called Normans-Law, or the Hill of Nor- 
thern Men. The tradition concerning thefe camps is, that 
when the Normans invaded for plunder, and not for conqueft, 
they depofited their fpoils there, till they got intelligence 
of a force being raifed in the country, that was able to re- 
pel them ; then they haftened to their boats in the Tay„ 
Cardinal Beaton's caftle ftands by the church of Criech. 
The tradition is, that the Cardinal kept there a little coun-

try feraglio. It is defended on one fide, by a morafs ; and 
on the other fide, has had ftrong outworks. Being much 
defaced, and fome of the fineft ftones removed, no infcrip- 
tion can be found to mark its date. There were lately 
found, in a rifing fpot of ground near the manfe, 2 brown 
jars, with their bottoms upwards, and a broad ftone laid 
on each, containing human bones. The bones were much 
confumed, yet joints, &amp;c. were difcernible. It muft have 
been long fince they were put there, as burning or in-urning 
the dead, is not a late practice in this country. 

"Thunder. — About 18 or 20 years ago, the lightning 
ftruck Pitcullo houie, about 4 miles north of Cupar. It 
entered in 2 ftreams ; one came down the kitchen chim- 
ney, tore off the jack-cafe, and left 3 or 4 black fpots on 
the roof of the kitchen, at conliderable diftances from each 
other. A fervant fitting in a clofet off the kitchen, had a 
large hole burnt in the crown of her head-drefs. She was 
fome hours infenfible, but recovered. When the ftroke 
came, fhe thought that £he was falling into a fwoon or faint. 
The other ftream entered by a fine fhell-clofet, {tripped a 
few fhells and fome frofting off, then Went down the ftone- 
turnpike, and burft through the panneling of another room, 
where was a mahogany table. This table was picked, as 
if hit with very fmall (hot. Here its force was exhaufted. — 
Thunder broke within a mile of the manfe in fummer 1789, 
in a low-lying field of oats. It laid flat the corn for about 
15 or 16 yards in length, and 7 or 8 in breadth. The 
ftraw that was before green, and full of fap, became yel- 
low and withered. The earth on the fpot was ploughed 
up, though not deep. This field, though lying fo low, is 
near the Tay, and water is an attra&amp;or. — Four or 5 years 
ago, a tremendous flafh, accompanied with a dreadful peal 
of thunder, killed 2 tradefmen at Cupar. They were fit- 
ting

ting in one of the higheft houfes there, and on the loft im- 
mediately above them were feveral pieces of old iron. 
The watch of one of them fcarcely retained any of its 
former fhape. It looked as if it had lain fome time in a 
fmith'-s furnace. The lightning feems to fpread like fmall 
fliot when near fpent. There is undoubtedly a ftrong con- 
cuffion of the air when it ftrikes. In the room in Pitcullo 
houfe, the glafs was all forced out of the windows, though 
the cafements were not marked. The houfe in Cupar, 
where the men were killed, had both fide-walls a little 
fplit, and burft out from the flooring. 

Hills. — The hills not only fhelter, but by the rains warn- 
ing them down in the courfe of ages, increafe and meliorate 
the foil of the valleys. There is a narrow ftrath, which 
runs through this parifh, E. through Kilmeny, and W, 
through Dunbog and Abdie, the adjacent panfhes, which, 
is fheltered by the Ochil Hills, and the dealers in barley 
prefer the grain to much that grows in other parts of Fife, 
The rich Carfe of Gowrie, oppofite to this parifh, is ftiel- 
tered in the fame way. It, perhaps, deferves notice, that 
the moft remarkable ridges of hills in Scotland run E. and, 
W. This holds with refpecl; to the Grampian, as well as 
the Ochil Hills. It has been remarked, that the great 
ridges of mountains in England, extend generally E. and 
W. too. The fame has been obferved of the Alps, of Cau- 
cafus, and Taurus, in Alia ; and of Atlas, in Africa. Be- 
fides affording fhelter, they are faid to prevent the exhaled 
vapours from going too much N. or S. that there may 
be a fufficiency of rain for the inland countries. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is one Seceder family 
here, and a few other individuals that are Seceders. It is 
fuppofed they are not increafing along the banks of the

Tay and Forth, where they were at firft moft numerous. 
They, too, are lefs bigotted now, from the increafe 
of knowledge. — Induftry is inculcated both publicly and 
privately, as one of the cardinal virtues ; and indeed it is 
more eafy to perfuade to this, than to fome other virtues, 
as the reward of it immediately follows. — Many of our 
young people leave us, to go to the neighbouring towns of 
Dundee and Perth, to learn handicraft trades. — There is 
only one ale-houfe. — It has been reported, that in a part of 
the parifh of Leuchars, near this, there were a race of Da- 
nifli fhepherds, who kept their fheep as well as themfelves 
in their original ftate, and produced wool not inferior to 
that of Shetland ; but I am informed, that the people do 
not keep themfelves feparate, but intermarry in the neigh- 
bourhood ; and as to their wool, I do not hear that it is 
praifed. Their fheep are of a fmall fize, and feed on coarfe 
grafs or bent. When other fheep fell at 14 s. or 16 s. thefe 
people are glad to get 6s. or 7 s. for theirs. '

perfons of influence, the clergy of Scotland muft degene- 
rate. If they become objects of compaflion, their weight 
mull be leffened, and no refpeclability of character will 
counterbalance that evil. Should the teachers of religion 
become meanly thought of, on account of their poverty, 
religion will fuffer •, and if good morals decline, induftry, 
which requires regularity and fobriety of conducl, muft de- 
cline alfo. The very fmall encouragement alfo given to 
fchoolmafters, is one of the greateft evils ; for it is' not only 
an unfpeakable lofs to the poor men who teach, but to the 
riling generation. There are not a few parifhes in this 
neighbourhood, where the falary is only 100 merks. Some 
have L. 100 Scots. But what man fit to teach can live 
upon this ? What knowledge can he communicate ? A 
common tradefman can live more at his eafe. Were the 
encouragement increafed, though but a little, it would do 
more good than can be expreffed. Imperfect teaching of 
youth is like bad plowing in fpring, which muft of necef- 
fity produce a bad crop in harveft. The poorer fort of 
people are left without a remedy, and muft fend their chil-

<p>Extent, Situation, Soil, Climate, i$c. 

T^HIS parifh is computed to extend about 3 miles from 
E. to W. and 4 from N. to S. Its figure refembles 
the form of a long bow, with its firing {trained to the ut- 
moft pitch. The boldeft fide of the curve is bounded on 
the W. and part of the S. by a quick bending of the bank* 
of the river Tay, and on the E. S. E, and part of the S. 
by a low fandy fhore of the German Sea. The flat fide of 
the curve is bounded by the parifh of Panbride on the N- 
E. and part of the N. and on part of the N. and N. W- 
by the parifh of Monikie.— The parifh is in the prefbyte- 
ry of Aberbrothock, and the Synod of Angus and Mearns. 
A high verdant bank, which feems once to have formed a 
fleep fhore of the ocean, runs through the whole, from E. 
to W. giving to the northern divifion the appearance of a 
great regular terrace, elevated about 50 feet above the 
fouthern part.— The foil is various. The lower divifion is 

cainpofedi 



of Barrie, 



compofed of a thirfty down, which barely fuffices for the 
grazing of a few flocks of flieep and of young cattle, inter- 
fperfed with fome acres of arable land, which, in fhowery 
feafons, yield a moderate crop of grain. The upper divi- 
fion is partly light loam, partly generous gravel, and a few 
fields approach to a deep black foil. The mould, though 
in no refpedt rich, favoured by inclofure in many parts, and 
aided in general by an enlightened hufbandry, produces 
crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas, turnip, flax, clover, po- 
tatoes, little inferior in quantity and quality to the growth 
of the fame extent of land in diftricts diftinguHhed by a va- 
luable foil. — Within the bounds of this fmall parifh, a di- 
verfity of climate is experienced. The lower divifion, 
from its fandy nature, and the interpofing banks which 
hide it from the ocean, though fometimes covered with 
hazy fogs, is warm in fummer, and enjoys a kindly tern- 
perature in the winter months. The upper divifion, ele- 
vated above the level of the fea, is fenfibly cooler in the 
warmeft weather, and in winter feels the almoft unbroken 
feverity of the winds from the E. and the N. W. The 
climate is not uncommonly hoftile to the conftitution. The 
inhabitants paid an annual tribute to the ague, while the 
land continued undrained, and in rainy winters fome com- 
plaints of rheumatifm are ftill heard of ; but there are no 
diflempers ftri&amp;ly local. It will readily be perceived, that 
a climate, circumftanced as that of Barrie, muft be friendly 
to vegetable productions. An early verdure covers the 
fields. The fowing feafon commences about the middle of 
March, and the corns are generally lodged in the barn- 
yard before the fecohd week of October. Migratory birds 
vifit this place very early in the feafon. The pariih might ' 
perhaps claim the appellation of beautiful, did not the foil 
in fome parts, and the vicinity to the fea in others, deprive 
it of the verdure of thriving and copious wood, 

Prices 



238 



Statijlical Account 



Prices and Wages.— The parifii is nearly fupplied with 
provifions of its own produce. A few ftones of butcher- 
meat are purchafed from the Dundee market, by a family 
or two, during the fummer ; but oats, furnifhing the meal, 
that is the principal article of food, are raifed in fufficient 
quantities. A quantity of vyheat and oat-meal is annually 
fold at Dundee, and feveral hundred bolls of barley are ex- 
ported, to fupply the' exigencies of fome of the northern 
and weftern counties of Scotland. A number of black 
cattle, reared and grazed within the parifh, are yearly car- 
ried to England ; and fome oxen, ftall-fed with turnip, are 
purchafed by the butchers of the neighbouring towns. 
Wheat is generally fold at L. i, i s. barley at 14 s. oat- 
meal at 14 s. the boll ; beef, mutton, veal, pork, at 3^ d. 
the pound, of 16 oz. ; ducks at 10 d. a-piece ; hens at is.; 
butter at 8 d. the pound, of 22 oz. ; cheefe at 4 s. 6 d. the 
ftone ; eggs at 3 d. the dozen. — The hire of labourers is 1 s. 
a-day, from the .ift of March to the ift of November, and 
10 d. during the reft of the year, excepting the time of 
hay-mowing and harveft, when they are paid at the rate of 
is. 6 d. a-day. The wages of a carpenter are is. 3 d. of a 
mafon 1 s. 8 d. of a tailor 1 s. In the above ftatement, the 
victuals of the labourers and tradefmen are included. The 
average hire of farm-fervants, when they eat in the houfe, 
is L. 8 a-year for men, and L. 3 for women. Domeftic 
fervants form no diftincl: clafs. There is not a male or fe- 
male fervant in the parifh, who is not employed fome- 
time during the year in the Work of the field. 

ManufaBures. — Every houfeholder almoft is a manufac- 
turer of brown linen. In the foreign markets, the linen 
ftamped at Aberbrothock has acquired a high reputation ; 
and it will not be denied, that to the cloth made at Barrie, 
which has long been diftinguifhed for the goodnefs of its 

materials.

materials, and the fuperiority of its workmanftrip, the ftamp 
of Aberbrothock is indebted for part of its fame. By in- 
troducing honour as a prompter to excellence, the manu- 
facture of Barrie has reached its prefent perfection. For 
more than 40 years, the infpeftion of the weaving, by the 
unanimous confent of the manufacturers, has been afligned 
to an annual officer, who is allowed to choofe two affiftant 
counfellors. The officer, with his affefTprs, are eagle-eyed 
to difcover every blemiffi. A pecuniary fine, or what is 
more dreaded, the correction of ridicule, overtakes every 
one who is in fault. Thefe circumftances have contribu- 
ted to fix fuch habits of attention and accuracy, that in- 
itances occur of workmen whofe cloth has not been caft at 
the (lamp-office in a period of 20 years. Exclufive of con- 
fiderable quantities of home-grown flax, the manufacturers 
ufe yearly of foreign flax, from Riga and Peterfburg, fe- 
yeral tons, amounting in value to more than L. 800. The 
manufacturers are in number 1 00. The condition of this 
ufeful clafs of men might be ameliorated, by infuring to 
them at all times abundance of flax at a reafonable rate, by 
continuing the encouragement on the linen branch, and by 
refcuing the manufactures from a twofold combination of 
the brown linen merchants, by which they enhance at 
pleafure the price of the foreign flax they fell, and deprefc 
the price of the cloth they buy. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 689. At prefent (1791) the population is 
796.

Excepting 4 or 5 Antiburgher Seceders, and 3 Epifcopa- 
lians, the people in the parifh are all members of the Efta- 
bliflied Church. There are 3 ftudents of divinity. There 
are 8 heritors, 3 only of whom relide. — It may not be en- 
tirely foreign to the prefent article, to notice, that by the 
late minifter of Barrie, who lived in the parifli not lefs 
than 50 years, it was frequently remarked, that dying per- 
fons expired during the ebbing of the tide. With this re- 
mark accords that obfervation in Pliny's Natural Hiftory, 
(Lib. ii. cap. 98.), quoted from Ariftotle, who affirms, that 
1 no animal expires, unlefs during the going back of the 
* tide.' To which Pliny adds, ' Obfervatum id multum 
' in Gallico Oceano, et duntaxat in homine compertum.' 

Stipend, School and Poor. — The living, including the glebe, 
is fomething more than L. 80 Sterling a-year. The King is 
patron. The manfe, though repaired only 10 years ago, 
is hardly a tolerable houfe. The kirk is an old and forry 
building.— The office of fchoolmafter has, for many years 

paft, 



of Batrie, 



paft, been difcharged by young men of liberal education, 
who have fucceflively come forward to preach, to lecture 
in colleges, and to fill very reputable departments in focie- 
ty. The annual emoluments are inconfiderable. L. j, us. 
Sterling of falary, L. 2 as feflion-clerk's fees* 5 s. for each 
proclamation of banns, 10 d. for regiftering each baptifm, 
3d. for the regiflration of each burial, -and is. 6d. a-quar- 
ter, as the average fees for 40 fcholars throughout the year, 
with fome trifling gratuities, make up the total fum of the 
annual income. — The fum of L. 30 Sterling, arifing partly 
from Sabbath day collections, partly from the rent of fome 
feats in the church, is the only fund allotted for pious pur- 
pofes within the parifh, and the annual fupport of the poor. 
A fmall portion of the money is yearly applied by the 
kirk-feffion, to furniih with neceflary books a few of the 
children of indigent parents, who are unable to give them 
a fchool education without this aid. The reverfion is di- 
ftributed among the poor. The number on the roll is ge- 
nerally n. The poor receive the public charity in their 
own cottages. A begging native has not been known in 
the parifii for many years. Beggars from other places a- 
bound.

Sheep — The late inftitution of the Britim Wool Society, 
gives increafed importance to the flocks of every diftrift. 
The paftures of Barrie may contain 1000 fheep. In a 
country where Iheep are not the fole object of the farmer's 
care, an unexceptionable breed can hardly be expected. 
The fheep of Barrie have no diftinft character. A few an- 
nual recruits imported partly from Fife, partly from the 
northern counties, lately formed the mixed race. It was 
fuppofed, that the union of the Fife ewe with the northern 
ram, would have produced a fpecies hardy, and at the fame 
time fine wool. Difappointment, as to the latter quality in 

Vor - 1V - H h particular,

particular, has been the refult of fome experiments. An 
introduction of the Englifli breed feemed to promife a- 
fpecies, valuable for wool, and of a large fize. However, 
a pafture which affords but harfh grafs and fcanty flielter, 
was found ill fuited to fuch flieep. The fmall Fife flieep, 
weighing 3,2 ponnds, unites in fome meafure the advantages 
of a profitable fleece and a pretty durable conftitution, and 
at prefent appears beft adapted to the foil. It were defi- 
rable, if a breed affording a greater weight of wool could 
be obtained. Not lefs than 12 fleeces, at an average, pro- 
duce 1 ftone of wool. Of the wool, which is generally fold 
at 1 s. the pound, is manufactured almoft every kind of cloth 
worn in the parifli ; hodden, which is moftly.ufed for herds 
cloaks, and is fold at 1 s. 8 d. the yard ; plaiding, which is 
fometimes fliaped into a coarfe kind of hofe, and is fold at 

2 s. the yard ; fey, the common cloth for mens apparel* 
fold, when dyed, at 5 s. the yard ; timming, camblet for 
womens gowns, when in colours, are reflectively fold at 

3 s. and 2 s. 10 d. the yard •, blankets fold at 12 s. the pair, 
confifting of 4 yards •, Sabbath day plaids for women, when 
dyed of 2 or 3 various colours, and containing about 4 
yards, at 16 s. a-piece. — The fcab, from accident, and 
the rot, from the nature of fome of the flieep-walks, are a- • 
mong the number of the difeafes to which the flieep are li- • 
able. The prefcription of Dr Anderfon (tobacco oil) has 
been applied with fome fuccefs in the former difeafe. An- 
other malady, againft which no remedy has yet been de- • 
vifed, preys on the flieep here. Among the fhepherds, it : 
is called the Bracks. The autumn is the feafon of its at- 
tack. The moft lufty, and apparently vigorous of the flock, 
are fingled out as its victims. It kills in 2 hours from the 1 
time it is at firft obferved. From the defcription which 1 
the writer has received, excels of blood appears to be the, 1 
probable caufe of the diforder. The dead carcafe is re- 
markably :

243 



markably bloated and difcoloured, and in a very mort time 
becomes a carrion. The experience of an aged man, who 
for many years was a fheep-mafter in the parifh, affords 
fome prefumption, that a preventative may be found to the 
bracks. He let blood of his Iheep uniformly in the fum- 
mer feafon, and be does not recoiled that the bracks at any 
time thinned his folds. 

Remarkable ObjeBs and Antiquities. — In die fouthern ex- 
tremity of the pariflb, on the banks of the Tay, ftand 2 re- 
flefting light-houfes, reared to direft rhe veffels trading to 
Dundee and Perth through the perilous entrance of the 
Tay. The largeft, which is ftationary, is a circular ftone 
building =ere.£fced on piles ; the other a moveable wooden fa- 
bric, raifed on rollers. When the two lights are feen in 
one, the pilot may navigate the river without fear. The 
expence of the lights is defrayed by a fmall tax on the ton- 
nage of the veffels which enter the Tay. — The Danes feem 
to have been deftined, by their misfortunes, to furnifh the 
only memorable objefts of antiquity which Barrie affords. 
On the eaftern boundary of the parifh many tumuli ap- 
pear. The traces of a camp in their immediate neighbour- 
hood, Carnouftie, i. e. the Cairn of Heroes, the name of 
an adjoining eftate, the vicinity of a brook, which is faid 
to have run three days with blood, proclaim thefe tu- 
muli the graves of thofe northern Marauders who fell in 
the defperate engagement, which, according to Buchanan, 
(B. 6. chap. 50.), took place near Panbride, between the 
Danifli troops commanded by Camus, and the Scotch army 
under King Malcolm II. 

Roads and Bridges. — The roads have at no time been 
much indebted to the improvement of art. The poft-road 
between Dundee and Aberbrothock, which for a long pe- 
riod 



244 



Statijlical Account 



riod ran through its bounds, was merely a line traced by 
frequent paffengers on the furface of the foil. A new poft- 
road, formed 20 years fince to the northward of Barrie pa- 
rim, has annually engrofled nearly the ftatute-labour of the 
contiguous diftricL The fmall reverhon allotted to Barrie, 
has been faithfully and judicioufly applied by a refident Ju- 
flice of the Peace •, but in a light fandy track, where gra- 
vel cannot be obtained without great expence, it may well 
be conceived, that the repairs effected by a trifling fum, 
can neither be permanent nor extenfive. Nature, how- 
ever, has not been unkind ; the roads of Barrie, though 
fomewhat fatiguing, are at all ieafons dry. Voluntary con- 
tributions reared, and have hitherto fupported, the bridges 
within the parifh. A detailed account of the bridges 
would refled no honour on the police of the diftricf. 

Advantages and Li/advantages. — Vicinity to the fea is 
an obvious advantage to this parifh. Though it has no 
formed harbours, the furrounding beach affords a fafe land- 
ing place to fmall veffels ; by which lime, the ftaple ma- 
nure, and coals, the chief article of fuel, are imported 
from the frith of Forth, and fold at a reafoaahle rate. 
Lime fhells are delivered from the fhip at 1 s. 6 d. the 
boll. Coals, conveyed to the moft diftant parts of the 
parifh, are bought by the cottager at 6 s. 8 d. weighing 
72 ftones. — But amid the advantages which Providence 
has already beftowed, and human improvements promife 
to confer, the parifhioners of Barrie experience a rigorous 
aftriction to a barony mill ; a fpecies of vaffalage, which 
they deem an inconvenience of no trivial kind. Legal ap- 
plications for redrefs have hitherto produced a very par- 
tial relief; while, from the unavoidable ambiguity of 
old papers, the reciprocal fervices of the millmafter, and 
th,e aftri&amp;ed farmer, furnifh a fource of hourly difcord ;

while dues are exa&amp;ed by an undamped meafure, which 
is no part of the ftandard of the nation ; while a power is 
lodged with the renter of a hopper, to demand, by a folemn 
oath, an account of every pea, every barley-corn, every 
grain of oats, which is daily diftributed to every labouring 
ilead, perhaps dropped to every hen. Thus circumftanced, 
it will not appear ftrange, if the people of Barrie look for- 
ward to the abolition of thirlage, as a change much to be 
wilhed. They are fufficiently fenfible, that an adequate 
compenfation is due to the reprefentatives of thofe men, 
who originally reared thofe accommodations, which have 
proved fo eminently ufeful to the community. Keeping 
this in view, they find themfelves ftrongly inclined to join 
in any legal, well-concerted plan, by which they may be 
relieved from a fpecies of fervitude, which has often pro- 
duced the mod bitter effects ; and has brought along with 
it, confequences not only hoftile to improvements, but even 
to the beft interefts of morality and religion. The multi- 
plicity of oaths introduced into procelTes relating to thirlage, 
tend in fome degree to take off that refpecT: to things facred, 
which every true ftatefman would delire to preferve un- 
violated. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In general, the people are 
attached to the trades of their fathers. Farming and wea- 
ving are the profeffions which ftand higheft in their efteem. 
To other employments, hardly fo many are inclined as 
fupply the ordinary demands of the parifh. The fine ap- 
pearance of fummer fleets on the fmooth furface of the, Tay, 
allures a few boys to a fea-faring life. Diffipation is un- 
known ; though the fliort fpace of a quarter of a mile pre- 
fents to the view of the traveller the whole inns and ale- 
houfes in the parith, amounting to no lefs than 4. This af- 
femblage, principally defigned for the accommodation of 

ftrangers 



246 Statijlical Account 

Grangers journeying between Dundee and Arbroath, mutt 
not be interpreted to the difadvantage of the parifluoners, 
who are induftrious in a high degree, and in their money 
engagements are punctual to a proverb. Vulgar report 
has fometimes involved, along with the inhabitants of the 
furrounding country, the people of Barrie in a charge of 
inhumanity to ftupwrecked mariners ; but more truly may 
they be chara&amp;erifed as dupes, by their companion to 100 
pretendedly ftupwrecked. — The oppreflion mull be grie- 
vous indeed, which can drive them from their native foil. 
A fort of maladie de pais rivets them to the place of their 
birth. — Though the houfes, drefs, ftyle of living, &amp;c. of the 
parifluoners, indicate nothing difproportionate to their real 
wealth, a confiderable alteration in thefe different articles 
has taken place within a period of 20 years. Inftead of 
the turf-built cottages of former days, the eyes of the ob- 
ferver are fometimes pleafed with manfions, neat, commo- 
dious, almoft elegant. Leeds, Manchefter, Spittalfields, 
unite to furnifli the apparel of thofe who were formerly 
contented with clothing wholly manufactured on the north 
fide of the Tweed. The perfons, however, of this defcrip- 
tion are not numerous. The bulk of the people are eafily • 
diftinguiftied from thofe of the furrounding pariflies, by a 1 
rejection of the fopperies of drefs, and a becoming attach- • 
ment to articles made in their own families The improve- • 
ment in the ftyle of living may be charadterifed, not by a . 
rapid tranfition from fordidnefs to luxury, but rather by a . 
gradual remove from meannefs to a comfortable mode of 
life. A ftrict attention to ceconomy, joined with a pride 
of inheriting unimpaired their paternal acres, prevents, a- • 
mong the heritors of Barrie, that fluctuation of property 
which has lately marked many parts of Scotland. Some i 
lands, however, have within thefe few years changed their 
mafters. The price about 25 years purchafe.— The fize of

the farms can be reduced to no average meafure. The 
upper divifion of the parifli, which may be properly ftyled 
the arable part, is parcelled out among 10 or 11 landhold- 
ers, 3 of whom are proprietors. Their farms contain re- 
fpeftively from 30 to 300 acres a-piece. A happy adjust- 
ment of things has prevented a monopoly of farms, many 
of the leafes prefently current having been granted before 
the all-engraffing fyftem began to extend its baneful influ- 
ence. It cannot be denied, however, that when any tack 
happens to fall, this fyftem difcovers itfelf in miniature, 
by a marked avidity to join to the former poffeffion of a 
houfe and yard, the ground plot of a razed houfe, and the 
extent of its attached yard. Along with the mode of la- 
bouring with horfes, inftead of oxen, the number of cotta- 
gers in the fervice of the farmers has been diminilhed. 
There is no planned defign to deprefs cottagers ; but fer- 
vants entertained in the houfe, are found more conveni- 
ently placed for every exigence, are perhaps lefs expenlive, 
not lefs a&amp;ive, not lefs difinterefted, than thofe who have 
families of their own. Befides 12 day-labourers, who have 
merely houfes and yards, the only clafs of men who fall 
under the defcription of cottagers, are thofe employed by 
the farmers for threftiing the corns. They receive as wages, 
the twenty-fifth boll of each kind of grain they feparate 
from the ftraw, with a dinner each working day. The 
plough of Small's conftrudlion, drawn generally by 4 horfes, 
and attended by a flout lad and a boy, appears well a- 
dapted to every variety of foil in the parifli. In a fmall 
parilh, of which not a third part is arable land, the num- 
ber of ploughs and carts is very inconfiderable. One wag- 
gon was made at Barrie in the year 1791. No waggon- 
road can reafonably be expected in the parilh fooner than 
the year 1793.

<head>NUMBER XXXIII. 

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010108">EARLSTOUN</name>", 
(COUNTY OF BERWICK.) 

jBy the Rev. Mr Laurence Johnston.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Air, %£c. 

r "r HE P arifn probably derives its name from being ori- 
ginallj the refidence of the Earls of March, one of 
whom lived here about the middle of the 13th century. 
It is by fome called Arfehilltoun, becaufe the village is in 
a low fituation, and almoff furrounded with riling grounds. 
However, I take the other to be its true name, and this to 
be only a corruption of it •, for there is no doubt that the 
family of March lived here at the period above mentioned. 
The parifh is about 6 miles in length, from E. to W. and 
from 3 to 4 in breadth. It is bounded by the parifhes of 
Lauder and Melrofe on the W. and S. W. ; by Mertoun 
on the S.; by Smalholm and Nenthorn on the S. E. and 
E. ; and by Gordon and Legertwood on the N. E. N. 
and N. W. It is fituated in the weft end of the county 
of Merfe or Berwick, in the prefbytery of Lauder, and 
Synod of Merfe and Tiviotdale. The foil is not all the 
fame ; fome parts of it are clay, others a light dry foil, and 
other parts are a defirable mixture of both. And as the 

V foil, 



of Earljioun. 



249 



foil, ib the climate is alfo different. It is more mild in the 
weftermofl parts of the parifh, where the foil is generally 
light and dry, than in the eaftermoft parts of it, where the 
foil is ftronger and wetter. But, notwith Handing the dif- 
ference of both foil and climate, the people are in general 
healthy ; many of them arrive at old age. The moft com- 
mon difeafes are agues, rheumatifms, and fcrophula. The 
frequency of the laft is probably owing to intermarriages. 
The ague has not been fo frequent thefe 2 years part as 
formerly ; but confumptive complaints are more common, 
probably owing to the fcrophula ; as it is moffly thofe who 
are of that habit that become confumptive. About 14 or 
15 years ago, the Honourable Mr and Mrs Baillie, both 
very humane and benevolent, caufed inoculate, at their 
expence, above 70 children in this parifh and neighbour- 
hood ; all of whom did well, except 2, who were of a fcro- 
phulous habit. Ever, fince inoculation has been rather more 
generally pra&amp;ifed, and has been the happy means of pre- 
ferving many lives. 

Rivers. — The river Leader runs along the W. end, and 
the river Eden along the E. end of the parifh. Both have 
their fource in Lammar Muir, and run into Tweed. They 
formerly abounded with very fine trout, the firft alfo with, 
falmon. But fince the farmers have fet about improving 
their farms, neither falmon nor trout are near fo plenty in 
either. This is thought to be owing to the liming of the 
grounds on each fide of the rivers, which, by heavy rains, 
is often wafhed down into the rivers, and is fuppofed either 
to fcare or kill the fifh. 

Plantations—There are large plantations of wood in the 
E. end of the parifh, which are a great ornament to that 
part of the country, as well as a benefit to the adjacent 

VoL - IV - I i fields, 



250 



Statiftical Account 



fields, to which they afford great ftielter. There are aH© 
ftrips and clumps of planting lately made in other parts of 
it, which, when grown, will add greatly to the beauty of 
the place, and be a conliderable benefit to the proprietors. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 1197. There are at prefent (1791) 670 
males, and 681 females. In all, 135 1 fouls. 653 are of 
the Eftablifhed Church, the reft are Sectaries. I do not 
think it has increafed in numbers of late years. The farms 
are now much larger than formerly. What ufed to ferve, 
1 2 or 13 farmers, is now dccupied by 4, which muft rather 
diminifh than increafe the number of inhabitants. 

Mamtfa&amp;ures, Agriculture, is"c. — Although the parifh 
confifts chiefly of villages, yet very few manufactures are 
carried on in it. The principal one is linen cloth. There 
are between 40 and 50 weavers looms, moftly employed 
weaving linen v and the greateft part of that cloth is for 
fale. We have only one woollen manufacturer, though no 
place can be better fituated for carrying on that branch of'"j 
trade, than the village of Earlftoun is. Leader runs along 
the weft end of it, where there is an extenfive beautiful 
haugh, and there is plenty of wool, if not in the parifh, 
yet in the neighbourhood, to fupply 20 manufacturers, 
though they manufactured to a conliderable extent. Nor 
can any part of the country be better accommodated with 
roads. The turnpike between Edinburgh and Jedburgh, I 
goes clofe by the weft end of the village, and the great 
road from Edinburgh to London, by Kelfo, goes within 
l£ mile of the eaft end of it. There are 4 mills in the | 
parifh, which manufacture a conliderable quantity of all 
kinds of grain. Befides what the inhabitants 6f the parifh 
confume, they make into meal and barley above 7000 

bolls,. 



1 



of Earlfloun. 



251 



bolls, Linlithgow meafure, every year ; all which is car- 
ried to Dalkeith and Edinburgh markets. Coal and lime ' 
are brought home in return. — There are about aooo lheep 
kept in the parilh. The farmers alfo rear a conliderable 
number of black cattle every year. Befides thefe, they 
buy many in the autumn j which, with thefe of their own 
that are of proper age, they fatten on turnips. They are 
now beginning to breed horfes. This will probably be the 
means of lowering the price of that ufeful animal, which, 
for fome years paft, has been very high. Horfes are abfo- 
lutely neceflary in this part of the country, for it is by them 
the farmers labour their farms, and drive their corn to 
market. They never work with oxen now, as they ufed 
to do formerly. — The moll common crops in this parilh 
are oats, barley, and peas. There is alfo fome wheat every 
year ; but the quantity of it is fmall, in proportion to the 
other kinds of grain. Turnips and potatoes are very gene- 
ral, and commonly very good. There is now a great 
quantity of clover and rye-grafs fown, and fome flax for 
private ufe. The oats that grow on the grounds about 
Fans, are much elleemed for feed. In feed-time, they ge- 
nerally fell for 3 s. or 4 s. a boll more than other oats, and 
there is ufually a conliderable demand for them at that 
feafon. Of late years the quality, both of lheep, black 
cattle, and horfes, has been greatly improved, and their 
numbers increafed, owing to the improvements that have 
been made in hufbandry ; and if the farmers continue 
in the fame fpirit of improving their farms, which I hope 
they will, there is not the leall doubt but their black cattle, 
horfes, and lheep, will Hill improve, both in quality and 
number. — The valued rent of the parilh is L. 5948 : 1 3 : 1 1 ^ 
Scots. There are about 40 proprietors in it, 3 of whom 
jure freeholders ; the others are all feuers or portioners. 

Stipend, 



Statijlical Account 



Stipend, School, and Poor. — The ftipend is nz bolls, 
half oats, half barley, about L. 34 in money, and a glebe, 
about 8 Englifti acres. The manfe was built in 1724, and 

the church in 1736. The King is patron There are 2 

fchools. The parochial fchool is in the village of Earlftoun ; 
the falary L. 7 : 19 : 5 Sterling ; the mafter has alfo the 
intereft of 500 merks Scots, mortified for teaching the chil- 
dren of inrolled poor. The other fchool is in the village 
of Mellerftain ; the mafter of it hasL. 5 yearly falary, which 
is the intereft of L. 100 Sterling, mortified by the family 
of Mellerftain, for teaching a certain number of poor chil- 
dren. There is alfo a Sunday's fchool in each of thefe vil- 
lages, patronifed and fupported by the Honourable Mrs 
Baillie. — There are many poor people in this parifti. A- 
bout 30 are inrolled, who receive a weekly allowance, 
according to their neceftities. For this purpofe, a fum is 
raifed twice a-year, by affefTment on the heritors and te- 
nants. The fum levied thefe 2 years paft has been about 
L. 70 a-year. 

Mifcellaneous Obfer vatiom : — The famous Thornas the 
Rhymer, (whofe real name and title was Sir Thomas Ler- 
mont), was a native of this parilh. He lived at the weft 
end of Earlftoun, where part of his houfe is ftill ftanding, 
called Rhymer's Tower. And there is a ftone built in the 
fore wall of the church, with this infcription on it, ' Auld 
1 Rhymer's race, lies in this place.' He lived in the 13th 
century, and was co- temporary with one of the Earls of 
March, who refided here then. 

There are 2 fairs held at Earlftoun. One on the 29th 
of June, for ftieep, black cattle, and horfes. It is reckoned 
the fecond beft fair in the fouth of Scotland, both for ftieep 
and black cattle. — The other fair is held on the third Thurf- 
day of October. It is only for black cattle and horfes. 

There

There is often a good fliow of black cattle in it, but no- 
thing like what is in the June fair. There are 4 public 
hoiues in the pariQi. But on the fairs, almoft every low 
houfe is a public one. 

One great difadvantage under which this parifli labours, 
is the want of fuel. The common people burn turf and 
peat. Thofe in the neighbourhood of Mellerftain are con- 
veniently fituated for fire-wood, which they get at a very 
moderate rate. The better fort of feuers and farmers burn 
coal, which is ufually from the neighbourhood of Dalkeith, 
a carriage of about 24 or 25 miles, which neceffarily makes 
the price of coals fo high, that the poor cannot purchafe 
them. Lime is alfo carried about 22 miles, from which it 
is likewife very high priced.

By the Rev. Mr James Beatson.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Air, ifc. 

THE parifli of Kingfbarns originally belonged to Crail, 
till 163 1, when it became a feparate cure. I have 
not been able to obtain any decifive information as to the 
origin of the name. The tradition is, that King John ufed 
frequently to live in a large building called the Caftle, 
placed on a fmall eminence above the beach, and at a quar- 
ter of a mile's diftance, (where the village is now built), 
had his ftore-houfes for grain. The remains of the caftle 
were taken down feveral years ago, and the ftones were of 
an immenfe fize. The parifli is in the prefbytery of St 
Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. It lies about 6 Englifh 
miles E. of St Andrew's, and is nearly fquare, being fully 
4 Englifli miles each way. It is bounded on the N. by St 
Andrew's parifh ; on the W. by Deninno ; and on the S. 
and E. by Crail. The foil upon the coaft is light and 
fandy, but now, from proper culture, it bears the fame 
grain with the higher grounds, and of equal quality ; al- 
though the higher grounds are in general deep, ftrong, black

clay. Being fo near the fea-coaft, it is natural to imagine 
the air is pure, and upon the whole healthy; though I 
have often thought the water which comes from the higher 
grounds, and ftagnates in the village, occafions nervous fe- 
vers, efpecially among young people, and makes epidemi- 
cal diftempers to rage feverely among us. This eafily might 
be prevented, as there is a beautiful and gradual defcent 
from the fummit of the higher grounds to the fea-lhore, 
and conduits for the water, at little expence, could be 
made. The only fpring worthy of notice, is a fteel mine- 
ral, which, about 30 or 40 years ago, was reforted to by 
many diftreffed with various complaints. Its tafte and 
flxength are the fame with the Peterhead water, fo juftly 
famed, but the fpring much greater ; fo that, at one period, 
what flowed from it, afforded a fufficient quantity of water 
for driving a meal-mill. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 871. From the laft Itate of the rolls, the 
numbers amounted to 807, of whom 467 relide in the vil- 
lage, and the remaining 340 inhabit the country part of 
the parilh. For 30 years back, the annual averages have 
been 16 deaths, 22 baptifms, and 6 marriages. There are 
about 24 extenfive farmers, whofe families amount to 192 
fouls. There are only 1 1 Seceders. 

Wages, Manufaclures, Agriculture, ifc. — Male fervants 
wages, able to hold a plough, are not under L. 5, 10 s. or 
L. 6, 6 s.; the overfeer is allowed from L. 10 to L. 12 a- 
year. Maid fervants wages are from L. 2 to L 2, 10 s. or 
L. 3. The wages given to labourers hired by the day, in 
fummer, are lod. or is.; in winter 8 d. — The Ofnaburgh 
meeting, and fhirting, is the manufacture carried on in the 
village, which is moftly bought by the Dundee merchants.

The number of weavers is from 20 to 30 ; and thefe are, 
the people, at certain feafons of the year, who are alfo em- 
ployed in the different frfhings. They hare greatly the ad- 
vantage over the fifhers in the coaft towns to the weftward, 
who, as they are not bred to bufinefs, confequently in 
ftormy weather, not only are they idle, but half ftarved, 
while the people here are occupied at their looms, and can 
earn wages fufficient to maintain their familes. — The people 
in general are induftrious, much difpofed to humane gene- 
rous a&amp;ions, and are well contented with the lot afligned 
them by Almighty God. The feafaring is preferred to 
the military life ; and there is feldom a feafon but fome of 
the young men are employed in the Greenland whale- 
fifliing. — The cattle annually reared will amount to 480 ; 
5 or 6 yoke of thefe were conftantly employed in agricul- 
ture by each farmer fome years ago, but horfes are now 
more generally ufed. At 3 years old, thefe cattle are put 
upon turnips, and fattened for the butcher ; the price they 
bring varies according to their fize, from L. 11 to L. 12 
or L. 14 each. There is no feparate map of the parifh, 
but multiplying the number of ploughs, which are 50 by 
50, the arable acres accurately may be afcertained ; 16 of 
thefe plough-gates furround the village, and each of them 
pay an annual feu of 9 bolls wheat, 11 bolls of bear, and 
8 s. 4 d. The bell arable land is let from L. 1, 15 s. to 
L. 2, 2 s. the acre, and the inferior from 15 s. to L. 1. 
The valued rent of the parifh is L. 63$$ : 6 : 8 Scots. 

'- ■bend, Poor, 1$c. — The ftipend, including L. 5 allowed 
for glebe and foggage, amounts to about L. 85 yearly. 
The manfe was rebuilt about 28 years ago, and fince that 
time, has been once and again repaired. The Earl of Craw- 
ford is patron. — The average number of poor who receive 
'weekly from the fefiion is 12 ; befides thefe, many .indi-

gent families receive occafionally ; and the annual fum ex- 
pended for their relief will amount to L. 22, fome years 
L. 27 Sterling. Thefe weekly poor are all maintained in 
their own houfes, and are not allowed to beg from door to 
door. The kirk-feffion is extremely attentive to give 
them relief, according to their neceflities. They provide 
medical aid for them when fick, and pay the fchoolmafter 
for teaching their children reading, writing, and the com- 
mon rules of arithmetic. Befides thefe advantages, their 
children have an opportunity of attending the Sunday's 
fchool, (eftablifhed about 2 years ago), where the young 
ones are inftrucled in the principles of the Chriftian faith, 
and are taught to read and write. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — Some years ago vaft quan- 
tities of haddocks were caught, and fold at moderate prices ; 
but few have appeared for thefe 3 years. Still a few large 
and fmall cod, Ikait and ling, are got, but not in plenty. 
At certain feafons the lobiter-fifhing is worthy of attention, 
and thefe all go to the London market. The poor fufFer 
much from the want of herring, as they were the chief 
part of their winter's provifion. Early in fpring and au- 
tumn are the ieafons when the herring appear ; but fuch 
as are caught are bought at exorbitant prices by merchants, 
who cure them, and fend them up the Mediterranean. 
— There is no account of any battle or fea engagements. 
Upon the more, graves are found lined with ftones, af- 
ter the fame conftruction they are met with in many places 
of Scotland, and fuppofed to be Danifli.— The only remark- 
able wreck upon this coaft happened in Oftober 1761. 
After a fevere ftorm from N. E. a three malted veffel, Danilh 
built, was driven afliore, and foon went to pieces ; not a

NUMBER XXXV. 

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12060976">KELLS</name>, 
(COUNTY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Gillespie.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, Is'c. 

•"T^HE name is Gaelic, and is probably expreffive of the 
fituation, which is the higheft in this part of the 
country. The parifh lies in the ftewarty and prefbytery 
of Kirkcudbright, and Synod of Galloway. It is nearly 
in the form of an Ifofceles triangle, almoft furrounded with 
the rivers Ken and Dee. The Ken runs from N. to S. 
14 miles along the eaft fide of it. The Dee rifes at the 
N. W. end, and runs along the W. and S. till it meets the 
Ken. Its length is about 15 miles-, its greateft breadth, 
at the N. end, 6 miles. It continues nearly of this breadth 
for 6 miles S. ; then gradually diminiihes to 5, 4, 3, 2, I 
miles, till it ends in a point at the junction of the two ri- 
vers Ken and Dee. It is bounded on the E. by the pa- 
rimes of Parton, Balmaclellan, and Dairy ; on the S. by 
Balmaghie ; on the W. by Girthon and Minnigaff; on »-he 
N. by Carfphairn. The air is healthful. The face of the 
country is hilly and unequal. There are large rocky hills 
on the fouth end, covered moftly with heath ; ftill higher 

hills 



Statijlical Account 



hills on the N. W. covered with grafs ; a great number of 
leffer rocky hills in the interior part of it, interfperfed with 
large flats of mofs, all covered with heath ; here and there 
is a large fpot of meadow and arable land. The foil on the 
S. W. and N. is fhallow, rocky, and barren, fit only for 
fheep-walks. Along the burns and rivulets, are fpots of 
meadow and arable land. On the eaft fide, along the Ken, 
and for a mile, and fometimes more, on both fides of it, 
the land is moftly arable, and is either flat or Hoping to- 
wards the river. The flats are of a deep rich clay ; the 
Hoping and higher land, of a thin, dry, and kindly foil, 
and improved with dung, the only manure the country 
affords, yields good crops. Some of it of late has been 
improved with lime and marl, and fully repaid the expence. 
The flat land at the head of Loch Ken, confifting of 200 
acres, is perhaps one of the richer! fpots in Scotland. It is 
of a deep clayifh foil, enriched by the overflowing of Loch 
Ken, which covers it feveral times during winter and fpring, 
and, like the Nile, leaves behind it the falts, oils, and fat 
earths, carried down by the Ken ; fo that many acres pro- 
duce 300 ftone of natural hay, and the arable is fertile in 
proportion. Some of it has been cropped 25 timeo fuccef-- 
lively, without any manure, but what it receives from the 
inundation of Loch Ken. In great falls of rain, the rivers 
Dee and Ken rife near 7 feet perpendicular, by which large 
tracks of meadow and low land are laid under water. When 
thefe happen in hay time, or in harveft, they greatly da- 
mage, and often carry away large quantities of hay and 
corn. They come fo fuddenly, that there is no guarding 
againft them. But if in winter, which is ofteneft the cafe, 
they rather better the land.. 

Lafyes, Ifc. — There are 6 lochs, befides Loch Ken, 3 of 
which, -on the north end of the parifli, are ftored with 

trout,;. 



of Kelts. 



261 



irout ; the other 3, on the fouth end, near Loch Ken, ftored 
■with pike. Loch Ken is 5 miles long, and from $ to | of 
a mile broad. Loch Ken and Loch Dee are but one loch, con- 
tinued 10 miles long. They abound with pike, trout, perch, 
eel, and falmon. The pike grow to a very large fize. The 
head of one, caught with the rod, is preferved at Kenmore 
Caftle, which weighed 57 lb. Some are frequently caught 
from 20 lb. to 30 lb. ; trout and perch, from 1 lb. to 6 lb. ; 
and feveral trouts have been taken, weighing 8 lb. They 
are in the greateft perfection in May, June, and July. Few 
are expofed to fale. Loch Ken and Loch Dee are navi- 
gable. Boats of confiderable burden are frequently em- 
ployed in bringing up marl from the Carling-work Loch, 
and carrying down fir, afh, and oak-wood, with which 
this hilly country abounds. There is a falmon-fifhing on 
the Dee. At its firfi erection, about 30 years ago, it was 
let at about L. 10. It has never been very productive. 
There is another fifhing in this pariih, claimed as no man's 
property, that cannot be eafily eftimated. I mean a pearl 
fiJbery. In dry fummers, great number of pearls are ^ 
fifhed here ; fome of great fize, and fine water, and are 
fold from is. to L. r, 1 s. according to their fize and 
beauty. 

Hills. — There is on the fouth end of this parifh, a range 
of high hills, lying from N. W. to S. E. 5 miles in length, 
and upwards of 3 miles over, of one continued folid mafs 
of granite, almofl naked, only here and there fome fpots 
of heath. The floping fides of thefe hills, and the flats 
near them, for a mile S. W. are covered with large manes 
of loofe rock, all granite •, fo thick, that you may almoft 
walk over them ; and fo big, that many of them are 10 
tons weight. Thefe are not broken pieces of rock, fallen 
from the hills, for the hills are entire •, and if they were, 
could never have come to their prefent fituation. The 

number,

t 

number, fize, and fituation of thefe loofe rocks, are a great 
natural curiofity. At the end of thefe hills, in the fame 
direftion, is another rocky hill, containing great quantities 
of iron-ftone ; but, as fuel is fcarce, and coal diftant, it 
cannot he turned to any advantage. Thefe hills are the 
natural foil for goats. On the weft fide, and north end of 
the parifh, the hills are ftill higher, covered with gnifs, 
but of a bad quality. Thefe hills are called the Kells 
Range, and are feen at 40 miles diftance ; fo high, that 
there is fnow upon them for 8, and fometimes 9 months in 
the year. They are the very ridge or higheit land in Gal- 
loway, and the middle between the two feas on the W. 
and S. E. As, a proof of this, the rivers Ken and Dee, 
which rife on the eaft fide, run to the S. E. fea at Kirk- 
cudbright ; and the Don, which rifes on the N. W. fide 
of thefe, runs to the fea near Ayr. Thefe are a part of a 
range of high hills, running from W. to E. by Leadhills, 
the whole breadth of Scotland. There is a great natural 
curiofity to be feen on the fide of one of thefe hills. The 
Rocking Stone*, of 8 or 10 tons weight, fo nicely balanced 
on 2 or 3 points or excrefcences, that it moves from one to 
the other, by the preffure of the finger. Captain Groffe, 
laft harveft, fent and took a drawing of it •, and fome anti- 
quaries think it has been a Druidical place of worfhip. It 
fhould feem that the ftone was formed by nature, juft as 
we fee it ; and lying on a ftrata of mofs, a or 3 inches deep, 
the rains have in time waflied away this mofs or earth, and 
left the ftone refting on thefe points. 

Miner als.-r-T£\\ere is a flate quarry in the north end of 
this pariftx, formerly wrought, but, by unlkilful manage- 
ment, has fallen into difrepute. If funk deeper, and lkil- 
fully wrought, it might be valuable, and fuperfede the ufe 
of Engliih flate, brought hither at a great expence. The

lead mine on Sir William Miller'^eftate, has never been 
wrought to any extent. Within half a mile of it, on the 
fame eftate, is the appearance of a copper mine. Some 
miners, about 12 years ago, palling from Leadhills to Min- 
nigaff, obferved it, and wrought fome days for a trial ; and 
finding the appearance promifing, wiflied to take a tack of 
it ; but difagreeing with the landlord about the terms, it 
has been negle&amp;ed ever fince. Near the Kenmore, 2 miles 
further S. there is an appearance of lead. Pieces of the 
ore have been dug up almoft on the furface. Both thefe 
are probably a part of the fame ftrata of lead, wrought 
with fo much advantage at MinnigafF, 18 miles S. W. of 
this, and might perhaps be wrought with equal profit here. 

Animals. — Foxes, hares, wild cats and badgers, find ex- 
cellent cover in our woods ; otters in the banks of our ri- 
vers ; of thofe lalt, our fportfmen, in time of froit, deftroy 
great numbers. There is plenty of black and red game 
in our moors. Partridges are not fo numerous as. in more 
corn countries. Tarmagants are on our high hills. Plover 
and fnipe in low and marfhy lands. Eagles of a large 
fize build on the tops of precipices and high rocks. One 
killed lately, meafured from the tips of the wings 7 feet. 
Swallows and cuckoos make their appearance about the 
beginning of April j wood-cocks in the latter end of har- 
veft, when the weather begins to be cold. In a hard win- 
ter, flocks of geefe and fwans come to Loch Ken ; wild 
ducks and teals are there in great abundance at all fea- 
fons. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 784. For 10 years paft, the average has 
been, marriages 6 ; births 13. Inhabited houfes are at 
prefent 180; 73 of which are in the town of New Gal.

loway. The number of fouls at prefent is 869 ; males 
438 v females 431. Nine wrights, 3 fmiths, 7 tailors, 13 
weavers, 7 ftioemakers, 4 mafons, 2 millers, 2 dyers, a 
tanners ; apprentices 7. Male labouring fervants 36, fe- 
male 47 ; ftudents at colleges 5. There is x furgeon, for- 
merly 2. The people are moftly of the Eftablifhed Church, 
there being only 2 Seceders. The number of inhabitants 
has greatly decreafed fince 1764, occafioned partly by the 
too common practice of uniting feveral farms into one ; 
partly to the almoft total difufe of cottagers and fubtenants ; 
partly to the practice of feuing out lands, and building 
villages on the high roads ; and partly to the high rent of 
fmall poffefiions, which compel the poorer fort to retire to 
thefe villages. The proportion between the annual births 
and whole population is as 1 to 67 nearly. Between the 
annual marriages and the whole population, as 1 to 145 
nearly. Some families emigrated to America immediately 
before the rebellion of the colonies. Some young people, 
both males and females, leave the parifti as fervants. Several 
young men of fpirit go to the Weft Indies as planters and 
merchants. Some go to England to pufh their fortunes, 
as pedlars, and, when fober and induftrious, commonly re- 
turn, after 10 or 12 years, with L. 80c or L. 900, or 
L. 1000. Several return from the Weft Indies, after 16 
or 1 7 years, with genteel fortunes ; and fome young men 
choofe a fea-faring life. 

Agriculture, Wc. — There are between 280 and 290 acres 
annually employed in railing oats ; 15 or 16 in bear and 
rye ; between 70 and 80 in potatoes ; no wheat ; cabbage, 
turnip, and other roots are only raifed in gardens ; little 
flax or hemp. Potatoes make a principal article of the 
food of the lower clafles of people. Oats are fown from 
the middle of March to the middle of April ; reaped from 

the 



of Kelh. 



the 20th of Auguft to the middle of Oftober. Potatoes 
planted in March, ready for digging about Lammas. Crops 
earlier near New Galloway, and along the Ken, than on 
the moorifh and wefterly part of the parifh, by feveral 
weeks, and better filled. Many farms are inclofed ; but 
the great extent and barrennefs of others, difcourage the 
attempt. There are 32 farmers in the parifh, each of 
whom have one or more ploughs. Several labouring men 
have crofts and fmall poffeflions, and each have a plough. 
The old Scots plough, drawn by 4 horfes abreaft, is laid 
afide, and a lighter one adopted. They break up their 
ley-ground now with 3 horfes inftead of 4, and fometimes 
with 2, and 1 man fervant, and in the following crops with 
2 horfes. The ploughs in the parim are 55; carts 47; 
carriages 2 ; no waggons. — The parim needs a great deal 
of more meal, barley and malt than it produceth. There 
are nearly 17,400 fheep ; 1550 black cattle ; 150 horfes ; 
200 goats. The farmers depend on the fale of their black 
cattle, fheep and wool, for the means of paying their rent, 
and fupplying their families with what other articles of 
provifion and clothing they may need. A fmall quantity 
of cheefe is exported. The butter is all employed in 
fmearing fheep, and not fufficient for that purpofe. There 
is fome imported from the weft country, or from 
England. — The land-rent is nearly L. 3000 Sterling. The 
rent of good arable and meadow ground, is from 12 s. to 
16 s. the acre; of the beft meadow land, 30 s. No arti- 
ficial grafs was fown here till within thefe 10 years; at 
prefent there may be 20 acres. It cannot be raifed but by 
lime or marl, and the diftance of each is fo great, as dif- 
courages the farmers ; the lime 20, and the marl 14 miles 
diftant. The prefent minifter was the firft who brought 
marl to the Glenkens ; the projeft was laughed at, as too 
cxpenfive ; but on feeing the rich crops it produced, amply

rewarding the labour and expence, his example was foon 
followed ; and now, both fides of the Ken are enriched 
by it ; and befides, the grain arifing from this mode of 
Cultivation, he has the fatisfa&amp;ion of having infpired his 
people with a fpirit of induftry ; and now, when marl 
cannot be conveniently got, they have recourfe to lime, 
and find that it pays them very well. There is no mar] | 
in Galloway beyond 10 miles from the fea. Here we are 
24 miles diflant. The cultivation by marl is principally 
owing to the exertions of Mr Gordon of Greenlaw, a very 
public fpirited gentleman, the fheriff of the county, who 1 
not . only encouraged the draining of the Carlingwork 
Loch, where there are immenfe beds of fhell-marl, but at his . 
own expence made a canal 3 miles in length, to join Loch 1 
Dee, and conftru&amp;ed a number of flat bottomed boats of : 
different dimenfions, to carry the marl from the Carling- 
work Loch up the Dee and Ken to this place ; fome of ; 
which carry 20 double cart load, at 20 feet fquare to the • 
cart load, or 400 folid feet of marl. — There are upwards 
of 500 acres of natural wood in different fpots in this pa- 
rifh, coniifting moflJy of oak, afh, birch, alder, hazel. . 
Thefe woods have been moftly cut within thefe 25 
years, and the young plants are in a thriving flate. . 
Much old fir is in the parifh. Many acres of young fir • 
were lately planted. About 80 acres in lochs, befides 
Loch Ken. There has been a large forefl in the north end 
of this parifh ; two large farms ftill retain the name of : 
Upper and Nether Foreft, and a large flat of meadow ■ 
called the King's Holm. This foreft has been anciently 
flocked with deer ; feveral of them were running wild on 
our moors about 20 years ago. Some old people remem- ■ 
ber to have feen near 20 of them. Since that time, their 
number has gradually decreafed ; the laft of them was 
killed 7 or 8 years ago. Deer were plenty on the hills 

and 



of Kells.

and moors on the fouth end of this parifh, about 60 years 
ago, and were claimed as the property of Lord Kenmore \ 
at prefent they are all deftroyed. 

Advantages and Dijadvantages. — The peculiar advantages 
of this parifh are thefe : The particular richnefs of the tafte 
and flavour of the mutton fed on our high hills, above that 
fed on the lower and richer grounds ; a town, with a con- 
ftant weekly market; a port- office ; the high road from 
Edinburgh to Portpatrick, and from Glafgow to Kirkcud- 
bright paffing through it, and eroding one another at New 
Galloway. — The peculiar difadvantages of it are, the high 
fituation of the ground, rendering the high hills cold and 
ftormy, and dangerous to fheep ; the bad roads through the 
interior parts of it ; the pernicious quality of a fpecies of 
grafs to the health of the fheep in 2 or 3 farms on the fide 
of the Dee, infecting them with a difeafe called the Van- 
quifh, i. e. it weakens, waftes, and would at laft kill them, 
Unlefs removed to another farm ; but are no fooner removed 
than they recover their health, and gradually their ftrength 
and fatnefs. This difeafe is of a difFerent nature from the rot ; 
for rotten fheep put upon thefe farms (I am told) often re- 
cover. — The belt means of meliorating the condition of the 
people of this parifh, would be, ift, Encouraging and pro- 
moting a woollen manufactory at New Galloway ; idly, Im- 
proving the breed of fheep, arid quality of the wool. This 
laft has already been attempted, and in fome meafure ef- 
fected, by the premium given by the Society for the En- 
couragement of Fifhing and Manufactures, and, if conti- 
nued, will ftill more promote this good purpofe. 3dly, Ma- 
king a canal from the fea by the Carlingwork Loch, to 
join Loch Dee, a fcheme fome years ago projected, the

this place, for importing freeftone, lime, &amp;c. for the pur- 
pofe of building, and of meliorating the land. 4 thly, By- 
making or mending that part of the road leading from 
Portpatrick to Edinburgh, by New Galloway from Min- 
nigaff to Monnihive, and building bridges over the Ken 
efpecially one at New Galloway, which is often impaffable 
by fords or ferry-boats, and alfo by making or mending 
the road leading from New Galloway, crofs the moors by 
Shawhead to Dumfries. This would not only be a great 
advantage to New Galloway, but to the country in gene- 
ral ; for as this road from Portpatrick to Edinburgh by 
New Galloway is 15 miles nearer than by Carlingwork and' 
Dumfries, and the road from Portpatrick to Dumfries 10 
miles nearer by New Galloway than by the Carlingwork, 
all travellers from Ireland and the fliire of Galloway tra- 
velling to Edinburgh, Dumfries and England, and all the 
Irifli cattle exported to England, which amount to many 
thoufands yearly, would pafs this way, and alfo all travel- 
lers from Edinburgh to Ireland, or fliire of Galloway.

The glebe is worth L. 7. The King is patron. The church

ritors is io, 5 of whom refide. — There is a public fchool at 
New Galloway in this parifli. The fchool-houfe was re- 
built laft year, and rendered more commodious ; the year-

of the parifli that is within 2 or three miles of it. Such as 
are farther diftant, hire young lads into their families, that 
have been bred at the public fchool, to teach their children 
Englifli, and the firft principles of writing and arithmetic, 
which they can do for L. 3 or L. 4 a-year. When 4 or 5 
families lie contiguous to one another, they hire a teacher 
among them, for which they pay from L. 5 to L.6, with 
victuals •, and by this means all the children in the parifli 
are taught to read and write. — At an average for the laft 
12 years, the number of poor, quarterly fupplied with alms, 
is 12 \ average of collections for that time, L. 12, 10 s. ; 
intereft of a fund received in legacies, and otherwife, L. 8,

poor. 

Prices, Wages, \£c. — In 1 765, beef was from 3 s. to 4 s, 
mutton from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. 6 d. the Englifli ftone, a good 
lamb 3 s. a dozen of eggs 1 d. a hen 4 d. a duck 5 d. &amp;c. 
At prefent (1791) the prices are nearly doubled. — The 
wages of a day-labourer are from 6 d. to 8 d. and victuals ; 
without victuals, from 1 s. to 1 s. 2 d. The annual wages 
of a labouring man fervant are from L. 5 to L. 7 ; of a maid 
fervant, from L. 3 to L. 4. A healthy and induflrious man 
is able to maintain and bring up a family. — The fuel com- 
monly made ufe of is peat \ fcarce at New Galloway and 
neighbourhood. The mofs is 3 miles diftant, inacceflible 
to carts, by reafon of the badnels of the roads ; carried 
home in corn-facks, on horfes backs, which, confidering 
the diftance, greatly increafe the expence, and hinder the 
poorer fort, who have not horfes of their own, from get- 
ting home a fufficient quantity ; they have recourfe to 
broom, furze, and other brufli-wood, to fupply the defi- 
ciency. In all other parts of the parifli peat is plenty, 
*f eafy accels, and of good quality. Every family cut; 

their 



Stati/iical Account 



their own peat, and though brought home on horfes backs; 
as the diftance is fhort, have fufficient fuel at a very trifling 
expence. Much coal is ufed by the better fort, brought in 
carts from Dalmellington, near 20 miles diftant. Though 
New Galloway is finely fituated for a woollen manufa&amp;ure, 
the difficulty of finding fuel has hitherto difcouraged the 
manufacturer from fixing there, and hindered both the 
increafe and improvement of the burgh. But now when 
roads are opening up, and mofles rendered acceffible to 
carts, both the expence and difficulty will be leflened ; for 
a cart with 1 horfe will carry as many as 7 horfes on their 
backs. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The people are of the com- 
mon fize, between 5 feet 7 inches, and 6 feet, rather ftronger 
made, and of a more rofy and better complexion than thofe 
in the low country ; owing, perhaps, to their not being 
accuftomed to fuch hard labour, to their living better, and 
eating more animal food. There is no part of Scotland 
where the poor live better, or eat fo much animal food, 
as in this moor country. — There are no public manufac- 
tures. The people in general are frugal and induftrious, 
and manufacture moft of the woollen and linen cloth ufed 
by them. They are fond of mufic, dancing, and other fo- 
cial amufements. — A part of the landed property has been 
of late years exchanged, owing partly to the failure of the 
Douglas and Heron Bank, which has much diftrefTed this 
part of the country, and partly to other caufes. It fold at 
between 24 and 30 years purchafe. — 'Since 1780, when the 
a£ of Parliament was obtained for converfion of the ftatute- 
labour, high-roads have been made and repaired by aflefT- 
ments on the parifh, not exceeding L. 1 the L. 100 of valu- 
ation. Yet this is fo inadequate to the making and repair- 
ing extenfive roads, that many of them are flail in bad or- 
der 



of Kells. 



der. There are eleven ftone bridges, and which are 
kept in good repair. One of them, of two arches, ovejr 
the large burn of Paharrow, is the private donation of one 
Quintin Maclurg, a tailor, who lived in that neighbour- 
hood about 60 years ago. Being often in fear and danger 
of his life, in palling and repaffing this burn, to ferve his 
cuftomen, he refolved that no one after him mould be in 
fuch jeopardy again, and erected this bridge out of the earn- 
ings of his trade, which was never more than 4 d. a-day. 
His name ftill remains engraven on a large ftone on the top 
of the bridge, as a teftimony of his public fpirit. — There 
are only 2 inns in New Galloway, where entertainment can 
be had for men and horfes. There are 7 fmaller ale-houfes 
in the town, and 3 in the country parilh ; but as thefe can- 
not afford to pay the licence, they fell only profeffedly in 
time of fairs. Formerly there were double that number ; 
but of late years, the law has been fo rigoroufly executed, 
and heavy fines impofed on fuch as fell without licence, 
that many of them have given up felling ; and happy for 
the country that it is fo, as cheap whiiky has now found 
its way here. — Within thefe 10 years, 7 houfes have been 
built and rebuilt in the town of New Galloway, 3 of which 
are 2 ftories high ; befides 1 built for a tannery, lately fet 
up there, and now carried on to a great extent. In the 
country part of the parifh there are 4 houfes built, and 3 re- 
built, 4 of which are 2 ftories high, and elegantly fitted out. 
A better tafte for neatnefs and elegance is getting into this 
country, and which always bears fome proportion to the fpi- 
rit of induftry. Gentlemen are not only building more ele- 
gant houfes for themfelves, but are alfo giving better and 
more convenient houfes to their tenants. So many new 
houfes are no proof of the increafe of population ; on the 
contrary, the farmers meet with greater encouragement 
from the landlords, in accumulating feveral farms into one;

fo that more houfes are gone to ruin, for want of bhaBii 

tants, than have been built and rebuilt The prefent cu- 

ftom of employing hired fervants, who live in the family, 
inftead of cottagers, has its advantages and difadvantages! 
The advantages feem to be thefe : ift, They are more un- 
der the mafter's eye, and more under his command day and 
night, than the cottagers, who often live at a diftance, and 
think themfelves obliged to work only ftated hours : 2dly, 
An induftrious tenant can often make more of the benefit 
commonly given to cottagers, efpecially when given in land, 
or in grafs to cows and iheep, which was formerly the cafe, 
than will pay the wages of a hired fervant. — The difadvan- 
tages feem to be, ift, The decreafe of population ; for ex- 
ample, there is 1 tenant in this parifli that rents L. 300 a- 
year, and poffefles 5 different farms, in which, about 10 
years ago, were 7 tenants and 7 cottagers, which make 14 
families ; but now there are only 10 families in thefe farms, 
which is a decreafe of 4 families, calculating thefe at 4 j, 
which I find is the calculation neareft to the truth, in the 
country part of this parifli, is 17 perfons fewer than for- 
merly, adly, The increafe of the price of labour. Cot- 
tagers were formerly nurferies for breeding up fervants, and 
furniflied numbers fufficient for fiipplying the wants of the 
parifh, and fo kept down the price of labour ; but now the 
difufe of them leffens the number of labouring fervants, 
the wages of whom rife or fall in proportion to their num- 
bers ; and being fcarce for want of proper nurferies for 
them, the price of labour is greatly increafed, and muft in- 
creafe, as the fpirit of induftry increafes, and hands are 
wanted ; fo that the difufe of cottagers is, amongft many 
others, one great caufe of the increafe of the price of la- 
bour. 3dly, This difufe, and the high rent of fmall 
poffeffions, difcourage matrimony in young people who 
are fervants. — New Galloway is a royal burgh. It has 

four 



of Kells. 



four fairs in the year. Here is an excellent meal-market ; 
for as meal and barley are almoft always 2 d. and moftly 3 d. 
the (tone cheaper here than at Dalmellenton and mire of Ayr, 
great quantities are purchafed at New Galloway, and car- 
ried thither, where they meet with a ready market. — The 
Park of Glenlee, where there, is a houfe elegantly fitted up 
by the late Lord Prefident, Sir Thomas Miller, is one 
of the fined fituations in this hilly country. It is on 
the banks of the river Ken, at the head of a beautiful 
holm.furrounded with hills, finely Ikirted with natural wood* 
and flickered with clumps of fir, and fine old oak. Two 
beautiful cafcades, or falls of water, are near it. — There is 
ftill to be feen the veftige of a road from the King's Holm 
to the caftle of Dindcuck, 3 miles diftant. But who this 
king was, tradition itfelf does not fay. This old caftle or 
abbey, or whatever it was, is now in ruins, and has all the 
marks of having been a ftrong place. Some arched cel- 
lars, and fome pieces of the mouldered walls, are all that re- 
main of a large building.

<p>Situation, Soil, Air, \$c. 

r t "'HE parifh is fituated in the prefbytery of Paifley, and 
Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. It is about 6 miles 
fquare, bounded on the W. by the parifties of Port-Glaf- 
gow, Greenock, Innerkip and Largo, on the E. by Kilallan 
and Houfton, on the S. by Kilbarchan and Lochwhinoch, 
and on the N. by Erlkine and the river Clyde. The ap- 
pearance of the country is more moorifli than toward the ealt 
of it, abounding much with rocks •, but not mountainous, 
though there are frequent gentle rifings on the furface. The 
foil is fhallow, and in a moift feafon is very prolific in grafs 
and corn. Little barley or bear is raifed, though I con- 
ceive, if the ground was properly prepared, it would pro- 
duce this grain with equal fuccefs. The air in general is 
moift, and there are frequent heavy rains from the weftern 
fhores, often accompanied with high winds. The inhabi- 
tants are generally healthy. The moft frequent difeafes are- 
fevers, confumptions and rheumatifms, occalioned, perhaps, 

among

among the common people, from frequent wetnefs and damp 
cottages. The waters of Grief? and Duchal run through the 
parifh from the W. abounding with fine trouts ; in the 
fpawning feafon falmon come from the Clyde, and leave im- 
menfe quantities of fry, which remain till April, and then 
return to Clyde ; by cutting a fin as a mark, feveral have 
been taken next feafon to the fize of 18 and 20 inches, fo 
quick is their growth in fait water. There is alfo fine 
parr. The Clyde produces kelp on the north fide of the 
parifh, but it is not much ufed for manure. 

Population.— At the time of Dr Webfler's report the 
numbers were 1495. By a late enumeration there were 951 
perfons, of whom were 443 males ; 508 females.

Agriculture, ifc.~ Planting is fcarce, excepting about 
Finlayfton, Duchal, Carncuran and Craigbate, where the 
lime-tree abounds, and the foil is favourable for its growth • 
there is alfo the elm, oak, plane and fir, and at Duchal 
beech is in confiderable perfection. Farms are generally 1 
inclofed. Farmers are fmall and numerous. For the 1 
moft part the farms rent from L. 20 to L. 60 Sterling 
yearly, arable land lets at an average from 15 s. to 20 s, 
the acre ; meadow-ground from 30 s. to 45 s. oats (which 1 
is the prevailing crop) are generally fown in the endi 
of March and beginning of April, and the reaping begins 
for the moft part in September. Natural grafs abounds ; , 
the artificial is little cultivated, though the lime quar, . 
ry is only about 3 miles diftant. The farmer imagines him- • 
felf more profited by collecting earthen dunghills. Few r 
horfes are reared. The cows are generally of a fmall fize be- • 
tween the highland and Galloway breed, but are moftly • 
good milk cows. Sheep are rare. The ploughs are gene- • 
rally of the Scots form, and made very ftrong, as the ground i 
is ftony ; each farmer ufes only one, as the farms are fmall. 
The plough is generally drawn by 3 horfes, and 2 men are : 
employed. Much of the ground might be ploughed with 2) 
horfes and a ploughman accuftomed to drive by the rein, 
which is introduced of late with fuccefs. Each farmer has s 
generally a fingle cart. The farmer has a ready marketforeve- - 
ry article at Port Glafgow and Greenock, and a high price. 

Stipend, School, Poor, Is'c— The ftipend is L. 63 : 17: o£ 
money, with three chalders of meal, which may be rated 1 
at 16 s. the boll, amounting in all to about L. 102. The 
glebe of a fhallow foil, at ati average, may be valued at L. 8. 
The Earl of Glencairn is patron. The church was built a- 
bout the year 1560. The manfe was laft repaired in 1788. 
There are 17 heritors, 2 of whom refide at prefent.

with 1 s. for each proclamation, is his living j and at an ave- 
rage, may amount to L. 15 or thereby, by which he frugal- 
ly maintains a wife and 3 children at prefent. — The poor 
upon the roll at prefent are about 27, fupplied from the 
public collections at the church, amounting at an average to 
L. 5 Sterling each Sabbath, together with the intereft of fome 
fmall mortifications, amounting to about L. 49 Sterling 
yearly, which, with an annual contribution on the approach 
of the New Year, fupports the natives. 

Wages, Prices, ifc. — The wages of a day-labourer are is. 
4 d. the rent of cottages is from 15 s. to 30s . yearly. Peat is 
the general fuel with the common people, and with others coal 
is brought from Quarrelton or Comehill ; the former are fold

about 6 miles diftant; the latter 3 d. the hutch, 5 of which 
are# cart-load, and 3 miles diftant. A labourer employed 
in hufbandry, at an average, has about L. 4 the half year, 
which, together with the thrift of his wife, gains his family 
a decent livelihood, or through-bearing, as they term it.* Her 
work, is mod frequently fpinning to the manufacturers in and 
about Paifley, of lint given by them, or raifed in the 
place. A male fervant has, at an average, about L. 8 year-

diftance, and in this rainy climate, a fhort time is precious 
in that feafon. 

Mifcettaneous Ohfervations. — The people cultivate 'their 
farms, and follow no other employment, yet improvements 
arc not advanced to any confiderable length. They are as 
ceconomical as their neighbours, and frugal from their cir- 
cumftances. Drefs, cuftoms and manners, are confiderably 
improved within thefe 50 years ; but the people by no 
means border on luxury. — The roads are but indifferent. 
There are 13 bridges, generally built and kept up by the fa- 
mily of Porterfield, and are in good repair. There are 3 of 
a larger fize on the great road from Port-Glafgow to Glaf- 
gow. The great road from Glafgow to Greenock, runs 
through the north corner of the pariQi for abbut 2 miles, and 
there are no other turnpikes. There is no commutation, 
and the ftatute labour is indifferently performed. A toll- 
bar is fixed on the road between Port-Glafgow and Kilbar- 
chan, and it is in contemplation to make a turnpike, which 
will open a more contiguous line of communication between 

Ayr and the towns of Port Glafgow and Greenock. 

There are 6 ale-houfes in the village of Kilmalcolm, and 
3 about the centre of the parifh. There the country people 
meet to tranfaft their bufinefs, and fpend the focial hour. ] 
Their drink is generally fmall beer and whifky, the latter 
is too frequently attended with fatal confequences to the 
conftitution and morals 

There are 3 low hills (as they are termed by the people) 
in a direft line from W. to E. where tradition fays, the laws 
were adminiftered before Courts of Seffion were eftablifhed. 
There are the remains of the caflle of Duchal, the ancient 
feat of the family of Porterfield, very romantic in its fitu- 
ation, and ftrong in its construction. Part of it was demo- 

lifhed . 



of Kilmalcolm. 



iilhed by the family when they reared a fummer houfe, and 
in an upper apartment was found a great quantity of human 
bones. — There are in the parifti the 4 communion cups ufed 
by John Knox when he firft difpenfed the facrament in Scot- 
land. The cups were originally ufed for the purpofe of 
:andlefticks, and perhaps from the neceflity of the time con- 
verted to this pious purpofe. Their hollow bottom rever- 
ed forms the cup, and the middle, where the focket feemsto 
je fcrewed out, forms the foot. They are of the fineft fil- 
ler, and in modern times make a very ancient appearance, 
rhey are kept with great care by the family of Glencairn at 
^inlayfton, and the parifli is favoured with the ufe of them, 
n occafion of difpenfing the facrament. The people refpecr, 
hem much for their antiquity, as well as for the folemnity 
.trending them in former and latter times.

<p>Situation, Surface, Soil, l$c. 

THE parifh of Dreghorn, or rather the united parifhes 
of Dreghorn and Percietown, are fituated in the pref- 
bytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glafgow and Ayr. Thefe 
parifhes were united in the year 1668. Each of them had 
a glebe ; but the minifter pofleffes only the glebe of Dreg- 
horn. Thefe parifhes may be 9 Englifh miles in length, 
and at the broadeft part of them 3 'in breadth, though, in 
fome parts they are not one. They are bounded on the 
W. N. W. and N. by the water of Annock, which fepa- 
rates them from the parifhes of Irvine and Stewartown; 
and the water of Irvine feparates them from Dundonald on 
the S. They are bounded byKilmares on the S. E. and on 
the N. E. by Fenwick. The ground is a gradual afcent 
from the weft end of the parifh to the eaft. The foil in that 
part of it, which lies neareft to the fea, is either fandy or 
gravelifh. Above the village it is a fine loam, and the reft 
of it clay. The whole of the parifh is arable, except a few 
acres of marfhy ground, Which are ufed as meadow lands. 



of Drtghorn. 



281 



It is alfo moftly inclofed, and there are a variety of clumps 
of planting upon the eminences of fuch lands, as are the pro- 
perty of the Earl of Eglinton. There is alfo a number of 
verges of planting upon the eftates of the other heritors, all 
which have a very fine effect in beautifying the country. 

Agriculture. — The ufual crops are oats, bear, and rye- 
grafs. Befides thefe, there are fome fmall quantities of 
wheat raifed, and two farmers in the parilh have feveral 
times fown a few acres of turnip There is very little 
black victual fown. The method of culture which has been 
generally followed here for upwards of 30 years is the fol- 
lowing. Every farm is now divided into three parts, each 
of thefe is ploughed for 3 years in its turn, while the 
other 2 remain in grafs. Grafs-feeds are fown with the 
third year's crop, and the tenant is allowed to cut his hay 
field for one feafon, and fometimes for two. Mr Snodgrafs 
of Cuninghamhead has, for upwards of 12 years, differed 
from this mode of culture. He allows his tenants only to 
plough one-fourth of their farms for 3 years. By this me- 
thod each fourth remains 9 years in grafs, in place of 6, be- 
fore it is ploughed up. This he confiders as being attend- 
ed with two advantages to the tenant. It leffens the num- 
ber of his horfes upon the farm, while the fourth that is 
ploughed up, on account of its long reft, yields nearly as much 
grain as the third ufed to do. The pafture grounds are like- 
wife very much improved for the fame reafon. A further 
advantage fuppofed to arife from this is, that when once the 
lands are put in proper order, the tenant has it not in his 
power to fpoil them, if he was difpofed to do fo. This plan 
is confidered fo far preferable to the other, that in all the 
late leafes of the Earl of Eglinton's eftate in this parifh it 
is adopted, where the farm is of a certain extent, as it is alfo

by fome other gentlemen in the country. Mr Snodgrafs has 
made the following alteration upon his own plan. In any 
of the leafes he has lately given to his tenants, he reftri&amp;s 
them to plough one-fourth for 2 years only, while the other 
three-fourths remain in grafs for 6. This he looks upon as 
an improvement upon his former plan, as 3 fucceffive crops 
of oats are confidered to impoverifh a field very much, evea 
though it is in the higheft order when at firft broke up. 
There is a confiderable quantity of very fine cheefe made in 
the parilh. Some of the farmers keep from 12 to 20 milk 
cows. The average rent of lands in the parifh will be from 
a guinea to 22 s. the acre. There are a few fields in it 
rented fo high as 42 s. and 43 s. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 887. The number of fouls at prefent is 
about 830. Of thefe there are about 400 males, and 430 
females. There are 6 perfons above 80, 18 above 70, 85 '

inhabitants have decreafed confiderably within the laft 33 
years. This is owing to two or three fmall farms being 
thrown into one. Another caufe of their decreafe is, that no 
additional houfes have been built in the village ; fince I 
came to the parifh there are feveral houfes fallen down and 
have not been rebuilt. 

Stipend, School, Poor, ifc — The flipend paid is 91 bolls 
pecks of meal, 2 bolls bear, and L. 16: 13: 4 in money. 
The church was rebuilt in 1780; the manfe in 1789; the 
Earl of Eglinton is patron. — The fchoolmafter has ioomerks 
of falary. He has a fchool-houfe for teaching his fcholars, 
but none for himfelf to dwell in. The late fchoolmafter 
was an old man, and for many years had very few fcholars ; 
but there was a private teacher, who often had 40 01-50 fcho- 
lars. — Though we are peftered with ftrolling beggars, 
yet none of the poor in the parifh are allowed to go about. 
They are fupported not by an afleffment, but from the col- 
lections, and the intereft of the ftock, which has been occa- 
fionally faved from the collections, and other fmall cafual- 
ties. 

MifceUaneous Obf equations. — In the weft end of the parifh 
there is a colliery, yielding, according to the information I 
received from one of the proprietors, above 11,000 tuns 
yearly. The greateft part of thefe coals is exported to Ire- 
land from the port of Irvine. 

There is only one village in the parifh where the church 
is built. There are no manufactures carried on ; the houfes 
being very bad are low rented, which induces old or poor 
people to occupy them. The village is properly fitiiated 
for manufactures, as the fields around it abound with fprings 
of foft water. The Annock alfo runs very near it on the

north fide, and the water of Irvine at a very fmall diftance 
upon the fouth. There are a few weavers in the village, 
and alfo in other parts of the parifh, but thefe are employed 
in weaving fuch kinds of cloth as are ufed by the country 
people. The inhabitants both in the village and parifh are 
in general fober, attentive, and induftrious. There are at 
prefent 3 ale-houfes in the village, and one in another part of 
the parifh; but the bufinefs they have is very inconfiderable, 
the principal part of it arifing from travellers. There are 
20 heritors in the parifh, but the property of two thirds of 
them is not extenfive.</p>

NUMBER XXXVIII. 

PARISH of <name ref="NA">BOLTON</name>, 
(COUNTY OF HADDINGTON.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Hamilton,</head> 

<p>Situation and Surface. 

THE parifli of Bolton is in the preibytery of Hadding- 
ton, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. It is 
very irregular in its boundaries and its dimensions ; ex- 
tending from the N. E. corner to the S. W. near 6 miles ; 
and in breadth, at a medium, not above 1 mile and a 
quarter ; it is broadeft at the two ends. It is bounded by 
Haddington parifli on the N. ; on the E. by that branch 
of the Tyne running from Yefter ; on the S. by Yefter 
parifli ; on the W. by Humbie and Salton, which laft in- 
clofes it on the N. W. corner. There is a fmall riling, 
with a gentle declivity on either fide, running from E. to 
W. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 359. At prefent it contains only 54 fa- 
milies ; males, 106; females, 129; fouls, 2359 baptifms 
from 1780 to 1790, were 62 ; but 6 of thefe were from 

other 



286 



Stati/lical Account 



other pariflies ; burials from 1780 to 1790, were 40 •, but 
the feflion-clerlc fays he records only fuch as pay the tax 
to the Government. Marriages from 1775 to 1785, were 
26. 



Agriculture, iSc. — The valued rent of the parifh is a- 
bout L. 2400 Scots ; the real rent is faid to be about 
L. 1400 Sterling. The number of acres is about 2300, of 
which there are about 170 planted; moft of the grounds 
are inclofed ; fome with ftrips of planting. There are three 
parks of Lethington in it, on the S. W. fide of the water ; 
two of which are yearly let for pafture ; the third is made 
an orchard, by the laft Lord Blantyre, with a fmall plea- 
fure ground planted by the fide of the water. The other 
parks of Lethington are in the parifh xi Haddington, in 
all between 300 or 400 acres ; the walls of which the 
Duke of Lauderdale is faid to have heightened about 4 
feet, fetting the ftones on edge, when the Duke of York 
came to Scotland in Charles IPs. reign, that he might mow 
a deer-park in Scotland. The parifh is divided into 11 
farms ; 2 of which are occupied by the proprietors : the 
reft, partly by refiding, partly by non-refiding tenants. 
There are 28 ploughs, 83 horfes, 280 cows, and about 
6 fcore fheep ; about 150 acres are in wheat ; about 120 
in bear; 230 in oats; 130 in peafe and beans ; 200 in 
clover ; 190 in fallow. I am told that bear is not culti- 
vated fo much as formerly, for the barley brought from 
the E. coaft of England is found to be of a better quality ; 
and the tenants rather give two furrows to their oats. 
There are few turnip or potatoes raifed, or lint fown, ex- 
cept what is given to fervants or cottagers, for carrying in 
flacks. The tenants are fometimes fubje&amp;ed to kain and 
carriage of coals, and thirlage to mills ; others pay com- 
monly 



of Bolton. 



monly money for grinding, or barley making ; and even 
in fome places, thirlage is converted into money. There 
are very few tradefmen. Ploughmen have ordinarily 
L. 14 Sterling a-year. Prices are regulated by the Had- 
dington market. Fuel is chiefly coal. 

Stipend, School, Poor. — The flipend is 17-j— bolls wheat, 
34-^ bolls bear, 69-^. bolls oats, and L. 9 Sterling, which 
comprehends vicarage tithes, communion elements, and 
L. 20 Scots for grafs. The glebe is 4 acres. The church 
is an old building, very thick in the walls. Lord Blan- 
tyre is patron. There are 5 heritors, one of whom refides. 
— The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 100 Scots. — There are no 
vagrants in the parifli ; and the poor and other neceflary 
charges, are maintained ordinarily by the colleftions, mort- 
cloths, and an hearfe, purchafed by the feflion, and let for 
hire. 

Antiquities. — In the little village of Bolton, there re- 
main fome veftiges of an houfe, and a park on the W. fide 
of it, ftill, called the orchard, about 4 acres, which is faid 
to have belonged to John Hepburn, a friend of Bothwell's, 
who fled with him from Dunbar, when Bothwell efcaped 
from the battle of Falfide, in Queen Mary's time. It 
feems that Bolton came then into the pofleffion of Mait- 
land of Lethington, who is the anceftor of the family of 
Lauderdale. — There is a place called ftill Chefters, where 
there are veftiges of a camp between 5 and 6 acres, with a 
rampart and ditch i but there is no record concerning it.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3776563">FEARN</name>, 
(county OF ROSS.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Urquhart.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, is'c. 

UEARN is evidently derived from the arn or alder 
■"- tree, in. Gaelic Fearnn, as there were many of thefe 
trees growing at Mid-fearn, in the parifh of Eddertown, in 
this neighbourhood, where the foundation of the abbacy 
was in the i 2th century firft laid, and intended to be built. 
But the churchmen in thofe days finding the lands there 
confined, and not fo fertile as they would incline, defifted 
from their purpofe, and got a new bull from the Pope, for 
building the abbacy where it now ftands, in a fertile and 
exteufive plain of good land. It was founded here by 
Farquhard, or Farquhar, firft Earl of Rofs, in the reign of 
Alexander II. — The parifh is of no great extent, being on- 
ly 2 Englifh miles in length, and nearly of the fame 
breadth. It is bounded on the S. by the parifh of Nigg;- 
on the W. by Loggie (Eafter) ; on the N. by Tain ; and 
on the E. and S. E. by Tarbat and the Murray frith.— It 
is fituated within the county of Rofs, in the pretty tery of 
Tain, and in the Synod of Rofs,— The foil is a deep loam, 

in 



of Fearn. 



in the centre of the parifti, about the abbacy-church. The 
loans of Fearn to the S. and the lands of Allan to the W. 
are a deep clay, the N. and E. part is gravelilh, the S. E. 
and S. is light and fandy. The face of the parrfh is near- 
ly flat, with the exception of a few eminences, that are gene- 
rally laboured, called, by way of diftinction, Hills. About 
three-fourths are arable, the reft partly green, and partly 
covered with heath. — The air is generally dry and whole- 
fome, but the climate has varied much of late years, efpe- 
cially fince 1782. Fevers are the mod general difeafes a- 
mong the common people •, and, for the moft part, at fome 
particular feafons prove mortal, efpeeially to thofe advan- 
ced in years. 

Lakes, Fijh, &amp;c. — The loch of Eye is above 2 miles 
long, and about half a mile broad. No fifh are to be feen. 
in it but eels 5 fome of them have been got of a good fize, 
weighing 4, 5 and 6 pounds. From this loch proceeds the 
water to the mills of Fearn, and in its courfe forms 2 leffer 
lochs, in one of which there is mofs and green plots, in 
which ducks, teals and fpeikintares (which laft are like fea- 
gulls, but of a fmaller fize) hatch their young, and which 
the fvvans and wild geefe frequent a great part of the win- 
ter and fpring. — The Murray frith lies to the S. E. of this 
parifh. The coaft for about a mile is flat and fandy, on which 
the fiftiing town of Balintore lies, and Hiltown, another 
fifhing town about half a mile to the eaft of it ; there it is 
rocky and high for about a mile more. The fifti caught are 
chiefly haddocks, whitings, cod and red codlings, Ikate, cud- 
dies, a few mackrel and flounders, dog-fifli, lobfters, crabs, &amp;c 
About 20 or 30 years ago, there were great quantities of 
all the above kinds, and fold very cheap ; 220 haddocks 
for a peck of oats, and 160 for a peck of bear, or 6d. and 
other fifti in proportion •, but for 7 or 8 years paft, nth. has

bean {"career, and consequently very high priced. Laft year 
and this alfo, haddocks fold for i d. each, and even at i^d.. 
and 2 d. for the largeft. It is true, that the few they get 
now are much larger than thofe taken when they got great 
quantities ; but thefe they had near the fhore, and might 
be, and were taken there twice and thrice a-day ; but now 
they feldom get them, and muft go farther for them, fome- 
times the length of Helmfdale in Sutherland. The great- 
eft number of. haddocks and cods ufed to be had in winter, 
and firft of fpring; and moft whitings, codlings, flounders 
and cuddies, in fummer and harveft. They are caught 
with nets, and ufed to be fold chiefly in the parifh, and at 
Tain. Sometimes they went with boat-loads of fifh to Ding- 
wall, Invernefs, &amp;c. The fea-weed is ufed on the coaft for 
manure. 

Quarries. — There is a foft freeftone at Pitkery, of an in- 
ferior quality, in the eaft end of the parifh, but little ufed ; 
a pretty good freeftone at Balintore ; a good deal of it ufed 
for building; but at Catboll, in the rocky part of the 
coaft, there is a remarkable good freeftone, little inferior to 
any in Scotland, 

Quadrupeds and Birds. — We have hares, foxes, rabbits, 
eagles, hawks, ducks, teals, partridges, owls, ravens, rooks, 
plover, grav plover, with migratory birds, as the fwallow 
and cuckoo, fwans and wild geefe, &amp;c. The fwallow and 
cuckoo appear about the beginning of fummer, the latter 
departs early in Auguft,, and. the former in September. 
The gray or wild geefe appear about the end of Auguft, 
and continue through the parifh, and efpecially at the loch 
of Eye, till the end of April, when they depart, to hatch 
their young ones in the Weft Highlands. The fwans ap- 
pear about the end of October, and continue about the loch 



of Fearn. 291 

of Eye, the fouth loch running from it, aim oft all the win- 
ter and fpring, except when a great froft locks up the loch 
from them. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webftcr's report, the 
numbers were 1898. It appears that the population of the 
parifh has increafed confiderably lince the ,1742, there be- 
ing at leaft a fourth more people in it now than when the 
church fell at that period j yet they have neither increafed 
or diminiihed any thing to fpeak of for thefe 20 years paft. 
On the laft day of April 1791, there were in the parilh a- 



bout 1600 perfons, of whom were, 

Under 10 years of age, - - 385

the regifter was complete. — There was no regifter kept 
here preceding 1783, when there was an aft of Parliament 
for taking a fmall duty of 3 d. for every baptifm, marriage 
and burial regiftrated in any parifli. This aft is rather 
defective, in that it does not oblige each parilh to regiftrate ; 
from which defect, not only many parifties, but, as is faid, 
fome counties, fuch as Sutherland, keep no regifter at all in 
any of their parifhes ; and even where fuch regifters are 
kept, thofe that do not incline to regiftrate, and pay 3 d, 
aire not obliged to regiftrate at all. — There are 10 heritors 
or proprietors, 2 of whom only refide. The inhabitants 
are generally farmers and cottagers, or crofters, except 
thofe afterwards mentioned. Befides the fifhermen, there 
are 16 weavers, with 5 apprentices, 13 tailors, with 4 ap- 
prentices, 14 fhoemakers, with 4 apprentices, 3 fmiths, 
with 3 apprentices, 5 joiners or wrights, with 3 apprenti- 
ces, 2 coopers, 2 mafons, 1 turner or wheel- wright, I mer- 
chant, and 8 millers •, all of whom are emploj'ed in work- 
ing for the inhabitants of the parifh, and not in manufac- 
turing articles for fale. All are of the Eftabliihed Church, 
except about 6 families of Seceders. There may be 38a 
houfes-, 30 new ones within thefe 10 years, and about 12 
pulled down. At an average, each family contains 4 or J 
perfons, and each marriage produces from 5 to 7 children. 
— There are only 3 fmall towns or villages, and about ico 
perfons in each. In the village of Fearn are 2 mills, (for- 
merly the Abbot's *), paying 12 chalders of rent yearly; 
alfo 6 farmers, 1 diftillery of whifky, 1 merchant's ftiop, 
a fmith's mop, a turner's fhop, and a public-houfe, felling 
drams', &amp;c. The village of Hiltown confifts chiefly of fifher- 
men. There are 3 fifhing boats in it, with 6 men in each. 
That of Balintore alfo confifts of fiftiermen, with 3 filh- ■ 

ing

ing boats and a coble. There are 3 houfes in which drams 
are fold. 

Wages and Prices.— -A farmer's fervant receives 6 bolls 
of oat and bear meal, for his meat, 2 bolls, 3 firlots of 
bear or oat meal, for his wages, and 6 s. or 8 s. for fhoes, 
with 1 boll for the produce of his afhes, together with a 
certain quantity of ground to raife potatoes on, which helps 
nearly to maintain himfelf and his family for half a-year, if 
his wife is induftrious. They can live comfortably, and bring 
up their children decently. A fingle lad in the houfe, gets 
from L. 2 to L. 3 a year ; female fervants get from L. 1 
to L. 1, 10 s. ; the day's wages for hufbandry are is. a- 
day without, or 6 d. with meat •, women, at 6 d. or 3d. 
with meat ; other work, and handicraftfmen, are generally 
paid by the piece. — Beef and mutton fell at 2*d. the pound, 
and in fpring, and beginning of fummer, at 3 d. and 3 J d. ; 
veal at 3^ d. pork at 2^ d. and 3 d. the pound ; hens at 
6d. ducks at 6 d. chickens at 2d. and eggs at 8, 10, 12, 
for 1 d. according to the feafon •, butter at 6 d. 7 d. and 
8 d. the pound of 21 ounces. 

Agriculture, ifc. — The valued rent of the parifh is 
L. 4037:12:11 Scots ; the real rent, about 2200 bolls. 
The rent of the land is 10 s. 15 s. and even L. 1 the acre. 
The principal crops are oats and barley, a confiderable 
quantity of peas, and fome rye, with a few beans, and a 
little wheat, about 50 or 60 acres of clover and rye-grafs, 
but little flax or hemp. Oats and peas are fown from the 
middle of March to the end of April ; barley, from the 
end of April to the end of May. There is little wheat 
here, and what is, is generally fown together with rye in 
October ; potatoes, from the end of March to the end of 
May, of which above ioco bolls are raifed annually. The 

harveft 



Statiftical Account 



faarveft begins generally about the end of Auguft, and ends, 
in good years, about the middle of O&amp;ober. There are a- 
bout 800 oxen, and it is believed 500 horfes, of the fmall 
Scots or Highland kind •, though the few gentlemen in the 
parim, ufe horfes of a better lize. There may be 150 
milk cows •, about 1000 Iheep of the fmall Scots kind, 
their wool neither coarfe nor very fine. There may be 
about 450 fwine fold annually from this parim, to Tain, 
Cromarty, Fort George, and Invernefs, at various prices ; 
the fmaller kind from 8 s. 10 s. 15 s. to L. 1, and the larger 
from -L. i to L.?, 10s. There maybe about 200 oxen bought 
into this parim annually, and about 250 oxen and cows 
fold yearly at Whitfunday and Martinmas. — There are 
140 ploughs, generally 6 oxen in the plough ; fome ufe 8, 
feveral ufe 4 oxen and 2 horfes. It is the old Scots plough 
that is ufed, with a few exceptions. But little of the pa- 
rim is inclofed. The produce is much greater than is fuf- 
•ficient for the confumption of the inhabitants •, above two- 
thirds of the whole is exported out of the parim, in oats 
and oat-meal, to Cromarty, Invernefs, and Leith. But the 
barley is partly diftilled in the neighbourhood, in Ferin- 
tofli, and the adjacent country. Monopoly of farms has 
taken place 'here ; there being inftances in this and the 
neighbouring parimes, of individuals farming what was for- 
merly poffefled by 4, 6, 8, and 10 tenants. There are little 
or no perennial fervices performed by any tenants or under- 
tenants in this parim. There were feveral days of fervi- 
tude about 20 or 30 years ago, fuch as manuring and plough- 
ing the matter's farm for 2 or 3 days in the fpring, cutting 
down his corns, and leading his peats and turf, for as 
many days ; but all thefe are now converted. 

Stipend, ScJjooI, and Poor. — The living coniifts of 128 
bolls of barley, with 100 merks Scots, for fmall teinds,

and 100 merks for communion elements, with a manfe and 
glebe of about 5 acres. The King is patron. A part of 
the old abbey church was repaired at a conliderable ex- 
pence in 1772, and i3 now ufed again as the place of wor- 
fhip. The manfe was built a confiderable time before the 
Revolution, and was raifed and repaired once and again ; 
the laft reparation was in 1782. — The ftate of the fchool is 
but indifferent. The fchoolmafter has only 100 merks 
Scots from the heritors, and the only perquifite is L. 20 
Scots from the feflion, as precentor and feffion-clerk, with a 
trifle he receives for each marriage and baptifm. The en- 
couragement being fo little* we fbmetimes want one alto- 
gether. Some boys or girls, in their parents houfes, begin 
to teach for a trifle of quarter payment. There may be a- 
bout 100 fcholars among them alL — The number of poor 
is 45. The annual mm expended for their relief, is L. 10 
Sterling, produced by the colle&amp;ions. in the church, and 
the intereft of a fmall fum appropriated for them. They 
are not deftitute poor, or fuch as do not work generally 
for themfelves j but many of them being old and fickly, 
get in proportion to their need. But they are chiefly fup- 
plied by the charity and benevolence of the gentry and 
farmers of the pariih. There are not above 6 on the roll, 
who at any time beg in or out of the pariih. Lady Ann 
Stewart, fpoufe to Baron David Rofs of Balnagown, mor- 
tified 3000 merks Scots for the ufe of the religious poor, 
within the prefbytery of Tain, and left the minifters of it 
patrons of faid fund. The intereft of it is divided once in 
the 2 years, and the different pariflies in the bounds get 
in proportion to the character of the religious poor in each, 
£0 far as it will, go; fome pariflies 30, fome 40, fome 50 
merks at each divifion. Sometimes one pariih will get 
more, fometimes another ; but not defigned for beggars, 
but for aged and reduced people of a good character. And 

the 



Statijlical Account 



the people on the lift in each parifti, get fome 5, fome lo, 
fome 15, or more merks, as they are judged deferving, as 
far as it will go, for life. 

Antiquities and Curiojities. — There are feveral Druidical 
temples in this parifti. The abbacy is one of the moft an- 
cient buildings here. It is faid to have been firft made up 
of mud. The principal part of it was 99 feet in length, 
within walls, 2jf feet in. breadth, and the walls 24 feet 
high above the ground. The abbacy was not only the 
place of worftiip before the Reformation, but ever fince, 
until October 1742, when, on a fudden, in time of public 
worftiip, the roof fell in. There were 36 perfons killed 
inftantly, by what fell in of the roof and flate, on that me- 
lancholy occafion ; 8 more died foon after. — The caftle of 
Lochlin, in the N. E. corner of the parifti, is another re- 
markable building. It is faid to be of 500 years (landing. 
It ftands upon an eminence, about 1 mile N. E. of the 
loch of Eye, and about 6 miles E. from Tain, and is indeed 
one of the moft confpicuous objects in this country. It 
was certainly built as a place of fecurity againft fudden in* 
curfions in the days of violence. Its fliape refembles 2 fi- 
gures, nearly fquare, joined together by the corners, in 
which junction there is a ftair-cafe to the top. The letter 
one, which looks towards the W. being about 20, and the 
greater, which looks towards the E. about 38 feet fquare. 
The caftle is 60 feet high. It is fortified with 3 large tur- 
rets, of which, 1 ftands upon the lefler fquare, and 2 upon 
the greater. Thefe turrets are each of them capable of 
holding 3 or more men with eafe, and in each of them are 
5 fmall rouud holes, of about 4 inches diameter, with 3 
larger above them, of a quadrangular form. The latter, 
it is imagined, were intended for the fentries or watchmen 

to fee through, and the others for mooting of arrows. The 

outer

auter door of the kitchen was made of ftrong bars of iron, 
as thick as an ordinary man's leg, and the windows were 
clofed with fmall grates or twifted ftentions of iron, fo that 
it may be readily fuppofed that it was aim oft impregnable 
at the period in which it was erected. — There is another 
very ancient caftle, that of Cadboll, equally old, if not 
older than either the abbacy or the caftle of Lochlin. 
There are little remains of it now, but 2 or 3 vaults. There 
is a very Angular and remarkable tradition concerning this 
caftle, that though it was inhabited for ages, yet never 
any perfon died in it •, and many of thofe who lived in it, 
wifhed to be brought out of it, as they longed for death, 
efpecially Lady May, who refided there about 100 years 
ago ; being long ftck, and longing for death, fhe defired to 
be brought out of her caftle, which at laft was accordingly 
done, and no fooner did Ihe come out of it, than Ihe ex- 
pired • 

Fuel. — The principal difadvantage under which this pa- 
rifti labours, is the fcarcity of fuel. The common people 
burn turfj a few peats, and fome heath, carried from the 
diftance of 8 miles ; there being little or no mots in the 
parifh, but that adjacent to the loch of Eye, and it, is ge-

Charles II. 's time, was born in the caftle of Lochflin ; but 
there is no certainty of it. Farquhar, the firft Earl of Rofs, 
and founder of the abbacy, was buried in this parifh., as 
were feveral others of the Earls of Rofs. There is an area, 
in the abbacy, appropriated for a burial place for all 
of the name of Rofs; almoft all of whom in the north, 
bury there. General Charles Rofs of Balnagown, who 
was advanced to the higheft military honours, and who 
had a principal hand in 2 very bloody wars againft the 
King of France, for the liberty of Europe, under the au- 
fpices of William and Anne, was buried here. This man 
was equally famous for the arts of peace and war. He 
died at Bath, in the 66th year of his age, 1732. There is alfp 
buried here, the valiant and brave Admiral Sir John Rofs 
of Balnagown. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervcitions.-. — The people are fober, regu- 
lar, decent, and induftrious ; they are alfo generous and hu- 
mane. Their condition, however, might be ameliorated 
confiderably, could they have coals imported duty free, 
and fome heavy multures removed, which hinders the im- 
provement of land, and checks any attempts for the efta- 
blifhing of manufactures. None are obliged to leave 
the parifh for want of employment. Some few inlift year- 
ly as foldiers. Many inlifted ia the late General Frafer's 
regiment, and many alfo in the 73d, and fome in the 43d 
and 75th regiments. The people are generally healthy 
and robuft, and rather above the common ftature. There 
may be 12 in the parifh above 6 feet high. — The common 
people fpeak the Gaelic language, though many of them 
now underftand the Englifh. The names of places feem 
to be wholly derived from the Gaelic, and are expref- 
five of their fituation, occupation of the inhabitants, qua- 
lite! of the place or foil, &amp;c— The lands in this parilh

do not yield near one half of the crops they produced 20 
ot 30 years ago, owing to the cold feafons. Since the year 
1781, there has been nothing like a good crop among us; 
no peas, efpecially, came to any account fince. It is now 
indeed idle, and appears fabulous, to relate the crops raifed 
here 30 or 40 years ago. The feafons were formerly fo 
warm, that the people behoved to unyoke their ploughs 
as foon as the fun rofe, when fowing barley ; and perfons 
yet living, tell, that in travelling through the meadows in 
the loans of Fearn, in fome places drops of honey were 
feen as the dew on the long grafs and plantain, flicking to 
their (hoes as they walked along in a May morning -, and 
alfo in other parts, their fhoes- were oiled as with cream, 
going through fuch meadows. Honey and bee-hives were 
then very plenty, which, fince the year 1782, are like to 
be wholly loft, and extirpated out of the country. Cattle, 
butter and cheele, were then very plenty and cheap. 
There are people yet living in this parifh, who have 
bought young oxen for 15 s. 19 s. and L. 1, which now 
would coft L. 4 Sterling each ; good butter fold at 2 s. 6d. 
and 3 s. the ftone ; cheefe at 10 d. the ftone ; and victual 
at 2 s. 6 d. the boll. Some of the abbots of Fearn's viftuai 
was only valued at half a merk Scots the boll ; and a 
gentleman in this parifh, about or within 30 years ago, had 
•a procefs for getting the current price for fome of the ab- 
bots teind-bolls, which was brought before the Houfe of 
Lords, and he loft it, being fixed at the old price of half a 
merk the boll. — In the years 1782 and 1783, victual got 
up to an enormous height, hitherto unknown in this coun- 
try ; being fold from 24 s. to 28 s. the boll. The poor 
were partly relieved by the wifdom and generofity of the 
Barons of Exchequer, who fent 300 bolls of viftual to the 
Sheriff of this county, to be diftributed gratis among the 
poor of the different parifhes, as the firft relief; and ano-

ther veffel with fo much, to be fold at a cheaper rate than, 
afry other in the country ; of both which, this parifli got 
their proportion, which was a feafonable relief. And Pro- 
vidence was kind in thofe days of fcarcity, in providing 
plenty of fiih from the fea, fo that not only the ordinary 
fifhermen caught abundance, and fold them to the poor un- 
til next crop grew up, but many poor people joined, got 
different cobles, and caught a quantity of cuddies, red cod- 
lings, and flounders, near the fhore •, alio an extraordinary 
quantity of fine cockles was had near Tain, on this fide of 
the Dornoch frith, which was almoft a miraculous fupply 
and fupport to this and all the neighbouring pariihes ; fo 
that hundreds of men and women, with their horfes, were 
feen daily coming home with great burdens and loads of 
the beft cockles, in fuch abundance as they never appeared 
before nor fince. Many boat-loads were carried to diflant 
places. No one died for want in this parilh. But in the 
year 1740, in the like fcarcity, many ftarved. — There is 
no kind of manufacture eitablilhed here, but there is a 
good deal of hemp fpun yearly, from the manufacture at 
Cromarty, which will circulate L. 400 Sterling. There 
will alfo be drawn about L. 150 Sterling yearly, for fpin- 
ning lint. The people have become much more extrava- 
gant in their clothing and apparel, of late years, buying 
thefe chiefly from the {hops, whereas formerly they only 
wore their own country-made cloth. The farmers have 
never yet recovered the diftrefs of 1782. Many of them 
were reduced thereby. Luxury has crept in among all 
ranks fince 1746, and all articles are now advanced in 
price. For inftance, fervants could buy a pair of fhoes in 
thofe days for 10 d. which now cofi them from 2 s. 6 d. to 
3 s. a pair. In this parilh, the people are far from market. 
There is no demand ordinarily for the victual here, until 
all is fold, not only in the fouthern counties* but even in

ing in ftraits for money at Martinmas, often fell the few 
bolls they can difpofe of, at 10 s. •, they feldom get 
more for it till Whitfunday, which is the time the price 
generally rifes. Since the feafons have varied fo much, 
and turned fo cold, they are at a great difadvantage for 
want of grafs ; for the common leys and meadows that ufed 
to yield grafs, which might be cut down by fcythes, now a- 
days yield but a very fcanty pafture for any cattle or fheep. 
The average rent of farms was 16, 20, and 25 bolls, 
the greater ones 30 and 35 bolls each, with a very few 
exceptions of 40, 45, and 50 bolls. But now feveral have 
farms of 70, 80, 120, and 130 bolls, fo that the number 
of farmers is diminifhing ; which, together with the annual 
emigration from the parifli, is the reafon that the popula- 
tion has not increafed for feveral years. Several young 
men and women go annually to fervice from this, efpe- 
cially to Cromarty, Invernefe, Moray, and Aberdeen 
fhires, and fome to Edinburgh, Glafgow, Newcaftle, and 
fome of the Colonies fome young men after, and fome 
before they have learned any handicraft. Property in 
land cannot be faid to be often changing, except in a few 
inftances. It is to be obferved, that as there is an union 
of farms, fo is there of eftates in this parifli ; 1 heritor pof- 
felung what 2, 3, and 4 poflefled 30 or 40 years ago. The 
laft crop was generally the fcantieft in quantity, and efpe- 
cially as to the quality of the barley fince 1782 owing to 
the cold fummer and harveft. So that, in one word, the 
only means whereby the condition of the people could be 
ameliorated, next to better feafons, would he, for the Le- 
giflature to allow coals duty free.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1533209">KNOCKANDOW</name>, 
(COUNTY OF MORAY.) 

By the Rev. Mr Francis Grant.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, is'c. 

K Nock and ow has its name from two Celtic words, 
Knock, fignifying 4 hill,' and Dow, 1 black.' It is fi- 
tuated in the county of Moray, prefbytery of Aberdour 
and Synod of Moray, about io miles in length, and, at an 
average, i in breadth. It is bounded on the S. and S. W. 
by the parifhes of Invcraven and Aberdour, from which it 
is fieparated by the river Spey, one of the moll rapid in 
Scotland •, on the E. by Rothes, on the N. by Birnie and 
Dallas, on the W. by Edinkilly and Cromdale. — The 
country is hilly ; the foil either deep mofs or fandy gravel ; 
the air dry and healthy. — Spey is the only river connect- 
ed with the parifh, which produces falmon ; but owing to 
cruives, few of them get up this length. The hills are co- 
vered with heath, and the river-fide with birch, oak and 
alder. The many fmall rivulets that defcend from the 
hills, are frequently in the months of February and No- 
vember fwelled by the rains, overflow their banks, and do 
confiderable harm. This happened particularly in 1783, 

when 



of Knockandow. 

when a water-fpout, there is reafon to believe, fell in the 
adjacent hills. 

Population. According to Dr Webfter's return, the 

numbers were 1267. The population is rather lefc than 
about 25 years ago, many having gone to Aberdeen. The 
number of all ages at prefent is about 1500 ; of whom 600 
are males, and 900 females. The annual average of births 
is 40, of marriages 12. The number of fouls under 10 is 
460, and from 70 to 100 is 36. 

Agriculture. — The grain principally cultivated is black 
oats, big, or Scotch bear, fome rye, turnip and potatoes. 
There is very little artificial grafs. Seed-time generally 
begins in the end of March, and continues through the 
whole of April. Harveft here is in Auguft, September 
and October. The land-rent of the parifh is about L. 2000. 
The fifhings produce about L. 10 a-year. The number of 
horfes 300, of cattle 3000, of fheep 5000. There may be 
about 150 ploughs, all of the Scotch kind, except one. 
The laft in general are very bad. The very bed arable land 
is 14 s. the acre; the general fize of farms about 30 acres. 

Stipend, Poor, l£c. — The value of the living, including 
the glebe, is L. 85 Sterling. Sir James Grant of Grant is 
patron. The church was built in 1757, and the manfe in 
1767. There are 4 heritors. — The number of poor is 20. 
The collections for their relief are about L. 3 ; and the 
lines tf delinquents, with what arifes from a mortification, 
may amount to L. 7. 

Prices and Wages. — Provifions formerly were very cheap. 
A fat ox might have been got for L. 1, 5 s. and a Iheep for 
3 s. 4 d. ; a boll of oat-mcal for 6 s. 8 d. Now, beef and 

mutton

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The Gaelic was generally 
fpoken here till about 50 years ago. — Peats are the only fuel. 
— The general fize of the people is about 5 feet 6 inches, 
and their complexion black. Many of them are very de- 
ficient in induftry, but oeconomical. They are fond of a 
military life, and prefer the Highland regiments. — The 
roads' in the parifh were formerly well made, and kept in 
good repair •, but, for fome time paft, they have been 
greatly neglefted. The people, fenfible of this negledt, 
pay the ftatute-labour in kind, and work, it may be fup- 
pofed, as little as poflible. Were a more liberal plan of 
management adopted, and the ftatute-labour commuted, 
it would be more agreeable, and of much advantage. The 
people here have no idea of turnpikes, or their advantages. 
—In 1782, there was neither a fufficiency of feed nor bread, 
and had not Government interfered, numbers muft have 
ftarved ; but the fupply granted, relieved, in a great de- 
gree, their wants. — The parifli, in general, is uninclofed. 
The people are fenfible of the advantage of inclofures, but 
they are little encouraged, except by one of the heritors. 
The condition of the people might be much meliorated, by 
granting them leafes for 38 years, and a lifetime, by en- 
couraging inclofures, and giving them good examples of 
hulbandry.</p>

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, i£c. 

T*\Alrymple appears to be a Gaelic word, Datrymole, 
and fignifies ' the valley of the {laughter of the king.' 
Here, it is fuppofed, Coilus king of the Britons fell. This 
parifli is in the prelbytery of Air, and Synod of Glafgow 
and Air. — The lower part of it is delightfully fituated, 
and is valley-ground, furrounded on both fides with little 
green hills. Near the river Doon, for the fpace of 5 or 6 
miles S. E. the fituation is beautiful. The length of the 
parifh is 6 or 7 miles ; its breadth, in feveral places, is a 
Scotch miles. Dalrymple is bounded by the parifhes of 
Dalmellington, Coylton, Maybole, Air and Kirkmichael. 
—The general appearance of the country is partly flat, and 
partly hilly ; part of the foil is fertile, and part barren ; 
part of it deep, and part fhallow. Some of it well culti- 
vated and manured by lime or marl. There is variety of 
mineral fprings and lochs. There is only one river called 
Doon, which flows from Loch Dune. After a courfe up- 
wards of 24 miles of various windings and turnings, it dif-

Ag7-iculture. — The parifti, for the moft part, fupplies it- 
felf with provifions, and fometimes exports. A confider- 
able proportion of the grounds is employed in railing corn, 
roots, potatoes, and cabbage. Only a few acres are culti- 
vated in railing hemp or flax. There are many acres, both - 
in fown grafs and pafture, but more in pafture. The farm- 
ers here commonly fow between the middle of March and 
the end of April ; and reap between the middle of Auguft

The value of the living is about L. 76 or L.80. The 
glebe is extremely fmall. There are 5 heritors. The King

yearly amount of the collections for their relief, is about 
L. ix. There is alfo about L. 20, for their maintenance, 
in the Bank of Air. No parifh in the preibytery has its

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — This parilh lay formerly 
under difadvantages, which are now, in a great meafure, 
removed, by means of inclofures and good roads. — There 
are 3 old caftles, the moft remarkable of which is called 
Barbifton. A battle is faid to have been fought between 
Dick of Barbifton and Kennedy, the latter of whom was 
killed. And from the ftone which killed him, the place 
is reported to have been called Barbarous Stone, or Barbi- 
fton. Some ftones of the old vaults were found, and bear 
the dates of 1340 and 1345. A fpear, and feveral large 
bones, which diffolved when expofed to the air, were alfo 
found near this fpot.— The price of provifions has increafed 
much within thefe few years. A day's wages for a labou- 
rer in hufbandry, are generally from 10 d. to 1 s. j d. the 
day. The wages of a common labourer, when married, 
are from L. 3 to L. 3, xo s. in the half year, and are found 
little enough to bring up a family. The fuel commonly 
ufed is coal and peat. Very little wood is ufed. The

MURCHUS</name>. 

(COUNTIES OF MURRAY AND INVERNESS.) 
By the Rev. Mr Patrick Grant.</head> 


<p>DUTHIL. 

Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

HTHE ancient name of the parifli of Duthil was Glen- 

chearnich, fignifying, in Gaelic, " Glen of Heroes 
from various exploits of the inhabitants in expelling the 
Cummins from that part of the countrj, as well as from 
their obftinate defence of it, afterwards againit the depre- 
dations of the Highlanders. The modern name Duthil is 
from Deogh-dhall, " excellent valley the Kirk-town be- 
ing fituafed upon a rifing ground, commanding the pro- 
fpecl of a valley about iooo acres. The parifli is in the 
county and Synod of Murray, and prefbytery of Aber- 
nethy, extends 14 miles from E. to W. and is 10 miles 
iu breadth, is bounded by the parifh of Moy on the N. 
by Alvey on the W. by Abernethy on the S. and by In- 
verallen on the E. The general appearance is hilly, with 

fir,

fir, birch and alder, on the ikirts of the hills ; but beyond 
them it is covered with heath, and is rocky. It is divi- 
ded nearly into two equal parts by the river Dulnan, fig- 
nifying in Gaelic, " floody," running from W. to E. a- 
bout 14 miles. On both fides of which lies a great part 
of the arable ground. The foil towards the lower end of 
the parifh, which widens into a flat for feveral miles, fre- 
quently overflowed by the Dulnan, is deep. Towards the 
upper end, and at a diftance from the river, lhallow, yet 
fertile through the whole. The climate is extremely 
healthy, and the moft common diftempers are nervous fe- 
vers, and fwellings in the joints, occafioned, moft proba- 
bly, by the viciftitudes of heat and cold, which occalion 
too frequent and imprudent changes of warmer clothing 
for the Highland garb. There are feveral mineral fprings 
in the parifli, two of which have been ferviceable in the 
gravel. 

Animals, &amp;c— - The quadrupeds are of the common 
kind in the Highlands. Some of the horfes are of the 
large labouring fpecies. The Highland garrons, as they 
are called, though not fo fufficient for labour, are more a- 
dapted to the lower clafs of people, eafily fupported, by 
running out in the fields moft part of winter. This 
country, once ftored with the fineft woolled kind of fheep, 
has for fome years been over-run with the coarfe Linton 
breed, which ought to be extirpated from every country. 
The pariih abounds with groufe, partridge and black- 
game, and a vaft variety of the fmaller kind of birds. 
The wood-cock appears in O&amp;ober, and difappears in 
April. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers in Duthil and Rpthiemurchus were 1785. In

the earlier periods of fociety here, when only the Ikirts of 
the hills were inhabited, the lower grounds being covered 
with wood, and infefted by wolves and other ravenous 
animals, the population bore a nearer proportion to what 
it now is ; than it did for a feries of years previous to the 
rebellion in 1745. Since that memoiable period, the po- 
pulation has decreafed confiderably, owing chiefly to two 
caufes. The opportunity afforded young adventurers to 
traverfe the field of fortune, and throwing land into large 
farms. The amount of the prefent population of Duthil 
is 830, all of the eftablifhed church ; males, 372 ; females, 
458 ; annual average of births, 70 ; deaths, 15 ; mar- 
riages, 15; fouls under 10, 150; from 10 to 20, 244;

43 ; farmers and families, 54 ; houfehold fervants, 3 ; la- 
bouring fervants, male and female, 330 ; one ftudent at 
college. Formerly moll of the gentlemen's fons and of 
farmers ftudied at college ; but for 40 years paft, they 
have become adventurers abroad. Number of perfons 
born in other parimes in Scotland, 141 ; number of gen- 
try, 5. About 20 year's ago there was a confiderable 
number of very creditable gentlemen with families in this 
parifli, moft of whom have now become extindt ; and the 
few remaining are foon likely to become fo, their fons 
preferring various purfuits abroad ; batchelors, 3 ; each 
marriage, at an average, produces 7 children ; inhabited 
houfes, 166 ; perfons at an average to each inhabited 
houfe, 5. 

Agriculture, &amp;c. — Cattle, at an average, are ie22 ; 
flieep, 3424 ; horfes, 315; ploughs of the Scotch kind, 
and a few Englifli, 105 ; carts, 260; arable acres, 2183;

bage, turnip and fown graft; acres in meadow-graft,

3467 ; acres in mofs and moor adjoining to the arable and 
meadow, 4650. What quantity of ground lies wafle, or 
in common, being the hilly part of the parilh, I cannot 
afcertain. At leaft a third of the parilh is under wood. 
The parilh fupplies itfelf abundantly with provifions. 
The only articles of export are black cattle and Iheep. 
The real rent of the parilh is about L. uoo Sterling. 
There are but a few inclofures in the parilh. The people 
murmur exceedingly at inclofures, their cattle having been 
accuftomed to range promifcuoufly through the year, ex- 
cepting in the fummer feafon, and while the corns are on 
the ground. 

Stipend, School, Poor.-— The value of the living, inclu- 
ding 2 glebes, is L. 67. The church was built in 1400, 
repaired in 1770. The manfe was built in 1704, rebuilt 
in 1763. Sir James Grant is patron, and the only heri- 
tor. — There are 2 fchools, a parochial one, and the other 
eftabliftied by the Society 'for propogating Chriftian 
Knowledge. The falary of the parochial fchool is 100 
merks. The falary and perquifites will amount to about 
L. 12 Sterling. The number of fcholars during the win- 
ter feafon is about 30. In former years,, when a number 
of gentlemen's families refided, there were ufually about 
70 fcholars, fome of whom were fent yearly to the Uni- 
verfity. But the falary is now fo inadequate to the ex- 
pence of living, that no proper fchoolmafter can be had ; 
fo that the gentlemen are obliged to fend their children, 
at a great expence, to diftant counties to fchool. The 
falary of the Society fchool is L. 9 Sterling, with fuitable 
conveniencics, furnilhed by the tenants, in whofe diftricr 
the fchool is ftationed. The number of fcholars, at an a-

formerly 1 d. ; butter, 12 s. formerly 5 s. the ftone ; cheefe 
from 4 s. to 6 s. formerly 2 s. 6 d. Days wages of labour- 
ers in hufbandry, and common labourers, when married, 
I s. which is fufficient to maintain a family. The fuel ufed 
is wood and peat, and is the mod expenfive fuel in any 
part of Scotland, requiring the labour of the whole fum- 
mer. Thus the farmer is under the neceffity of neglect- 
ing the proper bulinefs of the farm. The ufual wages of 
male domeftic fervants are L. 6 a-year ; female fervants 
L. 3. They are entitled to feveral articles befides wages, 
and engage only for a half-year, which is very diftreffing to 
the farmer. If fome mode is not adopted to regulate the wa- 
ges of fervants, fuch as reftri&amp;ing their wages to a reafon- 
able fum, by the univerfal confent of counties, the farmer 
mull unavoidably fail. Servants during the fummer, flroll 
about idly, and live upon their former half-year's wages, 
knowing that the farmer muft yield to the higheft terms 
when the harveft approaches. The idea of preventing, or 
even difcouraging fervants from going to the fouth coun- 
try, fo univerfally fuggefted, approaches too near to op- 
preffion. Servants confefs that their wages are beyond 
the profits of their labour, but when 1 or 2 farmers are 
n,eceffitated for labourers, they are obliged to give high 
fees, and from this view numbers of fervants lie in waiting. 
The increafe in value of faleable articles might feemingly 
admit of an augmentation of rent. But letting the Hill- 
improvements to feparate pofTeflbrs, having diminiuied 
thefe articles, by reducing the number of cattle, and thefe 
- too pinched in their pafture, ftill the fame number of fer- 
vants 



of DuthiL 

vsnts is neceflary. It Would therefore be of infinite ad= 
vantage to the pofleflbrs of low farms to have the Hill-im- 
provements alfo in their poffeflion, or portioned out upon 
the common pafture, though they mould pay the addition 
of rent. This obfervation, if applicable only to a parti- 
cular diftri&amp;, would be foreign to the purpofe ; but it ex- 
tends to a vaft track of country ; to the weftern diftri&amp;s of 
Aberdeen, Banff and Murray mires •, and a great part of 
Invernefs and Perth mires, which properly comprehend 
the Highlands of Scotland. Servants wages having in- 
creafed fo prodigioufly, it is more advantageous to the far- 
mer to employ cottagers or day labourers, for the purpofes 
of hufbandry, where fuel and other neceffaries can be con- 
veniently had ; but where it is otherwife, the difficulty 
of collecting fuel for the tenant's own ufe, and alfo for the 
cottagers, which would be neceflary, if employed in his 
fervice, would be unfurihountable. Employing cottagers 
oY day labourers univerfally in this way, being generally 
married* would have the good effedr. of increafing popula- 
tion, as well as fubjecling fervants to more tolerable be- 
haviour, where they muft necefiarily be had. Still there 
is one particular abfolutely neceflary to be obferved, 
which, if not attended to, will be an unfurmoun table bar 
to the farmer's induftry. It is the proper regulation of 
the price of corn and nleal ; when meal can be had Under 
16 s. a boll, (144 lb. Averdupois,) the different claffes of 
labourers become idly difpofed. The wages of 1 half-year 
will maintain them idle a great part of the yean 

Roads arid Bridges.— The roads and bridges have for 
fome years been kept in repair, by flatute labour exacted 
in kind. The road from Grantown to Aviemore, 13 
miles in length, was repaired in 1779 to 24 feet in 
breadth, being formerly 12 feet, by the country people,

at the requeft of the proprietor Sir James Grant, without 
affe&amp;ing the ftatute labour of the year. Of which road 
there are 9 miles extending through the fouthern limits of 
the parifh, therefore, of no material advantage to the 
people of this country, chiefly accommodating the public. 
The bridges were originally built at the expence of the 
proprietor, one of which, a ftone bridge of one arch, over 
the water of Dulnan, built in 1700, having now fallen in- 
to difrepair, is completely fupplied by a bridge built laft 
fummer, 1791, clofe by it. A military road being pro- 
jected by Duthil to Dulleybridge, than which, if executed 
equal to what of it is finifhed, no road can be more com- 
plete. For the proper line of this road, the public are 
much indebted to the affiduity and attention of Colonel 
Montgomery, Infpe&amp;or General of military roads; ha- 
ving traverfed on foot a vaft track of very rugged ground 
for that purpofe, and thereby rendered the line at leaft 4 
miles fhorter than that univerfally adopted, before Colo- 
nel Montgomery infpec~red it, at the fame time avoiding 
the expence of bridges, and the inconveniency of rifing 
ground. The objection to this line, which appeared to 
other infpe&amp;ors, arofe from mofles of immenfe depth in- 
tervening. 

Mifcettaneous Obfervatiom. — The general fize of the 
people is 3 feet 6. The greateft height which any indivi- 
dual in the parifh has attained to, is that of a gentleman a- 
live at prefent, being 6 feet 7, handfome and well propor- 
tioned. — They are extremely induftrious, more properly 
laborious, in the cultivation of their pofleffions, fuperfti- 
tioufly treading in the footfteps of their anceflors, difregard- 
ing every new mode of improvement, in which, unfortu- 
nately, this country is not lingular. To emancipate from

a prejudice fo univerfal and deeply rooted, will require 
ftrong and uncommon exertions. The efforts of a native 
have hitherto had fo little effect, that they only ferve to 
verity, 4 That a prophet has no honour in his own coun- 
i tl y.' The only effectual mode would be, by one or more 
fir angers of experience fettling in fuch diftricts, as a necefli- 
ty of this kind requires. Though proprietors, for a num- 
ber of years, mould give the higheft encouragement, the 
advantage in time would be immenfe. — Until of late, the 
people were very fond of a military life ; but the wages of 
fervants increafing fo exceedingly, that fpirit is almolt to- 
tally overcome. Formerly none would inlift but in the 
Highland corps. Bounty-money now determines the 
choice. The people are fufficiently ceconomical, yet ex- 
tremely hofpitable and well difpofed. They enjoy the 
comforts and advantages of fociety, as much as an inland 
country, and a fevere climate, will admit of. — The fitua- 
tion of the parifli in 1782 and 1783 was truly difh-efling. 
Had it not been for Government bounty, and Sir James 
Grant's large fupplies from diftant countries, the poorer 
clafs of people would have periftied.. So great was the de- 
finition of the crop in 1782, by the froft fetting in fo ear- 
ly as the month of Auguft, that the raoft fubftantial corn 
which was fent to fome of the mills in this parifh, was a 
crop of wild oats from a piece of ground which had been 
ploughed, but not fown. From various obfervations made 
upon this kind of grain, it appears to be a fpontaneous pro- 
duction ; fo that mould oats, by fome calamity, be fweepcd 
off from the face of the earth, it might be regained by a 
proper cultivation of this fpecies of grain, offenfive as it is. 
It will naturally occur to thofe unacquainted with a fevere 
climate, that early fowing would, in fome degree, prevent 
fche fatal effects of froft. This may anfwer in a favourable 

climate,

climate, but impracticable, where for moft feafons the 
ground is bomb proof in the middle of March, and mere 
puddle for fome time thereafter, In i68c, as nearly as 
can be recollected, there was a famine in this and the neigh- 
bouring counties, of the molt fatal confequence. The 
poorer fort of people frequented the church-yard, to pull a 
mefs of nettles, and frequently ftruggled about the prey, 
being the earlieft fpring greens, which they greedily fed 
upon, boiled without meal or fait. So many families 
periflied from want, that, for 6 miles in a well inhabi- 
ted extent, within the year there was not a fmoke remaining. 
Nurfing women were found dead upon the public roads, and 
babes in the agonies qf death fucking at their mother's 
breafts. Numbers, to avoid the horror of their bodies be- 
ing expofed, finding the near approaches of unavoidable 
death, crawled to the church-yard, for the purpofe of more 
immediate interment, that the earth, which denied them 
fubfiftence, might pioufly receive their remains into its bo- 
fom.— An augmentation of rent, the prodigious increafe of 
fervants wages, and letting fmall improvements towards 
the Ikirts of the hills, called Hill-improvements, al] concur 
as caufes of great alteration in the cuftoras and ftyle of li- 
ving of the inhabitants, within thefe 20 years. That emi- 
grations, to an extenfive degree, have happened from a 
country where i'uch oppreffion prevails, is not to be won- 
dered at. Still emigration is no criterion, to judge by, of 
the fituation of a people. Whole tribes, who enjoyed the 
comforts of life in a reafonable degree, have of late years 
emigrated from different parts of Scotland, from mere hu- 
mour, and a fantaftical idea of becoming their own mailers 
and freeholders. — The language principally fpoken is the 
Gaelic, and the names of places are derived from that lan- 
guage ; as Craig-Elaclk, * Rock cf Alarm.' There are %

the other, for all fit to bear arms to appear at an appoint- 
ed place. Hence the Grants motto, ' Stand faft Craig- 
' Elachie.' — The only principal inn in the parim is at A-

* | -T, HE parifli of Rothiemurchus was united to Duthil i» 
1625. Sir James Grant of Grant is patron. The 
name in Gaelic is Raat-mher-ghiuiJJ}, ' great plain of fir.' 
It is fituated in the county of Invernefs, Synod of Moray, 
and prelbytery of Abernethy ; extends 7 miles from E. to 
W. upon the fouth banks of Spey ; 4 miles in breadth. 
Bounded by the parifli of Duthil on the N. from which it 
is feparated by the river Spey ; on the W. by Kinguifich ; 
on the S. by Athol and Braemar ; on the E. by Aberne- 
thy. The nature of the foil near the banks of Spey is 
deep and fertile ; but, in general, is ftiallow. There is an 
. inexhauftible quarry, more properly a mountain, of lime- 
ftone, in the centre, with abundance of fuel. There are 
3 fmall lakes, abounding with char. Lochnellan, one of 
them, exhibits a fcene moft pidlurefque and romantic, and 
by the fituation of the furrounding hills are formed 5 very 
remarkable echoes. Upon a fmall ifland in Lochnellan, is 
a caftle, built time immemorial ; the walls of which are 
ftill entire. — To the birds common in this country may 
be added, in the parifli of Rothiemurchus, tarmagans, the 
only inhabitants, through all feafons, of the tops of the 
higher! mountains. 

Population. — The amount of the numbers at prefent is 
280, all of the eftabliflied church. Males, 130; Females, 
150. Annual average of births, 30 ; of marriages, 5 ;

bouring fervants, 46 ; gentry, 5. Each marriage, at an 
average, produces 5 children. 

Agriculture, ifc. — Number of cattle, 180; fheep, 2300 ; 
horfes, 95. There being a number of wood manufactu- 
rers, the parilh does not fupply itfelf with provifions. The 
land-rent is L. 300 ; wood, at an average, L. 300. 

Sc/jool, Poor, fcfc. — The only fchool is that eftablilhed 
by the Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. The 
falary is L. 10 Sterling. That, and the perquifites, amount 
to about L. 15. The number of fcholars feldom exceeds 
30.— The number of poor is 7. The annual contributions 
for their relief do not exceed L. 3; and there is no other 
fund.

<p>Situation, Surface, Soil, River, ifc. 

MEthlick is in the prefliytery of Ellon, and Synod 
of Aberdeen. The extent of the parifh from S. to 
N. is 5 miles, from E. to W. 6. It is bounded by the pa- 
rimes of Ellon, Tar ves, Fyvie, Monwhitter, and New 
Deer. The appearance of the country is rather hilly than 
flat. The hills are covered with heath, verdure, and crops 
of oats. The nature of the foil is neither very fertile nor 
very barren. — The fmall river Ithan is the only one in the 
parifli, and which falls into the fea about 10 computed 
miles below, to the E. It produces excellent trout in 
great abundance, and now and then falmon are caught as 
far up as this, and would be often found here, were it 
not that there are cruives about 6 miles below. In the au- 
tumn, falmon come up this length to fpawn, and abun- 
dance of pearl has been found in the river here. Ithan is 
a flow running ftream ; there are few fords in it below this, 
and it might be rendered navigable, at no great expence, 
for large boats.

The caufes of depopulation may be, ift, The rents are 
much raifed upon the farmers, who do all they can to make 
their fubtenants pay the additional rent. 2dly, Servants 
wages are fo high, that people who need them muft put up 
with fewer than formerly. 3dly, The number of manu- 
factures and manufacturers is fo much increafed, as to draw 
a great many hands from the country into towns, fo that 
fervants for agriculture are fcarce. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The church was built in 1780, 
and the manfe in 1734. The ftipend is L. 27 : 14 : 2 Ster- 
ling, 3 chalders of meal, 5 bolls and 5 pecks of bear.— 
There is only 1 fchool, and the fchool matter's emoluments 
are very fmall. — The number of the poor is 40. The an-

Within thefe 40 years they are doubled. — The people are 
of the middle fize. They are very diligent and induftrious. 
The manufa&amp;ure carried on here is that of knitting (lock- 
ings, in which perfons of every age and fex are employed, 
when other work does not interfere ; this enables them to live 
tolerably well, and to pay their rents. They are general- 
ly frugal, more expenfive in drefs than in diet. They are, 
alfo a focial people ; as one evidence of their being fo, there 
maybe fometimes 60, 70, and fometimes 100 at a wedding,

fome milk, butter, cheefe, poultry, &amp;c. and fome fend ftone 
plates and ftone jugs. — The air is rather healthy than other- 
wife. — There is an excellent limeftone quarry. — The roads 
and bridges over burns are pretty tolerable, and are made 
by ftatuce-labour. — The general fize of the farms is fmall ; 
the higheft rent paid in the parifli is L. 105. The valued 
rent of the parilh is L. 2700 Scots. There is very little 
ground in the parilh inclofed, except what is in the poffef- 
fion of the Earl of Aberdeen. — The crop in this parifh in 
1782 was very poor, and the meal it produced was in very 
fmall quantity, and exceedingly bad ; and had it not been v 
for what Government allowed at a low price, part in meal, 
part in peas, there had been a great fcarcity ; and befides, 
it was happy for the poor, that flour that year was cheap, 
for the poorer fort did at that time ufe flour-bread, other-

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, ifc. 

TT Ilbucho is faid to be derived from the Gaelic, and to 
JLV fignify the Cell of Bucho, but of whom nothing is 
known. The fuppofition of Bucho, being a corruption of 
Bede, would correfpond with a variety of traditionary re-n

monks, of his order, fettled here, and gave name to the 
church, &amp;c. There is likewife an excellent well of wa- ', 
ter, called St Bede's. There are fome beautiful banks 
faid to have been raifed by the monks. The parifh is a- 
bout 4! miles from E. to W.  and 3 from S. to N. Al- 
though, on the weft, it is fcarcely more than 1 mile from 
Clyde, and about thrice that diftance, on the eaft, from 
Tweed, yet it belongs to Tweeddale. It is bounded by 
Culter on the W. ; by Biggar and Skirling, on the N. ; 
Broughton, on the E. ; and Glenholm, on the S. Kil- 
bucho is fomewhat remarkable for 2 parallel ridges of

The heath on the hills is preferved by frequently burning 
it ; a tender growth fucceeds, which is delicious and excel- 
lent pafture for ftieep. Carden, part of which is in the 
S. W. of this parifti, is about 1400 feet above the level of 
the Tweed. The parifti contains between 4000 and 5000 
acres. The land is partly arable, and partly pafture ground. 
The foil is neither very good nor bad. There are 19 
ploughs of land, and pafture for 200 fcore of ftieep. The 
rental is little above L. 1000 Sterling a-year. 

Population, \3c. — According to Dr Webfter's returns,

years paft, the births have been 21, and the burials 4. At 
an average, there are 62 houfes, and 5 perfons to a family. 
There are about 8 or 10 day-labourers. The tenants ge- 
nerally prefer fervants hired for a year or half year. Day- 
labourers receive about 8 d. in fummer and 6 d. in winter. 
Men fervants, when married, get about L. 5 a-year, with 
their victuals, and a houfe ; and L. 6, if unmarried. Thofe 
who are unmarried are ufually preferred.

tempts have been made to find coal in the parifh, but have 
not as yet been fuccefsful, it is thought, for want of per-

in tillage than in former times. The farmers rear and fell 
a confiderable number of fheep. A confiderable quantity 
of potatoes and turnip is raifed here. .Several good farm- 
houfes have been lately ereaed.— There is a tumulus in the

ABerdour, in Gaelic, lignifies ' the mouth of the wa-

W. ; by thofe of Beath and Auchtertoul, on the N. ; by 
Kinghorn and Burntifland, on the E. •, and by the Forth, 
on the S. ; being, at an average, about 3 miles from E. to

little ftraths between them. The foil here is generally a 
black loam, more or lefs mixed with fand. The air is 
dry and healthy. 

Agriculture and Rent. — The north part of the parilh is 
but poorly cultivated. Little has been done in the way of 
draining or inclofing the fields. Where farms are fmall and 
leafes Ihort, little improvement can be expected upon poor 
lands. The fouth part is well cultivated, and generally in- 
clofed. The real rent of the parilh may be above L. 2600 
Sterling. The valued rent is L. 7015, 10s. Scots. The 
belt arable grounds are worth 40 s. the acre. Some of the 
lands about the village have been recently let at 50 s. and 
L. 3, 5 s. The farmers are 23 in number. They fow their 
wheat in the months of Auguft, September and Goober; 
beans and oats in March ; barley in the end of April and 
beginning of May. Harveft begins about the end of 
Auguft, though it is not general till about the middle of 
September, and the crop is commonly got in by the end of 
Odlober. The north part of the pariih is confiderably 
later. The old Scots plough continues to be ufed. Small's 
plough has been lately introduced. There are about 58 
ploughs in the parilh ; i§ of which are upon the village 
acres. There may be as many carts as ploughs, and per- 
haps 160 horfes, and about 130 milk-cows. The rotation 
of crops obferved by the farmers is various. Some fow 
wheat, beans, barley and oats in fucceffion, after fummer- 
fallow ; others leaving out the oats, fow grafs-feeds with 

the

the barley ; fome take wheat after drilled beans or po- 
tatoes, and then barley and oats ; after turnips they low 
barley, and then oats with grafs-feeds. The parifli in ge- 
neral exports wheat and barley, and imports oats and meaL 
The prices are much the fame as in Mid Lothian, or fome- 
thing lower. Farms are from 50 to 150 acres. There 
are about 200 acres planted in the parifli. The trees 
thrive well, and much more may be done this way. The 
rugged fpots, which are frequent, and generally covered 
with furze, if they were planted, would beautify the face 
of the country which they now deform. 

Roads and Minerals. — The roads in this parifli are gene- 
rally bad, as in other parts of Fife. The gentlemen of 
the county are now paying attention to the direction and 
the formation of the roads. Toll-bars are erecting, and a 
great change for the better mull foon take place. The 
village of Aberdour, like many others, has fuffered by its 
caufeway being changed into a common road. Such a 
road in a narrow village continues long moift, and is hurt- 
ful to the health of the inhabitants. They fuffer great in- 
conveniencies too, in winter, from the depth of the road, 
and in fummer, from the duft. Neither does a common 
road laft in a village, being exhaufled by the attempts which 
are made to keep it clean. A paved caufeway endures, 
and no inconvenience which the travellers can find from 
it, can balance the daily inconveniencies to which the refi- 
denters are fubjecledby the other. The parifli abounds with 
coal, lime and free ftone, and fome iron ftone. The coal 
is not wrought at prefent. The inhabitants are fupplied 
with this neceffary article from collieries in the neighbour- 
ing parifhes. The price paid on the hills is 6d. the load, 
of 18 ftone, of chews or fmall coal ; the great coal is refer- 
ved at prefent for the fea-fale. Tne limeltone on the coafl

is fhipped at a commodious harbour, which the Earl o£ 
Morton has lately built for the purpofe. It is a ftone of. 
a ftrong and fuperior quality. It is ufed at Carron foe 
fmelting. It is alfo difpofed of in lhells, or flacked. The 
fhells are put on board at i s. o\ d. the boll, and the ftones- 
at 2 s. 8 d. the ton. 

Coaji. — The parilh ftretches along the fhore above two 
miles. From the eaft boundary the coaft is rugged and 
fteep, and generally covered with wood to the water's edge. 
The trees have been planted with a proper regard to the 
variety of ftiade, and the jutting rocks which appear in 
different places, render the whole extremely picturefque and 
beautiful. This wood is interfected with walks cut out on 
the face of the hill, from which the profpe&amp;s are rich and 
varied. On the weft, there is a beautiful white fandy bay,, 
furrounded with trees. Here the grounds rife gently to 
the weft, bordered by thriving plantations - r and ftretching 
fouthward, they terminate in a perpendicular rock waftied 
by the fea. — By this rock on the E. and by headlands on 
the S. W. the fmall harbour of Aberdour is well flicker- 
ed from all winds. The flapping at prefent confifts of a 
few fmall veflels. There is one ferry-boat to Leith, which 
is principally employed in carrying grain. The flapping 
here, as in moft towns on the coaft of Fife,, was formerly 
much more confiderable than at prefent. To the N. W. 
of this harbour, the ground again rifes into a little hill, co- 
vered with trees,, above whofe tops an obelifk yet appears j. 
beyond this, fome corn-fields ftretch to the weftern boun- 
dary of the parifli on the coaft. The profpecls to the fouth 
are beautiful. On the right hand lies the ifland of Inch- 
colm, with the ruins of its monaftery. On the left ap- 
pears the town of Burntifland, which here feems to be 
feated on the fea. The iflands of Inchkeith, Cramond, 

Mickry 



qf Aberdour, 



33* 



Mickry and Carcary, vary the appearance of the frith. 
The coaft of Lothian is juft diftant enough to be feen with 
advantage. The city of Edinburgh and its environs rife 
in view, and the diftant Pentland Hills terminate the 
jprofpe£t. 

Village and Manufa&amp;ures,.— The village of Aberdour 
lies about a quarter of a mile from the fea. Tt is quite 
furrounded by riling grounds, except towards the fouth. 
Between the village and the fea are rich corn-fields, and 
the fliarpnefs of the fea-air is kept off by a great number 
of fine old fpreading trees. The venerable old caftle of 
Aberdour, riling amidft trees, ftands on the eaftern bank 
of the rivulet, which, taking a winding courfe below it, 
falls into the frith in front. The fituation is beautiful, and 
the profpe&amp;s from it magnificent. To the north of this 
,ruin ftands the houfe of Hillfide, commanding different 
•views of the Forth, and exhibiting the richeft and moft 
diverfified fcenes. Between this and the village, the ri- 
vulet runs in the bottom of a little rich ftrath, and its bor- 
ders in fummer are covered with cloth and yarn, which 
gives a pleafing idea of the induftry of the people. There 
are 36 weavers in the village, who are employed principally 
in making coarfe cloths and tickings. The only manu- 
facture for export is the coarfe tickings, of which there are 
made about 520 webs annually, of 70 or 80 yards each. 
"There is a fmall manufacture of fpades, Ihovels, &amp;c. lately 
erefted in the parilh. The great hammer is driven by 
water. There are about 15 tons of kelp made annually 
upon the coaft and the ifland of Inchcolm.

Inchcolm. — The parifh of Aberdour belonged to the mo- 
naftery of Inchcolm. This monaftery was founded about 
the beginning of the 12th century, by Alexander I. in 
confequence of a vow. Sibbald fays, that the welter part 
of Aberdour was given by one of the Mortimers to this 
monaftery, for the privilege of burying in the church. 
There is a tradition, that the corpfe of one of the family 
was thrown overboard in a ftorm, which gives name of 
Mortimer's Deep to the channel between the ifland and the 
fhore, according to the account which 1 have from a gentle- 
man connected with this parifh. This welter part of Aber- 
dour, together with the lands and barony of Beath, are faid 
to have been acquired from an Abbot of Inchcolm, by 
James, afterwards Sir James Stuart, fecond fon of Andrew 
Lord Evandale, grandfather by his daughter to the admirable 
Crichton, and by his fecond fon, Lord Doune, to Sir James 

Stuart, 



of Aberdour. 



333 



Stuart, who married the daughter of the Regent Murray. 
Lord Doune was Commendator of the monaftery of Inch- 
colm at the Reformation. The whole of the above men- 
tioned property, together with the ifland itfelf, is ftill in the 
family of Moray, with the title of St Colme. The prefent 
Earl of Moray attempted to cover the ifland with trees, 
which would have increafed its piclurefque appearance, 
but the attempt did not fucceed. 

Stipend, School, Poor, ifc.-*- The Earl of Morton is pa- 
tron of the parilh. The prefent Earl is a grandfon of 
James Earl of Morton, who was Prefident of the Royal So- 
ciety. He was a Nobleman of diftinguifhed literature and 
abilities. — The ftipend conlifts of 63 bolls 3 firlots of meal, 
50 bolls 1 firlot of barley, 15 bolls of oats, L. 200 Scots of 
money, and L. 5 for elements, with manfe and glebe.— 
The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 100 Scots. The fchool-fees 
are from 1 s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 d. for Englifli, writing, arithme- 
tic and Latin. The ordinary number of fcholars is from 
6c to 90, or upwards. As feffion-clerk, he has the perqui- 
fites of 2 s. 6 d. for proclamation and regiftrution of mar- 
riages, and io d. for regiftration of baptifms. — The funds 
for the poor are from L. 25 to L. 27 a-year. During the 
general fcarcity in the years 1782, 1783, the people were 
enabled to live by the generofity of the heritors, who 
brought meal into the parifh, and fold it coniiderably lower 
than the market-price. To the poor it was diftributed 
gratis. — There is an hofpital in the vilbge for 4 widows. 
It was founded by Anne Countelr. of Moray. The Earl 
of Aioray and the Clerks to the Signet prefent the widows. 
The Earl of Moray prefents 3 of them, and the Clerks to 
jthe Signet the 4th. 



Antiquities. 



334 Statijlical Account 

Antiquities. Not far from the village of Aberdour, oa 
a flat on the top of a hill, there is one of thofe cairns or 
tumuli fo frequently met with in Scotland. The. farmer 
on whofe farm it is iituated, when carrying away the ftones 
fome years ago, difcovered a Hone coffin, in which were 
found the ikeleton of a man, the head of a fpear made of 
copper, with the copper nails by which it had been fixed 
4o the ffiaft, and a piece of clear fubftance, like amber, 
fuppofed to have been an amulet. The coffin, with a great 
part of the cairn ftill remain. The tumulus has been coni- 
cal, the coffin being exactly in the centre of the bafe, from 
which, to the circumference, it meafures 20 paces. The 
height cannot now be afcertained. There have been found 
in the fame cairn feveral earthen velTels, containing hu- 
man bones. The veflels were flat, narrower at the bottom 
than top, and without any covering. The farmer digging 
in the fame field, in another place, found fuch a quantity of 
human bones, that he was obliged to defift. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — It is faid that there were only 
three parfonages in Fife, Aberdour, Dyfart, and Balin- 
gry ; and that there were only two nunneries in Scotland 
of the order of St Francis, the one at Dundee, the other 
at Aberdour ; the field contiguous to the minifter's garden 
bears the name of the Sifterlands to this day. — The people 
of Aberdour are fober and induftrious, are contented with 
their fituation, enjoy in a confiderable degree the advan- 
tages of fociety, and while in health, they are able to 
maintain their families. In ficknefs and in old age, many 
need relief. — Labourers receive from 8 d. to 1 s. 2 d. ac- 
cording to their ability ; carpenters and mafons, is. 6 d. 
tailors, 6 d. and their vicruals ; the wages of men fervants 
employed in hufbandry, are from L. 5 to L. 8 a-year, with 
vi&amp;uals, of women fervants from L. 2 to L. 3, with vic- 
tuals. 



of Aberdour. 



335 



tuals* A good fpinner on the two-handed wheel, may 
earn from 6 d. to 8 d. the day. — The food of the common 
people confifts principally of oat-meal, potatoes, garden- 
roots, and a little butcher meat. There are 5 alehoufes in 
the village. The people are fond of a feafaring life, and 
enter willingly into the navy. There are about 60 failors 
in the village. The common people here, and generally 
through Fife, are not fond of the army. — The village is in 
general healthy. A very epidemical fever appeared here 
June 1790, and continued till January 1791. It was 
not materially different from the fevers that are common 
in this country, except in the prevalency of jt. It was 
more general than in any former period in the memory 
of man. Nearly a fourth part of the parifli was infefted 
. during thefe 7 months. The frequency of this fever was 
fuppofed to proceed from two circumftances, very favourable 
to contagion : Its commencing in the hotteft feafon of the 
year, and among the children atfchool, who were crowded 
in a low damp room. — The croup fometimes appears among 
the children, as it generally does in places near the fea. 
It often proves fatal, unlefs affiitance is immediately pro- 
cured. — Inoculation is frequent, and fuccefsful among the 
better fort of people ; yet the common people are ftill a- 
verfe to it. This is not fo much owing to their prejudices, 
as to their poverty. A workman, with a fmall family, 
hath very little to fpare to the furgeon. — It is afked, what 
can be done to improve the condition of the people ? One 
anfwer to this may apply to a great part of Scotland. There 
is no doubt but it would much improve the ftate, both of 
the people and of the country, if the proprietors of land, 
where they have it in their power, were to give long and 
encouraging leafes to their tenants. This ufeful body of 
men, who, by toil and expence, improve the fields, mould 
be enabled to live comfortably, and, by the induftry of

their youth, to lay up a provifion for the feafon of old age. 
To improve the condition of the people, care Ihould be 
taken to improve their morals •, and particularly to efta- 
blifh their virtue upon religion, the only ftable foundation 
of good morals. The higher ranks of life might do much 
good in this refpeft. They who, by their pra&amp;ice, weaken 
the influence of religion among the people, do much hurt in 
fociety ; but they who give their countenance to religion, 
are public bleffings, and do honour, both to the foundnefs 
of their own heads, and the goodnefs of their own hearts.

(county of argyle.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Mackinnon.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, &amp;c. 

Tn HE mod ancient name of this parifh is faid to have 
been Glenduijk, fignifying the ' Glen of the Black- 
water.' Afterwards a battle was fought between Meckan, 
ra of Magnus, King of Norway, and the Albuns or Gails, 
'here it is faid the Norwegians were flaughtered on each 
de of a river called Ruail, which runs through the middle 
\ the glen ; and their bodies being thrown into the river, 
ive the colour of blood to it. Hence the parifli got the 
ame of Glenderwell, and the river the name of Ruail, 
hich fignifies the  Glen of Red Blood.' Though the 
flthet red is unneceffary to be added to blood, yet it is 
ery often done in Gaelic. After the introdudion of 
hriftianity into the country, the place of worfliip was con- 
crated to St Modan, and called Cella Modani, or Kilma- 
m. This pariih is in the prelbytery of Dunoon, and Sy- 
3d of Argyle. It is 12 miles long, almoft contained in 
e bottom of the glen, and a little more than a quarter o£

a mile broad. It is bounded by Kilfinnan, Inverchallen 
Dunoon, and Strachur. The parifli is almoft a flat, bounded 
by hills, covered moltly with heath. The air is moift, the 
foil deep and fertile. The extent of the fea-coaft is about 
3 miles ; the more is fandy and flat for the moft part. Cod, 
haddocks, fyths, mackrel, and herring, are caught on the 
eoaft. The herring are fold at i s. the hundred, when plen- 
tiful ; they were fent fometime to Rothefay, Greenock, . 
and Glafgow they are beft in Auguft. Muriels are the 
pnly ihell fifli here ; and wreck, the only fea-weed manure.

rhe population of the parilh is diminifhed nearly one -half 
rom what it was 25 years ago. The caufe is plainly this; 
rhe proprietors fet their farms in a large extent to gra- 
iers, who can afford to pay a great rent ; becaufe 1 man 
pill herd the cattle on a farm which formerly fupported 8 
imilies. They find alfo the fewer farmers in a farm, the 
sfs that farm is burdened with the maintenance of fami- 
ies ; and that a great number of farmers cannot pay the; 
ame rent that a few can. Some families leave the parilh, 
rearly ; but for 20 years paft, only 2 families belonging to 
t have emigrated from Scotland. 

Produce, ifc. — The parilh produces oa1§, barley, peas, 
otatoes, turnips, rye-grafs, clover, garden-fluffs, fruit trees, 
arren trees. There are between 5000 and 6©oo fbeep,

iooo black cattle, 109 horfes. The parifli imports ar- 
ticles of provifion. The foil is friendly to flax. This year 
the incumbent had 5 ftone Tron weight of unheckled lint, 
upon 1 peck fowing. The want of a lint-mill is a difad. . 
vantage to the country. Seed-time is generally in April, 
and harveft in September. There are 24 ploughs of the 
Scotch kind, and 28 carts. The land-rent may be about I 
L. 1300 Sterling. The rent of the beft arable land is be- 
tween 155. and 20 s. the acre. The ftate of this parifli 1 
in the years 1782 and 1783, was not fo bad as that of f 
many others ; but the crop in general, over the whole, 
fuffered from the fummer's cold and the wet harveft. The; 
poor were the better for the fupply granted by Govern- 
ment. 



Church, Stipend, Poor, ifc. — The church was built in 1783 
and the manfe in 1773. The value of the ftipend, inclu-- 
ding the glebe, is L. 100 Sterling. The number of the: 
poor is 20, the annual contributions for their relief, about; 
L. 10 Sterling. 

Prices and Wages* — About 30 years ago, 4 s. was a great 1 
price for a Iheep ; at prefent, it is 12s.; a cow at than 
time fold at L, j, 5 s. and now at L. 4 Sterling. Every 
thing elfe of meat kind is equally high in proportion. 
Meal is moftly at the fame rate it was then. Within 
thefe 20 years, fervants and labourers have tripled their 
wages or rather quadrupled them. A fervant roan de- 
mands L. 8 Sterling, 4 pair of lhoes, and his victuals : 
About 20 years ago, he would have been glad to get 
L. 3 Sterling a-year. A fervant-maid L. 2, 10 s. Sterling, 
and her victuals, and 2 pair of ftioes. 

Mifcellaneous

MifceUaneous Obfervations. — There is a mineral fpring, 
once famous for curing the fcurvy and other diforders, but 
is not now reforted to. There are 2 tumuli fuppofed to 
have been raifed by the Norwegians, but have not been 
opened. — The river Ruail produces falmon, grilfe, trouts 
of different kinds, par and eel, but not in great quantity, 
fold at 4 d. the pound ; they are beft between May and 
Auguft. — There is moor and limeltone. There is a great 
quantity of what is called pipe-clay in the panlh. Peats 
are the common fuel, and for the moil part very ill to be 
got, on account of the height of the hills, and bad accefs to 
them. This is one of the greateft inconveniencies to which 
the people are fubject. — The inhabitants are much dif- 
pofed to induftry, and it is a pity that fome manufacture, 
efpecially in the linen way, is not eftabliflied among them, 
as the foil is fo favourable for flax. They are judicious, 
economical, and difpofed to generous and humane actions. 
They are not remarkable for fize or ftrength ; fome arc 
5 feet 6 inches, fome 6 feet ; the greateft height known 
was 6 feet 1 inches. They are remarkably altered with 
regard to their drefs within thefe 30 years ; and their li- 
ving is little inferior to their drefs. The Gaelic is the 
language chiefly fpoken. — The people are not averfe to the 
fea. There is but one boat in the whole parifh. Few or 
none have been in the navy, and none in the army, except 
in the Fencibles. — Property has changed three times in the 
the prefent century. Land fold at 6 years purchafe not 
50 years ago. The people complain of high rents. Poor 
people get a houfe and garden for 10 s. a-year. The ftatute 
labour is exacted in money. The bridges are built and re- 
paired by the ftatute money. Very little land is inclofed.

HP HIS parifh is 6 Englifh miles in length, and 4 in 
- 1 - breadth. Its form is almoft triangular, one of the 
angles terminating in the fandy defart lituated at the mouth 
of the Tay. On the S. W. and W. it is bounded by the 
parifhes of Monifieth and Murroes ; on the S. E. by Barrie j 
on the E. by Panbride ; on the N. by Carmylie, and on the 
N. W. by Inverarity and Tealing.— The face of the country- 
is diverfified by feveral large hills. The foil and air are very 
various. The S. part of the parifli is diftinguifhed for fertili- 
ty. In the N. and N. W. the foil is more moift, the air 
colder, and vegetation more flow ; infomuch, that the in- 
habitants of the former have frequently their harveft ga- 
thered in a month or j weeks before thofe of the latter. 
The interpofition of a large hill, or ridge of hills, called 
Camuftoun, or Dunie, makes a confiderable alteration in 
point of climate.

Agriculture. — The rent of the beft land is from 5 s. to 
1 5 s. the acre, but that of fome of the worft has been re- 
cently 16 s. 8 d. Of the beft land, the leafes are old, 
having been let about 23 years ago, moft of them for 
twice 19 years, and a lifetime, the rent rifing 1 s. the acre 
at the 20th year. At that period, little or nothing had 
been done in the way of improving land, and the tenants 
were in general poor ; moft of them are now in eafy, 
fome of them in opulent circumftances ; they are in gene- 
ral frugal and induftrious. Of thofe farms, one which hap- 
pened to be let for only 19 years at L. 52 Sterling, and 
which confifts of about 170 aeres, was let again within 
thefe laft 4 years at L. 120 ; and the prefent tenant being 
a fkilful and induftrious farmer, is likely to make more 
money than the former, who laboured in the old way. 
Were the leafes of the other farms expired, they could all 
be let for more than twice the prefent rent. In the fouth- 
ern part of this pariih, the farms are for the moft part in- 
clofed. Every farmer finding his account in breeding and 
fattening cattle, raifes annually feveral acres of turnip. 
Wheat has long been cultivated in the fouthern, and which 
is the moft fertile part. For the laft 6 or 7 years, the far-3 
mers difcontinued the fowing of this grain, feveral of them 
having met with confiderable loffes by blafting. But they 
are now beginning to try it again, and have this year been 
fuccefsful. Good artificial grafs is alfo produced. By an 
article in their tacks, moft of the tenants are bound to 
have a third of their farms always in grafs. Much atten- 
tion has of late years been paid to the railing of flax. A- 
bout 25 years ago, when a great proportion of the ground 
confifted of natural pafture, every farmer had a large flock 
of flieep. At prefent, there are not in this pariih above 
2 or 3 who have Iheep at all. In the N. and N. W. parts 

of 



of Monikie. 

of* the parilh, there are large tracks of moor, formerly 
wafte and uncultivated, covered wholly with heath, info- 
much that a perfon might have travelled a confiderable 
way without feeing any other vegetable. At prefent 
thole tracks contain plantations of thriving young wood. 
In a track of moor which forms the northern extremity of 
this parifh, there are fettled 15 or 16 families, who, by 
their induftry, have rendered arable, and in forne degree 
fertile, confiderable fpots of land formerly wafte and bar- 
ren. The valued rent of the parifh is L. 4608 : 6 : 8 
Scotch. There are about 23 confiderable farms, fome of 
which confift of more than 200 acres. 

Population.— This parifh contains 2 large villages, one 
of which having about 30, and the other 25 families, and 
2 or 3 villages lefs populous. According to Dr Webfter's 
returns, the numbers were 1345. The number in 1772 
was 1033 ; at prefent it is 1278. There is reafon to be- 
lieve, that about the beginning and middle of this century, 
the parifh was more populous. The diminution of the 
oumber of people is owing to the union of farms ; the 
Farmers alfo employ fewer hands than formerly. Many of 
the cottagers are exterminated. Since commerce began to 
|ouriih, feveral manufacturers, who fubfifted partly by a- 
ipiculture, have gone to large towns. The annual average 
Df births for the Iaft 10 years is 32. The annual average 
fcmng a period of 10 years fubfequent to 1718, and du- 
•ing I0 years fubfequent to 1742, appears from a well 
«pt regifter, to have been 41. For fome years paft, the 
mnual average of deaths has been about 19. The number 
)f marriages annually for 7 years paft has not exceeded

Church, Stipend, School and Poor. — The church feems tu 
have been built or renewed in 1678. The manfe and 
offices are at prefent fomewhat ruinous. The value of 
the living depending chiefly on victual is in different years 
different. During the 7 years of the incumbent's miniftry, 
the ftipend, at an average, has been L. 115 Sterling a-year. 
The manfe and glebe cannot be eftimated, both together, 
at more than L. 10 or L. 12 Sterling. — The fchoolmafter's 
income as fchoolmafter, feffion -clerk and precentor, is a- 
bout L. 35 Sterling a-year. The number of fcholars is 
from 40 to 50. — The poor are. in general well provided 
for. None of them are reduced to the neceffity of beg- 
ging. The number at prefent on the roll is 15. The an- 
nual average of colleftions is about L. 23 or L. 24 Ster- • 
ling. There are of feat-rents belonging to the poor about: 
L. 12 Sterling; and there is lying at intereft at 4f/er- 
cent. 200 Sterling. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The roads in this parifh at 
prefent are not in the beft condition. That from Dundee 
to Arbroath, which interfe&amp;s the lower part of the parilh,, 
is in bad weather almoft impaflable. There is a turnpike- 
road begun to be made, which, though a mile farther fouthi 
than the old road, yet being quite ftraight, will fhorten the: 
diftance between thefe 2 towns. About 7 years ago, a* 
road was formed leading from Brechin to Dundee, and! 
patting through the northern part of this parifli. Upon this • 
l-oad there was built about 5 years ago, a ftrong mafly. 
bridge, 55 feet high, with a fingle arch, over a precipice att 
Denfiend, or the Fiend's Den, a place deep and winding. 
—Near the 8th mile-ftone, E. from Dundee, there is a ridge r 
of fmall hills, called the Cur-hills, where within thefe t*d 

yeart* 



of Monikie, 347 

years feveral ftone coffins have been found. In the vicini- 
ty of the fame place, were found upwards of 6 feet below 
the furface of the earth, feveral trees, oak, fir and birch. 
There were alfo found urns, covered with broad Hones, be- 
low which were alhes, fuppofed to have been human bodies 
reduced to that ftate by burning. To the fouth of the 
Cur-hills were found feveral heads of deer, and horns of a 
very large fize, among marl, about 9 feet below the fur- 
face. 

Within thefe 3 or 4 years, there have been 5 or 6 large 
neat new houfes, and feveral fmaller ones built. Every 
farmer almoft has within thefe 10 years made fome addi- 
tion or improvement to his dwelling houfe, or to his of- 
fices. — There are 2 confiderable inns in this parifh, and fe- 
veral petty ale-houfes. The confumption of fpiritous li- 
quors has within a few years greatly increafed, the quali- 
ty of the ale brewed in this part of the country being 
worfe than formerly ; yet the morals of the people feem to 
have fuffered little by the change. No bufinefs of any 
confequence can be tranfa&amp;ed by the common people but 
in the ale-houfe. But the vice of drunkennefs, and the 
crime of theft, are in this and other parts of the country 
more rare than about 30 years ago, when the lower clafs of 
people having fewer objects to excite their induftry, were 
more idle, and confequently more profligate. — About 3 5 
years ago, the wages of a ploughman were in this neigh- 
bourhood L. 2, 10 s. Sterling ; of a carter L. 2 ; of a female 
fervant from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 1, 10 s. At prefent, a plough- 
man is thought good for nothing, who does not receive 
L. 7 or L. 8. The ufual wages of female fervants are from 
L. 3 to L. 4. About 30 or 40 years ago, a farm which 
js pow worked by 3 ploughs, having each 4, fometimes on-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1028188">CALDER</name>, 
^COUNTIES OF NAIRN AND INVERNESS.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Grant.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Surface, Rivers, &amp;c. 

^T^HE old name of the parifh was Borivon, fupp jfed to be 
derived from the Gaelic, Brae Ewen, or, ' Ewan's 
t high country.' Calder is derived from Coille, a ' wood,' 
and Lor, 1 water.' It is fituated chiefly in true county of 
Nairn ; a fmall part of it lies in that of Inver nefs ; it is in 
the prefbytery of Nairn and Synod of Moray. The form 
of the parifh is not unlike the letter T. Its extent is about 
4 miles from S. W. to N. E. The general breadth is not 
above i miles, but a part of it from the ct ;ntre runs up to 
the high country about 7 or 8 miles. The parifh is at the 
diftance of 2 or 3 miles from the fea ; b junded by Nairn 
on the N. by Auldearn and Ardclach or. t'a- E. by Moy and 
Duthil on the S. and Croy on the W. The low part of 
the parifh is flat and level, the higher p art hilly and moun- 
tainous, abounding with heath, mofs an.d fome wood. — The 
'foil is fharp, fertile and friendly, but n pt wet or deep. The 
mountains which divide Calder froj fi Moy to the S. are 

very

very high ; are covered with heath, and abound with mofs. 
There is a good deal of hilly and rocky ground in the lower 
parts. A part of the low lands has fometimes been laid 
under water, by the overflowing of the burn of Calder, 
and the water of Nairn. The moft conflderable inunda- 
tion happened in 1782. The wood of Calder, and parti- 
cularly the burn that runs through it, offers to the view the 
moll delightful fcenery. It runs in a dark and deep chan- 
nel, fo as to be loft to the fight, with high, fteep and rocky 
banks on the eaft fide, covered with trees of all kinds, and 
the moft beautiful ftirubbery. The rapid river of Find- 
horn runs through the higher part of the parifh, as does the 
river of Nairn wafh it below. Both thefe rivers abound 
with falmon and trout. Salmon about 12 years ago, and 
lefs, fold at 1 d. and 1^ d. the pound, of late it has got up 
to 3 d. and even 4 d. The falmon is in high perfection iu 
May. 

Population. — There is every reafon to believe that the 
parifh is better peopled now than it was fome years ago. 
Although the farms are enlarged, feveral fmall ones being 
thrown into one, yet the number of improvers of moor and 
wafte lands is increafing. Tradefmen are more numerous, 
and fo are cottagers. Dr Webfter's ftate is 882. The pa- 
rifh. may now contain about 850 perfons, above the age of 
6 ; of which 400 may be males, and 450 females. The 
annual average of births is 23-*- for the laft 10 years ; of 
deaths, 14 ; of marriages, about 9. There are about 20 
perfons between 70 and 100 years of age. The number of 
farmers, and their families, is upwards of 60; of traders, 
dyers, carpenters, fhoemakers, wheel-wrights, tailors, fmiths, 
mafons, &amp;c. upwards of 40, and about 20 apprentices. 
There are upwards of 150 labouring fervants, including 

both 



of C alder. 



35* 



both fexes ; 2 ftudents at the Univerfity ; 1 perfon a na- 
tive of Wales, and 1 of America. ^There are fcarce above 
ao here born in any other parifh' or diftrift of Great Bri- 
tain. There are 3 or 4 gentlemens families, only 1 Se- 
ceder, and 1 Epiicopalian. The proportion between the 
annual births and the whole population, is about 1 to 37 : 
Between the annual marriages and the whole population, a- 
bout 1 to 94 : Between the annual deaths and the whole 
population, about 1 to 60. Each marriage, at an average, 
produces 6 children. There has been no emigration of con. 
fequence from the parifh ; but every other year there are 
fome young lads, in the chara&amp;er of adventurers, fervants, 
and apprentices, who go to America, London, Edinburgh, 
and other parts. There are about 160 inhabited houfes, 
and about 5 or 6 to a family. Only 1 perfon has been ba- 
nifhed from this parifh in the memory of man. 

Produce, 13 c. — Almoft all kinds of vegetables and plants 
that are produced in the north of Scotland, are to be found 
here. Trees are the oak, alder, birch, mountain-afh, afli, 
elm, beech, larix, and other pines in great numbers. Horfes, 
about 420 ; black cattle, 2100 ; fheep, 6300 ; goats, 400. 
There was a furvey and map made of the greateft part of 
the parifh in 1782 ; by which it appears, that the number 
of acres may be about 26,000, making a reafonable allow- 
ance for what has not been furveyed. Of the above, 18,000 
acres, at leaft, confift of moor and mofs. There may be a- 
bout 1000 fown yearly with barley, 2600 with oats and 
rye, 400 under potatoes, turnip, and flax, 500 let out in 
ley, without fown grafs, there being little grafs-feed fown 
in the parifh; and the remaining acres under wood, broom, 
green mofs, and common pafture. The parifh does more 
than fupply itfelf with provifions, and furnifhes a great deal 

of

of oat-meal, in particular, to the neighbouring towns of In- 
vernefs, Nairn, and Fort George. It fells a good many- 
cattle and fheep to the butchers in thofe towns, and to 
drovers. It affords much barley to the diftillers, of whom 
there are 2 in the parilh. The rent of the parifh is about 
L. 1200 Sterling. Some acres of arable land are let at 15s. 
an acre, and fome fo low as 2 s. 6 d. The fize of the farms 
is very different, fome confift of upwards of 100 acres, and 
others below 40. There are not as yet many inclofures, 
but the tenants are fenfible of the advantage of having their 
land inclofed, and fome of the more opulent have begun to 
inclofe and fence. The fituation of the parilli in 1782 and 
1783 was furely bad enough, though not fo ill as in many 
places. The corns were not fo much hurt by the froft, of 
courfe, the crop was better, and few of the cattle died, ha- 
ving been maintained chiefly on the tops of whins, cut and 
threflied, of which there are great quantities almoft in eve- 
ry part of the pariib. Oats are fown the latter end of 
March, barley generally before the 20th of May ; and they 
are begun to be reaped between the ift and 12th of Sep- 
tember. 

Prices and Wages. — Beef, mutton, veal, and pork, are 
from 2]d. to 3id. the pound. Hens 6d. geefe is. 6d. to 
2 s. ducks 8d. turkies 2 s. 6d. butter 125. cheefe from 4s. to 

6 s. the flone; barley has not been under 15 s. for many 
years ; meal is variable. It is to be obferved, that in all thefe 
particulars, there has been a prodigious rife of price fince 
the 1780. A day-labourer may receive 6d. and" perhaps 

7 d. a-day throughout the year, with fome other advan- 
tages ; fuch as a houfe and garden, time to gather and pre- 
pare his fuel, an extraordinary allowance in harveft, with 
liberty to plant potatoes, as far as any dung Ise can gather

will go. This is found very fufficient to maintain a fami- 
ly of 5 or 6 perfons, if the wife has any induitry at all. 
Male farm-fervants get from L. 4 to L. 6 in the year, and 
female fervants from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2. Domeftic fervants 
get a little more. A labourer in hulbandry gets 6 d. a- 
day, with his victuals. A carpenter, mafon, or other 
tradefman, about 1 s. 4 d. or 1 s. 6 d. without victuals. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The church was built in 
161 9. The value of the living is about L. 80. Mr Camp- 
bell of Calder is patron. There are 2 heritors, but neither 
of them refide. The manfe was built about 1730. — The 
fchoolmafter's falary is a chalder of victual, half meal, half 
barley. The meal is paid by the tenants, and the barley 
by the landlord. The fchoolmafter receives alfo L. 1, or 
L. 1, 5 s. Sterling, as feffion-clerk and precentor, 1 s. for 
every marriage, and 6 d. for every baptifm. The fchool- 
fees are is. a-quarter for Englifh fcholars, is. 6d. for 
writing, and 2 s. 6 d. for Latin and arithmetic. In winter 
the fchool is generally very throng, between 3 and 4 fcore 
of boys and girls attend. The parents in general wifli their 
children to read, write, and get fome knowledge of arithmetic, 
but mow little defirefor the learned languages. — The num- 
ber of poor is about 40. The annual contributions for their 
relief are only about L. 12. The poor have certificates to 
beg from d jor to door in the parifti. 

Mifcellaneous Obfer. vat ions. — The parilh has fome very 
peculiar advantages. It is well furnifhed with water, wood, 
and fuel. It has within itfelf, or is in the clofe neighbour- 
hood, of mills of many kinds, not only meal-mills, but 
flour-mills, waulk-mills, lint-mills, barley-mills, and malt- 
mills. It is well Hocked with tradcimen of every kind,

and withal the landlord is the mod; indulgent of mafters 
The air is remarkably falubrious. The rents of cottagers 
houfes, with a fmall garden, are from 15 s. to L. 1, when 
paid in money, but are generally exacted in fervices. It 
is found convenient to have cottagers in the neighbourhood- 
The\ are employed as day-labourers, and are extremely 
ufeful, particularly in the more bufy feafons of the year. 
But the tenants would not choofe to truft to them alone for 
the whole work of the farm, preferring fervants hired from 
term to terra, as the moll fteady and fixed. But few fer- 
vants can be prevailed upon to engage for a longer fpace 
than half a-year at a time, which is often a great incon- 
venience. As to perfonal fervices, they are almoft in dif- 
ufe, being only preferved on a fmall eftate, and a wadfet 
held by a gentleman in the parilh. Where they are flill 
continued, they confift of various attendances and carriages- 
The tenants or fubtenants affift their mafter in calling and 
leading his peats ; in cutting his corns, and bringing them 
home ; in repairing his offices, in carrying his victual to 
market, &amp;c. But Mr Campbell of Calder, the principal 
proprietor, has of late, in a molt generous and humane 
manner, abolilhed all fuch fervices and carriages on his 
eftate, commuting them with the tenant at a very eafy 
converfion ; and has included the rent, ftipend, cefs, cu- 
ftoms, in one fum, payable by the tenant at 2 different 
terms, obliging him only to affift in leading materials for 
the church, manfe, and offices, fchool-houfe, and for keeping 
the old caftle in repair. — There is 1 inn in the pariffi, and 
1 or 3 ale -houfes ; but it does not appear that the morals of 
the people are in the leaft corrupted by them. They are 
convenient for travellers, there being feveral public roads 
through the parifh, but they are very feldom vifited by 
the pariftrioners. It muft be allowed that the people are 

very 



of Calder. 



355 



very indubious in their way. Their great induftry in the 
fummer, lies in preparing dunghills and their fuel, and in 
winter, in threfliing out and milling their corns.— There is 
no eftablifhed manufacture in the parifli, but ftill a great 
-deal of work is done in the web -way in their families, both 
for home-ufe and for fale. A number of the women are 
alfo occupied in fpinning lint, given out by manufacturers 
in towns, for which they receive from 2§d. to 3d. the 
hank.— The inhabitants difcover no particular propenfity 
for the military life, and very few inlift in the army or 
navy. Luxury, in point of drefs, feems to have crept in 
very much of late, owing to the high wages. The people 
in general are humane, moral, and religious. There are few 
quarrels or law-fuits among them, and horning has fcarcely 
been executed againft any one in the parifli for many 
years. They feem to be very much contented with their 
fituation, and, as a proof of this, fhow little or no defire to 
leave the parifli. But ftill they would find thernfelves more 
at eafe, were their leafes permanent, and the caprice, the 
wantonnefs, and high demands of fervants, in fome mea- 
fure checked. — The roads are in a .tolerable ftate, being 
kept in repair by the ftatute-labour, which is exacted in 
kind. The bridges are in good order, being fo kept by 
Government, as the military road paffes through the pa- 
rifli. — Erfe and Englifli are equally fpoken. — In place of 
fome of the more obnoxious taxes of fmall confideration, 
laid on, or now laying on by Miniflry, a ftamp might 
be propofed of a 6 d. on certificates to fervants, from their 
mailers or miftreffes, when they leave their fervice •, to 
journeymen and fliopkeepers, (not apprentices), clerks in 
offices, and the like, when they leave their employment-; 
to all day-labourers, adventurers, handier aftfmen, and 6- 
thers, when they leave one parifli and county, and go to 

another,

another, teftifying, (where there is reafon to do fo), their 
honefty, fobriety, and peaceable behaviour j to be figned 
by the Miniflers, JufHces, Sheriffs, or Magiftrates ; and 
that all thefe defcriptions of perfons fhould be obliged to 
carry along with them fiich certificates upon every remove, 
otherwife be confidered as fufpcfted perfons. Something 
of this kind, it is imagined, would be very produ£Hve, and 
would have a happy tendency in preferving good order, and 
preventing many mifchiefs in fociety. The ftamp might 
likewife be extended to certificates to ftudents, when they 
leave the Univerfity, from the profeffors, attefting not only 
their progrefs in literature, but their general good beha- 
viour while there ; to patrons, when they prefent, certi- 
fying their having qualified for that purpofe ; and to projJ 
bationers alfo, when they accept, of their having taken 
the oaths to enable them to accept ; in ftiort, to all who 
are by law obliged to qualify to Government, on their ac- 
ceptance of any place or office ; to all certificates, proving 
the identity and exigence of perfons, ages, marriages, de- 
grees of propinquity, and the like. From the above might 
be excepted certificates granted to widows and orphans of 
all ranks and denominations •, alfo thofe granted to the poor, 
either recommending them to charity at home, cr to hof- 
pitals, infirmaries, and any public donation ; alfo certifi- 
cates granted to perfons in ficknefs, preventing their afej 
tendance at courts, affixes, or in any other way and place 
where their prefence is required by law. 

All the ploughs are of the old Scotch kind. About 70. 
are in conflant employment, and occafionally in the fpring 
there are more. The tenants have not as yet got any of 
the large mod -wheel carts and waggons ; they ufe the an- 
cient and ftiU common fort of fledges and carts. — A fmall

proved to any height. It may contain about a fcore of fa- 
milies, confifting chiefly of tradefmen, labourers, and the

(COUNTY OF BANFF.) 

By the Rev. Mr Walter Chalmers.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, ifc. 

\ Ccording to fome, Dei/h fignifies a " Linn or Lake.'* 
■* As there is a fmall linn formed by a water-fall, a lit- 
tle to the north of the village, Delkford may fignify the 
ford near the linn. According to others, Lejkford is a cor- 
ruption from Chefsfure, which fignifies " a cold fouth," or 
a " cold place to the fouthward." This alfo anfwers to 
the fituation of the pariih, as it lies fouth from the fea, and 
varies confiderably in climate from the country along the 
coaft. The worthy and ingenious Mr Lawtie, minifter of 
Fordyce, thinks Delkford a corruption from Decius's Fort. 
His opinion is founded upon a belief, that there was a 
Roman ftation in the parifli *. Delkford was originally a 

part 

* Mr Lawtie has formed this opinion from Roman coins found at Delk- 
ford ; remains of fofTes and roads ; limilarity of fituation to ftations in 
England ; exadl diftance between it and the ftation at Rothes (Tuiffis) 
as mentioned in Richard's Itinerary; ancient bridge over Spey on this 
road ; ancient name of the water of Defkford (Cullan) which is not more 
different from Selina (Defkford) than Ituna (now Fyvie) from Itheu

part of the parifh of Fordyce, and was included in Cullen, 
| when that parifh was disjoined from Fordyce ; but the 
I precife period when Defkford was erected into a feparate 
parifh from Cullen is not diflin&amp;ly known. It appears 
from a decreet of ftipend for Fordyce, that the Union fub- 
fifted in the year 1618. The parifh of Defkford lies in 
the prefbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. It 
is bounded upon the W. and N. by the parifh of Ruth- 
ven, on the N. E. and E. by Fordyce, and on the S. and 
S. W. by Grange. Its length from N. to S. may be a- 
bout 5 Englifh miles ; its breadth from E. to W. variable, 
but the greateft about 3 miles. The form of the parifh is 
that of a ftrath, having hills on the E. and W. and a fmall 
opening to the S. and N. The fields lie in a fl oping di- 
rection from the hills towards a fmall river or burn, which 
runs in the hollow, and has its banks covered with a va- 
riety of natural wood. From fprings in the hills on each 
fide of the ftrath, defcend through the fields various rivu- 
lets, which empty themfelves into the burn, and which are 
beautifully edged with natural wood. In many of thefe 
rivulets are water-falls, which, in fummer floods and win- 
ter thaws, defcend through the trees with great impetuofity, 
and exhibit many romantic and pidturefque fcenes. 

Hills. — Upon the E. fide of the ftrath is the Green Hill, 
which was formerly a commonty to the tenants, and af- 
forded a rough kind of pafture. The late Earl of Find- 
later, who was the patron of farming, of manufactures, and 
of every meafure that tended to the improvement of his 
country, tried to bring it into culture. With this view, it 
was inclofed and divided with ditch and hedge, belts of 
Scotch fir and alder planted, and a complete fet of farm- 
houfes built ; but after confiderable expence, and repeated 

trials,

trials, his Lordfhip was difcouraged. The bleak fituatiort, 
the bad expofure, the wetnefs of foil, owing to a pan be- 
neath it, prevented the crops from filling and ripening. 
The inclofures are now let annually for pafture. The 
hedges, by great care and attention, thrive in fome places ; , 
bnt the planting in the belts does not promife to fucceed. 
The prefent Earl of Findlater, about 10 years ago, made 
trial of the larix fir in one of the inclofures to N. E. It : 
thrives at prefent, and gives encouragement to proceed in , 
planting under its fhelter. Upon the W. fide of the ftrath, 
is a hill called Old More, which aflbrds, at a moderate de- 
fiance, a plentiful fupply of excellent peat and turf. The 
late Earl of Findlater parcelled out the Ikirts of this 
hill into fmall lots, and let them at a low rent ; but the 
people are poor, and their improvements not fubftan-- 
tial. 

Soil and Produce. — The foil, along the lower parts of the 
Strath, is generally a loam, with a bottom of ftrong deep 
clay, and produces wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, and good I 
crops of hay. Towards the hills, it is a light black foil, 
and under it, an obftinate pan. Owing to this pan, in fome ■ 
places, and the clay bottom in others, the fields retain the : 
rains long; which circumftance retards the labour in the- 
fpring, and renders the crops late, efpecially in rainy feafons. . 
In favourable feafons, the tenants fell confiderable quantities  
of barley and oats to merchants in Portfoy, who export 
them generally to the fouth frith. In the parilh, there : 
are fpots of moorifh and wafte ground, which might be im- 
proved to advantage. One of confiderable extent adjoin- 
ing to a farm, has been lately trenched and drained, at the 
expence of the heritor. This is a fubftantial and advan- - 
tageous mode of improvement. It not only gives bread :

to the induftnous, and beautifies the face of the country, 
but perhaps proves more lucrative to the landholder, than 
an extenfion of property. In the lower grounds, the foil 
feems peculiarly adapted for the growth of planting ; and 
had the famous Dr Johnfon directed his tour through 
Defkford, and deigned to pull down the blinds of his car- 
riage *, he would have feen many trees not unworthy of 
attention from the moft prejudiced Englifh traveller. In 
an orchard adjoining to an ancient caftle, there is particu- 
larly an afh-tree, which meafures in girth 24 feet jji inches. 
It is called St John's tree, from its vicinity to a chapel of 
that name, to be afterwards mentioned. There is another 
afh in the fame orchard, which meafures in girth 12 feet 
3^ inches, having a fhank 20 feet high, of nearly the fame 
dimenfions. This afh is called Young St John. There is 
alfo a holly tree, perhaps the largeft of its fpecies in this 
country. It meafures, at the diftance of 2 feet from, the 
ground, 8 feet 4-*- inches in girth. In feveral places of the 
"parifh, hedges have been planted ; and they alfo thrive a- 
mazingly, when they receive proper care and attention. — 
There is a quarry of limeftone at Craibltown, which yields 
lime fuperior in ftrength and colour to any in the neigh- 
bourhood. It is confequently in great requeft, and affords 
a profitable employment to many of the tenants, in fum- 
mer and autumn. 

■ Church, and ancient Cajlles. — There is no date upon the 
church ; one pew in it bears 1627, another 1630. It is fi- 
liated nearly in the centre of the ftrath, and, like the ge- 
nerality of churches in this country, is gloomy and mifera- 
bly furnifhed.— Clofe by it is an old caftle, called the Tower 
Vol. IV. Zz of 

* It is faid the Duftor drew up the blinds of his carnage in paffipg 
through Cu!!en,

of Deikford, and faid to have been built by the Sinclairs 
who were the immediate predeceffors of the Ogilvies in- 
the property of the lordfhip of Defkford. It appears to 
have been a pretty fpacious building, in the form of a court; 
but there now remains only one room's length, vaulted be' 
low, with 3 ftoreys and a garret. It bears no date.— Ad- 
joining to this tower, there was formerly a chapel, called 
St John's Chapel, upon one of the walls of which there 
is an infcription, bearing the name of Alexander Ogilvie, 
with the Ogilvies arms and motto, and dated 155 1.— About 
a mile to the S. of the chursh, ftands the caftle of Skuth, 
but of late years become ruinous. It is delightfully fituated 
upon an eminence rifing from the burn, having a peep of 
the fea, and an extenfive view of the ftrath. On each fide 
are water-falls from the hill, defcending between rocks and 
fertile fields, beautifully interfperfed with natural wood. 
This ruin is a finking objeft to paffengers, and a beautiful 
vifta to the furrounding inhabitants. 

Manfe. — The manfe and offices, with flated roofs, were 
built about 5 years ago. The heritor gave a liberal al- 
lowance, indulged the incumbent with his own plan, and 
every accommodation he could defire ; and had the under-' 
taker done his duty, it would have been perhaps a model 
of abundant and genteel accommodation ; but the work, in 
every department, is inefficiently executed. Such inftances 
are too common, and they are exceedingly diftrefiing, both 
to heritors and minifters. The heritors juftly complain of 
the hardfhip of incurring new expence, after recent and 
liberal expenditure ; and minifters muft daily feel the grie- 
vance of inhabiting houfes that will not defend wind and 
rain. Neceffitated to apply for repairs, they are confidered 
as troublefome, and fometimes loaded with much unjuft

•and Illiberal abufe. With a view to remedy theie evils, 
along with the contra&amp;or, an overfeer mould be appointed, 
who ought carefully to infpect the materials, and ha\ e a 
•watchful eye over the work in all its ftages. Atleaft,if this 
is objected to, it ought to be a claufe in the contract, that the 
work, is not to be judged of, nor the contract difcharged, 
until the houfes have been inhabited for 12 months. 

Stipend, Glebe, School, Poor, ifc. — The glebe is about 4 
acres arable, including the garden, with about ijj- acres of 
grafs-ground. The prefent ftipend is L. 44 : 15 : 3-^ Ster- 
ling of money, with 24 bolls j firlot of barley, and the 
fame quantity of meal at 8 s. the boll. The Earl of Find- 
later is patron of the church, and fole proprietor of the pa- 
rim. — The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 2 : 1 : H Sterling of 
money, payable by the heritor, and about 9 bolls 3 firlots 
of meal payable by the tenants. In fummer there are 
generally about 30 fcholars. — The number of poor pre- 
sently on the roll is 32. This uncommonly great number 
may be owing to the abundance of excellent mofs, which 
"has induced them to fettle in its vicinity. The funds be- 
longing to them are, the intereft at 5 per cent, of L, 1000 
Scotch, the weekly collections, which may amount to L. 8 
Sterling a-year, and 6 bolls of meal given annually by 
the heritor. Thefe afford only a fcanty fupply •, but ma- 
ny of the women are able to earn fomething by fpinning 
■.flax, and the men by day-labour, fo that few if any of 
them beg.

There are 46 perfons i^ the parifti who do not properly 
belong to any of the preceding defcriptions. There are 
2 Roman Catholics ; all the reft Prefbytsrians. The pre- 
vailing furnames in the parifti are Reid and Lawrence, 
Of each there are 9 families. The decreafe of inhabitants 
may be accounted for from there having been formerly a 
great number of crofters and fubtenants in the parifti, who 
fubfifted chiefly by manufaduring limeftone. Since that 
time, many of the crofts have been added to the adjacent 
farms, and the tenants reftri&amp;ed to 1, 2 or 3 fubfets, ac- 
cording to the extent of their pofleflions. A reftridion 
in the manufacturing of lime alfo fucceeded, in order to 
prevent the too rapid conmmption of mofs. Thefe cir- 
cumftances muft have occafioned the removal of feveral 
families from the parifti. 

State of Farming, is'c. — Improvements in farming are 
making fome progrefs. The' horfe-hoeing hufbandry has 
of late been introduced with fuccefs. There were about 
20,000 cabbages managed in this way laft feafon. It is 
computed there were 150 acres in fown grafs, 30 in tur- 




1 



nips,

365 



nips, 15 in potatoes, and 10 in lint. Though the foil in 
many places feems favourable for the growth of flax, 
it has not hitherto been extenfively cultivated. The cat- 
tle are of the Scotch breed, but considerably improved in 
fize by the culture of green crops. Thefe are confumed 
in rearing young cattle, which, from the fituation of the 
country, is found more profitable, than in fattening thofe 
that are grown. There are not many fheep, the pafture 
being much confined by the improvements in the hills 
formerly mentioned, and what remains being wet, is ra- 
ther againft their profperity. Some of the Englilh breed, 
and of a crofs breed from them, are paftured upon the 
farms. Thofe which pafture on the hills are of a very 
fmall fize. The farms are f mall ; the largeft not exceed- 
ing 100 acres arable, and the generality from 30 to 60 
acres. The rent varies from L. 1, 10 s. to 2 s. the acre. 
The average may be 9 s. the acre. The leafes are gene- 
rally for 19 years, a term by far too fhort- for fpirited ex- 
ertion and fubftantial improvement. The generality of 
the houfes are poor and uncomfortable ; ana no allowance 
granted for meliorations. There are 2 meal-mills and 1 
lint-mill in the parifli. The real rent is computed to be 
L. 1000 Sterling a-year, including mone} r , victual and cu- 
ftoms. 

Bleachfield. — In the north end of the parifti, there is a 
bleachfield, rented by a manufacturer in Cullen, of about 
10 acres in extent. At this field there are whitened year- 
ly about 150c pieces of cloth, and 1700 fpindles of thread 
and yarn. Owing to a deficiency of water, the machinery 
is frequently wrought by horfes. 

Services. — It is reluctantly to be obferved, that the te- 
nants are bound to perform many fer vices, fuch as calling, 

winning 



3 66 



Siatijlical Account 



winning and leading peats, ploughing and harrowing, ma- 
king hay, cutting down corns, and various carriages. Thefe 
fervices, though not exadled with rigour, are detrimental 
to the intereft of the tenant, and confequently to that of 
the landholder. They often occafion interruptions to ur- 
gent domeftic concerns, fometimes prevent the feafonable 
cultivation of the fields, and not unfrequently hazard the 
fafety of their produce. It is aftonifhing, that heritors, 
in many refpe&amp;s liberal minded and indulgent to their te- 
nants, ftill continue this pernicious v-eftige of feudal flave- 

Wages and Prices — The wages of fervants « have in- 
4 creafed, are increafing, and, in the opinion of the farmer, 
* ought to be diminifhed.' A capable ploughman receives 
from L. 6 to L. 7 ; an inferior man-fervant L. 5 ; and a 
female fervant L. 2, 2 s. a-year. Thefe gains are not now, 
as formerly, laid up for future fupport and provifion, but 
generally expended upon drefs, the defire of which has ob- 
tained great prevalence among them within thefe few 
years. The following wages are given to other labourers 
a-day : To a man for calling peats, 1 s. without victuals, 
in harveft, to a man 10 d. and to a woman 6 d. with 
victuals ; to a day-labourer 6 d. with victuals ; to a mafon 
is. 2d.; to a common wright 8 d. ; and to a tailor 6 d. 
with victuals. The prices of provifions have increafed very 
confidcrably within thefe 30 years. A hen, formerly 
bought for 4d. now gives from 6 d. to 8 d. ; beef and 
mutton fell from 24 d. to 3^ d. the pound; haddocks, 
which fold within thefe five years at 2d. the dozen, 
now give from 8 d. to 1 s. This great and fudden rife in 
value, is faid to be owing to a fcarcity of haddocks along 
this coaft for two years paft. Butter fells from 6d. to 8L 

the

the pound, 24 ounces ; and cheefe from 4 s. to 5 s. the 
ftone weight. 

Roads. — There are 2 principal roads in the parifh. Like 
the generality of roads in this country, they have been 
formed originally by far too narrow ; are not kept in pro- 
per repair ; and, from the nature of the foil, ar.e very un- 
comfortable to travellers, efpecially in winter and wet 
feafons. They are wrought in fpring and autumn by 
flatute-labour, which the people undertake with relu&amp;ance, 
and perform without care. Perhaps it would be better 
to levy the money along with the rents, and to employ 
labourers, under dire&amp;ion of an attentive and capable over- 
feer, during the fummer feafon. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . — The people are in general 
fober, induftrious, and regular in behaviour. There is 
*but one ale-houfe in the parilh, and which is little fre- 
quented. Though not rich, feveral of them are fubftan- 
tial in their (rations. The late unfavourable feafons, with 
the confequent failure of crops, have reduced their circum- 
ftances in fome inftances. Perhaps a total abolition of fer- 
vices, an extenfion of their leafes, and an allowance for 
building neat and comfortable houfes, would tend to me- 
liorate their fituation.- In confequence of their fobriety 
and regularity, the people are prolific and long-lived. The 
wife of one of the elders brought him lately 3 daughters 
at one birth, who are all alive, and doing well. There 
are 3 families confifting of eight children each, and feve- 
ral of 7 and of 6. The laft minifter died about 10 years 
ago, in the 88th year of his age ; and there are now living 
in the parifh one woman aged 91, another 89, and a man 
88,— The parifh of Defkford is a fpot univerfally admired,

on account of its natural beauties and ancient caftles. 
Its vicinity to the fea, and various internal advantages, 
particularly water, wood, mofs and lime, render it one of

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011685">PITTENWEEM</name>, 
(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Nairne.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Air, is'c. 



THIS parifh is fituated in the prefbytery of St An- 
drew's, and Synod of Fife. There is no doubt that 
coal was, in old times, wrought where the town now ftands ; 
and in the town there is a large cove, anciently called a 
weem. The pits produced by the working of the coal, and 
the ftriking natural obje£t of the cove or weem, may have 
given birth to the name of the parifh. Whether Pit- 
tenweem originally was a parifh or not, is uncertain. 
The extent of the parifh is about an Englifh mile and a 
quarter in length, and about half a mile in breadth. It is 
bounded by the parifh of Anftruther-Wefter on the E. ; 
by the fame and Carnbee on the N. 5 and by St Monance on 
the W. j the frith of Forth bounds it on the S. The grounds 
in the parifh are flat-, the foil is in general black and 
loamy, and very fertile •, the air is dry and healthy ; the 
water remarkably foft, while that of the neighbouring 
towns is hard and brackifh. The moft prevalent diftemper 
Vol. IV. 3 A among

among the inhabitants, is the phthifis pulmonalis, or con- 
fumption. 

Fifo, Shipping, \3c. — The fifh caught here have of late 
years been in much fmaller number than formerly. 
Quantities are fometimes fent to the Edinburgh market. 
Within thefe few months, a plan was formed for catching 
turbot with nets, and fo getting them alive to fend up to 
London \ but the trials have not been as yet very fuccefs- 
ful. A confiderable quantity of lobfters are caught here 
and in the neighbourhood, and fent to London. — The people 
here are generally fond of a feafariug life, hut few have 
entered the navy as volunteers. They in general diicover 
an averfion to the army, and I do not think more than % 
or 3 from the pariih have iniifted during the lalt 30 years. 
At prefent the number of boats is only 5, and of veffels 4. 
From a re ord of the town, it appears that prior to 1639, 
the flapping here was confiderable. From that year to the 
1645, the town fuffered greatly in that article. It appears 
from that record, that there belonged at leaft to the town 
13 fail of large veffels ; all of which were either taken by 
the enemy, wrecked, or fold in confequence of the death 
of the commanders and mariners" at the battle of Kilfyth. 

Coal, ifc — The whole furface of the pariih is fuppofed 
to cover a continued field of coal, which lies in a very ex- 
traordinary way, firft taking one dire&amp;ion, then a contrary 
one, with different dipps. The property of it belongs to 
Sir John Anftruther. When it began to be wrought is 
uncertain. It is believed to have been wrought by Oliver 
Cromwell, who took poffeffion of the Earl of Kelly's eftate, 
of which it then formed a part ; and a pit is ftill to be feen, 
that goes by the name of Cromwell's pit. In pad times, 
as much coal was taken out as could be procured without 

a

a fire engine. After the working had been long difcon- 
tinued, Sir John Anftruther, about 20 years ago, erected a 
fire engine, and has fince that period put out an immenfe 
quantity of coal, and made fait to a large extent. There 
are 9 falt-pans. The average expence for the coal and fait 
working is about L. 50 weekly. The colliers are all free, 
ftand engaged by the year, and are paid in proportion to 
the work they refpedively perform. A good and labo- 
rious collier will earn about 18 s. a-week. 

Population.— According to Dr Webfter, the number was 
939. At prefent it is 1157, all rending in the town, except 4 
families. Males, 541; females, 616; that is, nearly 30 
females for 27 males. The difproportion between the num- 
ber of males and females, may be owing to a number of 
the young men betaking themfelves to a feafaring life ; 
and there being no Slipping here, although there is a fea- 
port, many of them fix the refidence for their families at 
the places from whence they fail, and fo ceafe to appear on 
the parilh-roll. Befides, no manufactures being carried on 
in this place and neighbourhood, induces another clafs of 
young men to repair to thofe towns where manufactures flou- 
rilh, and to fettle there. The females are generally fta- 
tionary. The average of births is 37, of deaths 25 ; from 
which it appears, that multiplying births by 26, and deaths 
ky 36, will produce numbers that would fall fhort of the 



actual population.

From this it appears, that the population at the end of the

what it was at the middle of the current century. The 
failure of the herring-fifhing, and of the French and Eaft 
Country trade, diminifhed, and the erefHon of Sir John

The population has increafed very confiderably within thefe 
23 years, owing to the colliery and fait- works. The pro- 
portion between the annual births and whole population, 
is as 1 to 31 j between the annual marriages and whole 
population, as 1 to 165 ; between the annual deaths and 
whole population, as 1 to 46 ; between bachelors and mar- 
ried

373 



ried men, (meaning by a bachelor, a man at the age of 
25, and a houfeholder), as 1 to 18. Marriages, at an a- 
verage, produce about 4 children. The number of inha- 
bited houfes is 185, and the average of inhabitants for each 
exceeds 6, and does not reach 7. 

Agriculture. — Formerly the whole lands in the parifil 
were employed in railing corn. Two-thirds of the ground 
was fown with rough bear, and the remaining third with 
wheat, oats, peas and beans. Still a larger proportion of 
bear and barley is fown than of any other grain. Of late 
years green crops have been introduced. Fields are laid 
down with clover and rye-grafs ; cabbages and kail are 
raifed in the fields, for winter food. The average rent of 
lands may be L. 1, 15 s. an acre. For the beft, L. 2 : 12 : 6 
is paid. The land is generally not inclofed, and the rent 
is fuch, that the proprietors imagine the increafe would not 
be a fufficient compenfation for the expence of inclofing. 

Stipe/id, Church, Poor, Ifc. — The value of the living, 
including the glebe, and converting the vidlual at 10 s. the 
boll (which is rather a low converlion) is L. 82. The 
patron is Sir John Anftruther. When the church was 
built is uncertain. It certainly was not originally intend- 
ed for a church. Concerning it there are two traditions, 
one of which is, that it was fome of the cloifters of an 
abbey, and the other, that it was the large barn or gra- 
nary where the corns of the abbey were depofited, 
which laft feems probable, The manfe was built about 
the 1720, and received reparations afterwards. There are 
22 proprietors, 7 of thefe are communities, viz. 3 kirk- 
feflions, 2 fea and 2 trade focieties ; 10 of the heritors re- 
' fide in the burgh. — The number of poor in the parilh is 
proportionally great. At the two laft general diftribu- 

tions,

tions, upwards of 60 received charity. The funds for 
their fupport, arifing from lands and weekly collections, 
are from L. 50 to L. 60 Sterling yearly. The failors 
have a fund, confiderably above L. 100 a year, for the 
fupport of their own poor. They are able to make a 
very decent provifion for the widows, both of fhipmaflers, 
and of common mariners. This fociety obtained about 6 
years ago a royal charter. The trades have likewife 2 
fund for their poor, which I believe is about L. 20 a-year. 
There are other two charitable focieties, but they are ftill 
in infancy, and their annual produce is inconfiderable, but 
from the nature of them they mufl grow. One of thefe 
focieties is formed by the people connected with the col- 
liery. This feems to be a moft laudable and humane in- 
ftitution, as accidents often happen at collieries, and it 
were to be wifhed that it generally obtained at all public 
works. 

Prices and Wages. — The prices of provifions are nearly 
doubled within thefe 3c years. Beef, veal, mutton, lamb 
and pork, are generally fold at 4 d. the lb. ; geefe, at 2 s. 
6 d. ; ducks at 8 d. ; hens at 11 d. ; and rabbits at 3 d. ; 
butter is generally 8 d. the lb. ; grain is generally 2 s. the 
boll below the Mid Lothian fiars. The fuel made ufe of 
is coal, and the price of 400 weight is 1 s. 3 d. carriage in- 
cluded. The wages of domeftic female fervants are gene- 
rally L. 2, io s. a-year. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The people in general are 
ceconomical. Land is often changing proprietors, and the 
general price is 25 years purchafe. The people do enjoy 
the comforts of fociety, and are contented with their 
iituation. — The roads in the parifh are very indifferent.

They are kept in repair by the ftatute-labour, which is 
generally commuted. Laft feffion of Parliament paflkd a 
bill for turnpike roads in Fife, and the great road from E. 
to W. will pafs along by this town. — Kelp is made here, 
and the average quantity is 8 tons yearly. — The iiland of 
Mey, where a light is regularly kept, was a part of the 
priory, and is in the lordflup of Pittenweem. — The 
principal bay neai-eft this is Largo Bay, and the fafeft 
harbour is Ely, 2 miles farther up the frith than 
Pittenweem. — One of the fleet of the Spanilh Armada 
came to this coaft in great diftrefs, and put in to the 
harbour of Anftruther Eafter, where the people were 
hofpitably treated.— In the year 1779, Paul Jones, with 
his little fquadron, lay for feveral hours off this harbour, 
about half a mile from the fhore. The pilot and his 
crew went off, believing they were Britilh fhips, and 
requested fome powder, which was given. The crew were 
permitted immediately to return, but the pilot was detain- 
ed, treated very uncivilly, and was not fet at liberty, un- 
til after the engagement Paul Jones had with our fleet. — 
There is a limeftone loch to the weftward of the town, 
which produces a confiderable quantity of lime annually. — 
The cove or weem within the burgh is fituated half way 
between the beach and an old abbey. It is large and ca- 
pacious, confiiting of 2 apartments. At the further end 
of the inner one, there is a well of excellent water. At 
the junction of the two apartments, there is a (lone-flair, 
which carried you up a little way to a fubterraneous 
paflage, which led to the abbey, where was another flair, 
which landed in the great dining hall of the abbey. The 
two flairs ftill remain ; but of late years the fubterraneous 
paflage was deflroyed, by the impending earth linking, 
•and cutting off the communication. The fubterraneous 

paflage,

— Dr Douglas, the prefent Bilhop of Saliftmry, was bom,^ 
and received the firft principles of his education here. His 
father was in the mercantile line. — Pittenweem was con- 
flicted a royal burgh, by a charter from King James V. 
in 1547. In the town's charter-cheft there are many old 
writings, which I cannot decipher. The following extract 
from their records I tranfmit : 

' Pittenweem, decimo-quarto Feb. 1651. 
* The bailies and council being convened, and having re- 

* ceived information that his Majefty is to be in progrefs

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q425611">DUNSE</name>, 
(COUNTY OF BERWICK.) 

By the Rev. Dr Robert Bowmaker.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil and Air. 

T Erwi^kshire is nominally divided into three diftri&amp;s, 
-*- JP the Merfe, Lammermoor and Lauderdale. The Merfe 
is that flat part of the county, which is bounded by the ri- 
ver Tweed on the S. and S. E. ; by part of Tiviotdale and 
Lauderdale on the S. W. and W. and by the Lammermoor 
hills on the N. W. and N. with the town of Berwick at 
the eaft point. It is a plain of at leaft 25 miles from E. to 
W. and 15 from N. to S. and takes the name of Merfe 
from being a border county. At the head of this plain, 
and in the very centre of the county, ftands the town of 
Dunfe, encompaffed on the W. N. and E. by the Lamrner- 
1 moor hills. Its name is derived from the old Celtic word 
Dun, ' a hill,' its original lite having been on the top of a 
moft beautiful little hill, which is called Dunfe Law. This 
hill ftands upon a bafe of between 2 and 3 miles in circum- 
ference, and rifes in a gradual afcent on all fides, till it ter- 
minates in a plain of nearly 30 acres ; the whole hill may 
contain about 250 acres. It is 630 feet above the level of 

the 



of Dunfe.

the fea. Afterwards the town was built at the foot of the 
hill, on the S. where it now Hands. Dunfe is the prefby- 
tery-feat of that name, and belongs to the Synod of Merfe 
and Tiviotdale. — The parifli is an oblong fquare of 8 miles 
from N. to S. and 5 from E. to W. It is bounded on the 
N. by the parifli of Abbey St Bathan's, on the N. W. by 
Longformachiis, on the W. and S. by Langtoun, on the S. 
E. by Edrom, and on the E. and N. E. by Prefton and 
Bunkle. That part of. the parifli which runs up into Lam- 
merrnoor is hilly, and very much covered with heath; and 
thofe tracks of it which are cultivated are, in general, a 
lharp, gravelly, dry foil, on which the tenants grow very 
good barley, oats, turnip and clover. In the fouth part of 
it, the foil is a rich, light, deep loam, fome of it a ftrong 
clay, and very fertile. — The air is dry and healthy. The 
ague was a very prevalent diftemper about 40 years ago, 
and alfo the putrid fever, which laft, in fome particular 
years, cut off a great number of the inhabitants ; but in con- 
fequence of the rapid improvements in agriculture, begun 
at firft by the gentlemen, and followed up with great fpirit 
by the tenants, the country has been much drained, and the 
climate greatly changed. The cleaning of the ftreets of the 
town, and of ditches in parks adjoining to it on the 
fouth, has alfo greatly contributed to the health of the in- 
habitants. It may be remarked alfo, that 40 years ago, 
when the ague was very prevalent in the Merfe, it was not 
known in Lammermoor, nor is yet. 

Dunfe Spaw. — There are no mineral fprings in the pa- 
rifli. But there is one within a very few yards of the boun- 
dary, on the fouth, in the eftate of Mrs Carr of Nilbet, in 
the parifli of Edrom. It is called Dunfe Spaw, from its 
vicinity to the town, being only a mile diftant. It was 
difcovered in 1747, and was very much reforted to for fe- 

veral

Statijlical Account 



veral years. Some years ago, it was repaired at the ex- 
pence of a gentleman, who was cured of a ftomach difcrder, 
by the Spaw water. This mineral water is nearly of the 
fame kind with that of Tunbridge, the moft celebrated 
chalybeate water in England. Dunfe Spaw, according to 
the analyfis of it, publilbed by Prpfeffor Home at Edin- 
burgh, 1 761, contains iron, fea-falt, a marley earth, and 
fixed air, or what is called aerial acid. Like moft other 
chalybeate waters, it does not carry well, unlefs the ufual 
methods are pra&amp;ifed, in tranfpordng the foreign chaly- 
beate waters. Although the water may be thus carried to 
a great diftance, without lofing its properties in a confider- 
able degree, yet it muft unqueftionably be drunk with 
greater advantage on the fpot. This water is found very 
falutary in complaints of the ftomach, weaknefs of the in- 
teftines, diabetes, and a great variety of other diforders. 
The beft months for drinking Dunfe Spaw, are June, July, 
Auguft, and September, when the valitudinarian, and per- 
form fubjecl to chronic diforders, may, by a courfe of thefe 
waters, reap every advantage to be procured by any cha- 
lybeate water whatever. 

River. — The water of Whitadder abounds in trout, but 
of no high flavour, nor rich in quality. There is alfo in 
this river a larger fort of fifh, called a whitling; it is a 
large fine trout, from 16 inches to 2 feet long, and well 
grown ; its fiefti is red, and high coloured, like falmon, and 
of full as fine a flavour ; it is a moft delicate fiflh, and affords 
moft excellent fport to the angler. It goes to the fea in its 
feaf m, and returns ftrong, vigorous, and healthy ; but if, 
from the fmallnefs of the river in a dry feafon, it is pre- 
vented from getting to the fea, it becomes lank, fmall, and 
fpiritlefs, and lofes its red colour and flavour. The Whit-, 
sdder falls into the Tweed, about 12 miles E. from Dunfe, 

and. 



of Dunfe. 



38i 



and 3 miles above Berwick. From the Tweed, which a- 
bounds in fine falmon, a great many of thefe filh get into 
the Whitadder, and in the months of September and Oc- 
tober are found 30 miles up that river, palling into the fmall 
brooks among the hills in Lammermoor, till their backs 
are not covered, and there lodge their fpaurn among the 
gravel. No part of the Whitadder is rented, and the fillies 
are killed with the rod or lifter. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, about 
40 years ago, the numbers were 2593. Within thefe 60 
years laft paft, the number of inhabitants in the town of 
Dunfe has been doubled ; and though the town has not in 
that time extended itfelf much to any of its wings, yet ma- 
ny empty fpaces have been built upon, and many old houfes, 
which contained only 1 or 2 families, have been rebuilt up- 
on larger plans, and now contain from 4 to 8, and fome of 
them 10 families. There are fcarce any veftiges of old 
houfes. Many new ones have been built of late years, and 
feveral are now building. By a very exacl: lift, taken 3 
years ago, the number of fouls in the town was 2324 ; in 
the country part of the parifti, 1000. In all, 3324.

3§ 2 Statiftkal Account 



In the 1782, the fmall-pox raging, accounts for the number 
of deaths that year. In 1733, there were 130 children, 
who died of the fmall-pox in the fpace of 3 months. In 
1783, one man died at the age of 99, whofe baptifm is re- 
corded in the regifter now before me, in 1684. Another, 
a pauper, died this year, aged 93. There are now living 
iu the town 12 perfons, between 80 and 90. One 90, who 
fupports his family by his own labour, and enjoys as good 
health, and has as fine a flow of fpirits as any perfon at the 
age of 25. , Another, in my own family, (my father), who 
was born the 4th of July 1694, and is at prefent (April 
1 791) in perfect health, and going about. There is 1 phy- 
fician, 3 furgeons, and 8 gentlemen of the law in the town. 
There is an Antiburgher, a Burgher, and a Relief minifter, 
whofe congregations are made up of a mixed multitude 
from all quarters. Three weekly carriers to Edinburgh, 
1 to Kelfo, 1 to Dunbar, 1 to Eyemouth, 2 to Berwick, 
twice a week. 



Agriculture, ISc. — There are 14 tenants in the parifh, 
who rent from L. 100 to L.300 a-year; and about the fame 
number, who rent from L. 30 to L. 100. The parifh is in 
general inclofed. The bondages to which the tenants were 
formerly fubje&amp;ed are now entirely done away ; there is 
nothing but rent to be paid. Wheat, barley, and oats, are 
the principal crops of grain ; turnips are raifed in great 
quantities, and turn to good account, in feeding fheep and 
black cattle, and let from L. 4, 4s. to L. 5, 5 s. an acre; 
and in the immediate neighbourhood of Dunfe, are let from 
L. 5, 5 s. to L. 7, 7 s. and are ufed in the town chiefly for 
milch cows. Cabbages are alfo planted in confiderable 
quantities, and are more fuitable for cows than turnips are, 
as they do not fcour the cattle fo much ; and if the fpoiled 
leaves of the cabbages are taken off, the milk, cream, and 

butter 



of Dunfe. 383 



butter will be as good as from grafs ; befides, the fpoiled 
leaves may be given to young cattle, and nothing is loft. 
Potatoes too are raifed in great quantities, and the land for 
them is let from L. 4 to L. 6 an acre •, the proprietor or te- 
nant only ploughs it, and the renter cleans them, digs them 
up, and carries them home. A great deal of grais-feeds 
are fown annually, but little flax is raifed, and no hemp. 
Very great improvements are making in the breed of 
Iheep and black cattle. In the S. part of the parifh, the 
lands are let from 1 5 s. to L. 1 an acre ; in the NT. part, 
which is high ground, the land is not let by the acre, but 
a cumulus rent is paid for the whole farm. Such has been 
the fpirit of improvement within thefe laft 50 years, that 
farms in the parilh, which were let at L. 35 and L. 40, pay 
now L. 210, and the tenants doing well. In no county of 
Great Britain is there a more refpeclable tenantry, than 
there is at prefent in the county of Berwick ; many of 
them rent from L. 500 to L. 1200 a-year ; men well in- 
formed in fcience, and moft intelligent and induftrious in 
their profeflion ; and in every 10 or 15 years, fome of them 
are purchafing property of L. 200, and even L. 500 a-year; 
on which they enjoy, otium cum dignitate, the juft reward 
of their attention, labour, diligence, and good fenfe ; and 
all this under the great difadvantages, of being diftant from 
10 to 20 miles from lime and markets, and in a county 
where victual is cheaper than in any county in Scotland. 
There is plenty of marl, but lime, though diftant, is con- 
fldered as a cheaper manure. The county of Berwick ex- 
ports from the ports of Berwick and Eyemouth, above 
80,000 bolls of victual, and fully the fame quantity is car- 
ried annually to the weekly markets of Edinburgh, Dal- 
keith, Haddington, and Dunbar. Land is fold from L. 30 
to L. 80 an acre. Houfes are rented from 10 s. to L. 20. 
Property does not often change, either in lands or houfes. 

Manufactures.

Statiflical Account 



Manufaflures. — There are no manufa&amp;ures carried on 
here to any great extent ; an woollen manufacture is to be 
let on foot at Whitfunday firft, the houfes are building, 
and the fpinning machines are already brought from Eng- 
land. There is a very fmall tannery ; but it is in contem- 
plation to have one foon upon a large fcale by a fubfcrip- 
tion, in fhares of at leaft L. 25 the fhare, by the inhabi- 
tants. Hides to the extent of. L. 400 a-year have been 
bought here by commiffion, and fent to Haddington, 
where they are tanned, the expence of carriage, L. 33. 
We have here a very large bleachfield. 

Proprietors, Ifc. — The number of heritors is above 40, 
12 of whom poffefs property from L. 100 to L. 2oco a- 
year in the parifh •, the reft are fmall portioners, from 1 
to 30 or 40 acres ; only a few of the principal heritors 
refide. Robert Hay, Efq; of Drumelzier is proprietor of 
one half of the parifh ; he refides at Dunfe caftle, a large 
ftately venerable old building, fituated about half a mile 
above the town, and commanding an extenfive view to 
the fouth, as far as the Cheviot hills. It is furrounded 
with riling grounds on the weft and north, and the beau- 
tiful hill of Dunfe Law on the north eaft. On the north 
and weft too, are fevera] hundred acres of thriving plant- 
ing, much of it very old. In the bofom of this planta- 
tion is a fine bafon of water called the hen -pond ; it is a- 
bove a mile in circumference, and in fummer vaft num- 
bers of wild ducks refort to it. 

Stipend, School and Poor. — The ftipend is 66 bolls 1 fir- 
lot barley, 66 bolls 1 firlot oats, 64 bolls meal, and L. 40 
in money, with 91^ acres glebe. Mr Hay of Drumelzier 
is patron. A moil complete and excellent manfe was 
built in J 783. A new church is now building on a large 



of Dunfe. 



385 



fcale, and moft elegant plan. — The fchool of Dunfe has 
long been in very great repute. The number of fcholars 
is from 90 to ico, 60 or 70 of whom are learning the 
languages, the others are learning writing, arithmetic, 
mathematics, &amp;c. The fees for the languages are 5 s. the 
quarter ; 3 s. 6 d. for writing and arithmetic, and 2 s. 6 d„ 
for Englifh ; book-keeping, and the higher parts of ma- 
thematics and navigation, are taught by the piece at a 
certain agreed fum. The falary is L. 12, and a houfe well 
calculated for accommodating boarders. The board is on- 
ly L. 16 a-year. There is alfo a female boarding fchool, 
where every branch of female education can be got on 
the following terms : Reading and plain white feam to- 
gether, at 5 s. the quarter ; tambour and coloured work, 
and embroidery at 7 s. 6 d. ; mufic at 10 s. 6 d. the month, 
or L. 5, 5 s. a-year; writing 5 s. and dancing 6 s. the 
month ; board L. 16 a-year. The prefent dire&amp;rix has 
a falary of L. 18 from the heritors, and other inhabitants, 
for a certain number of years. — The number of poor up- 
on the roll is at prefent 90, the annual amount of the con- 
tributions for their relief is L. 230. There are no lega- 
cies, nor mortified money. The funds for their fupport 
arife, ift, from an afleflment upon the lands, according to 
the valued rent, the one half paid by the landlords, and 
the other by the tenants-, at prefent it is 12 month eels 
upon the lands. 2dly, The feveral incorporations pay 
quarterly into the fund, £.3:9:6 Sterling. 3dly, The 
unincorporated, viz. the furgeons, lawyers, merchants, pu- 
blicans, &amp;c are afTeffed annually by themfelves ; that af- 
feflment at prefent is L. 3, 19 s. the quarter. The feffion 
alfo pay a proportion of their collections weekly into the 
general fund. Thefe feveral funds are collected by an over- 
fecr of the poor, appointed by the heritors. When at 
any time the fund is unequal to the expenditure, a meet-

ing of the heritors is called, and an additional affeflment 
is laid on, (but only upon the heritors and tenants), p ro . 
portioned to the demand. Every pauper who comes upon 
the roll muft give in an allignation to all the effects be- 
longing to them. The poor too are buried at the expence 
of the fund, amounting to 17 s. each, if adults. 

Prices, Wages T i£c. — About 50 years ago, the prices o£ 
provifions were greatly below what they are at this time ■ 
butcher meat was not then fold by weight, but when 
weighed after having been bought, was found not to 
exceed i^d. the lb. Dutch weight for beef, mutton, and 
pork ; lamb was bought at 6 d. and 7 d. the quarter. At 
prefent beef and mutton are 4 d. pork 3^ d. veal from 
3d. to 5 d. and lamb, even in July, is never below 3 d. 
the lb. ; at prefent (the beginning of April) it is 1 s. the 
lb. Wheat is from L. 1, j s. to L. 1, 12 s. ; barley from 
12 s. to 16 s. and oats from 10 s. to 14 s. the boll upon an 
average; but the Berwickfhire boll is a 24th part, or ~ peck 
in the boll, larger than the Linlithgow meafure ufed in 
the Lothians. The farmers fervants who have families, 
and engage by the year, are called hinds, and receive 10 
bolls oats, 2 bolls barley, and 1 boll peas, which two laft 
articles are called hummel corn, a cow grazed in the 
fummer, and ftraw through the winter, boll potatoes 
planted, fome lintfeed fown, with fome other fmall con- 
liderations, the whole amounting to about L. 13. A An- 
gle man fervant receives from L. 6 to L. 8 a-year, with 
victuals, but few fingle fervants are now employed. La- 
bourers, by the day, are paid 1 s. in fummer, and 9 d. and 
10 d. in the winter quarter; in hay-time, 1 s. 6 cL with- 
out victuals, except a bottle of ale at noon, and another 
in the afternoon, with f d. worth of bread to each. In 
harveft, the wages of a man are from is. to is. 6 d. with 

vidluals t 



of Dunfe.

victuals, thofe of a woman, 10 d. and. is.. The wages of 
a mafon are from 1 s. 4 d. to 2 s. the day, a carpenter 
from 1 s. to 1 s. 8 d. The wages received by the different 
dalles are fully fufficient for the fupport of their families ; 
and fuch as are fober, and have been fortunate in getting 
indubious wives, ibmetimes fave confiderably. When 
any fall into want from bad health or misfortune, they 
receive an interim aliment from the poor's funds ; they 
are often relieved and fupported by the voluntary con- 
tributions of the inhabitants at large. Upon the diftrefs of 
any family, two of their neighbours, by going through 
the town with a iubfcription paper, will, in a few hours, 
collect feveral pounds. Women fervants have from L. 3 
to L. 4 a-year. This being a border county, is the caufe 
of the high wages of the labourers, &amp;c. 

Ale-houfes. — There are no fewer than 27 ale-houfes in 
the town of Dunfe, many of which are kept by low people, 
who do not depend upon their retail altogether, but who 
carry on, at the fame time, fome other profeflion, or ra- 
ther from a fpirit of indolence, they keep an ale-houfe, to 
help the emoluments of the profeflion they followed ; 
which profeflion, in confluence of the habit of idlenefs 
and drunkennefs which they have contracted, is foon in a 
great meafure laid afide, and the family reduced to beg- 
gary. It is, in confequence of people of this defcription 
keeping ale-houfes, that others of the fame ftation are in- 
duced, from old acquaintance with them, to frequent their 
houfes, and which frequently grows into fuch a habit, as 
greatly to hurt the circumftances, and difturb the peace of 
their families. Befides, 'tis in houfes of this fort, that the 
profligate of both fexes find lodging, where they get in- 
toxicated, and from whence they fally forth, in the dark 
hours of the night, to commit depredations on the inno- 
cent, 



Statijlical Account 



cent, virtuous and unful'pefting members of the communi- 
ty. 'Tis in thefe houfes alfo that they depofit the fruits 
of their depredations, and are furnilhed with means of fu- 
ture intoxication. It is a laudable practice (authorifed by 
law) which feveral counties have of late adopted, not to 
allow any perfon to take out a licence to keep an ale- 
houfe, without that perfon mall produce, from the mini,

ment can be got as in any place in Great Britain. 

Poft-office.— Formerly the Dunfe bag came by Old- 
cambus to Dunfe, afterwards the office was removed from 
Oldcambus to the Prefs, and, of late years, has been re- 
moved to Berwick, by which circuitous conveyance, our 
Edinburgh letters are charged 4 d. inftead of 3 d. in con- 
fequence of the diftance round by Berwick, being more 
than 50 miles. But though the bag for the convenience 
of the port-office is now fent on to Berwick, and the di- 
ftance by that means increafed, there is no reafon that we 
mould pay more for our letters now, than we would have 
done, had they continued to be fent from the Prefs. Be- 
fides, the letters to Kelfo go alfo by Berwick, which is 
farther from Berwick than Dunfe ; the inhabitants of that 
town, upon an application to the General Poft-office at E- 
dinburgh, got a deduction of a fourth upon their Edin- 
burgh letters, but the memorial from the town of Dunfe 
upon the fame fubjefr was treated with fullen filence. 
The letters alfo have been accuftomed to be delivered, 
time immemorial, to the inhabitants to whom they were 
addrefled, at their houfes ; but of late years the man who 
holds the office here, has made a demand of x d. more 
than the pottage, for the letters delivered by him. We 

have

matter General at Edinburgh, in which we fhewed how 
the law flood, and the feveral inftances in which it had 
been decided in the Courts of England againft the poft- 
mafters, but no redrefs has been obtained. We have at 
laft fent a copy of the fame memorial to the Poft-mafter 
General at London, with the different cafes referred to ; 
and the only anfwer which we have got, which was in the 
middle of March, was, that the memorial was under con- 
fideration : As that is likely to be all the anfwer which 
we are to get, we have refolved to demand that juftice 
from the laws of the land, which our fellow fubjecls have 
received, and which thefe offices have refufed us. 

Hills. — Cockburn Law rifes from a bafe of at leaft 6 
miles in circumference to a conical top, which, on the 
north and fouth fides, is a mile from the bafe, and is fur- 
rounded by the river Whitadder on 3 fides. On the 
north fide, and a bttle below the middle of the hill, are 
the ruins of a very old building, by fome called Wooden's 
hall, but commonly called Edin's or Edwin's hall. It 
confiffs of 3 concentric ci«cles, the diameter of the inner- 
moft 40 feet, the thicknefs of the wall 7 feet, the fpace 
between the innermoft and the fecond wall 7 feet, be- 
tween that and the third or outer wall 10 feet ; the fpaces 
between thefe walls have been arched over, and divided 
into cells of 12, 16 and 20 feet long ; they feem to have 
been of confiderable height, but as all the roofs have long 
fince fallen in, the height cannot be precifely afcertained. 
The fpace within the inner circle feems never to have 
bad any roof, as there are no fragments nor ruins there. 
The building is not cemented with any fort of mortar ; 
the ftones, which are whin, and many of them very large, 
are all grooved into one another, that is, the concavity of

the one receiving the convexity of the other, fo that they 
are locked together, and yet all thefe locks are different : 
It is fuppofed to have been a Piftifh building, and after- 
wards ufed as a military ftation. What the original name 
•was, we have no tradition of; but* in after times, it has 
gone by the name of Edin or Edwin's hall, from a Prince 
of that name, who was King of Northumberland, and 
whole dominions extended as far north as the frith of 
Forth. From this Prince the city of Edinburgh took its 
name. It would appear that Edwin had taken poffeffion 
of this ftrong poft, for a military ftation, for an army of 
obfervation, as the Danes were frequently invading Scot- 
land, both by fea and land. There are feveral of thefe 
military ftations in this neighbourhood, both to the eaft 
and weft of Cockburn Law. This hill, being 900 feet a- 
bove the level of the fea, is a fine land-mark for mariners 
on the German Ocean, and is feen at a great diftance from 
that fea, confequently any fleet from the north would be 
eafily and readily defcried from that ftation. 

Learned Men — The celebrated metaphyfician and theo- 
logift, John Duns Scotus, was born in Dunfe in 1274. 
Camden, in his Britannia, and the authors of the Biogra- 
phia Britannica contend that he was born at Dunftone in 
Northumberland, but bring no argument, but their bare 
aflertion to fupport it. Nothing is more certain, than that 
the family, of which this extraordinary man was a branch, 
were heritors of the parifh of Dunfe, and continued to be 
proprietors of that eftate which now belongs to Mr Chri- 
ftie, till after the beginning of the prefent century, called 
from them in all ancient writings Duns's half of Gruel- 
dykes. Thefe lands are adjoining to the town of Dunfe. 
The father of John Duns Scotus had been a younger 
brother of the family of Grueldykes, and refided in the 

town 



of Dunfe.

town of Dunfe. The fite of the houfe where he was born 
is ftill well known, and has been in ufe, generation after 
generation, to be pointed out to the young people by their 
parents, as the birth place of fo great and learned st 
man. 

Mifcellaneous Obfer-vations. In 1782-3, when vi&amp;ual 

was at a very high price, the heritors, and other inhabitants 
in good circumftances, contributed very largely for the flip- 
port of the poor and indigent, and fold at leaft 20 bolls 
weekly, from the 3d of December 1782, to the middle of 
Auguft 1783, at one-third below the market-price. The 
inhabitants are humane and generous to all real objects. 
They are alfo induftrious and (Economical, and contented 
with their fituation and circumftances. — There is a public 
library in Dunfe, which was eftablifhed in 1768, confuting; 
of about 60 mares, at L. 2 a ftiare, and 6 s. a-year ; the 
fliares are transferable, like any other property. From the 
original L. 2 for each fhare, and the 6 s. alfo advanced for 
the year's reading, we were enabled to buy at once near 
L. 150 worth of books, and from L. 12 to L. 15 has been 
expended annually upon books ever lince that period. — 
There are 3 great fairs in Dunfe. At thefe is a very great 
ihew of fine cattle and horfes. At leaft L. 20, : 00 Sterling 
is received for cattle at thefe fairs, which are chiefly pur- 
chafed by Englifh dealers. There is alfo a good deal of 
fheep. — The roads were originally made and kept up by 
the ftatute-labour, except the two great roads from Edin- 
burgh to London, the one by Greenlaw and Coldftream, 
the other by the Prefs and Berwick, which were made by 
fums borrowed by the gentlemen of the county upon the 
turnpikes. The ftatute-labour is now commuted at 7 s. 6 d. 
each horfe, and 3 s. on houfeholders. The queftion re-

the two ports of Berwick and Eyemouth, is now agitating, 
among the proprietors, but not yet fettled. — There was a 
confiderable common in the environs of Dunfe, confifting 
of feveral hundred acres, a few years ago, that has been 
divided ; by which a large piece of knd, which had been 
for ages paft an eye-fore to every traveller, and of no value 
to any, is now an ornament to the neighbourhood, and pro- 
fitable to many. — We have abundance of freeftone quar- 
ries in the parifh, and alfo in the neighbourhood, the rock 
lying from 3 feet to 10 below the furface. There is alfo 
an inexhauftible fund of whinftone within a mile of the 
town, all above ground, lying in immenfe large (labs, one 
upon another, and may be broken into the fhape of flags, 
with the leaft trouble, and of any fize. We are 15 miles 
diftant from coal, and bring them all from Northumber- 
land, as alfo our lime. — On the 18th September 1790, was 
found, 3 miles S. E. from Dunfe, a bird very rare in Scot- 
land. It was killed by a cat, and difcovered to be the bird 
called Hoopoe by the Englifh, Wedhop by the Germans, 
the Upupa of the ancients, defcribed by Pliny, Ariftotle, 
Faufanias, ./Elian, &amp;c. The bird is common in Germany, 
and fometimes even in England. A few days after, ano- 
ther Upupa, of a greener colour, was feen flying about the 
garden at Kimmergham, but foon difappeared. — There is 
a very remarkable wall in the parifh, inclofing near 100 
acres of ground, called Borthwick Park, belonging to the 
family of Langton ; it is of moorftone, without any fort of 
mortar, and never had any covering, either of fod or any 
thing elfe ; it has flood 179 years, and never was known 
to need any repair till within thefe 4 years ; and though 
it is but low, yet, in confequence of the unevennefs of its 
texture, and the ruggednefs of its top, neither horfes nor 
cattle ever ventured to leap it.</p>

PARISH of <name ref="NA">ALVAH</name>, 
(COUNTY OF BANFF.) 

By the Rev. Mr George Sangster.</head> 

<p>Situation, Surface, ISc. 

r I "HE parifh of Alvah is fituated in the prefbytery of 
-*- Turriff, and Synod of Aberdeen. Its form is irre- 
gular; extending in length about 6 Englifh miles, and at 
its greateft breadth to nearly the fame diftance, but in o- 
ther places to only 3 or 2. On the N. and N. W. it is 
bounded by the parifh of Banff; on the S. W. by Mar- 
noch; on the S. by Forglen ; on the S.E. by Turriff; 
and on the E. and N. E. by King Edward and Gamery. 
The river Dovern enters this parifh about a mile below 
Forglen, the feat of Lord Banff, and after many beautiful 
windings through a very fertile valley, leaves it about 2 
miles from the fea. It abounds with falmon, trout, and 
eel, and is frequented by wild ducks, widgeons, teals, he- 
os, &amp;c. On the E. bank lie the eftates of Dunlugaa 
and Inrichney, feparated by the intervention of a part of 
the parifh of King Edward ; and on the W. the lands of 
Mountblairie, Auchinbadie, Sandlaw, and a fmall part of

the barony of Alvah. About half a mile below the church, 
the river is contracted by 2 fteep and rugged precipices, 
which are commonly denominated the Craigs of Alvah, 
where it meafures about 50 feet in depth. The fcenery, 
which is naturally bold and piclurefque, has been greatly 
embellifhed by its noble proprietor, the Earl of Fife, by 
thriving plantations, and a magnificent arch, which unites 
both fides of the river, and forms an eafy communication 
between the oppofite parts of his Lordlhip's extenfive park. 
The fruitful haughs along the banks of the river are fub- 
jecl to frequent inundations, which, in fummer and harveft, 
make dreadful depredations among the corns. This in- 
convenience is more especially felt in the neighbourhood of 
the rocks of Alvah, which, during a flood, check the rapi- 
dity of the ftream, and make the water flow backward for 
nearly 2 miles, and fpread more than a quarter of a mile 
over the adjacent fields. As we recede from the river to- 
ward the W. the country becomes more hilly and barren. 
Of thefe eminences, one of the mod confpicuous is the Hill 
of Alvah, which rifes from the bed of the river to a very 
great height, and ferves as a common landmark to mari- ■ 
ners, on their approach to the coaft. The majeftic appear- 
ance of this mountain, which is fomewhat increaied by the 
view of the church, manfe, fchool, and a farm-ftead on ife 
E. brow, is thus defcribed by an indigenous poet. 

Erigit ad nubes hie fe mons Alvius ingens, 

Oftentatque procul confpicienda juga. 

Hie quoque Templa Deum furgunt in raonte locata 
. Sublimi ; furgit Pieridumque domus. 

Agriculture, ifc— The air of this parifli is in general . 
dry and healthy. Its foil, along both fides of the river, is 
«ery fertile ; deep on the haughs, and more mallow on the 

declivities.

declivities. Nor are there wanting fruitful fields on the up- 
per grounds, interfperfed amongft the rough paftures and 
heath, which ftill occupy a very considerable part. The 
crops which are commonly cultivated are oats, barley, and 
peas ; and on fome of the richer and more fheltered fpots, 
wheat has been tried with fuccefs. Turnip, for 20 years 
paft, has been fown in the fields ; and clover and rye-grafs 
have become a conftant part of the rotation. Feeding for 
the butcher is carried on by a few ; but rearing young 
cattle has of late years been found a more lucrative branch, 
and by confequence more generally pra&amp;ifed. As farms 
are not commonly let by the acre, it cannot be faid with 
accuracy what value is put , upon each. The beft arable 
ground may rent about L. 1, or perhaps fomewhat higher ; 
a ftill greater quantity about 15 s. and much more about 
12 s. or 10 s. and even below that value. There are only 
a few farms inclofed, nor does that mode of melioration 
keep pace with the other fpecies of improvement. Hedges 
do not thrive, unlefs in places which are Iheltered, as well 
as fertile. Feal or earthen fences have been found of fhort 
duration, and ftone fences are expenuve. But, though in- 
clofures are not fo frequent as might be wilhed, the practice 
of herding in winter is general ; fo that the turnip and 
fown grafles fuftain little detriment from ftraggling cattle. 
Several of the farms are already brought to a very high 
degree of cultivation, and others are advancing by gradual 
progrefs to a like ftate of improvement. About the year 
1747, the minifter began to bring home his peats in carts, 
valued each at 4 s. 6 d. Before that period the fuel was 
carried in creels, and the corns in curracks ; two imple- 
ments of hulbandry which, in this corner, are entirely dif- 
ufed. The ftraw brechem is now fupplanted by the leather 
collar, the raflien theets by the iron traces ; and more is

now expended on a (ingle cart, than would then have pur- 
chafed both cart and horfe. The iize of farms is increa- 
sing, and^ of confequence their number diminifhes. We 
account one of from L. 30 to L. 50 rent, a middle fized 
farm. There are a few above that rent, but many more 
below it — This parifh, unlefs in very bad years, produces 
much more grain than is neceflary for the fubfiftence of its 
inhabitants. Befides the farm-victual, which amounts to a 
very considerable part of the rent, there are large quanti- 
ties, both of meal and barley, annually fold by the farmers 
for the fupply of the neighbouring town of BanfF, and for 
exportation. In 1782 the crop was fo defective, that, ac- 
cording to the computation of infpe&amp;ors, there was not 
grain within the parifh fufficient to fupply it beyond the 
month of April. By the attention and generofity of the 
heritors, and the bounty of Government, with L. 40 from 
the funds of the parifli, the poorer fort were fupplied. The 
moft curious fadt relating to that alarming period was, that 
the oats on the earlier grounds, which ripened, were plump, 
and were found on trial to yield abundance of excellent 
meal, did not vegetate when fown next year ; whereas the 
oats on late grounds, which were green, and neither filled 
nor ripened, fprang up with vigour. As this was not found 
out till too late, it proved of the greater! detriment to the 
fucceeding crop. The feed, which had been bought up at 
an enormous expence, mifgave ; what might have greatly 
contributed to the fupport of families, was unprofitably 
call into the ground ; and what might have been profitably 
fown, was fent to the mill, where it made but a fcanty 
return. 

Population.— The numbers returned to Dr Webfter 
were 1161. As there are no parifli regifters previous to,

the year 1720, the ancient ftate of its population cannot be 
afcertained. From the records fince that period, it mould 
feem that population is upon the decline.

The marriages are reftri&amp;ed to thofe where the hufbaud 
was a refidenter ; from the idea, that girls married out of 
the parilh do not contribute to its population : But left 
this fliould be deemed erroneous, it may be proper to 
notify, that the average of all, who were married during 
the firft period, was 7^- ; during the fecond, gf ; and du- 
ring the third, gf. In the year 1782, the number of pa- 
rifhioners, on an exacl furvey, was found to amount to 
1070 ; which is very nearly the prefent ftate of it. Some 
years before it was rather greater. One principal caufe 
of depopulation in this parilh is, the eagernefs of fome im- 
provers to take all their land under their own manage- 
ment ; by which means mechanics, and even day-labour- 
ers are deprived of their crofts ; and, as there are no vil- 
lages within the parilh, betake themfelyes to other places, 
where they can find accommodation. Why the fame 
number of marriages doth not produce an equal number 
of births as in former times, is left to more intelligent 
heads to explain ? There have been no extraordinary in-

fiances of longevity of late. Only one man has reached 
loo, and a few are on the verge of 90 years. The inha- 
bitants are moftly employed in agriculture. There are fe- 
veral weavers and Wrights, a few fmiths and tailors, and 
often not one fhoemaker. They are regular attenders of 
the Eftablifhed Church ; nor do the Diflenters, of what- 
ever denomination, exceed 8 or 10. 

Heritors, Stipend, Poor, &amp;c. — The property of the pa- 
rifh belongs at prefent to 5 heritors, of whom only 1 re- 
fides. The manfe was built in 1764. The church is very 
old, and in bad repair. The ftipend is 58 bolls 2 firlots 
a pecks oat-meal ; 5 bolls 2 firlots bear ; L. 600 Scots, 
with 50 merks for communion-elements. The glebe con- 
fifts of between 6 and 7 acres, of which the rough mea- 
dow ground has been drained and cultivated by the pre- 
fent incumbent, and the whole inclofed. — The yearly col- 
lections amount to about L. 15 or L. 16, which, with the 
intereft of L. 120, and L. 1, 10 s. the rent of fome feats in 
the area of the church, conftitute the whole funds for the 
maintenance of the poor. 

Wages and Prices. — The wages of fervants and mecha- 
nics, and the price of provifions have rifen rapidly within 
thefe few years. The yearly wages of a man fervant 
may be rated at L. 5, or L. 5, 10 s. ; and of a woman at 
L. 2. A labourer earns 8 d. a-day. The price of beef, 
mutton, poultry, &amp;c. is regulated entirely by the weekly 
market in Banff, of which an account will be given in the 
report from that parifh. 

Roads and Bridges. — The principal roads were made by 
the ftatute-work, and are kept in repair by the fame

means. It is commonly exa&amp;ed in kind ; but when com- 
mutations in money are more convenient for the people, 
they are accepted. Of late years, bridges have been built 
over the moft dangerous paffes, to the great accommoda- 
tion and fafety of travellers ; and it is hoped, that, as foon 
as the funds can afford, more will be erected. Turnpikes 
are unknown in this corner of the country, and would 
undoubtedly be unacceptable at firft ; though the expe- 
rience of their advantages might in time reconcile us. It 
muft indeed be allowed, that, as the refort on our roads is 
but little, they are not fo neceffary as on thofe that are 
more frequented. y 

Antiquities. — There are few or no antiquities in this 
parifh worthy of a place in hiftorical records. At the 
farm of Bog of Mountblairie are the remains of an old 
caftle, fituated in a fwamp now overgrown with alder, and 
faid to have been built by the Earl of Buchan ; and on an 
eminence above it, the ruins of a chapel, adjoining to 
which is a well, famed of old for its fovereign charms, 
but now fallen into difrepute. Within thefe few years 
there was an iron laddie ; and many ftill alive remember 
to have feen the impending boughs adorned with rags of 
linen and woollen garments, and the ciftern enriched 
with farthings and boddles, the offerings and teftimonies of 
grateful votaries, who came from afar to this fountain of 
health. At the foot of the hill of Alvah, towards the 
north, is another fpring, which pafles by the name of 
Corn's or Colm's well, in honour, very probably, of the re- 
nowned Saint of Icolumkil.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011984">STRATHMIGLO</name>, 
(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Mr George L.YON.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

O Trathmiglo is fo called, as being a ftrath or valley 
on both fides of the water of Miglo, which runs 
through it from W. to E. and then takes the name of 
Eden. It is in the prefbytery of Cupar, and Synod of 
Fife. It is 5-j- Englifh miles long, and 3^ broad, bounded 
by the Lomond Hill on the S. and on the N. by a 
branch of the Ochil Hills and by the parilhes of Port- 
moak, Orwell, Arngolk, Abernethy, Auchtermuchty, 
Kettle and Falkland. It is partly flat, and partly hilly. 
The foil on the N. fide of the water is generally moift, 
but tolerably fertile ; on the S. fide dry and fhallow ; 
but in the eaftern part of the parifh, on both fides of the 
water, it is deep and fertile. The air, through a great 
part of the year is rather moift, but not unhealthy. The 
mofl prevalent diflempers are fevers, attributed to the 
moiftnefs ; but they are not frequent, and feldom mortal. 
There are no remarkable mountains. The hills are co- 
vered 



tf StratbmiglOi 



vereil with grafs. A bed of freeftone runs .along the S« 
fide of the water of Miglo for about 3 miles, and is ufed 
for building houfes and inclofing ground. There is no 
other found, except a white ftone on the N. fide of the 
Lomond Hill, which admits of a fine polifh, and is ufed 
by the richer fort of people for hearthftones, the corners 
of their houfes, and lintels for doors and windows. A 
kind of moorftone is fometimes ufed for inclofing ground 
with what they call a Galloway dike, or open ftone -fence. 

.Population. — By Dr Webiter's report, the numbers 
were 1695 *. In the year 1754, when I was ordained mi- 
nifter of the parifh, there were about 1 100 perfons in it, 
and this year (1790) there are about 980, of whom about 
470 are males, and 510 are females. From the ift of 
October 1783, when the regifter began to be better, 
though not exactly kept, to the ift of October 1790, the 
number of births has been about 225, of burials about 
136, and of marriages about 95. There is but one in- 
ftance of a very long life well authenticated, that of one 
James Beveridge, who lived to 110, and was 7 times mar- 
ried. There are 26 farmers, whofe families may confift 
of 182 perfons in all : About 50 manufacturers, 46 handi- 
craftsmen, 24 apprentices, 29 houfehold and 50 labouring 
fervants, 4 merchants, and 110 inhabitants in the town o£ 
Strathmiglo. There are about 266 born in other diftri£ts 
or parifhes in Scotland. There are 19 heritors ; 12 of 
whom, among which are 2 families of gentry, refide. 
There is one writer. About 750 are of the Eftablifhed 
Church, about 228 Seceders, and 2 Episcopalians.; The 
population of the parifii is materially different from what 
it was 25 years ago, and the decreafe is attributed chiefly 
to the throwing 2 or 3 fmall farms into one, and the a- 
bolifhing of cotterits ; for, though fome of the cottagers

take houfes in the town of Strathmiglo, others go and re- 
fide in towns, where the encouragement to manufacture* 
is greater. Each marriage may produce, at an average r 
5 children ; none have died from want ; no murders or 
fuicides have been committed ; few have emigrated, and 
none have been banilhed ; if any have left the parilh, it 
was not for want of employment. There are about 2,45 
inhabited houfes. At an average, 4 perfons may be to 
each inhabited houfe. A few are uninhabited. 

Agriculture, &amp;c. — The number of cattle may be about 
500, of horfes 190, and of lheep 300. Within thefe few 
years, great improvements have been made in agriculture. 
There are about 54 ploughs, all of the common kind ; 
74 carts, and 2 carriages. The parifh fupplies itfelf with 
provifions for common ufe ; but at the fame time, it both 
imports and exports. — 26 years ago there were only 2 
inclofures in the parilh, and now there are about 63, and 
many of them large. Great part of the parilh is now in- 
clofed. The people generally fow in April and May, and 
reap in Auguft and September. There is only one wood 
about 3 quarters of a Scots mile in circumference : One 
piece of marfliy ground, about a quarter of a mile long, 
and very narrow : One lake, about a quarter of a mile 
in circumference ; and no river except Miglo, which is 
very fmall. The parifh has no peculiar advantages or 
difadvantages that 1 know ; except the advantage of being 
in the immediate neighbourhood of hills for the rearing 
of lheep. The land-rent may be about L. 2926 Sterling. 
The rent of houfes cannot be exactly afcertained, as they 
are of fuch different dimenfions ; but a houfe of 2 ftoreys 
may rent at L. 3, 4 s. Sterling, and of ; ftorey, if of equal, 
length and breadth, at L. r, x6s. 



Stipend* 



of Strathmigh. 



Stipend, Poor, fcfc— The living, including the glebe, is, 
at the ordinary converfion of vi&amp;ual, L. 105, 13 s. Sterling. 
Lord Storraont is patron. The church was built about 
c years ago, and the manfe a years fooner. — There are 8 
poor families, who receive monthly penlions, behdes fome 
others, who have occafional relief. The ordinary annual 
amount of the weekly contributions is about L. 8:12:4 
Sterling, and the produce of alms, and other funds deftined 
for that purpofe, is about L. 23 : 3 : 4. 

Prices, Wages, ^fc— Butcher meat 30 years ago was 
about a£ d. now 4* d. ; and fo on as to other articles j a 
boll of wheat 15s. now L.I, is.; of barley 9s. now 14s.; 
And of oats 8 s. now 12 s. — A day's wage for a labourer 
in hulbandry and other work, is generally i s. without vic- 
tuals, and 8 d. with them ; and fo on as to other profef- 
fions. — The fuel commonly made ufe of is coal. The price 
on the coal-hill is 7 d. for the load, which is reckoned 16 
itone. They are procured from Balgonie, Balbirnie, Loch- 
gellie, and Kettle — I cannot exa&amp;ly fay what the expence 
of a common labourer, when married, at an average may- 
be ; but if he has 3 or 4 young children, it may be about 
X. 16, 12 s. ; and if he and his wife are in health and vi- 
gour, his wages, with any little fhift his wife can make, 
and it can be but little while the children are very young, 
is fufficient to bring up his family. The ufual wages of a 
farmer's principal male fervant, are L. 8 Sterling of an 
under male fervant, L. 4; of a female fervant, L. 2, 5 s.; 
and of a domeftic female fervant, L. 2, 10 s. 

Mifcelianeous Obfervations. — There are only 2 villages. 
The people are generally of the middle fize. The talleft 
man I ever heard of, and whom I knew, was about 6 feet 5. 
They are in general difpofed to induftry and ceconomy. 

No

No manufactures are carried on, except by individuals. 
They are not fond of a feafaring or military life. Property, 
particularly in land, does not often change. It fells, at an 
average, at about 26 years purchafe. The people are as 
much difpofed to humane and generous actions, as others 
in their circumftances generally are. On the whole, they 
enjoy the comforts and advantages of fociety, and feem con- 
tented. — The county roads and bridges are in tolerable good 
order, and are kept in repair by affeffments in money and 
ftatute-labour, exacted in kind. There are no turnpikes. 
The general opinion is, that if the money raifed by them 
is properly applied, it is the only effectual way to make 

good roads and bridges, and keep them in proper repair 

The farms in general may be at an average of about 150 
acres, and the average rent about 10 s. an acre. The num- 
ber of farms is diminifhing rather than increafing. — The 
manners of the inhabitants are much the fame they were 
36 years ago, civil and obliging •, but their drefs and ftyle 
of living are very different. At that time, though the 
rents the farmers paid were very low, they and their fa- 
milies were in general coarfely clad, and lived in a mean 
ftyle ; but now that the rents are greatly raifed, in fome 
places of the parifh doubled, and in one farm almoft tripled, 
the farmers are in appearance richer, and their families 
drefs and live much better. </p>

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q219427">ROW</name>, 
(COUNTY OF DUMBARTON.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Allan.</head> 
<p>— - ■ - 

Name, Situation, Soil, Fijh, ifc. 

r T~" , HE name Row is a Gaelic word, and fignifies 4 a 
' point.' Very near the place where the church is 
fituated, there is a pretty long point running out into the 
fea. — The parifli is fituated in the prelbytery of Dumbar- 
ton, and Synod of Glafgow and Air. It is between 13 
and 14 miles in length, and about 3 in breadth ; bounded 
on the E. by the parifli of Cardrofs; on the N. E. by Lufs; 
on the N. W. by Lochlong-, on the W. and S. by the Gare- 
loch, which feparates it from Rofeneath, and the frith of 
Clyde, which feparates it from Greenock. The E. end of 
the parifli is pretty flat, the greateft part of it hilly, and to- 
wards the N. E. mountainous. The foil in general is light, 
and where it is properly cultivated, pretty fertile. The 
air is fliarp and healthy. Fevers are the prevalent diftem- 
pers. The fea-coaft extends about 1 2 miles, for moll part 
flat and fandy, but in fome places high and rocky. — Sal- 
mon, haddocks, fmall cod, whitings, fmall flounders, and 
fometimes mackerel and herring, are caught in the lochs 

before

before mentioned, the quantity not great. Salmon is fold at 
-6d. the pound, tron weight, at an average \ mackerel, fd. 
a piece ; haddocks, &amp;c. x\ a-pound. The bell feafon for 
falmon is from the beginning of April to the end of July; 
mackerel, in June and July ; haddocks, from December to 
March ; cod and whitings, in the fummer months. Sal- 
mon, herring, and mackerel are taken with nets; the other 
kinds of fifti with long or hand lines. The town of Gree- 
nock is the principal market. A fpecies of whales, called 
Bottle-Nofes, have fomctimes run a-ground during the tide 
of ebb, been taken, and oil extracted from them. Por- 
poifes and feals are likewife to be feen occalionally. Sea- 
ware is ufed all along the coaft for manuring land, and 
kelp is fometimes made, but in very fmall quantities. 
Twenty or thirty years ago, all the hills were covered with 
heath ; but fince the introduction and increafe of ftieep, 
the heath has gradually leflened, and the hills begin to have 
a green appearance. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 853. About 50 or 60 years ago, it ap- 
pears the amount of the population was about 1300. The 
prefent amount is about 1000. The number of males 
486, of females 5 14. It appears from the regifter, that 
there are more males than females born ; but many of the 
young men leave the parilh in queft of employment, fome 
as failors, others as tradefmen or fervants. There is one 
village in the parifh, lately built, which contains about 
100 fouls. The annual average of births, from May x. 
1760 to May 1. 1770, is 40 ; from May 1. 1770 to May 1. 
1780, 34 ; and from May 1. 1780 to May 1. 1790, 33. 
There was no diftintt regifter of burials prior to 1783, 
nor can the number of deaths in it be exactly afcertained 
now that it is kept ; becaufe fome of the people have 

their

their burying places in the neighbouring pariihes, and 
fome from other parifties are brought here. The annual 
average, however, may be about 14. The annual ave- 
rage of marriages from May 1760 to May 1770 is 7; 
from May 1770 to .May 1780, 9 ; and from May 1780 to 
May 1790, 10. There are in the parifti 65 farmers, their 
families are about 325 in number. There is only 1 fa- 
mily of Seceders. The population, as hath been already 
obferved, has decreafed thefe lad 10 or 20 years, owing 
to many of the farms being now pofleffed by 1 tenant, 
which were formerly occupied by 3, 4, and fometimes 
more, each of whom accommodated a cottager; belides, 
fome of the farms have of late years been entirely kept 
under grafs, and no tenant upon the grounds. Each mar- 
riage, at an average, produces about 6 children. 

Agriculture, l£c. — There are from 45 co to 50C0 fheep ; 
the average price of white wool is 7 s. the ftone, and the 
wool laid with tar 5 s. The parifh does more than fup- 
ply itfelf with provilions, Greenock is the market for the 
overplus of grain and potatoes, Glafgow, Paifley, Port- 
Glafgow, Greenock and Dumbarton, for beef, mutton, &amp;c. 
Oats and peas are fown from the 20th March to the firfl 
week in May ; potatoes from the middle of April to the 
2cth of May 5 bear from the.ioth of May to the 8th or 
loth of June. The crops are reaped in general from the 
beginning of September to the 20th of Odlober. 

Stipend, School, Poor, ifc. — The value of the living, in- 
cluding the glebe, is about 100 guineas. The Duke off 
Argyle is patron. The church was rebuilt in the year 
1763. The manfe in 1737. There are 8 heritors 5 1

he generally has from 30 to 40 fcholars, in fummer about

30 years ago, one of the then heritors of the parifti, Mr 
Glen of Portincaple, mortified a piece of land for the fup- 
port of another fchoolmafter ; the number of fcholars 
taught by him is confiderably greater, and his emoluments 
at leaft equal to the parochial one. — There are at prefent 
8 poor who receive regular fupply, and about the fame 
number occafionally. The funds are the weekly collec- 
tions at the church-door, amounting to from L. 10 to 
L. 12 a-year, together with the intereft of about L. 220 
of ftock, L. 50 of which was lately bequeathed by Robert 
Carmichael, Efq; of Broomley, a late proprietor in the 
pariih of Bonhill. 

Prices, Wages, ifc. — The prefent price of beef, veal, 
and mutton, is 6 d. the pound, tron weight ; in harveft, and 
beginning of winter confiderably cheaper ; butter, from 
gd. to iod. the pound; cheefe, from 4s. to 6s. the ftone; a

10 d. to 1 s. a day. The ufual wages of men fervants em- 
ployed in hufbandry, are from L. 8 to L. 9 a year ; females,

(county of Berwick). 
By James Bell, D. D.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Air, is'c. 

THE ancient name of the pariih was Lennel, and the. 
ruins of Lennel church, diftant from Coldftream a- ■ 
bout a mile and a half nearly, ftill remain. Eaftward from 
this church there was formerly a little town or village call- 
ed Lennel, which was fo entirely deftroyed in the Border 
wars, that the fite of it is not known to me. Coldftream.- 
was the feat of a priory or abbacy which belonged to the 
Ciftertian order, and was fituated near the Tweed, where a i 
fmall water, called Leet, falls into it. Of this ancient ftruc- • 
ture a vault only remains. It is probable that a village 
was formed near it, which, from the pleafantnefs of the u-- 
tuation, and the proteflion afforded by the abbacy to the • 
inhabitants, increafed to the fize of a fmall town. Before • 
General Monk marched into England to reftore the Royal 
Family, he made Coldftream his head quarters, and raifed 
that body of men, which, being in fuccefllon recruited, has 
been called ever fince the Coldftream Regiment of Guards.— •

JColdftrcam is fituated in the county of Berwick, prefbyte- 
Iry of Chirnfide, and Synod of Merfe and Tiviotdale. Pla- 
iting the foot of a compafs at Lennel church, taking 4 miles 
I for a radius, and the river Tweed as a diameter, a femi- 
j circle defcribed on the north of that river will give a gene- 
Iral idea of the extent and form of the parifti. The length 
I from E. to W. is from 7 to 8 miles ; the breadth 4 miles 
jat an average. Coldftream is bounded by Lady kirk on the 
IE. by Simprin (now united to Swinton) on the N. by 
I Eccles on the W. The river Tweed is the fouthern boun- 
I dary. The general appearance of the country is flat. The 
j rifing grounds in the parifti do not deferve the name of 
I hills. — The foil for the moll part is rich and fertile ; near 
j the Tweed light •, inclined to clay backwards. A broad 
1 (lip of barren land runs through the parilh from E. to W. 
I called the Moorland. — The ak is in general dry and healthy. 
Coldftream is fituated at a confiderable, and nearly equal 
diftance from the Chiviot and Lammermoor hills. When 
the weather is fliowery, efpecially if the wind be wefterly* 
the clouds (from the weft) take the direftion of one or o- 
ther of thefe hills, pour down their contents upon them, 
and leave this parifti untouched. There is much more rain 
at Dunfe and Wooller than here. According as the fum- 
mer is wet or dry, Coldftream is benefited or hurt by the 
locality of its fituation. Agues prevail in fome feafons, 
but not regularly. Headaches, toothaches, and nervous 
complaints in general, are more frequent here than in other 
places with which I have been acquainted. Perhaps the 
eafterly fogs and rains, together with the frequent blowing 
of the wind from that quarter, may be the caufes of thefe 
complaints. In the village, the children of the poorer in- 
habitants are liable to the fcrophula.

Tweed. — Tweed produces bull-trouts, whittings, gilfes, 
falmon, and all other kinds of fifh common to the rivers in, 
the fouth of Scotland. Bull-trouts make their appearance. 
?n Tweed during the fpring months, and. foon after go a. 
k -way. When they come in numbers, they are thought tQ 

prognosticate a plenteous feafon for gilfes and falmon. The 

intercourfe carried on between Berwick and London, by 
means of the Berwick fmacks, and the recent difcovery of 
carrying frefti fifti to a diftant market, preferved in ice, 
render the price of gilfes and falmon as dear at Coldftream 
as in the metropolis. Tweed is open to fi/hing from the 
loth of January to the iQth of O&amp;ober. In the rivers to 
the north, which abound in fuch fifti, the c\ofe feafon, as it 
is called, which comprehends the reft of the months, varies, 
and is earlier, I believe, for the moft part in proportion to the 
latitude of thefe rivers northwards in Scotland, to the Tay, 
Don, and Dee. The fiiheries in the Tweed are of fmall 
value here, but not fo near Berwick. The gentlemen con- 
cerned in them have of late been at great pains to protect 
and extend them. They reckon nothing more beneficial 
than the taking care that the protection afforded to the 
fifh, be obferved, during the clofe feafon, with the utmoft 
ftridtnefs. Meetings have been held by the gentiemen of' 
Merfe and Tiviotdale, lately, to deliberate concerning the 
practicability and expediency of renderiug Tweed navigable, 
or of cutting a canal through thofe twp counties to the 
fea. 

Minerals, ifc— Befides good freeftone, pebbles, fee.mingly 
of a good quality, are found among the ftones and fand on 
the banks of Tweed, as well as in the fields nigh that 
river. Whether there is coal, is not yet certain. Some 
trials have been made without fuccefs. A company near. 

Newcaftle, 



of Coldjlream. 



413 



Newcaflle, employed in that bufmefs, engaged lately to 
make the experiment on a great fcale, and for that end en- 
tered into terms with Lord Binning. The writs were ex- 
tended, an agent from his Lordfhip came to Coldflream to 
finilh and fettle the affair ; but thefe colliers of the fouth 
broke their faith with him, and difappointed our hopes — 
Shell-marl was found in one marfh, and there is plenty of 
rock-marl in many parts. 

Population.— According to Dr Webfter's return, about 40 
years ago, the numbers were 1493. From the roll of ex- 
aminable perfons in 1785 and 1786, the numbers were 
2017. In the country part of the parifh, were 292 males, 
387 females, 176 children. In the town and a few houfes 
adjacent to it, the numbers were 1162. Number of fami- 
lies in the town, 305 ; in the country, 189. I mull remark, 
however, that the examination-roll is by no means a ftan- 
dard by which the number of the inhabitants of a parilh is 
to be eftimated. This roll is ufually made up by the officer 
,of the feffion, called the kirk-officer, who is feldom a per- 
fon in whom any trull in a matter of this inveftigation can 
be repofed. The age at which children are to be inrolled 
is not afcertained. Parents, according as they have been 
anxious to forward, or have been negligent in their educa- 
tion, are defirous to have the names of their children early 
infer ted in or withheld from this parochial record. Still, 
however, it gives a general profpeclus of the population of 
a parifh. I mult add, that the feffion-officer in this parifh 
is one of the few to be depended upon for accuracy.

Previous to the year 1786, the number of burials could on- 
ly be afcertained from the regifter of mortcloth money in- 
terfperfed among the records of the kirk-feffion. The poor 
who were buried at the public expence were not taken no- 
tice of except occafionally, fo that there mud be fome fmall 
degree of inaccuracy in the above average account of bu- 
rials. In the town of Coldftream there are about 34 day-la- 
bourers, 20 carters, feveral of whom farm 3 or 4 acres of land, 
17 weavers, 1 1 flioemakers, 15 wrights, 9 mafons, 6 bakers, 4

Agriculture^ l£c. — The parifh produces the ordinary ve- 
getables, plants and trees, to be found on the fouth eaftern 
border of Scotland. At Kersfield, which belongs to Mr 
Morifon of Morifon, the trees are of a large frze. At Hirfel,

cepted, the plantations along the fmall water Leetare not as- 
yet of age. There are no natural woods, forefls, wafte or 
common grounds. Near Tweed on this fide, and ftill more 
remarkably on the oppofite bank, as far as the Chiviot, and 
the ranges of hills contiguous to it, the want of trees attefts the 
border defolations. Plants in far greater variety are to be 
found in the lower parts of Clydefdale and Renfrewfhire 
than in this parifli and its neighbourhood. This part of the 
Merfe and downwards along Tweed, is not a rich field for 
a botanical journey. Hufbandry is well underftood in the 
Merfe. By the Merfe I do not mean the (hire of Berwick. 
That Ihire confifts of three parts : i. Lauderdale ; 2. that 
range of hills which, under different names* extends weft- 
ward from the head of Leader water, to the fea below the 
town of Berwick ; and, 3. that track of country which is 
fituated betv/een thofe hills and Tweed. That charming and 
fertile track is properly the Merfe, Lauderdale excepted. 
The parifli fupplies itfelf in provifions, and fends cattle and 
corn to other markets. We have an early harveft, and the 
fowing of the crops is adjufted to this. The grofs rent of the 
parifli may be about L.6000 Sterling a-year or more. 
The rent of fiftiings is L. 93. 

Wages and Prices. — A mafon's wages in fummer are 1 s„ 
6d.; a day-labourer's is.-, a man reaper's is.; a woman 
reaper's 8 d. ; a mower's is. 4 d. ; men fervants wages are 
from L. 7 to L. 10, yearly; women fervants are L.3. The 
hinds roll, as it is called, or wages of a hind the year, at an 
average, are 8 bolls oats, i\ peas and barley, coals led, 3 
cow's grafs, a pig and poultry allowed to be fed at the di- 
rection of the mafter. Hinds form the principal clafs of fer- 
vants belonging to the great farmers in this neighbourhood. 
Good beef, mutton, veal and lamb, fell at 4 d. the lb ;

pork at 3 d. ; butter at 6 d ; cheefe at 5 d. 5 hens from 8 d 
to 10 d. ; ducks from 6 d. to 8 d. ; geefe 2 s. ; turkeys, % &amp; 
6 d. ; falmon and gilfes at the Billingfgate price. 

Manufafiures. — There is no town in the fouth of Scotland 
fo well lituated for manufactures, in my humble opinion, as 
Coldftream. The country in its neighbourhood, on both 
banks of the Tweed is rich in corn and cattle. The price 
of coals is moderate. We are diftant from Berwick about 
15 miles. The great road between London and Berwick 
the road between Berwick and Kelfo, and between Dunfe 
and Northumberland, all pafs through the town of Cold- 
ftream. Goods manufactured here might be thus carried iu 
various directions into England and Scotland, by ways of 
communication already opened up. Should the projected 
plan of a canal be executed and carried near this place, the 
price of coals would be reduced, and all the advantages 
would be reaped, which arife from an inland navigation. 
From the excellent nature of the foil, flax might be raifed to 
ferve the purpofe of a linen manufacture. The good qua- 
lity of our barley would favour a diftillery or a brewery ; 
neither of which we at prefent have. Our ale, beer, and 
porter, come from Ednam. But the woollen manufafture is 
that for which Coldftream is particularly well fituated. 
The breed of ftieep is excellent, and is ftill improving. I 
am not fure if the wool, by which the trade and manufac- 
tures of Leeds have rifen to fuch vaft importance, be in ge- 
neral equal to what is produced in the Merfe, Tiviotdale and 
Northumberland. Yetham, Galaftiiels, Hawick, places far 
diftant from coals, and not enjoying our advantages of com- 
munication, are puftiing the woollen manufacture with fuc- j 
cefs. Were a proper plan fet on foot here for carrying on 

that

that manufaflure, it is hard to fay to what extent it might 
in time arrive.

day collections and the contributions of charitable perfons. 
iJt appears, that in that year, the feffion admitted on their 
roll as conftant penfioners, 3 perfons at 4 d. and 3 at 2 d. 2- 
:week; At that time the affairs of the poor were entirely 
tin the hands of the kirk-feffion, and continued fo till about 
('1740. It appears,' that in 1737, the fifft demand was made? 
lupon the heritors tb give a regular affiftance to fupport the 
boor. It was not, however, in general, punctually obeyed 
on their part. In 17 41 the feffiort requefted that the JuftU 
pes of the Peace would call for the poor's lift, and appoint 
bverfeers, &amp;c conform to an act of feffion I. of pari 1. of 
Charles II. This remonftrance feems to have had the de- 
cked effect; for in 1742, it appears, that half the collection 
was ordered to be given to the overfeers for the poor. The 
[weekly pay of the poor in 1743 was about 10 s. Sterling, 
ffrom the year 1765, the heritors kept 4 regular minute- 
fcbook and a cam-book ; their accounts after this being alto- 
gether unconnected with the kirk-femon records. In May 
1765, the number on the poor's roll Was 22, in aid of whom 
.19 s. 1 d. Sterling was the weekly affeffment. The higheft 
allowance was one milling. The quarterly affeffment was 
L. 13 Sterling. Ill 1770 the quarterly affeffment was 
L. 18, and in 1774, it amounted toL. 25, befides L. 4 levied

from the town of Coldftream. The weekly payment being 
L. 2 : 6: ii. The number on the poor's roll 34. In the 
year of fcarciry, 1783, meal was fold at reduced prices to the 
poor, at the expence of the heritors and tenants, to the a- 
mount of L. 112 Sterling. For the inrolled poor the quar- 
terly affeflment was L. 40, 14 s. the weekly pay L. 3, 4 s. 
The number on the lift 46. No demand has been made on 
the feflion fince 1773. Half of a quarterly affeflment was 
paid by the feflion in 1780 or 1781. The collection money 
goes to relieve tradefmen laid off work by ficknefs, perfons 
overlooked or not fufHciently provided in the poor's lift, , 
poor whofe claims upon the parifti being dubious, are not : 
entered on the lift of the heritors, genteeler families decayed : 
not on the roll, lick and diftrefled perfons returning to Scot- 
land, a great number of which pafs this way, and the like. . 
Owing to the high affeflment of the parifti, the collection is 
fmall. From 1785 to 1790, the yearly amount of poor's 
rates has exceeded L. 220, the weekly pay above L. 4. Two 1 
evils have arifen from the rapid increafe of the poor's rates. , 
The one is, that trufting to thefe rates, the common people : 
do not endeavour to provide any thing for a time of ficknefs 
or fcarcity, or for the approach of old age. The other is, , 
that thefe rates have, in a great meafure, deprived them of: 
the natural feelings of giving aid to their relations in diftrefe. 
The neareft ties of confanguinity are difregarded, and thee 
holieft affections of humanity are thus extinguiftied. No: 
perfon almoft is aftiamed of having his father, mother, bro. 
ther, or any other relation, on the pauper's lift. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — The only part of the parifti 1

1783. — A very remarkable thunder-ftorm happened in 

: this parilli on the 19th day of July 1785 ; a very accurate 
and fcientific account of which, by Captain Brydone, is to 
be found in the Philofophical Tranfadtions of London. — 
There are two obelifks in the parifli, which were both e- 
re&amp;ed by Alexander the late Earl of Home. The one 
fmall, built on the centre pier of a Chinefe bridge, con- 
fiding of two arches, over the water Leet. The other lar- 
ger, which exhibits in miniature the elegant and beautiful 
proportions of the Obelifcus Matthei at Rome. This is 
erected at the foot of a wooded bank nigh the Leet, and 

j was intended by Lord Home as a monument, in memory 
of his eldeft ion Lord Dunglafs, who died in America of 

[! the wounds he received in the battle of Cambden. — There 
are two fmall tumuli in the Kersfield eftate on the top of 
a fteep bank of the Tweed. The tradition is, that the 
bodies of thofe who fell in one of the border battles are 
buried in them. — The fize and ftature of the people on 
this fide of Tweed being the fame with thofe on the other 
bank, the following notanda of the Northumberland 
militia, which were communicated to me by Mr John 
Hall, furgeon, who officiated in that corps in the laft war, 
will illuftrate the fubjecl. The height of the men was 
from 5 feet 8^ inches to 5 feet io-§ inches; fome of the 
grenadier company were 6 feet, 6 feet 1 inch, and 6 feet 
2 inches ; the loweft fize j feet 7 inches. They were in 
general very ftrong made, particularly the clafs firft men- 
tioned. It was remarked by judges, that this battalion, 
though confining of fewer men than other battalions from 
the fouthern counties, yet occupied as much fpace in the 
line of brigade. The perfon who furnifiied the cloathing,

found that a greater quantity of cloth was neceffary for 
them, than for thofe of the fouthern counties, numbers 
being equal. — The people are much difpofed to induftry- 
in the line of hufbandry. We have no manufactures. 
Thofe who are fond of a military life, have a predilection 
to the Coldftream Regiment of Guards. — The number of 
ale-houfes have the worft effect upon the people, encoura- 
ging almoft every fpecies of vice. — The language is di- 
ftinguifhable from that fpoken on the other fide of Tweed, 
by the foft found of the letter R. From that river fouth- 
ward, as far I believe as Yorklhire, the people univerfally 
annex a guttural found to the letter R, which in fome 
places goes by the name of the Berwick burrb. — The 
names of one or two places in the parifh are derived from 
the Latin, as Qzxn-cbejler and Lares-croft, the grounds of 
which lie contiguous. Bil-chefter and Row-chefter, in the 
neighbouring pariih of Eccles, are of the fame derivation.

(COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

<p>Name, Situation, Surface and Soil. 

J Ogie is derived from the Gaelic ; and is faid to fignify 
" a low lying place." The parifli is called Logie 
Buchan, probably to diftinguifli it from other pariflies, 
called Logie in this county, iuch as Logie Mar and Logie 
Durno. It is fituated in the prefbytery of Ellon, and 
Synod of Aberdeen. The river Ythan interfects it pretty 
nearly in the middle. The parifli extends from the church 
upon the S. fide of the river to the S. W. about 4 Eng- 
lifti miles, but is not above a mile broad. On the N. fide 
of the river, it extends about 3 miles, and in general is 
from i-i- to 2 miles in breadth. That part of the parifli 
which lies on the N. fide of the river, is in the diftricT: of 
Buchan ; that on the S. fide, is in the diftricT: of Formar- 
tin. On the N. of the. river, it is bounded by the parifli 
of Slains on the E. » by Cruden on the N. ; and by Ellon 
on the W. On the S. of the river, it is bounded by Fo- 
veran on the S,; Udny on the W.i and Ellon on the N. W. 

The 



Statijiical Account 



The furface is pretty flat, with fome riling grounds in it, 
but none that can properly be called a hill, or which are 
not arable and improvable. The foil in general is fer- 
tile, but more barren on the banks of the river, than far- 
ther removed from it ; and the river Ythan, I believe, is 
pretty Angular in this, that its banks, during the whole 
courfe of it, are barren, rocky, and covered with heath, 
(a few fmall haughs excepted), even in a fertile country 
where heath is very fcarce. On the N. fide of the river, 
the foil is in general a rich loam on a clay bottom, or a 
ftrong red clay, which, in feafons that are neither too wet 
nor too dry, yields a rich crop, but it often fails. On the 
S. fide of the river, the foil for more than a mile to the 
S. and W. is light and black, on a gravelly or rocky bot- 
tom ; but as you advance to the weftward, it becomes a 
rich loam, and in fome places a ftrong unmanageable red 
clay. 

River. — Ythan is the only river in this parifh ; it pro- 
duces falmon, the common burn trout, the falmon trout, 
and the finnack. The firft is in feafon in fpring, and the 
two latter in Auguft ; it produces alfo eels and flounders, 
which are highly efleemed. Near the mouth of the river, 
there is a very fine bed of mufcles and cockles, which fup- 
plies the neighbouring country, the town of Aberdeen, 
and alfo the filhers of the whole Buchan colt with bait. 
The mufcles, about 12 years ago, were fold at 4 d. the 
peck on the fpot ; but the prefent tackfman raifed them to 
6 d. and this fpring to 7 d. which bears very hard upon 
the filhers, who muft pay at that rate, or L. 1 yearly for 
each man or boy who goes out to fea ; and they are un- 
der the neceflity of complying with his demands, however 
unreafonable, as no fubftitute has ever yet been difcovered,

which can anfwer the purpofe of bait. The mufcles are 
in feafon from September to April but as the mufcle 
bed lies in the parifh of FoVeran, I mail add no more up- 
on the fubjeft, as it will perhaps be only anticipating what 
may be faid more properly in the account of that. parifh. 
The falmon fell in the beginning of the feafon at 6 d. the 
lb. and as the feafon advances, they fall to 4 d. 3d. and 
even to 2§d. if they are plentiful.— The fhells, which con- 
tains pearl, are pretty often found in this river. I have 
not indeed heard of any pearls having been found in them 
for thefe 16 or 17 years ; but I am informed from good 
authority, that a few years before that, feveral were got 
by people keeping cattle upon the water fide, and that 
fome of thefe were of confiderable value. A circumftance 
has come to my knowledge within thefe few days, which 
fhews, that the pearl fifhery of this river was confidered 
as an objedt of greater value fome time ago, than it has 
been for thefe feveral jears paft ; namely, that one of the 
predeceffors of Mr Buchan of Auchmacoy had obtained 
a patent for it •, and in the lift of unprinted a&amp;s of iffc 
Parliament of Charles I. anno 1633, there is an aft, " re- 
" pealing the patent for the pearl fifhery, granted to Ro- 
" bert Buchan." Ythan is not a large river, but the tide 
flows for more than 4 miles up, and is navigable to fmall 
craft for more than 3, which is a great accommodation 
to the neighbouring country. About half a mile below 
this church, the tide flows out into a broad bafon, and 
covers a piece of land to the extent of go acres, called the 
Sleek of Tartie ; part of the furface is green, and produ- 
ces a fine fhort grafs, which is very fattening both for 
black cattle and horfes. The foil is mixed with fhells, 
and the farmers ufe it as a manure with great advantage ; 
they lay it on, and fpread it on the ground in autumn 

and 



4H 



Statijlical Account 



and winter, and plough it down in the fpring, and by this 
manure alone, I have feen good crops of bear raifed on 
poor outfield ground. Perhaps, by railing a proper dike 
along the natural courfe of the river, the tide might be 
prevented from overflowing this fpace, and by this means 
a valuable piece of ground might be gained to the pro- 
prietor ; the channel of the river might be deepened, and 
rendered navigable to larger veffels. 

Produce and State of Improvements. — Oats and bear are 
almoft the only productions. A few years ago, one of 
the proprietors built a lint-mill, fince which time, the in- 
habitants have begun to cultivate flax •, but as they are 
not fufiiciently acquainted with the proper mode of ma- 
naging this ufeful crop, it is not yet cultivated to that ex- 
tent to which it is to be hoped they will foon arrive. 
Improvements in agriculture may be faid to be here only 
in their infancy. From the eafy accefs which the far- 
mers have to lime, by means of the Ythan being navi- 
gable, it has been ufed as a manure for more than ao 
years paft ; but for want of a proper check in the mode of 
cropping, after ufing this manure, they at firft rather ex- 
haufted than improved their fields by it. They are, how- 
ever, beginning to fee the impropriety of this practice  
but they ftill, for moft part, taike 3 crops of grain after 
liming, then a green crop, either turnip or peas, and then 
bear with grafs feeds. This mode of cropping, although 
better than what was formerly adopted in this corner of 
the country, would perhaps be reprabated by good far- 
, mers ; but it is to be hoped, that in a few years, our far- 
mers will be brought to crop their fields, in a mariner lefs- 
hurtful to the foil, and more beneficial to their landlords- 
and themfelves. The Jhortnefs of the leafes that are com- 
monly 



of Logie Buchan. 



monly granted in this part of the country, muft be men- 
tioned ad 'one great bar to the improvement of it. There 
are a few instances of pretty long leafes granted lately ; 
and as molt of the proprietors profefs their readinefs to 
give longer leafes when good tenants offer, I hope this 
great obftacle to improvements in agriculture will be re- 
moved. There are few fheep ; and although of late years 
the high prices of black cattle have induced the farmers 
to breed more of them than they did formerly, yet grain 
may be faid to be the ftaple commodity ; of which we al- 
ways raife a great deal more than is confumed in the pa- 
rifh. A confiderable quantity is every year fent to the 
Aberdeen market, and exported from the Ythan, when 
there is any demand from abroad, or from diftant parts of 
the kingdom. There are 62 ploughs ; that moft general- 
ly in ufe is the old Scots plough : feveral people are get- 
ting ploughs of a more improved conftrudion. Perfonal 
fervices by the tenants to the landlords are entirely abo- 
lifhed here. Subtenants continue to pay fome fervices to 
the principal tackfman ; but it is generally 6 days only in 
the year, for affifting at cafting their peats, and building 
their fold fences. 

Rents and Size of Farms.— The valued rent is L. 3751, 
13s. 4d. Scots; the real rent may be about L. 1500 
Sterling. The general rent of infield ground is 15 s. or 
16 s. the acre, although fome of it is fet at L. 1 and up- 
wards; good outfield fets for 6 s. or 7 s. and poor outfield 
from 2 s. 6d. to 5 s. The fize of the farms is various 7 
There are 3 farms which contain upwards of 300 acres; 
but two of thefe are fet off by the tenants in fmaller 
farms, and they do not occupy above one half of them. 
The general fize of the other farms may be about 120 or 
100, and fome from 60 to 80 acres.

Roads and Bridges. — The roads have been made by fta- 
tute-Iabour, and are ftill kept in repair by the fame means, 
I will not fay that the ftatute-labour is not fufficient for 
this purpofe, but in the remifs manner in which it is ex- 
acted and executed, it is by no means fufficient for keep- 
ing them in proper repair ; and it is pretty certain, that 
much more work might be carried on by commuting it, 
even at the low rate at which the law fixes it, of 1 s. 6 d. 
each man for the feafon. I believe an aft of Parliament, 
obliging the country people to pay money in place of 
working, would be a nioft effential fervice to the country. 
It is doing the gentlemen, in this corner, no more than 
juftice to fay, that they have of late been very attentive, 
and at confiderable expence in building bridges ; and 
there is great reafon to think, that in a few years, bridges 
will be ere&amp;ed in every place where there is any necef- 
fity for them. 

Population — According to Dr Webfter's report, 40 or 
50 years ago, the numbers were 575. At prefent, (1791), 
there are exactly 538 fouls, of whom 284 are males, and 
254 females. Upon an average of 10 years, there have 
been 10 births, and 5 marriages yearly. As there is no re- 
gifter of burials kept, I cannot afcertain the number •, but, 
from the beft accounts, I fuppofe there are about 7 yearly 
at an average. The population of this parifh is much the; 
fame now, as it has been for thefe many years part. In- 
deed, after the year 1782, the number of inhabitants de- 
creafed about 40 or 50, owing to fome farms becoming va- 
cant, after that calamitous period ; but thefe are now occu- 
pied by new tenants. A Seceding meeting-houfe was built 
within this parifh laft fummer, but there are only 2 families 
of profeffed Seceders in it. There are alfo 2 families of 
Epifcopalians.

Stipend, School, Poor, bc. — The living confifts of 5 chal- 
tlers of vi&amp;ual, half meal, half bear, L. 24, 8 s. Sterling, 
and a glebe of about 5 acres. The prefent manfe was built 
in i775» and the church in 1787. There are 7 heritors, 
of whom only Mr Buchan of Auchmacoy, the patron, re- 
fides in it. — As this parilh is divided by the Ythan, in the 
manner above mentioned, fcholars could not eafily pafs the 
river to a fchool fituated on any one fide of it. Many 
years ago, therefore, a fchoolmafter was placed on each 
fide of the water, and the falary, which is only 100 merks 
Scots, and the other perquifites, were equally divided be- 
tween them. But from this divifion of the emoluments, 
which was intended for the accommodation of the parifh, 
both fides of the water are in fact deprived of the benefit 
of a fchoolmafter; the encouragement being fo fmall, that 
no perfon qualified for teaching, can accept of it. — There 
is no parochial fund for the fupport of the poor, except the 
weekly collections, which amount, upon an average, to a- 
bout L. 12 Sterling yearly, and even this fmall fum is 
fufficient for the poor, as I have feldom known the num- 
ber on the roll to exceed 5 or 6. — There is only 1 alehoufe, 
kept at the lint-mill, for the accommodation of thofe who 
bring their lint from a diftance, to be drefied at it. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — Among the advantages 
of this parifh, may be mentioned, that the foil in general 
is very improvable. I do not fuppofe there are 20 acres 
in the whole parifti, that may not be improved to advan- 
tage, conlidering the eafy accefs that there is to lime, by 
means of the Ythan, the moft diftant parts of the parilh 
not having above 4 Englifti miles of land carriage. The 
navigation of this river alfo affords eafy accefs to coals for 
fuel, which is a matter of the utmoft importance to this 
jparifh, as there is no mofs in it, and the mofles in the neigh- 
bouring 



Statijlical Account 



bouring pariflies, from which they get their peats, are 
pretty much exhaufted. This readily fuggefts, that taking 
the duty off the coal would be a great means of meliorating 
the condition of the inhabitants ; as, in that cafe, they would 
not only have fuel at a cheaper rate, but would have it in 
their power tcemploy that time in improving their farms, 
which is at prefent neceffarily occupied in providing their 
peats, which in general employs a good part of their fum- 
mer work, both of themfelves and their horfes. Confider- 
ing the eafy accefs that there is to, coals, I think I need not 
mention the fcarcity of mofs as a difadvantage to this pa- 
rim ; becaufe, if thefe circumftances would induce them to 
make ufe of coals wholly for fuel, it would, upon the 
whole, be for their advantage. — It may alfo be added, that 
giving them longer leafes, and fuitable encouragement for 
jnclofing their farms, would be another mean of bettering 
their condition, by exciting a fpirit of improvement.

"TP HIS parifli feems to derive its name from the nature 
and form of the fpot ; the moft confiderable part of 
it being a glen or ftrath, through which a fmall river runs, 
having fome flat grounds along the river fide, which 
grounds are commonly called holms. — It is fituated in an 
inland country, diftant from Peebles, the county town, a- 
bout 12 miles S. W. ; in the prefbytery of Biggar, and 
Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. It was anciently a cu- 
racy, pertaining to the parfonage of Stobo ; when prelby- 
tery was eftabliftied, it was comprehended in the prefbytery 
of Peebles, and afterwards was joined to that of Biggar. 
The poft road to Dumfries runs through the lower part of 
this parilh. On the road here, at the diftance of 28 miles 
from Edinburgh, in the opening of a ftrath, about a mile 
in breadth, is a fmall river, called Holm's water, crofting the 
road, which comes down between two ridges of hilly ground. 
Theafcentof the hilly ground on both fides the water is 
eafy and gradual, for a mile above the church j on the fides 

of 



43° 



Statijlical Account 



of the braes and flats along the water, there is arable 
ground, which produces very good grain ; the higher parts 
are a mixture of green and heath ; but the tops of the hills 
are generally heath. The ftrath becomes narrower, and 
terminates in a high hill, which feparates this parifh from 
that of Cultar. In the lower end of the parifh, where the 
river croffes the high road, the country opens to the north 
eaft on both fides. This parifh hath alfo a confiderable ex- 
tent from north to fouth ; it begins about | of a mile north 
from Holm's water, and runs fouth along the Dumfries 
road upwards of 4 miles, 3 of which are upon the banks of 
Tweed. By far the greateft part is fheep pafture ; the a- 
rable ground is generally of a loofe and fharp foil, of a 
moderate depth, and in the fpots that are beft cultivated, 
the crops are ftropg and very productive. As this country 
is high and hilly, the air is damp, impregnated with va- 
pour ; mifts frequently hover about the tops of the hills ; 
the clouds are often intercepted in their courfe, by the hills 
at the head of this ftrath, and brought down, fo that we 
have more frequent rains than in the low country : hence 
it is often a wet day at the head of this water, when it is 
dry weather in the lower end of the parifh ; but notwith- 
standing dampnefs is the general quality of the air in this 
place, there have been feafons when it has fuffered feverely 
through drought. Colds and rheumatifms feem to be the 
prevailing diftempers. There is a flate quarry, which con- 
tinued for many years to be wrought, but was fome time 
ago given up. There is alfo a limeftone quarry, which 
provides the farmers in this neighbourhood with lime for 
improving their land. 

Population.— -The numbers, according to Dr Webfter's 
report, 40 or 5 c years ago, were 392. The population ap- 
pears to have been greater formerly than now, as the 

grounds 



of Glenholm. 



43* 



grounds were then parcelled out in fmaller pofTefiions ; and 
this is generally the cafe throughout this country, efpecially 
with refpeft to the fheep farms, as the management of a 
fheep farm does not require fuch a conftant foperintendance 
as renders the refidence of the pofTefibr to be neceffary ; 
hence there are many inftances of one farmer holding fe- 
veral farms, and fome of them at a confiderable diftance 
from the place of his refidence. One confequence of this 
practice is, that in this way, a fheep farm will let at a high- 
er rate than otherwife, as the fupport of this family 
is not to depend wholly on the profits of that one farm. 
At prefent there are 300 fouls : was the account to be taken 
in the fummer feafon, it would amount to fome more, 
by the additional number of maid fervants, hired for the 
purpofe of milking ewes, and an addition of herds. Of 
the above 300, 135 are males, 165 are females, 76 are un- 
der the age of 10, 72 are from 10 to 20. The annual a- 
verage of births is 9. So far as can be collected from ob~ 
fervation, the annual average of death* is 3 or 4 at moil , 
The annual average of marriages is 2. There are 10 han- 
dicraftfmen, 42 male fervants, 24 female, 3 ftudents at the 
Univerfity of Edinburgh, 14 Seceders, 2 perfons who were 
born in Jamaica, 158 who were born in other parilhes ia 
Scotland, 44 married men, including widowers, and 18 
bachelors, reckoning them from 20 years and upwards. 
Marriages have produced 4 children at an average : none 
have been obliged to leave the parifh for want of employ- 
ment. There are 5 5 inhabited houfes. 

Agriculture, Ifc. — The land rent is at leaft L. 1000. There 
are about 5000 fheep, 150 black cattle, 60 horfes, 340 bolls 
of grain fown, 50 acres in fown grafs, 28 acres in turnip, 
a part of which are allotted for fheep to pafture on, and 
part to fatten cattle for the butcher, with 14 acres of pota- 
toes. The parifh is able to fupply itfelf with provifions. 

There 



43 2 Statijlical Account 



There is fome grain yearly exported, but lefs than former 
ly, the grounds being more in pafture. About 50 fcore of 
Iheep are yearly exported for the butcher. The time of 
fowing is in theiirft good weather in March, and the ordi- 
nary time of reaping is in September. There was ancient- 
ly a confiderable extent of flieep ground at the head of the 
parifti, which was common to moft of the heritors, but was 
fome years ago divided. There are 12 ploughs, generally 
of the Scotch kind ; 36 carts. Befides the refiding heri- 
tors, who farm moft of their lands, there are 6 tenants, and 
3 or 4 very fmall ones. There are 2 difad vantages this 
place labours under. From its fituation, the crops are often 
hurt by the early frofts in autumn. Sometimes the froft 
will touch the crop in the month of Auguft. In that fea- 
fon, the hoar froft will fometimes hover as a mift over the 
low damp grounds, and the crops in thofe tracks are more 
or leCs hurt. It has been obferved, that in a field of pota- 
toes, growing in a declivity, that on the fame ridge of po- 
tatoes, in the lower end, the leaves would be blackened 
with the froft, while in the upper end, they have remained 
in their proper verdure. The lofles to which the crops 
are liable through frofts, as well as the advanced price of 
labour, are inducing fome to turn their grounds more into 
pafture. Another difadvantage, is the great diftance from 
coal, which is no lefs than 14 or 15 miles, and the labour 
of driving "home fuel gives a great interruption to the ope- 
rations of hufbandry. 

Stipend, School, Poor. — The value of the living is about L. 70 
a-year, including 2 chalders of meal, and 1 chalder of bear. The 
glebe is about 6 acres, very good in quality; the inconvenience 
arifing from the fmallnefs of the glebe, is in fome meafure 
remedied, by the incumbent's renting a fmall farm of arable 

ground- 



of Glenholm.

ground. The patron is the Duke of Queenfberry. There 
are 8 heritors, of whom 3 refide. — The falary of the fchool- 
mafter is 100 merks Scots, which is the minimum ap- 
pointed by law. Fees for teaching, are 1 s. the quarter for 
reading, and 2S. 6d. for writing and arithmetic. The 
number of fcholars has been between 20 and 30. The 
falary and emoluments do not amount to the value of a la- 
bouring fervant's wages and board ; and hence the prefent 
fchoolmafter, finding his income quite insufficient for the 
fupport of his family, has had recourfe to ihopkeeping, and 
this has created a prejudice againft the fchool, and made 
feveral averfe from fending their children to it, apprehend- 
ing that the courfe of teaching will be much interrupted by 
the bufinefs of the mop, which has greatly reduced the 
number of fcholars, whereby the education of the youth in 
this place sustains a lofs that is to be regretted. — The num- 
ber of the poor has been fometimes 4, fometimes 3, or 2, at 
prefent there is only one who is fupplied regularly once a- 
week, and other two who receive occasionally. The an- 
nual average of the collections is about L. 6, 10s. It is a 
lofs to the poor funds here, that the moft opulent of the he- 
ritors do not refide. And though indeed the law makes a 
provifion by affeflments, in the cafe of the collections be- 
coming deficient ; yet the refidenters in the pariih would 
reckon it a hardlhip to be equally involved in an afTefTment 
with the non-refiding heritors, notwithstanding they con- 
tribute by their weekly collections. At the fame time it 
muft be owned, to the honour of both refiding and non-re- 
liding heritors, that in winter 1782 and 1783, when there 
was extraordinary occafion of attending to the poor, they 
very generoufly contributed a fum to purchafe meal. 

Prices, Wages, and Fuel. — The price of provisions is 
nearly the fame with that of Edinburgh market.— The 
wages of labourers in hulbandry are generally 8 d. a-day 

Vol. IV. 3 I and 



434

and their meat, and i s. without their meat. The waget 
of a male fervant are L. 6 a-year. The wages of a female 
fervant are L. i, 5 s. in the winter half year, and L. 2 in the 
fummer half year. The reafon why the fummer wages do 
fo much exceed the winter, is the labour of the ewes milk- 
ing, which is reckoned a fevere talk, which nothing but 
high wages can induce them to engage in ; and part of that 
wage having been by long ufe paid in wool, the rife in the 
price of that commodity has contributed to raife then? 
wages. — With refpedt to fuel, about 40 years ago peat was 
almoft the only kind of fuel that was ufed in this parilh, 
of which there is to be got very good in kind, but at a 
great diftance, on the top of fteep hills, and difficult of ac- 
cefs ; and hence the principal inhabitants have entirely 
quitted the ufe of that fpecies of fuel for many years part, 
and find they can more ealily provide themfelves with 
coals, and only fuch as are thirled to certain mills, (of 
which there are 2 in the parilh), do caft a few on thofe 
heights for the purpofe of drying their grain at the kiln, 
which they are obliged to furnifh by their thirlage. The 
cottagers are provided with a kind of peat, of an inferior 
quality, which are to be found in low damp grounds, near 
their dwellings, and are fuch as require a part of coal to be 
ufed along with them. The coals are brought from a great 
diftance ; fome from Douglas, which is reckoned belt in 
quality, and is about 14 or 15 miles diftant and fome are 
brought from Carlop, which is fomewhat nearer. The 
price is is. 6 d. a load, the load being 12 flone Dutch- 
weight. 

Antiquities. — There are in the parilh remains or veftiges- 
of 6 old caftles or towers, which were inhabited by the an- 
eient proprietors of the grounds, and feem to have been 

built 



of Glenholm. 



435 



built in a ftrong manner, for defence againd the borderers, 
who made frequent incurfions in thofe days. There arc 
vefliges of what appear like camps, in 3 feveral places •, 
but there is no tradition concerning them, to mow whether 
they have been encampments in time of a&amp;ual war, or 
have belonged to a chain of watching pods, to convey an 
alarm from one part of the country to another ; for they 
.are in lofty fituations. — There is a plain by the fide of 
Tweed, on which there are feveral mounts, apparently ar- 
tificial i on one of them there was an appearance of feve- 
ral rifing fpots of ground. The proprietor had the curi- 
ofity to caufe one of them be digged, and there found the 
flceleton of a man, with bracelets on his arms ; the body 
was inclofed in a (tone building, with a done cover ; and 
nim him was an urn. Another was alfo opened in the 
fame fpot, where they found the remains of a body, greatly 
•confumed. 

PoJl-offi.ce. — The conveyance of letters to this partfh, is 
by the pod-office at Bield, which is 7 miles diftance. It 
is reckoned that this pod-office is not placed in the mod 
favourable fituation for accommodating the greater part 
of thofe in this didrift, who have frequent correfpondence 
by pod ; and that there is a public houfe in this parifli, 
on the pod-road, to which the opening of the bag might 
be transferred with advantage, viz. Rachane Mill. At 
Bield there is only one gentleman's family, and the mi- 
nider ; whereas there are 9 or 10 in this parifh and neigh- 
bourhood, whom a pod-office in the above mentioned place 
would accommodate. If it be not thought proper to re- 
move the pod-office from Bield, there mould be allowed a 
bag to open at Rachane Mill. The gentlemen in this pa- 
rifli, and others in the neighbourhood, lately joined in a 

petition

petition to the poft-ofEce for that purpofe, reprefenting that 
the having this commodious conveyance, would encourage 
fuch an additional number of letters fent by poft, as would 
more than defray the expence that would be incurred ; and 
that, if it mould not, they would bind themfelves to pay 
the extra expence. But their application was refufed.

(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Brown.</head> 

<p>1 

Name, Situation, Soil, Surface, ifc. 

rpHE ancient name of the parilh was Kilgour ; in the 
Gaelic language, Cul-gawn is the ' hill of goats.' Its 
modern name is evidently taken from that of the town, or 
burgh, and probably took place in that year in which the 
church was transferred from Kilgour to Falkland. — It is fi- 
liated in the prefbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The 
contiguous parifhes are, on the W. Strathmiglo, which alfo, 
by a narrow ftrip of land ftretching along the louth fide of 
the water of Eden, feparates it from Auchtermuchty, and 
bounds it on the N. ; on the E. Kettle and Markinch ; and 
on the S. Leflie and Portmoak. It is of a regular form, 
and approaches nearly to a fquare of about 10,000 acres. 
Its general afpect is not unpleafant. On the N. there is a 
considerable plain or flat, called the Park of Falkland, ex- 
tending about a mile and an half fquare, from which the 
furface gradually rifes to that hilly ridge which forms the 
Lomonds. That ridge, which is the fteepeft, a little weft 
of the town, is ikirted with furze, above which it prefents 

a

Statijtical Account 



a beautiful verdure at all feafons, and rifes into a conical 
fummit, called the eaftern Lomond. On the eaflern fide of 
this hill the ridge gradually Hopes, and is partly verdant 
and partly heathy. On the weft the defcent is fteeper, to 
the gap or opening which feparatcs it from the weftern Lo- 
mond, and which extends above a mile nearly on a level. 
Upon the northern front of this intermediate fpace, the 
eaftern part of it, which fwells beyond the line of the ridge, 
rifes in 4 tires of hills, refembling fo many fegments of a 
circle. The loweft is totally covered with a ihort heath, 
interfperfed here and there with abrupt and rugged maffes 
of freeftone rock. It is well named the Black Hill. From 
its fummit, as you' approach the foot of the fecond, the fur- 
face becomes verdant; but the face of the hill, which is 
called the Stony Fold, is covered with loofe heaps of blue 
moor-ftone, very hard, and of the fineft grit. They are 
found in various fliapes and fizes, from that of the fmalleft 
pinnings, to the moft folid binding maffes employed in 
building. The fides and top of this hill are clothed with 
a clofe and beautiful verdure, from which it is named the 
Green Hill, and is reckoned fuperior, as a fheep walk, to 
all the furrounding pafture. Of fimilar form, but lefs mag- 
nitude, are the two remaining hills, by which you rife to 
the common ridge which divides the Lomonds. Their 
grafs, too, is of coarfer quality than that of the Green Hill, 
but ftill very fit for pafture. The weftern part of this in- 
termediate fpace, and which is divided from the eaftern by 
a deep ravine, ftretches from the circular into the redluli- 
neal appearance ; and from the firft afcent, which is higher, 
more abrupt, and broken, runs to the fummit. of the ridge, 
by three different afcents, bearing fome refemblance to ter- 
race walks in a hanging garden. From the fummit of the 
hill and ridge, the fouthern afpecl has little variety, but a 
gradual and uniform defcent, till it joins the parifhes of 

Leflje 



of Falkland.

Leflie and Portmoak.— The foil, as well as the furface, is 
confiderably diverfified. Part is of a light brown loam, 
upon a red bottom, part a light black fand, with a mixture 
of mofs, and in the plain or flat of Falkland Park, already 
mentioned, part of it is barren fand and gravel, covered 
with fliort heath and furze, but a greater part of it deep 
black mofs, generated from the oak and other timber which 
grew there, when it was inclofed for a hunting park to 
royal fportfmen, fome of which hath been cultivated at 
great expence, and the reft is lying in its natural ftate, 
That track of land which extends almoft the whole length 
of the parifli, from weft to eaft, between the plain and the 
foot of the eaftern Lomond, is generally of deep loam, and 
needs only proper culture to produce both fure and luxu- 
riant crops. On the fouth fide of the hill and ridge, the 
foil is fpungy and wet, more fit for pafture than for the 
plough. About one half of the parifh may be confidered 
as pafture-ground, in which is included the eafter Lomond, 
and that part of the weftern which lies within the parifh, 
both of which are a commonty to the contiguous heritors, 
and the town of Falkland. — The air is of a middle tempe- 
rature, rather dry than moift, particularly about the town 
of Falkland, and that track which ftretches along the foot 
of the hill, both to the eaft and weft. For, on the one hand, 
the Lomonds attract the moift vapours floating in the fur- 
tounding atmofphere, and either colled them in fogs about 
their head and ftioulders, or conduct them along their range 
in fhowers. On the other hand, the creeping fogs which 
fet in from the eaft, more frequently in fpring and autumn, 
attracted by the water of Eden, interfering the valley be- 
tween Falkland and AuchteYmuchty, and by the planting 
and marfhy ground, fettle there, and leave the air more dry 
and pure on the rifing ground, or that part of the pariih 
which is moft populous. In general, therefore, the inhabi- 
tants

tants are very healthy. Formerly, thofe who lived on the 
low grounds are faid to have been fubjeft to aguifli com- 
plaints, which, no doubt, arofe from their vicinity to mofs 
and marfli, and the ftagnation of water from the overflow- 
ing of the Eden, which fometimes covered a great part of 
the valley. But of late years, the moffes and marfhes have 
been much drained, and in this neighbourhood the Eden 
confined within its banks, by a new ftraight cut or channel, 
and the aguifli complaints are lefs frequent. From the Lo- 
monds, on all fides, iflue fprings and fmall ftreams of the 
pureft and moft wholfome water, fo that the inhabitants en- 
joy in great perfeftion that neceflary of life, and moft falu- 
tary beverage. 

The Lomonds are the only hills which deferve no- 
tice, and that not from their natural magnitude, but 
their relative fituation and appearance. As being the 
higheft ground of the county, they command a very exten- 
five and variegated profpedt. into many neighbouring and 
diftant counties, and are feen by travellers, in fome direc- 
tions, at a very great diftance. The eaftern, which is the 
moft regular and beautiful, is faid to be about 550 yards 
above the level of the plain already mentioned ; and 
where it is moft acceflible, feems to have been fortified near 
the top, with a deep trench, for what purpofe, there is no 
record or tradition. Very near the higheft part of the hill, 
there is a fmall cavity, about a foot and an half diameter, 
which, in rainy weather, collects fome water, and is called 
by the common people a fpring or well, but by fome tra- 
vellers a volcanic crater ; and the ftones immediately under 
the northern fummit, though common to the whole ridge, 
and without any appearance of calcination or vitrification, 
are carried away in triumph, and exhibited as fpecimens of 
volcanic lava found in the eaftern Lomond. The weftern 
hill is confiderably higher, and has on its top a large heap 
of loofe ftones, or a cairn, fuch as is found on- many hills

ind mountains cf Scotland. On the eaftern Lomond is 
plenty of limeftone rock, a few feet below, and in fome 
places very near the furface, and ealily wrought. There 
are alfo ftrata of coal of very good quality, but not yet dif- 
covered in fuch quantity as to be thought worth the dig- 
ging, efpecially in a country where there is abundance of 
fine coal, at a reafonable rate, in the neighbouring parifhes 
of Leflie and Markinch. On the fouth iide of the fame 1 
hill, too, was formerly difcovered a lead-mine of very rich 
ore ; but either through unfkilfuhiefs, or neceflity of circum- 
ftances, given up. It is now opened again, and with hope 
of fuccefs. There is alfo in the parifli, particularly on the 
Lomond hills, plenty of fand, and moorftone of good qua- 
lity for building, and eafily got at. Marl and fuller's earth 
have been difcovered, but in final! quantities, 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's reports", the 
numbers were 1795. In the parifli at prefent are 2198 
fouls. Of thefe' 937 are in the town of Falkland, 120 in 
Balliriblae, a contiguous village, 193 in Newton, another 
village, 476 in Freuchie, another village, arid 472 in what

The annual average of births for the preceding 7 years, is, 
of males 30, of females 24, of marriages 16, and of deaths 
34. The proportion between the annual births and the 
whole population, is as 3 to 122 ; between the annual mar- 
riages and the whole population, as 1 to 131, and between, 
the annual deaths and the whole population, as 1 to 61. 
Thefe calculations and proportions are founded on the pa- 
rifh regifter, and according to it, as near the truth as whole 
numbers will admit. But the regifter of annual deaths is 
not pretended to be nearly accurate, as is evident from 
the proportion between them and the whole population, 
which, it is believed, falls confiderably Ihort of the annual 
proportion of mankind that die, even in the moft favour- • 
able of the common circumftances of human life. For 
many years the parifa of Falkland has been confidered as 
very ftationary, in refpecT; of population, manufacture and . 
agriculture. Of late it has made fome progrefs, though, 
flow and gradual. The increafe of population in the laft 7 l

years is 1 68, and arifes more from the increafe in the fa- 
milies, than from that of their number. 

Manufatlure. — In the parifh are 337 tradefmen, of whom 
50 are apprentices. Of thefe 231 are weavers, 45 ihoe- 
makers, 22 tailors, 12 mafons, 16 wrights, including wheel, 
plough, cart, wrights, and cabinet-makers, of the lafl very 
few, and 1 1 blackfmiths, each trade including its propor- 
tion of apprentices. — The weaving of coarfe linen is the 
principal branch of manufacture, and that is principally car- 
ried on in the town and villages. Suppofing the number 
of looms well employed, and it is the utmoft that can be 
fuppofed, 200, the quantity of yarn annually manufac- 
tured, at 300 fpindles to each loom, is 60, coo. The va- 
lue of the above yarn, manufactured and brought to mar- 
ket, at 3 s. 9 d. the fpindle, is L. 11,250 o o

The markets for their green cloth are Auchtermuchty and

demands of the inhabitants. There are alfo cloth-mer- 
chants and grocers, fully adequate to the demands of the 
place. 

Agriculture — Agriculture, from its long rude ftate, has 
of late years made fome progrefs, and the arable part of the 
parifh is confiderably improved, both in beauty and rich- 
nefs. Still, however, there is much room for improve- 
ment. That greater progrefs has not been made, may be 

accounted

accounted for from the particular ftate of the parilh. Thg 
great body of the inhabitants live in the town and villages. 
Q£ thefe there are a number of fmall proprietors, and others 
who term from I to 2, 3 or 4 acres, for convenience, gene- 
rally tradefmen, who depend upon their trade for the fub- 
iiftence of their families, and by confequence have neither 
leifure nor Ikill to manage their little farms to the belt ad- 
vantage. From this divifion of the land, about the town 
and villages, into fmall portions, it lies uninclofed and na- 
ked, and from the want of a more Ikilful ploughing and rota- 
tion of crops, though well manured, it has neither that beau- 
ty nor richnefs, to which its foil and fituation are both na- 
turally difpofed. There are a few farms of from 2 to 3 and 
4 ploughs in the parilh, of which that of Falkland Wood or 
Park is the molt extenfive. There are fome inclofures, 
and a tafte for them is prevailing ; but, in general, the land 
is very naked. Oats and barley are the prevailing crops. 
Peas and turnip are raifed in fmall proportions. Artificial 
grafs, as clover and rye-grafs, begins to be cultivated with 
more attention. Flax too is raifed, and in fome years in 
confiderable quantities. The whole produce, however, is 
not fufhcient for the confumption of the inhabitants. The 
old valuation of the parilh, as it Hands in the cefs-books, is 
Jj. 5824. The prefent bears a proportion to the increafed 
value of land. The farms, from the various quality of the 
foil, are very differently rented ; but, it is believed, in ge- 
neral moderately, conhdering the late rife of rents. That 
of the land immediately about the town is from L. 2 to 
L. 2, 105. the acre. The price of labour and fervants 
wages are, as in the country in general, high. The day- 
labourer has 10 d. in winter, and 1 s. or t s. 2d. in fum- 
rner. Men fervants have from L. c to L. 7, women from 
L. 3 to L. 3 wages.

Burgh of Falkand. — Falkland was erected into a burgh 
by King James II. in the year 1458. The preamble to 
the charter of erection ftates, as reafons of granting it, the 
frequent refidence of the Royal Family at the manor of 
Falkland, and the damage and inconvenience fuftained by 
Xhe many prelates, peers, barons, nobles, and others of their 
fubjects, who came to their country feat, for want of inn- 
keepers and victuallers. This charter was renewed by 
King James VI. in the year 1595. In this charter is men- 
tioned the right of holding a weekly market, and 4 public 
rnarkets or fairs, yearly. To thefe laft have been added 
other 2 markets, 1 in April, called the Lintfeed-market, 
and 1 in September, called the Harvelt-market. The 4 old 
markets are the mofl frequented, and very considerable 
numbers of both horfes and black cattle are fold and bought 
at them. What is commonly called the fet of the burgh, 
is as follows. There are 3 bailies, 15 councillors, of whom 
I is treafurer, and a clerk. The councillors elect them- 
felves annually, and generally continue councillors till cho- 
fen bailies. The bailies are chofen by a majority of the 
councillors, and may continue as long as that majority 
pleafes. No old bailie is ever chofen a councillor, and can 
come into council again only as bailie. The revenue of 
the burgh arifes from cuftom at markets, landed property, 
and a mill, and is, communibus a/mis, from L. 100 to 
L. 110, exclufive of public burdens : A fum which, in the 
hands of patriotifm and ceconomy, might be turned to much 
public good in fo fmall a town. It has not altogether been 
mifapplied. There is one monument of public fpirit in the 
town, a plentiful fupply of fine water. It was brought in- 
%o it in the year 1781. The expence amounted to near 
L. 400. Partiality for the place of his refidence, and that

turally lead a writer to wifli, that he could add more in- 
ftances of public fpirit and beneficence, or that, by a courfe 
of ftridr. and judicious ceconomy, the means of doing good 
were accumulating. In this refpecf, Falkland claims no 
diftinguiflied fuperiority to fimilarly circumftanced burghs, 
nor is it perhaps juftly chargeable with greater degeneracy. 
It only adds to that mat of confiderations which calls aloud 
for borough reformation. Great as the evil is of the want 
of ceconomy, or the mifmanagement of public revenue, it 
is fmall, compared to the neglect or mifmanagement of pu- 
blic authority and power. Magiftracy is highly refpe&amp;able, 
and will always be refpe&amp;ed by every man of fenfe, and 
friend to the public weal. It is more particularly fo when 
it is contemplated, as defcending from the fupreme, to eve- 
ry fubordinate magiftrate, inverted with the facred majefty 
of public law, and cireumfcribed by the rules of equal ju- 
ftice. But where office is not decently fupported, it were 
better not to exift. There are not wanting, in our country, 
many inftances in which the vigilance, activity, and patrio- 
tifm of magiftrates do them great honour, and mark them 
out to public refpeft, as public blelungs ; at the fame time, 
it cannot efcape the obfervation of partiality itfelf, that 
there is fometimes little or nothing of its fpirit to be found 
in thofe who are inverted with the office. There is a na- 
tural difpofition in mankind, to refpect and reverence offi- 
cial authority ; but when it is degraded by office-bearers, 
the contempt and irreverence which naturally fall upon 
them, defcend to their office, and are productive of the 
moft pernicious confequences to the great body of the 
people.

of a manfe and glebe, only a ehalder of bear. Mr Sandt- 
lands of Nuthill is patron. — There is no houfe nor garden 
for the fchoolmafter, in hiring of which, his legal falary of 
about L. 6, 10 s. is nearly exhaufted. The average number 
of his fcholars is about 8o, of whom the fmall proportion 
that read Latin and arithmetic, pay only as. 6d. the quar- 
ter, and the Englifh fcholars is. 6d. Thefe, with the per- 
quifites arifing from the offices of feffion-clerk and precen- 
tor, conftitute the whole of his emolument, on which he de- 
pends for his own and the fubfiftence of his family. His 
emoluments not admitting of an affiftant, both limits the 
number of his fcholars, within what the populoufnefs of the 
parifh might afford, and render it neceffary to employ o- 
ther teachers in different parts of the parifh. To thole who 
have any regard for the education and right principling of 
the common people, it muft appear evident, that no clafs 
of men are of more importance to fociety, or more defer- 
ving of patronage than fchoolmafters. The legal provifion 
made for them, was, at the time, adequate to the objeft in 
view, and the happy effe&amp;s of it foon were, and ftill are, 
confpicuous in our country. Education was univerfally 
diffufed. The lowed claffes of the people were taught to 
read the fcriptures, inflrufted in the firft principles of reli- 
gion and morality, and thus prepared in fchools for being 
further enlightened and improved by the theological and mo- 
ral lectures of churches. Hence the diftinguifhed fuperiority 
of the common people of Scotland in knowledge and fo- 
briety. Parifh fchools have hitherto been the great nur- 
feries for the church, and many other learned profeffions. 
There many men of ufefulnefs and eminence in the dif- 
ferent departments of fociety, have received thofe rudi- 
ments of literature which they could not otherwife have 
obtained, but to the great lofs of fociety and of their coun- 
try, muft have continued blinded with the common mafs,

and, like the defert rofe, wafted, in vain, their uncultiva 
ted fweetnefis. All who value thefe advantages, and wifh 
to fecure them to their country, will fee the neceffity of in- 
terpofmg, for the greater encouragement of that order of 

men, on whofe abilities and fidelity they fo much depend. 

Confidering the populoufnefs of the parifti, and the town 
and villages which are in it, the proportion of poor is 
as fmall as in the generality of parilhes limilarly circum- 
ftanced. Of thofe who receive regular fupply, the annual 
average is about 15, and of thofe who are occalionally af- 
fifted about 22. The funds for this fupply are^ the week- 
ly collections at the church-door, the yearly rent of fome 
land, the intereft of a fmall fum of money, perquifites at 
marriages, when the bride is of the parifh, and at burials, 
for the ufe of the mortcloth or pall. Thefe, at an average 
of the laft 7 years, amount annually to about L. 44, of 
which the annual collection is L. 24, 

Inns a?id Ale-houfes. — The market for every thing gene- 
rally bears a proportion to the demand. The unfrequency 
of travellers by the way of Falkland, efpecially fince the 
great north road was made by Kinrofs and Queensferry, 
has greatly diminilhed the demand for inns. Still, how- 
ever, there are 2 houfes in it that go by the name of inns'. 
— Of ale-houfes, for which there is a greater demand from 
the populoufnefs of the town and neighbourhood, there is a 
greater number. There are ic in the town of Falkland, 
I in Newton, and 3 in Freuchie. Thefe generally belong 
to brewers ; and though ftill more than are favourable to 
either the health or morals of the inhabitants, aie faid not 
to exceed half the number of what have fometimes been 
known in the parifh. This diminution of inns and ale- 
houfes has arifen from the increafed demand for f .irituous 
liquors. It were injuflice to the generally fober and indu- 

ftrious

jftrious character of the pariflnoners, to fay, that they are 
^either idle or prodigal ; but where there are temptations, 
jfomc will always be tempted. 

Antiquities. — Of this paiifh, the moft memorable anti- 
iquity is the ruinous palace of Falkland, which, for many 
syears, was the occafional relidence of the Royal Family of 
Scotland. — On the S. fide of the Eden, directly between 
[Falkland and Auchtermuchty, are the remains of what is 
icalled a Danilh camp. That it was fo, is probable from 
:the name of a neighbouring village, Dunfhelt, fuppofed to 
Ibe a corruption of Danes-halt, and to have derived its 
jname from the circumftance of the Danes having formed 
an encampment in its vicinity. Another circumftance adds 
tto the probability of the tradition, that it is of a circular 
jform. The remains of this camp confift of five concentric 
circular trenches, nearly equidiftant from one another, and 
rleem to have been feparated only by the bank of earth 
thrown up from each. The centrical fpot inclofed by the 
firft trench is about 22 feet diameter, and where they are 
not demoliihed, the trenches are at prefent from 10 to 15 
feet wide. — On the E. of Nuthill, and nearly half a mile 
W. from the houfe, are 4 parallel trenches, in the form of 
inverted wedges, of from 250 to 300 yards in length, evi- 
dently the work of art. — And the fame is to be faid of 
(what is called the Maiden Caftle, on the fame eftate, fitu- 
ated above half a mile diftant, on the S. fide of the green 
hill already mentioned. It is an oblong circular mound, 
gradually rifing from a level on the E. to a fteep and ab- 
rupt termination on the W. of nearly 400 yards in cir- 
cumference, and, except the fteep part on the W. and the 
level on the E. where are the remains of a ftone wall, is 
furrounded with a ditch of 12 feet wide.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4854063">BANCHORY DAVINICK</name>, 
(COUNTIES OF ABERDEEN AND KINCARDINE.) 

By the Rev. Mr George Morison.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Air, Ifc. 

J£)anchory, the name of the parifli, is faid to fignify in 
Gaelic, * an opening between two hills •,' and is defcrip- 
tive of the fituation of the church and manfe. It is not 
agreed as to the meaning of the word Davinick. — This 
parifli is divided into two parts by the river Dee, which 
being the boundary between the counties of Aberdeen and 
Kincardine or Mearns, that part which lies on the north fide 
of the river, is in the former county, and that whiah is on 
the fouth fide, in the latter. Although the church ftands 
in the county of Kincardine, the parifli is in the Synod and 
prefbytery of Aberdeen. The bounding* and figure of 
that part of the parifli which lies in the county of Kincar- 
dine, will be beft underftood by confuting Garden's map 
of that county ; the other part is a ftrip about i mile in 
breadth, and about 4 in length, lying along the bank of the 
river, and ftretching both farther E. and farther W. 

than the parifli does upon the oppofite bank. On the E.

of Banchory Davinick.

this part is bounded by the parifh of Old-Machar, or Old 
[ Aberdeen, on the N. by Newhills, and on the W. by 
: Peterculter. A line drawn from one extremity of the 
parifh to the other, would, I fuppofe, meafure 7 miles. The 
general appearance of the country is rugged and ftony. 
The kind of ftone which prevails is blue granite, of which 
. feveral quarries are wrought for the purpofe of fending to 
London, as well as for building at Aberdeen. The hills 
are covered with heath, and the air by no means unhealthy. 
There is no diftemper, fo far as I know, that can be faid to 
be peculiarly prevalent here ; and the people might enjoy 
good health, did they not drink too freely, particularly of 
ardent fpirits. Belides the quantity of gin fmuggled in 
I upon the coaft, which by the way is not fo great as former- 
. ly, we have two whifky dulillers in the parifh, and 10 or 
12 public houfes. The foil in this parifh is not naturally 
rich ; it is in general light, and either moffy or fandy, but 
when properly managed it is not ungrateful, and produces 
good grain, particularly on the river fide, and ©n fome parts 
of the fea-coaft. 

Agriculture, is'c.—A fpirit for agriculture has begun 
within thefe few years to make its appearance in fome parts- 
of this parifh. Still, however, it is with a few exceptions 
confined to thofe farms which lie near the river, particular- 
ly on the north fide. On that fide the foil and expofure 
are good, and the heritor, Mr Menzies of Pitfodil, ha3 wife- 
ly granted leafes of 19 years and a life, with an obligation 
to take off houfes and fences to a certain extent, at the ex- 
piry of the leafe. The change which this has effected on 
that part of his eftate, within thefe five years, is aftonifhing,. 
On this fide there is not the fame encouragement, and lefs 
confequently is done. Belides, in all the parifh fouth of

the river, there is a vaft quantity of mofs, and being i n the 
vicinity of Aberdeen, the tenants who pay upwards 0 f 
L. i an acre for fmall bits of land, depend for a livelihood 
upon driving peats to town, where they find a ready mar- 
ket for them. This is one caufe why the cultivation of the 
land is very much neglected. Another bar to agriculture, 
is the high price of labour. A day labourer, if a good 
hand, earns i s. a day for 9 months of the year, and 9 d. 
the other 3 ; and the wages of a capable farm fervant, who» 
has his victuals found, are feldom under L. 6, and fometimes 
as high as L. 9 Sterling a-year. And a third caufe of the 
uncultivated ftate of our fields, is the poverty of the people,, 
which renders many of them unable either to ftock or 
manage their farms to advantage. I mult, however, for/ 
the honour of fpirit and exertion, relate one inftance of the 
increafed value of land, which is remarkable. I allude to 
MrFordyce of Ardo, one of thofe brave men who circum- 
navigated the globe with Lord Anfon, and fuffered fo many 
hardfliips in the fervice of their country. This gentleman,, 
after accomplilhing the voyage, returned to Scotland in the 
year 1744, with the well-earned wages of his toil, and pur-, 
chafed the eftate of Ardo in this parifli, where he has re- 
lided ever fince. When he took pofTeflion of his eftate, he 
found the manfion-houfe, fuch as it was, with the garden, 
and about 40 acres of land, in the hands of a tenant, who 
paid about L. 3 : 6 : 8 Sterling annually. Having it in con- 
templation at that time to go abroad again, he alked the 
man if he would renew his leafe, which was expired, at the 
annual-rent of L. 5 Sterling, his anfwer was, ' Na, by my 
4 faith, God has geen me mair wit.' Mr Fordyce fettled, 
and employed himfelf in improving the land, which is now 
in a good ftate of cultivation, and would rent at L. 1 , 5 s . 
an acre. Little has hitherto been done in the way of plant- 
ing*

i mg, although a great deal of the ground is fit for nothing 
elfe. Some plantations that were made about 40 years ago, » 

» being chiefly of Scotch fir, are not in a very thriving con- 
dition. 

River, Sea~coaJl, lie. — The river Dee is not navigable 
here, but produces excellent falmon. The different pro- 
prietors upon the river let their fifhings ; but as the filh are 

: not got in great quantity at this diftance from the mouth, 
they fetch but fmall rents. I fuppofe the grofs rent of all 
the falmon-fiftiings in the parifh, would be found to be fiiort 
of L. 100 Sterling. The river Dee, from its long courfe, 

I and the mountainous country through which it runs, is fub- 

ii jecl: to very fudden and very high floods. In the year 
1768, one of thefe happened in the middle of harveft, 
which fwept the whole crop of the haughs, and alfo a great 
many flieep from the inches, or fmall iflands, which are 

i frequent in the midft of the river. We had another fwell 
of the river, not much inferior to the former, in November 
laft, thte water rofe 9^ or 10 feet above its ufual leveL 
This fwell was occafioned by a ftorm of wind and rain 

I from the S. E. and it is remarked here, that rain from the 
E. always fills the river more than from any other quarter. 
Luckily when this flood happened, the harveft was nearly 
over. The ravages which it made in overthrowing bul- 
warks and fences, tearing up the cultivated land in fome 
places, and covering it with fand and ftones in others, were 
truly aftoniftiing. — The fea-coaft, which extends 3 or 3-*- 
miles from N. to S. is throughout high and rocky. No 

: part of it affords a fafe harbour for any veflel larger than 
a fifhing boat. Of thefe we have a good many. At Fin- 
don, (which gives name to haddocks when fplit, and dried 

i in a particular way by the fmoke of peat, and which are 

known 



454 



Statijlical Account 



known and efteemed in moft parts of Scotland,) there sre 
2 fiftiing boats, each of which requires 6 hands, and 3 
fmaller ones of yauls, wrought by four men each. At 
Portlethen, about a mile farther S. there are 3 of the larger 
boats, and 1 yaul, manned as thofe of Findon, and at 
Dounies, ftill farther to the fouthward, there is 1 yaul em- 
ployed. The fimermen at Findon, have each an acre of 
land, a houfe, garden, liberty of fuel, and a right to the 
harbour, for L. 3 Sterling annually. Thofe at Portlethen 
have not a full acre of ground, and on that account pay 5 s. 
lefs of rent. They fifli pretty fuccefsfully for fkate, ling, 
turbot, cod, haddocks, whitings, flounders, crabs, lobfters, 
&amp;c The vicinity of Aberdeen fecures a good price. 
Haddocks this feafon, which has been a bad one for fiftiing, 
have fold from 2 s. to 6 s. the dozen, according to their flze. 
— Whilft fpeaking of the coaft, a remarkable incident 
may be mentioned, of which this parilh was the fcene. 
On the 19th Auguft 1710, 7 boys, about 1 5 years of age 
each, failed out of the harbour of St Andrew's in a little 
boat, and lofing one of their oars, were driven into the 
ocean. After 6 days and 6 nights of continued falling and 
labour, they got to more alive, 4 miles fouth of Aberdeen, 
and 50 north of St Andrew's. A humane country man,- 
John Shepherd, kindly received them into his houfe, and 
fent information of fo moving an accident to the magiftrates 
of Aberdeen, who difpatched their dean of guild, a phyfi- 
cian, and a furgeon, to attend them. All of the boys were 
preferved in life, except the two youngeft, who died foon 
after they came afhore. John Shepherd was prefented with 
a filver cup in form of a boat, by Robert Bruce goldfmith 
in Edinburgh, father of one of the boys, in teftimony of 
his gratitude for the a&amp;ive part he took in recovering his 
fon. 

Population, 



of Banchory Davinick. 455 

Population.— At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 1495. The population at prefent amounts 
to about 1700. Of thefe 1700, no more than 744 are 
males, which leaves 956 females. I fuppofe this difpropor- 
tion will be found to be greater! in country parilhes in the 
vicinity of large towns. 

J 

Stiptnd) Poor, i$c— The (tipend at prefent, amounts to 
no more than L. 54 : 2 : 3^ Sterling, 42 bolls 1 peck of 
meal, and 24 bolls 1 peck of bear ; in which is included 
communion element money, and L. 16 Scots allowed for 
grafs carried off by the river. The glebe is very little 
above the legal minmium. There are 10 heritors, 3 of 
whom refide. — The number of poor who are fupplied 
quarterly, are from 20 to 30, befides a good many who re- 
ceive occasional aid. Our funds confift of L. 5 Sterling, 
appropriated by a fpecial deed for that purpofe, out of th» 
rents of the eftate of Banchory, L. 3 : 6 : 8 out of thofe of 
Ardo, a piece of ground which yields L. 6 of free rent, 
and the intereft of L. 25 of flocked money; befides our 
weekly collections, fo much for the ufe of the parilh mort- 
cloth, and fo much for the ufe of the buryiug-ground, 
exacted from every perfon who ufes it, and who does not 
refide in the parifli, and fuch fines or penalties as are levied 
from fornicators, &amp;x. From all thefe fources together, we 
have an annual income of L. 45 Sterling at an average. 
I cannot help here exprefling a wifh, in which I am by no 
means fingular, that fornicators and other fcandalous per- 
fons were entirely turned over to the fecular arm. Our 
difcipline has no effect to check the evil, and expofes us to 
•witnefs very difagreeable fcenes of equivocation, falfehood, 
and perjury.

Mifcellaneous Olfervations. — We have in general good 
materials for making roads, but the ftatute-labour, which 
is partly commuted, and partly paid in kind, is not fuiftV 
cient for keeping them in repair. I am perfuaded we never 
ihall have good roads till turnpikes are eftabliftied. Many 
of the country gentlemen are, I believe, fenfible of this • 
but the meafure would be ftrongly oppofed by the town of 
Aberdeen, which would be feverely affe&amp;ed by it, and which 
has an intereft in the parifti. — There are fever al very 
large cairns, both on the north fide of the river, and towards 
the coaft, and in one place in particular, a number of fmall- 
er ones are fcattered over the moor near them. There is 
alfo in the fouth fide of the parilh, a Druidical temple that 
is worthy of notice. It is fituated on an eminence about 
a mile and a half from the coaft, and was till within thefe 
few years remarkably perfect. It confifted of three circles 
of ftones within each other. The outer circle, which was 
about 45 feet in diameter, confifted of 12 large ftones placed 
on end. The inner circles were compofed of fmaller ftones, 
placed in the fame manner, and between the two outermoft 
upon the eaft fide, there was a ftone cheft funk in the earth, 
about 3 feet long, and 1^ wide, which having been accident- 
ally uncovered by a country man, he found an urn, which 
difclofed nothing but a little duft or alh.es. A little farther 
down the hill, towards the S. E. there is another ere&amp;ion 
of the fame kind. It confifts of 1 circle of pretty large 
ftones.

By the Rev* Mr John M'Kill.</head> 



<p>Situatien, Surface, Soil, ifc. 

THIS parifh is fkuated in the county and Synod of 
Dumfries, and in the prelbytery of Penpont. It is 
almoll furrounded with hills, except a pleafant opening to 
the S. and S. W. It has alfo three fmall openings, one W. 
in which is the road up the river Nith to Sanquhar, Air, 
&amp;.c. One N. in which is the road up Enterkin for Lead- 
hills, Edinburgh, &amp;c. One N. E. betwixt 2 hills, being 
a ftrait pafs, known by the name of the Wall-path, leading 
to Edinburgh, &amp;c. by Crawford Muir, and having in it 
the remains of an old earthen or mud-wall fort, called 
I Deers-Cq/l/e, and which had formerly commanded the pafs 
j there, a little above the church and village of Durifdeer. 
The mofl [of the parifli has a fine expofure to the fun along 
1 the range of hills. The river Nith divides it. Its extent 
along the Nith, is about 5 computed miles : From the top 
1 of the Lowthers near Leadhills to Druidmilk, about 2 
I miles W. from Drumlanrig, it is fully 8. On the S. it is

bounded by the parifh of Morton ; on the S. W. by p e n- 
pont ; on the W. N. W- and N. by Sanquhar ; and on the 
N. E. and E. by Crawford. Its general appearance with- 
in the range of hills is flat ; but on the banks of the Nith 
there is a good deal of fleep ground. The Nith is fordable 
only in two or three places. There is a ftone-bridge of 
three arches over it, near the foot of the parifn. Carron, a 
fine clear rivulet, riling at the foot of the Lowthers, runs 
feveral miles down the E. fide of the parifh, then divides 
it from Morton, falls into Nith at Carron foot, and hath 
many acres of arable land, with a gentle declivity on its 
banks. — The foil, in general, is deep and fertile ; in many 
places inclining to a reddifh colour, and this colour increafes 
in proportion to the height of the hills. The moll remark- 
able mountains in the parifh are the Lowthers, from the 
Job of which, in a clear day, there is a mofl extenfive ai}d 
variegated profpe£t. The hills are partly covered with 
heath, partly with verdure, and a ftrong kind of grafs call- ' 
ed Bent. They are paflured with fine flocks of fheep of 
the fhort kind, as that fpecies has hitherto been confidered . 
the mofl proper for the fituation. — Freeftone of various 
kinds is found. In feveral places there is the appearance - 
of coal ; and it is thought that fome of the hills contain \ 
lead, as the mines of Leadhills and Wanlockhead are on i 
the other fide of the Lowthers. 

Population.— According to Dr Webfter's returns, the 
numbers were 1019. It is highly probable that this parifh 1 
was more populous about the beginning of this century than 1 
at prefent. One or 1 tenants now poffefs places formerly ' 
occupied by feveral famines. The parifh now contains = 
1031 fouls. There are only 2 villages ; 1 containing about t 
100 perfons, and another about 50.

During thefe laft 19 years, 430 have been baptized, 323

whofe own account of her age was, that flie remembered the 
Merk Monday being then a little girl. This remarkable 
Monday is faid to have been in the year 1652. The num- 
ber of farmers, excluding thofe who have fmall fubfets, is 
43. All the inhabitants are natives of Scotland, except 1 
families from Ireland. There are 27 Seceders, and 7 of 
thofe who call themfelves of the Reformed Prelbytery. 
There has been only 1 inftance of filicide lince the. year 
1 77 1, and the perfon who was guilty of it was evidently 
lunatic^ 

Agriculture, ifc* — The produce of this parifh is fuch, as 
is common in the fouthern parts of Scotland. Oak is the 
moft plentiful fpecies of trees, and lheep the moft plentiful 
fpecies of animals. Some farms bordering on the hills have 
upwards of 80 fcore. The breed of lheep might be impro- 
ved here, by introducing the long inftead of the ftiort kind. 
They are already on the farm of Holellain, and it is 
thought that they may thrive on the high grounds of this 
parilh. They carry a much greater quantity of wool than 
the lhort kind. Butter is reckoned preferable to oil for 
mixing with the tar ufed in fmearing. This is the opinion 
of the Englifti manufacturers, who have got the Holeftain 
wool thefe few years paft. The lheep of a bluifti colour 
are fuppofed to have the worft kind of wooi. The wool at 
Holeftain farm was fold, within thefe few years, at 3 s. and 
3s. 6d. the ftone. In funvmer 1790, after the lheep were 

waftied

warned, it fold at 8 s. the ftone. The number of flxeep is 
about 10,500. Several diftri&amp;s are remarkable for producing 
mutton and beef of the beft quality. There are 188 horfes, 
the moft of which are employed in agriculture, which has 
been making rapid improvement of late years. Within 
thefe few years, many acres have been employed in raifing 
potatoes and barley ; a few in turnip, wheat, and rye-grafs ; 
but by far the greateft number is fown with oats. The 
parifti for feveral years paft, not only has fupplied its inha- 
bitants with proviftons, but exported many hundred Hones, 
of oat-meal and barley to the mining Company's ftores at 
Wanlockhead and Leadhills, and fome to Sanquhar and the 
Well country. Many fcores of lambs are fent annually to 
the fairs at Langholm, Lockerby, Lanark, &amp;c. and fome 
Iambs and fat fheep to Edinburgh : alfo a great number 
of black cattle of various ages and fizes to England. When 
the feafon is favourable, feed-time "begins here about the 
middle of March, and bear or bigg, (a kind of grain with 
four rows on each head,) is fown from the beginning to the 
20th of May. In a good feafon, harveft fometimes begins 
on the 2cth of Auguft. In 1782 and 1783, plenty of meal 
was to be got here for money. The higheft price was 2 s.

Almoft the whole parifh belongs to the Duke of Queenf- 
berry. 

Stipend, School, Poor, l$c. — The ftipend is L. 700 
Scots, 3 chalders of victual, 5 meal, the other bear, L. 40 
Scots for communion-elements, and 21 acres of a glebe. 
The Duke of Queenfberry is patron. The manfe was 
built in 1763. The church was repaired in 1785. — There 
is one fchool with a falary of L. 100 Scots, but no fchool- 
houfe nor dwelling-houfe. There is another fchool for 
teaching Englifh, writing, and arithmetic, to which Mr 
Thomas Tod, once minifter of this parifh, mortified 1000 
merks Scots ; the intereft of this fum, and of L. 14 Sterling 
that had been faved during vacancies, make the whole of 
the falary. The kirk-feffion elect, the teacher, according to 
Mr Tod's deed of fettlement. There are feveral other 
teachers employed in different places of the parifh. There 
may be 35 fcholars at an average throughout the year 
at the parifh fchool. — On the poor's roll there are generally 
between 25 and 30 perfons. Befides occafional afliftance is 
given to families in diftrefs. Few of the poor beg except 
within the bounds of the parifh. The poor are provided for 
by the Sunday collections, by the intereft of 1000 merks 
Scots, mortified by the late Mr Tod, and by L. 1 1 : 1:5 
Sterling, mortified by General Douglas, long paid on that 
footing ; but the bond being amifiing, it has, for fome time 
paft, been paid as an allowance, from the Duke of Queenf- 
berry, together with 25 ftone of meal yearly. Befides, 
there is L. 106, 12 s. at 4 per cent, intereft. So that the funds 
for the fupport of the poor amount to about L. 40 a- year, ex- 
clufive of occafional legacies.

derable quantity of falmon caught, and fold for 2d. and 
fometimes for 3 d. the lb* The inhabitants, in general, are 
hofpitable, honeft, fober, and induftrious. They are of the 
middle fize. A great number of the lower claffes are employ- 
ed in fpinning yarn of coarfe wool for carpets, which is 
moftly fold for ready money, and carried to Kilmarnock, 
and of late to Kendal. The coarfe wool has been rifing for 
tome years paft from 3 s. to 6 s. the ftone, and the fine in pro- 
portion. The price of cattle and horfes, as well as ftieep, is 
greatly raifed. — Some of the inhabitants have inlifted in the

ment for the Holland fervice, a confiderable number inlifted 
here, and in the neighbourhood. Several of the natives 
have gone abroad likewife in the mercantile line, and fome

of them have been very fuccefsful in the Weft Indies. The 
people, in general, live comfortably. Some of the princi- 
pal farmers and ftoremafters are in affluent circumftances, 
and live in a genteel manner. — The rent of cot-houfes is 
from 10S.I020S. a-year. Farmers, tradefmen, labourers, and 
fervants, are much better lodged than 20 or 30 years ago. 
The removal of the burden of hay and corn labour, coal car- 
riage, the payment of fowls and other fervitudes, would me- 
liorate the condition of fome of the farmers. A moderate 
advance of yearly rent, inftead of high graffums, (which 
take away the money that would enable the farmers to 
improve their ground), would have the fame effecT:. Were 
the tax on horfes taken off, it would tend to meliorate, in 
fome degree, the condition of the clergy. They muft con- 
lider themfelves aggrieved in being fubje&amp;ed to pay a tax for 
horfes only employed in labouring their glebes, and in car- 
rying them to difcharge the offices of their profeffion. They 
plead an exemption, becaufe the law allows them a horfe in 
landward parifh.es ; becaufe glebes, by a£l of parliament, be- 
fore the Union, were free from taxation, and becaufe every 
privilege belonging to the Church of Scotland before the U- 
nion, was exprefsly ftipulated to be continued. — There are 
9 houfes, where whifky, porter, and ale are fold by licence. 
The morals of the people will, probably, be hurt by drink- 
ing more fpirituous liquors lince the malt-duty was raifed fo 
high ; and little malt is made in this country in comparifon of 
what was made formerly. — Theftate of the roads is but indif- 
ferent. The ftatute-labour is commuted. A road from the 
village of Durifdeer would conne&amp;the Wallpath road with the 
new turnpike to Sanquhar and the weft country, and would 
be of very great fervice to all the inhabitants of Carron water 
for the article of coals. A bridge over Nith, even though it 
were confhu&amp;ed of timber, would be of material advantage ;

^ Orphichsn is faid to fignify f ten hills a range -of hills 
having fo many particular tops being immediately in the 



vicinity of the village of Torphichen. The parifii is fitua- 
ted in the prefbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian 
and Tweeddale, about 17 miles W. of Edinburgh, in lati- 
tude 55 0 55', about 9 miles in length from E. to W. and 
its average breadth about 2 J. It is bounded on the S. part- 
ly by the parifh of Bathgate, and partly by Shotts ; on the 
W. partly by Shotts and New Monkland ; on the N. by Sla- 
mannan and Muiravenfide ; and on the E. by Linlithgow. The 
parifh is hilly in general, but particularly fo at the E. end, 
where the hill called Cairn Naple is fituated, the height of 
which above the level of the fea is 1498^ feet. The parifh 
maybe reduced into two diftri&amp;s ; the E. end, extending about 
4 miles, is in moft parts very fertile, except the hilly parts. 
The weft end is what is commonly called moor-land. The 
air, in general, is moifler than farther eaft the county, but

does not appear to be unhealthy, nor is there any diftemper 
that may he called endemic. There is one fpring ftrongly 
impregnated with iron, and may therefore he ufeful as a 
Tonic ; it is about a mile weft from the village of Torphi- 
chen, and is faid to have been much frequented about 40 or 
50 years ago. There is a loch about a mile to the N. E. 
of the village of Torphichen, about a mile, or rather more, 
in circumference, which affords pike, perch and eel. There 
is a confiderable quantity of freeftone, and very durable 
for building, and plenty of what is commonly called whin- 
ftone, both made ufe of for building houfes and fences. 
Coal is very plenty a coal-mine has been wrought on the 
wefter declivity of Cairn Napple for a confiderable time, 
but is only made ufe of by the proprietor for burning his 
lime, which is in the neighbouring parifti of Linlithgow ; 
about 2 miles farther weft, on the farm of Killicanty, a 
coal-mine was wrought for a very long period, till within 
about 20 years paft, and might ftill be wrought if there 
was encouragement. In this farm, too, there is iron-ftone, 
2 feams of it having appeared on cutting into a hill for the 
purpofe of levelling a road ; they are about 18 inches a- 
funder, and each about 5 inches thick, and of a good qua- 
lity. 

Population.-~-At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 1295. Excepting that the village of Tor- 
phichen is considerably increafed, it is probable, that the 
reft of the parilh was more populous even a century ago 
than it is at prefent. The prefent amount is 1069. Deaths,

There are 6 fmiths, 9 tailors, 15 weavers, 26 mafons and 
Wrights, 1 furgeon, 156 Seceders. Very few reach the age 
of 80 ; one man, aged upwards of 80, a farmer, and capable 
of going about bufinefs, has been 4 times married, and has 
had 26 children ; there is another man of middle age, or" 
rather more, has had 15 children by one woman, who is 
ftill alive, and had a child within a few months ago, and 
the whole 15 children are alive. 

Agriculture, %3c. — Land rents at from 7 s. to 30 s. the 
acre. There are 62 or 63 ploughgates of land in the parilh r 
each ploughgate not lefs than 70 acres. Some farmers have 
one or two ploughgates •, two or three about three ; and one 
five. The roads in the parifh are upheld by each ploughgate 
of land being alfeffed in 12 days work of a fingle horfe cart, 
and a man, or fix days work of a double horfe cart, with 
a man. The above work may likewife, in the option of 
the truftees or overfeers, be converted into money, at the 
ordinary rate of labour, which commutation is at prefent' 
ftated at 12 s. Sterling the ploughgate ; a fum by no means- 
adequate to the work. — There is a diftillery in the village of 
Torphichen, where about 2000 bolls of barley are yearly 
diftilled, and upon the grain are fed about 40 head of cattle^ 
that will weigh at an average 40 ftorie each. Few fheep 
are kept \ the grounds are moftly grazed with black cattle. 
The parim produces wheat, barley, oats, peas ; the former 
in the eafter half of the parifh only, and of late the quantity. 
£own yearly is increafing ; the culture of peas is rather de- 
clining.

dining. There is a very confiderable quantity of planting, 
confiding of oak, afh, elm, birch, beech and fir, the latter in 
very large quantities ; of the other there are fome very fine 
trees, both for beauty and value. There is a poplar, the di- 
menfions of which were taken about the year 1788, when it 
was fome what more than 80 feet high, and its circum- 
ference within two feet of the ground, 5 feet 11 inches. 
Planting is yearly going on, both for fhelter and beauty. 
The moll part of the parifh is inclofed, and the farmers are 
fo fenfible of the advantages refulting therefrom, that 3 
piece of uninclofed land is not eafy to be let. There are a- 
bout 30 bolls of wheat fown yearly, 80 of barley, about 
80 acres of artificial graffes, and turnip is beginning to be 
attended to. Each family in general plants as many potatoes 
as may ferve for its own ufe. The fame may be faid of 
flax. It is fuppofed that about two thirds of the parifh are a- 
rable, and that the parifh fupplies itfelf with provifions, and 
about a third more. Seed-time, in general, for oats, is from 
the ift of March to the middle of April, and from the 
ift to the middle of May for barley. Harveft from ift Sep- 
tember to the middle of October. The parifh has abundance 
of fuel and water, for the encouragement of the manufac- 
turer, with the additional encouragement of the Cleugh 
turnpike road. There are 3 oat and barley mills, and 1.

the family, receives as wages L. 7 a-year. A woman fervant, 
living in the family, L. 3 : A man fervant that lives in a cot- 
tage receives the forefaid wages, and 2 pecks of meal, and 
6 d. a- week, which is reckoned much the fame expence as 
living in the houfe. A day-labourer's wages are 1 s. 
without victuals, and 6 d. with victuals. 

Antiquities, r Jc. — A little to the N. E. of the village of 
Torphichen, is the hofpital or preceptory of Torphichen, 
the principal refidence of the Knights of St John of Je- 
rufalem. There is only the choir of the church remain- 
ing, all the reft of the houfes being razed, except a fquare 
tower ; there are two wings, one on the S. and the other 
on the N. fide, and evident marks of other two on the 
E. and W. •, on the inlide are three beautiful Gothic arch- 
ed domes, the middle one fupported by fome Gothic co- 
lumns ; the windows are large and Gothic ; in the S. wing 
is a niteh for laying the dead during funeral fervice, and 
likewife the font for baptifm. It was founded by King 
David I. There have been feveral preceptors of Tor- 
phichen who have been confiderable men, the firft men- 
tioned is one Archibaldus magifter de Torphichen, who 
is witnefs to a charter of Alexander, Great Steward of 
Scotland in 1252. Sir Henry Livingfton was likewife 
preceptor, who, dying in 1463, was fucceeded by Sir Wil- 
liam Knows, who, in the fame year, was made Lord High 
Treafurer. He died at the unfortunate battle of Flouden 
in 15 13, and was fucceeded by Sir George Dundas, who 
Vas a perfon of great learning, and a fchool fellow of 

Hector 



47© Statiftical Account 

Hector Boethlus at Paris. The laft preceptor was Sir 
James Sandilands, fecond fon to Sir James Sandilands of 
Calder. Sandilands, at the Reformation, refigned all the 
lands of the Johanites in Scotland into Queen Mary's 
hands, who feued them out again to him for 10,000 
crowns, and the yearly annuity of 500 merks. She alfo 
erected all the forefaid lands into a temporal lordftiip, 
in favour of him and his heirs, in 1563. The Templarj 
crofs was ordered to be put upon all houfes that wert 
feued out by thefe Knights, and to this day is feen a great 
number of croffes upon the top of feveral buildings in E- 
dinburgh, Leith, Linlithgow, Stirling, &amp;c. which former- 
ly belonged to them. This preceptory was a place of re- 
fuge. There is a ftone in the church-yard as a centre, and 
others at a mile diftance, E. W. S. and N. with a St 
John's crofs on them : They ftand about 2 feet out of the 
ground. — About a mile to the E. of Torphichen, is an al- 
tar of 4 great unpolifhed whin ftones, on which, accord- 
ing to tradition, facri dees were anciently performed : By o- 
thers, it has been called the temple of Terminus, although 
it may rather have been a druidical place of wcrfliip. — I 
About a mile to the N. W. of this altar, is the hill Bou- 
dane, upon which there are evident marks of a military 
ftation : The form of the camp is oblong and round •, it is 
marked in Armftrong's map of the 3 Lothians as a Da- 
nifh camp ; the tradition of the country is, that it is Ro- 
man. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — The people of this parifli 
are induftrious, the mod of the labouring men wifh to 
take a fee in winter, but in fummer to remain free, when 
they employ themfelves in mowing hay, driving cattle to 
England, and reaping in harveft. This is complained of by 



of Torpbichen.

the farmers. Servant women are difficult to be had too in 
fummer, as they make nearly as much in harveft as their 
half year's wages would be, and can do very well the reft 
of the time by fpinning flax •, indeed there are many wo- 
men who do very well the year round, by fpinning flax, 
with their harveft wages. A married man, with common 
prudence, is at no difficulty to maintain and bring up his 
children, if he keeps his health, along with the induftry of 
the mother. The commonalty live on the produce of the 
country, or what is called milk and meal, with a large 
proportion of potatoes in winter. The drefs is greatly more 
expenfive than it was 30 or 40 years ago.

(COUNTIES OF ROSS AND CROMARTY.) 

By the Rev. Mr John Ross.</head> 

<p>Na??ie, Situation, Soil, River, &amp;c. 

THE parifli of Loggie Eafter is fo called, becaufe there 
was another of the fame name fome time ago in the 
weftern divifion of Rofs. The name Loggie, (in the Gaelic 
Lagie) fignifies " a hollow." The church formerly flood 
in a beautiful hollow, furrounded by braes or hillocks. It 
is nearly 7 miles in length, and in fome places more than a 
in breadth-, bounded on the S. by the parifli of Kilmuire, 
on the E. by Nigg ; on the N. E. by Fearn ; on the N. 
by Tain ; and on the W. by Eddertown and Kilmuire. 
This parifli lies partly in the county of Rofs, and partly in 
the county of Cromarty, within 4 miles of the town of 
Tain, which is the prefbytery-feat, and fometimes the feat 
of the Synod of Rofs. The difeafes to which the inhabi- 
tants are raoft fubjecT:, are the cough, afthma and rheuma- 
tifm. Sometimes fevers get in among them. The fmall- 
pox raged here twice lately, and carried off a confiderable 
number of children. Some of the inhabitants, from a reli- 
gious prejudice, were not reconciled to the practice of inocu- 
lation ;

lation; whilft others were prudent enough to take the bene- 
fit of this fuccefsful mean to fave their children. There 
have been, and are ftill feveral inflances of longevity here. 
—The foil, in fome places, is a ftrong deep clay, in others a 
rich black mould, and in others a light earth on an open 
bottom. There is a conliderable part of the parifh not in 
.culture, which is capable of being turned to good account. 
There was, however, fomething done of late in this way. 
The proprietors give fome encouragement towards it, by 
building houfes on wafte ground, and giving their pofieflors 
the benefit of what ground they can break up for feven 
years, before they pay any rent. Some likewife give each 
of them, a fpade, mattock and feed for once to fow what 
ground they yearly bring into culture. There is a good 
deal of plantations in a thriving condition . The only natu- 
ral wood is on the ground of Ulladale. The only river in 
this parifti goes generally by the name of Abhor, or " river." 
It has 2 bridges upon it. There are 3 burns or rivulets, one 
of which, with heavy rains, overflows its banks, and fome- 
times, particularly in feed-time, confiderably damages the 
fields on each fide of it, walhing away the loofe earth and 
feed within its reach, and fpoiling the grafs. We have fome 
of the fineft fprings in different parts of the parifn. One of 
them near the old church was once fuperftitioufly thought 
to foretel the future recovery or death of any lick perfon, 
for whom they fetched fome of its water, by changing its 
colour if he was to die, and continuing the fame if he was 
to recover. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 850. The population has been greatly on 
the increafe for 10 years back. The laft incumbent had no 
more than 600 examinable perfons on his lift •, whereas, by 

Vol. IV, 3 O an

an exact, lift taken by the prefent incumbent 2 years ago, 
there were 900 perfons in the parifh, from 8 years old and 
upward. In the fummer of 1782, whole families came 
down from the Highlands, on account of the dearth, and 
fettled here for the benefit of daily labour, and having the 
fuel fo near them. The encouragement given for turning 
wafte ground into culture, has likewiie increafed the popu- 
lation. The monopoly of farms, cr turning fome fraall ones 
into a large one, takes pla.ee here. Gentlemen proprietors 
have very conliderable farms under their own manage- 
ment; and the farmers wifh to have each as much land as 
he can. This, however, does not afFeclt the population. 
There are 258 houfes pofiefled 2 reliding heritors, a gen- 
tleman captain on half pay, the minifter, fchoolmafter and 
kirk-ofneer, 49 farmers, 33 cu't-fervants, 32 cottagers, 15 
weavers, 11 fhoemakers, 2 mafons, a brick-maktr, a care- 
wright, a plough-wright, 3 fmiths, 3 coopers, 3 millers, 3 
pedlars, 2 turners, 3 public-houfe keepers, 8 tailors, 2 houfe 
carpenters, 2 gardeners. ' The remaining 78 hcufes are po&amp; 
felled by day-labourers, poor widows and maidens who fet 
up by themfelves, fometimes only 1, generally 2 of them if 
a houfe. All are of the Eftablilhed Church, except a few Sp- 
eeders. The number of births for 10 years back, reckoning 
at an average, is 32 yearly ; of marriages 8. 

Agriculture. — The valued rent is L. 1514 Scots. The 
real rent may be about L. 1100 Sterling. Some of the pro- 
prietors have converted cuftoms and fervices into money, 
and there are no fervices at prefent from the tenants to their 
matters, except that fome tenants, by their leafes, are obli- 
ged yearly to cut fome peats for them, and carry them 
home, and to give them 3 days afliftance in harveft. The 
cottagers who relide near their matters houfe, are obliged to

attend and affift in carrying their corn-ftacks from the barn- 
yard into the barn. The fervitudes which difgraced human 
nature, by rendering tenants almoft flaves, ai'e, in this parifh, 
done away ; and I hope the day is faft approaching, when 
proprietors will find it proper to have their rents paid in. 
victual and money only. The greater! farmers pay about 
L. 60 Sterling yearly rent in victual and money, and fome 
of them not L. 5 Sterling. The principal crops are oats, 
barley, and potatoes, which laft are the fupport of ma- 
ny poor families, with fome little meal, for more than half 
of the year. There grows alfo a confiderable quantity of peas, 
and rye. The proprietors, and even farmers, now fow clo- 
ver and rye-grafs, and find this the moft profitable way of 
refting their lands, after which they get rich crops. Of e- 
very kind of grain, a far greater quantity grows than ferves 
the inhabitants. A confiderable quantity of barley is ufed 
in malting, for ale, and to ferve the diftilleries around us in 
other parilhes, there being none licenfed here. Oats, bar- 
ley, and oat-meal are fold here to perfons^at a diftance, and 
fometimes fent out of the country. — There are about 600 
horfes, nearly twice the number of oxen,- and a confiderable 
quantity of milk cows. The horfes are generally fmail, but 
even the farmers have begun the cuftora of fupplying them- 
lelves with thofe of a large fize from Moray ; and this bet- 
ters the breed of horfes here. The number of fheep is not 
fo confiderable now as formerly, the gentlemen in this pa- 
rifh rather cultivating milk cows, and the tenants not having 
the fame range for their fheep, by the improvement of 
wafte ground.

Twelve years ago, during the vacancy Sir John Rofs of 
Balnagovvn, with confent and approbation of heritors and 
prefbytery, took the manfe and glebe to himfelf, and built 
a neat manfe for the prefent incumbent. The former 
glebe meafured 9 acres of very good land, in lieu of which, 
by the arbitration of proper judges, he gave 26 acres of a- 
rable and wade ground, around the hill on which the manfe 
was built. On this hill, there is a raoft charming profpect. 
to the fouth of the town and bay of Cromarty, and to the 
eaft, of the parifh.es of JSfigg and Fearn, and a part of the 
parifh of Tarbat. From the month of May, to that of Oc- 
tober, fuch a fcene of corn fields, over fo very confiderable 
a fpace of ground, ftrik.es the delighted beholder. The fti- 
pend is 5 chalders of barley, L. 22 : 15 : 6 Sterling, and a 
right to the fmall tithes in kind. Kenneth Mackenzie, Efq; 
is patron. — The falary of the parilh fchoolmafter is only 
100 merks. By this falary and fchool-dues,. which are far 
from being extraordinary, with his falary and perquisites as 
feffion-clerk, and fome laudable drifts, this man decently 
fupports himfelf and family. There is a fchool in .the 
heights of the pariih of Kilmuire, the falary of which year- 
ly is paid by the Society for Propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge, which lies very contiguous to the heights of this pa- 
rifli, and at which feveral children from it are taught. — The 
number of perfons on the poor's roll is generally between 60 
and 70. The greateft part of them can do fomething to- 
wards their own fupport ; fuch of them as are able, go a- 
bout once a-year and collecl: fomething in this way. They 
receive alms frequently from the inhabitants at their own 
houfes, and the money collefted at church, (except a little 
given in the way of falary to the feffion-clerk, catechifl, and 
kirk-officer), goes all to their ufe. They have alfo the 
fines raifed from fuch as commit fornication. There are

the behoof of this and of fome neighbouring pariihes, from 
which this parifh has a fund of L. 24 Sterling. Befides, 
there is a fund of L. 18 Sterling belonging to the feflion, 
the intereft of which is yearly given to the poor. Col- 
lections at church for 10 years back are, at an average, 
L. 14 Sterling yearly. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The common people gene- 
rally fpeak the Gaelic language ; many of them underftand 
fomething of the Englifli, and fpeak it through the Gaelic 
accent and idiom. — The inhabitants are in general of a pi- 
ous, fober, and induftrious difpofltion, well acquainted with 
the principles of religion, and regular in their practice. 
This does not fay that there are no exceptions. There has 
not been one of them tried for theft or murder fince the 
prefent incumbent came among them. Two inftances of 
fuicide have indeed occurred during that time. — The ne- 
eeffaries of life are eafily acquired here •, its conveniencies 
and fuperfluities fall to the fhare of a very few perfons. 
This parifh abounds in the extremities of it, and in fome 
parts through its very middle, with mofs and turf ground ; 
fome of the neighbouring parifhes cut their peats and turf 
in it, and carry them to their own homes. To cut, dry, 
and carry thefe home, is the labour of many during the 
greateft part of the fummer, and the firft month of harveft. 
Peats, turf, and brufhwood, are in general the fuel here. 
Gentlemen indeed buy and ufe coals. — The out fervants 
have a houfe from their mafter, 6 bolls of meal for their 
meat, and 3 for their wages in the year •, with 2 pairs of fhoes, 
and the ufe of as much land to plant potatoes, and fow bar- 
ley on, as they can provide manure for. The produce of 
potatoes is all their own. They give half feed for the bar- 
ley

ley land, and receive half of the incrcafe. All thefe things, 
with fome perquifites they expect and get, will be worth 
about L. 12 Sterling a-year. So that an out fervant, with 
his wife, (if ftie be fober and indirftrious), and 5 or perhaps 
6 children, can live eafily, though frugally, and may be 
juftly more void of care than his mailer. The hire of a 
day-labourer here is from 6d. to 8d. a-day ; but they ge- 
nerally deal in what they call flump work, or work by the 
piece. The women, befides out labour, deal much in fpin- 
ning hemp, flax and lint, of which they can make each 3d. 
a-day ; and fome maidens chooie rather to keep houfe by 
themfelves, (as a hut can eafily be built, and fuel procured), 
and live in this way rather than go to fervice. They reap 
in harveft, for which they have each a boll and 2 pecks, for 
about 6 weeks labour, and fpin throughout the reft of the year. 
The hire of a man for the harveft work is a boll and a half, 
with one diet a-day. — There is a ridge of fmall hills in the 
middle of the parifli, of no great height. On the top of 
one of thefe once flood a gallows, which part was furround- 
ed by a. ditch, as may be ftill feen. Not far from it, near 
the very end of the ridge, is a pond of water, narrow in 
circumference, but very deep, and not eafily fathomed. 
This pond goes by the name of Poll a bhaidh, or the ' Pool 
' for drowning.' About 40 years ago, died a man, who 
witnefled the laft execution in this pool, that of a woman 
for child-murder. Hence it appears, that when heritable 
jurifdidtion took place, this was one of thofe places in this 
county appointed for the execution of condemned crimi- 
nals. — On each fide of the burn or rivulet, called Aultran, 
Albanick, or Scotlburn, are feveral cairns. The tradition 
refpefting them is, that there was a battle fought in this 
place by the Scots and Danes, which the Scots gained - r 
that this water received its name from that cireumflance |

and that under thefe heaps of ftones they buried their (lain. 
A part of one of thefe heaps was removed, the ground un- 
der it dug up, and human bones and an axe were found there. 
In fevcral places are tumuli, fome of which clearly appear to 
be the works of art- There are likewife fmall inclofures of 
turf artificially made, fome of them fquare, and fome circular. 
Two always appear near each other ; they are called in the 
Gaelic, Reiiagan. Reite or Reitachas, in that language, fig-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5395549">ERROL</name>, 
(COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By Mr Willjam Herdman, AJJiJlant to the Minijler of 
Errol.</head> 


<p>Name, Situation, Soil and Climate. 

•^J^HE name of Errol feems to be of great antiquity. 

The firft mention made of it is about the year 980, 
when the country was freed from an invafion of the 
Danes. One Hay and his two fons, who were ploughing 
in the field, flopped their countrymen in their flight, cau- 
fed them return to the charge, and, by a furious onfet, fub- 
due and rout their enemies. For this fignal fervice, the 
family was ennobled under the title of Earl of Errol, and 
obtained a portion of land in the Carfe of Gowrie, where 
Errol is fituated. It continued in the pofieffion of their 
defcendants till the middle of the laft century, and has 
fince belonged to feveral proprietors. No account is given 
of the origin of the name. The parifh lies within the Sy- 
nod and prefbytery of Perth. It is bounded by the river 
'Tay on the S. by the parifh of Inchture on the E. ; by 
Kinnaird, Kilfpindie, and Kinfawns, on the N. ; and by 

St 



of Erroh 



481 



St Madois on the W. It is 5 miles in length, and near- 
ly 3 in breadth ; perfe&amp;ly regular and compact, and in- 
cludes a large and a fair portion of the carfe of Gowrie» 
From the one end to the other, it ftretches over almoft the 
whole breadth of the carfe, from its commencement at the 
foot of the hills, to its termination by the Tay ; and 
though it is in general level ground, there are feveral e- 
minences in it, which add much to the beauty of the fi- 
gure. The foil is of excellent quality. It varies accord- 
ing to the fituation. The low land, which may compre- 
hend two-thirds of the parilh, is in general a ftrong clay j 
the rifing ground, and particularly that in the neighbour- 
hood of the village of Errol, is a rich black earth ; and 
towards the W. end of the parilh, the foil is of a lighter 
nature, inclining to a brown fand. The whole country is 
naturally wet, and it is the draining and improving of it 
within thefe laft 5c years, which has contributed fo much 
to its value and fertility. The climate, of courfe, could 
not be confidered as the molt defirable. It was damp,- 
and attended with fuch difeafes as are common in a heavy 
atmofphere. Some time ago, the ague was a very pre- 
valent complaint ; it has now in a great meafure difap- 
peared ; but a difeafe Hill more fatal feems to have come 
in its (lead. Confumptions, which formerly were rare, 
have of late been very frequent, although, from the ftate 
of cultivation, it fhould be thought that the air is much 
more falubrious. But what is remarkable in the carfe of 
Gowrie, the people who refide in the higher parts of the 
country are not found to be the moft healthy. The in- 
habitants of the low and marlhy grounds, indeed, may be 
more liable to rheumatic complaints, but they have been 
often obferved to enjoy the longeft courfe of life.

Statiflical Account 



Agriculture. — The mode of cultivation has undergone 
an entire revolution within thei'e 40 years, and, as this 
parifh is an important part of the carfe of Gowrie, that 
article is the more delerving of notice. The land was for- 
merly divided into what was called infield and outfield, 
there being about two-thirds of the former, and a third of 
the latter. The infield, which generally lay next the vil- 
lage or tenement, got the dung produced on the farm, and 
was kept under a conftant rotation of peas, wheat, barley 
and oats -, lime, fallow and artificial graffes, were almoft 
unknown. The outfield, after remaining 6 years in its 
natural ftate, was for 3 crops turned into oats, having 
been previoufly thrown up into dikes as a preparation for 
them ; after which it was allowed to revert to its former 
condition. The produce of every kind was very indiffe- 
rent. In thofe days of fterility, the horfes were fupported 
in fummer upon thirties, which were to be had in abun_ 
dance, both in the laboured and uncultivated grounds, and 
which it was the employment of the fervants to collecf. 
The land is at prefent in a high ftate of improvement. 
As almoft the whole parifh is capable of bearing the fame 
grain, the farmers, like impartial ftewards, direct their at- 
tention equally to every part of their charge, and divide 
their poffeflions into 6 equal portions, which they employ 
for fallow, wheat, peas, barley, grafs and oats. The fal- 
low which fucceeds the oats or wheat, is turned over ill 
the end of autumn, again in the beginning of fummer, 
and commonly ploughed and harrowed other 3 times in 
the courfe of it. It is always enriched with dung, and 
frequently with lime, which are laid on it before it gets ' 
the laft furrow in Auguft.— The wheat upon the fallow 
is fown from the 8th to the laft of September. As this is 
the principal crop which recompences the toil and ex-| 

peafe. 



of Errol.

jfcerife of the farmer, it ia perpetually encroaching on the 
!grounds belonging to the other kinds of grain. Some te- 
nants who are only bringing their lands into order, or 
who, it is feared, are bound down by their leafes, adhere 
ftriclly to the fixths into which they have divided them* 
and convert no more into wheat than they had under fal- 
low ; others, whofe pofleflions have been longer in a ftate 
•of improvement, borrow confiderably from the barley and 
oats, turning fields of peas and of grafs into wheat as they 
judge bed ; while fome very good farmers plough up the 
whole of what was grafs, and lay the third of their grounds 
under wheat. But this extenfive cropping is liable to be 
interrupted, and is fometimes entirely prevented, except 
on the fallow, by the heavy rains which fall in autumn. 

The feed-time is finifhed in general by the middle of Oc- 
tober, and the harveft commences about the 24th of Au- 
guft. According to the foil, ftrong beans, grey peas and 
beans, or early peas are raifed ; the grain is fown as early 
in March as the feafon will permit, the oats immediately 
after ; and the harvelt takes place in September. The 
land for barley, that it may be fully pulverized, is tho- 
roughly ploughed at 3 different periods, November, A- 
pril and May, and the crop is ready for reaping at the 
fame time with the oats. Drilled beans, potatoes and tur- 
nip, are fometimes put in place of peas, and found to be an 
excellent preparation for the barley. — If the quantity 
reaped from each kind of grain in the parifli Ihould not 
feem remarkable, the quality yields an abundant corn- 
pen fation. The return obtained in general from wheat 
may be 10 bolls the acre on the fallow, and 8 after grafs. 
The average produce of peas and beans is 8 bolls, which, 
at the price they ufually bring, is a poor crop ; but the 
benefit derived to the land, and the maintenance they 

furnifh 



484 Statijlical Account 



xurnifli for the horfes, are the reafons for continuing them. 
Oats may be eftimated at n bolls, and often leveral more • 
but as they do not commonly exceed 14 s. in value, wheat 
is found to be more profitable, and feldom fails to be fub- 
ftituted in their room, when the exchange can fafely be 
admitted. Barley is a precarious crop on ftrong clay 
ground, and cannot be reckoned upon for more than 8 
bolls, though 10 and upwards are frequently obtained. 
But the produce of all the above articles is fubjeel to 
much viciffitude, though the return mentioned is the high- 
eft that can in general be expected. No part of the king- 
dom perhaps excels this for crops of grafs. They are 
raifed after barley or oats, and even fometimes after 
wheat •, and though the increafe depends a good deal upon 
the feafon, 3 luxuriant cuttings are frequently had be- 
tween the beginning of June and the end of September. 
A confiderable quantity of fruit is like wife produced in 
this diftrid. Formerly there were large orchards planted 
at many of the farm tenements, fome of them coniifting 
of feveral acres ; and though they are in fome meafure be- 
come barren through age, and the quality is by no means 
fine, they annually bring money into the parifh. 

The rearing of live flock, though generally practifed, is not 
carried to great extent. The foil is ill adapted for pafture, 
and too valuable to be left for that purpofe. There are 
juft as many animals maintained, as confume the fodder 
produced on the farm. The cattle are kept in ftraw- 
yards with open fliades, where they thrive very well, and 
are fold when 3 years old, from L. 4 to I,.. 6 or L. 8 each. 
The milk-cows, and work horfes only, have liberty to 
feed on a part of the fown grafs for a little time in fum- 
mer, and the other ftock are fent to graze in the neigh- 
bourhood, or fold, excepting as many as can be fupported 

in

in the yard upon clover. Till of late, the breeding of horfes 
was rather negledted, and large fums were laid out in pur- 
chafing them ; but the farmers are now become more at- 
tentive to their intereft in that refpedt, and there is a pro- 
fpeft that they will henceforth provide for themfelves. 
But the carfe tenants who can go much length in bringing 
up young beafts of whatever kind, are thofe who have 
grafs poflefiions fomewhere elfe, to which they can remove 
them at the proper feafon. The parifli may contain 7000 
acres. The whole of it is arable, and at prefent under 
cultivation in the manner already mentioned, excepting 
fome inclofures of firs, which, though the trees are 
fcarcely come to half their fize, the proprietors are faft 
clearing off. From the different methods purfued by the 
farmers for the productions of grain, it cannot be exactly 
determined what quantity of land is employed in each, 
fpecies •, but it is conjectured that there is a fifth of the 
whole parilh in wheat, nearly a fixth in grafs, and as much 
in peas, fomething more in fallow, potatoes, flax, and plan- 
tations, lefs than a fixth in oats, and about the fame in 
, barley. — Land is rented at very different prices. Fifteen 
years ago, it was about 15 s. the acre. It rofe immediate- 
ly after to L. 1, j s. and was then judged fo high, that the 
tenant obtained his poffeffion for life. It has of late been 
letting for L. 2, and fome of it even for L. 2, 10 s. ; but 
rents of this laft kind are given chiefly for lands about the 
village, where trades people pay rather for the conveni- 
ence than value of ground. The valued rent of the parifli 
is nearly L. 17,000 Scots, and the real rental is faid to be 
about L. 8000 Sterling. The extent of farms is variable, 
but in general from 100 to 200 acres. The tillage is per- 
formed by a plough, with an iron head and mettle mould 
board, drawn by 2 horfes, which one perfon manages. 

For 



486 StatiJHcal Accmmt 



For every 30 acres in the farm, one fuch plough is com- 
monly judged neceffary. As the labour is fevere, ftrong 
horfes are employed, which, for the moft part, coft more 
than L. 21 a-piece. Four or 5 cows are kept on a pof- 
feflion of 1 00 acres. 

Wages, Prices, Wf. — An ordinary ploughman gets from 
!L. 7, 7 s. to L. 9, 9 s. a-year; if married, he pays^L. 1 for 
his houfe and garden, and L. 1, 10 s. for the maintenance 
of a cow throughout the year. There are many of both 
defcriptions in the parilh ; and though the cottager is not 
fo likely to -change his refidence, the unmarried perfon is as 
much defired for a fervant. The wages of a female fer- 
vant are from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, and the whole of her 
employment is in the houfe, except in feed-time and har- 
veft. Moft of the male fervants have their lodging apart 
from the dwelling of the farmer ; and for vicluals, which 
they prepare themfelves, receive 2 pecks of oat-meal a- 
week, and a certain meafure of milk for each diet. When 
iabourers are hired by the day, they have 10 d. in winter, 
and 1 s. in fummer, for meat and wages. Perfons from the 
neighbouring boroughs are engaged for cutting down the 
crop ; the men get from L. 1, 3 s. to L. 1, 5 s. and the wo- 
men from 15 s. to L. 1, befides provifions, which they ge- 
nerally earn in 3 weeks. A confiderable expenfe, befides, 
was annually incurred for a number of hands for threlhing 
out the grain, which fervice is chiefly done now by ma- 
chines for the purpofe. Threlhing-mills were introduced 
into the pariftt about 3 years ago, are multiplying every 
feafon, and confidered a capital improvement in hufbandry. 
— The whole cofts attending cultivation, exclufive of rent, 
and alfo of lime, which is frequently demanded, are faid 
;o be L„ 2 an acre. The price of provifions is much the

fame as in the neighbouring parilhes. — This pariffi pro- 
duces much grain, befides what is neceffary for its own 
confumption. A good deal is fent every year to Perth 
and Dundee, and large quantities are exported by fea. 
It is carried coaftwife to Leith, and feveral other ports on 
the Forth, and up the canal to Glafgow. Winter and 
fpring are the feafons of exportation, the farmer being then 
obliged to difpofe of his grain. The prices are regu- 
lated by the Edinburgh and Glafgow markets, being com- 
monly fomewhat lower, though the grain is of the beft 
quality, and the meafures ufed here exceed thofe at Leith, 
by at leaft 5 per cent, which will defray the charge of tranf- 
portation. There are two places at which all the grain ex- 
ported from the parim is ftiipped off; the more of Er- 
rol, a little below the viUage, and of Powgavie, on the 
E. point of the parilli, where it joins with Inchture. The 
chief traffic carried on, is that of grain in winter, and lime 
and coals in fummer. Lime is brought from different 
parts of Fife, and fold for 17 d. the boll, wheat meafure, and 
alfo from the north of England, of a fuperior quality, which 
is to be had for 2 s. 4 d. barley meafure. Coal, which i s 
the fuel ufed in the parilh, colls about 3 s. 9 d. the boll, 
weighing 52 (tones. There may be 140 or 150 chaldrons 
of coals delivered at the more of Errol in a feafon, and 120 
of lime. The quantity of grain exported may be nearly 
the fame with that of the lime delivered. A correfpond- 
ence is likewife kept up with London, and fome other 
places, whence porter, wine, fugar and wood, are frequently 
received. The proprietor of Errol has a duty upon the ar- 
ticles ftiipped off, or landed at the harbour on his eftate. A 
paflage-boat goes regularly between it and the ftiore of 
Newburgh every tide.

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 2229. At prefent (1791) the numbers are 
2685; of thefe 1857 live in the country, and 828 in the 
village. There are 13CI males, and 1384 females. Com- 
puting from 21 years, the time of majority, there may be 
472 unmarried, 846 married, and 164 widowers or wi- 
dows. Of all defcriptions, there are

The annual average of births for the laft 6 years is 77 ; of 
marriages 32, and of burials 40. There are 18 heritors 
belonging to the pariih ; but the mod of it is in the hands 
of 6 or 7 proprietors, few of whom refide. Almoft the 
whole country is occupied by the farmers. They are ex- 
pert and induftrious in their profeffion, and profperous in 
their circumftances. Little of the fervile work on their 
pofleffions is performed by them or their families ; and be- 
lide female, many of them conftantly maintain 8 male fer- 
vants. There are 211 weavers, who for the moft part 
work cloth for fale ; but no fine manufacture is carried on. 
There are 50 wrights, 25 tailors, 21 Ihoemakers, 14 black - 
fmiths, 5 mafons, 2 brickmakers, 1 bricklayer, 4 bakers, 
3 butchers, .2 furgeons, and 1 writer. There are 7 inn- 
keepers in the village, and 10 in other parts of the pariih. 
There are not above 240 Seceders of all denominations. 
The remaining 2445 belong to the Eftablifhed Church, 
who, for numbers and genteel appearance, will not be ex-

from fordidnefs, and are not unfufceptible of generofity, of 
which they have given proof on feveral occafions. As the 
people equal their neighbours in ufeful, and far furpafs

will be exemplary alfo in that devout and religions de-

the intereft of L. 600, which is a fund belonging to the 
poor, and the duties arifing from marriages and burials. 
No affeflment has for fome time been levied from the pa- 
rifh. 

VoL - IV\ 3 Village,

Statijtical Account 



Village. — The village of Errol is the only place in the 
parilh, in which the number of buildings has lately in- 
creafed. Its fituation is remarkably pleafant. Seated on 
an eminence, riling by a gradual afcent above the level of 
the country, the profpeft from it is extenfive and delight- 
ful. But the houfes in the village are as paltry as the fi- 
tuation is pleafant. As there is no ftone in the neighbour- 
hood, they are moftly built of clay, and huddled together, 
without much order or regularity. Excepting gentlemens 
feats, all the old buildings in the parilh are of that fub- 
ftance, which, when properly cemented, is reckoned the 
warmeft and moft durable of any ; and there are fome fa- 
brics of it ftill in tolerable repair, the date of which cannot 
be afcertained. In forming fuch edifices, every man is his 
own mafon, railing them by times, and putting on one 
layer as the other is condenfated ; and to this caufe it is 
certainly owing that there are fo few profeffional mafons in 
the parifli. It is thought that the people have now in fome 
tneafure loft the art of preparing the materials,, and com- 
pacting them together, fo as to give the clay-houfes the fo- 
lidity they had in paft times. They are, however,, adopt- 
ing a plan of building much more agreeable to the eye, 
and certainly no lefs ufeful for accommodation, moulding 
the mortar into bricks, and with thefe forming their dwel- 
liags. The proprietor having adopted the judicious plan 
of feuing out many of the old houfes, with their yards, fe- 
veral good houfes have of late been erefted, and the village 
has increafed in population. 

River Tay.— The country is interfefted in different places 
by fmall trafts of water, called pows, which move flowly 
from the N. to the S. fide of the carfe, and which are col- 
lected moftly from the trenches opened for draining the 

ground,

ground. The Tay, into which they iflue, is the only ri- 
ver in the parifti. It furnifties excellent falmon. For- 
merly the market here was well Hocked with them, and 
their price always moderate •, but the whole filhings having 
"been let to companies of merchants in Perth, for a number 
of years the produce has been fent in veflels to London^ 
where the demand for them has almoft entirely removed 
them from the reach of the people, for whofe ufe nature 
•feems to have ordained them. They are ftill caught in 
.great quantities in the river, but not many immediately 
oppofite to Errol. The Tay, by the conftant action of the 
tide and current, making an impreflion on a foft bank, and 
•warning away every feafon a valuable portion of land, the 
-late proprietor of Errol built large ftone dikes for the de- 
fence of his eftate. Befides ftretching along the coaft, piers 
Were run fome length into the river. They have had a 
confiderable efFe£t. A ftrong crop of reeds grows annual- 
ly in the mud, over which the tide regularly flows, which 
help to diminilh its influence, and, by' their roots, to con- 
folidate the earth ; and the bank, which formerly was fo 
yielding, is become a firm beach, covered with young 
.planting, which is of ufe, both for ornament and protec- 
tion. But what is profitable by land is hurtful by water. 
The long piers are fuppofed to have altered the pofition of 
the banks on which the falmon were caught, and they 
feem to have deferted that part of the coaft. There is a 
.popular tradition, that the Tay anciently ran along the 
foot of the hills, by the N. of this parilh •, but if ever that 
was the cafe, it muft have been at a much earlier period 
than is reported. The change from that courfe to the 
-prefent, is fuppofed to have taken place in the 12th cen- 
tury; but there are charters on record of that date, con. 
firming to the Hays of Errol, and other proprietors" ir the

neighbourhood, or mentioning their difponing to religious 
houfes, their right of riming on the Tay, to which it can- 
not well be conceived how they had any title, unlefs the 
river always held the channel which it now occupies. That 
fome branch of the Tay may have had its direction by the 
N. of the carfe, or rather that there may have been much 
water in the hollow ground, before the country was drained, 
is extremely probable ; but there is little reafon to ima- 
gine that the bed of the river has ever undergone any 
alteration. 

Difadvantages. — The parifli has always had a bad name 
for roads. In a wet country, and deep foil, the track either 
of man or beaft, when much ufed, and never repaired, 
foon becomes unpleafant, if not impaffable. The keeping 
the public ways in a tolerable condition, mjid have been 
attended with uncommon difficulty and expenfe, from the 
neceflity there was of bringing the materials from a di- 
ftance ; but the talk which was fo arduous, being almoft 
entirely neglected, the roads were in a ftate of difrepair, 
which cannot eafily be conceived. There is a profpeft 
that this grievance will now befpeedily removed. In con- 
fequence of an aft of Parliament, lately obtained, a great 
pod-road is carrying on from Perth to Dundee, which runs 
through this parifli, and another turnpike is making from 
that to the fhore of Errol, which will facilitate the com- 
munication both by land and water. When this import- 
ant work is accomplifhed, it is hoped that the ftatute-la- 
bour, which will not be neceffary elfe where, will be ap- 
plied to the crofs-roads. that they alfo may be put in a 
tolerable ftate. The landlords will certainly find, that the 
money expended in this way will be a valuable improve- 
ment to their effaces.— -Next to bad roads, the chief incon- 
venience 



of Errol. 



493 



venience of which the people can complain, is the want of 
good water. There are few fprings in the low grounds, 
and the fmall ftreams which ifllie from the hills «re pol- 
luted before they reach the inhabitants of the carfe. The 
country people ufe the water of the pows, which, in time 
of drought, is of a ftagnating nature, and in rain, is 
deeply tinctured by the clay. The inhabitants of the vil- 
lage dig pit -wells, which, when left open, afford the molt 
naufeous water ; and even when inclofed, and built up 
with a pump, their produce is not of the moft pleafunt or 
falutary quality. But this is a difadvantage which it would 
be very difficult to remove, and which the people mult 
.endeavour to fupport as part of their natural destination.

            PARISH or <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5468100">FORDOUN</name>, 
(COUNTY OF KINCARDINE.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Leslie.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Surface, &amp;c. 

THE ancient name of this parifli was Paddy Parifli, 
from having been, it is faid, for fome time the re- 
fidence, and afterwards the burial-place of St Palladius. 
Fordoun is faid by fome to fignify, in Gaelic, ' the brow or 
« declivity of a hill.' The parifli is fituated in the pre- 
{bytery of Fordoun, and in the Synod of Angus and Mearns. 
It is of an oblong form, broadeft in the middle. Its greateft 
length from E. to W. is about 10 Englifli miles ; its greateft 
breadth from S. to N. about 7. It is bounded on the 
N. by the parifli of Strathaen ; on the E. by Glenbervie 
and Arbuthnot; on the S. by Garvock, Laurencekirk, 
and Marykirk ; and on the W. by Fettercairn. The S. 
fide of the parifli is very flat and plain, making a part of 
what is called the Ho%v of the Mearns, and of that ftill 
larger valley, called Strathmore, which is reckoned to 
reach from Stonehaven to Dumbarton. In this part of the 
parifli, the foil is deep, clayey, and in general fertile. The 

north 



of Fordoun. 



49$ 



north fide of the parifli is hilly and mountainous, the foil 
light and ftiallow, and not fo fertile as the other. In the 
plain, the air is moift ; towards the hills, dry. The moft 
prevailing difeafes are agues and" fevers ; but, as within 
thefe few years much of the ftagnated water has been 
drawn ofF, and the lands drained, thefe difeafes are not fo 
frequent as formerly. There are feveral mineral fprings, 
but none of any confiderable reputation. They are fome- 
times drank by thofe in the neighbourhood, who are af- 
flicted by ftomach or gravelifh complaints. The moft re- 
markable mountains are the Grampian Hills, which bound 
the parifli to the N. and run through the ifland, from A- 
berdeen to Dumbarton. They are covered with heath 
and rock. There are fome quarries of freeftone, ufed for 
building. 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr Webfter's return the 
numbers were 1890. In the year 1771 there were about 2400 
people in the parifli •, now (1790,) there are only 2258 •, of 
thefe are about 11 58 males, and 1 100 females. The annual 
average of births is from 70 to 80 ; of deaths from 60 to 
70 ; of marriages from 1 6 to 20. There are 267 below 7 
years of age, and 199 1 above that age. There have been 
fbme few inftances of perfons who have reached the age of 
90, and 1 or 2 who have exceeded 100. Of the Eftablifhed 
Church are 2001 \ Epifcopals, 106; Seceders, 151. The 
caufe of depopulation feems to be the union of farms. The 
number of inhabited houfes is about 470 ; 5 perfons at an 
average to each. There are feveral villages in the parifli. 
That of Auchinblay contains about 100 perfons, and there 
is a weekly fair in it chiefly for cattle, from Michaelmas ta 
Chriftmas. The village of Kincardine, in the weft end of 
the parifli* contains about 70 perfons. From this village the 

county 



49^ Statijlical Account 



county takes its name, and it was the county town till the 
reign of James VI. of Scotland, who removed the Courts 
from Kincardine to Stonehaven, which has continued to be 
the county town ever fince. 

Produce, lie. — The number of acres in the parifh is 
computed to be 21,885 Scots, or 27,747 Englifh. 
Not above the half of thefe are arable, the reft are moors 
and hills ; a few acres are planted with wood, chiefly fir, and 
fome afh and birch. About a third of the arable ground 
may be in turnip, potatoes, rye-grafs and clover, flax and 
fome wheat ; the other two thirds in oats, bear, barley and 
peas. The parifh not only fupplies itfelf with provifions, 
but exports a confiderable quantity of corn and meal, and 
fells a confiderable number of cattle, Iheep, and fome hor- 
fes. Oats and peas are commonly fown in March, and 
reaped in October. Bear and barlej in the beginning of 
May, and reaped in September. Turnip is fown in the end 
of June, and ufed for feeding cattle through the winter. 
Property in land fells at 25 or 30 years purchafe. Some of 
the heritors in this parifh have of late given leafes of 57 
years to their tenants, encouragement to inclofe their 
grounds, and to build commodious houfes for themfelves and 
their families. Were the fame plan univerfally adopted 
by landlords, it would tend very much to the comfort of the 
farmer, and to the improvement of the country. The 
yearly rent of the beft arable grounds is from 15 s. to 20 s. 
Sterling the acre. Inferior grounds from 3 s. to 10 s. Sterling. 
A fpirit of improvement, and confequently of inclofing, is 
fpreading among the tenants, owing to examples fet be- 
• fore them, and the encouragement given them by the re~ 
fpectable gentlemen in the neighbourhood. The fences, on 
account of the fcarcity of ftones, are made of earth, with

parilh was involved in the fame calamity with the reft of the 
country, and felt the fame fcarcity. Meal fold at 20 s. Sterling 
the boll. 57 bolls of meal were given by government for 
the fupply of the moft neceftitous; 200 bolls were purchafed 
with the poor's money, and feveral private benefactions 
were received ; which were diftributed among houfeholders 
and others, who were in want. — The valued rent of the pa- 
rim is L. 7125 Scots ; the real rent may be between L.3000 
and L. 4000 Sterling. 

Stipend, Poor, 6c. — The value of the living, including the 
glebe, is about L. 100 Sterling. The Crown is patron. 
The manfe was rebuilt in 1779; the church rebuilt in 
1788. The number of poor who receive alms is between 
30 and 30. The annual Sunday collections, at an average, 
amount to about L. 30 Sterling. Belides this, there is about 
L. 200 Sterling lent out, the intereft of which is annually 
applied to the fupply of the poor. 

Prices and Wages. —Beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, &amp;c. 
fell at about 3 d. or 4 d. the lb. ; about 30 years ago they 
fold at about 2d. A hen now fells at 7 d. and 8d. ; former- 
ly at4d. and 5 d. Eggs are now fold at 3 d. the dozen ; 
formerly at id. ; butter is fold at 7 d. and 8 d. the lb. ; for- 
merly at 4 d. and 5 d. Cheefe at 5 s. the ftone, formerly at 
3 s. or 4 s. The wages of a day-labourer are 10 d. and 1 s. ; 
of carpenters and mafons 1 s. 6 d. ; of tailors 6d. and their 
victuals. The common wages of fervants who are main- 
tained in the family are as follows : a ploughman gets 
L. 6 Sterling a-year, inferior men fervants from L. 2 to L. 5 
Sterling; female fervants from L. 2 toL. 4 Sterling-, boys 
who are employed as herds for cattle, horfes or fheep, from

L. I to L. 3 Sterling. Many of the common labourers who 
marry, and have houfes, are enabled to fupport and bring 
up large families by the wages they receive. 

Antiquities. — About 3 years ago, when inclofing a field 
near this place, was difcovered an earthen urn with allies in 
it, in the centre of 4 large Hones, with a flat ftone on the 
top. The urn, when expofed to the air, and touched, 
mouldered into duft. It was probably a Roman urn, as at 
about a mile's diftance from the place where it was difco- 
vered, there are ftill the veftiges of a Roman camp. The 
wall and ditch, which furrounded the camp itfelf, are fcarce- 
ly difcernible in many places, having been taken into the 
adjacent corn-fields ; but the wall and ditch which furround- 
ed the praetorium are very diftincl, which Ihew it to have 
been an oblong fquare. — In the weft end of this parilh at 
Kincardine, not far from Fettercairn, are the ruins of a ca- 
ftle, faid by tradition to have been once a Royal palace, be- 
longing to Kenneth III. where he fometimes refided. It is 
conjectured by fome, that he was making a progrefs from 
this caftle to Fordoun, to worlhip at the fhrine of St Palla- 
dius, when he was killed by Finella in the manner related 
by Buchanan. — Not far from Kincardine, and near to the 
Grampians, is a mount called Green Caftle, by fome 
thought to have been the refidence of Finella, by others 
fuppofed to have been only a place of fafety or retreat for 
the depredators, who frequently came down from the 
Highlands to carry off the cattle belonging to the inhabi- 
tants of the low country. This laft conjecture is the moft 
probable. That Finella had her refidence in this neighbour- 
hood is highly probable. The hill which runs between 
Fordoun and Kincardine has the name of Strathfinella, 

There 



of Fordoun. 



499 



There are many who fuppofe that the caftle at Kincardine 
was not Kenneth's but Finella's caftle. 

Eminent Men. — This parifh is remarkable for having 
been for fome time the refidence, and probably the burial- 
place of St Palladius, who was fent by Pope Celeftine into 
Scotland fome time in the 5th century, tooppofe the Pelagian 
herefy, and by whom it is thought bifhops were firft ap- 
pointed in Scotland, having before that time been governed 
by monks. That Palladius relided, and was probably buried 
here, appears from feveral circumftances. There is a houfe 
which ftill remains in the church-yard, called St Palladius's 
chapel, where, it is faid, the image of the faint was kept, 
and to which pilgrimages were performed from the raoft 
diftant parts of Scotland. There is a well at the corner of 
the minifter's garden, which goes by the name of Paldy 
well.- — This parifh is farther remarkable in having been, if 
not the birth-place, at leait, the temporary refidence, and 
probably the burial-place of John Fordoun, author of the 
Scotichronicon, one of the moft ancient and moft authentic 
hiflories which have been publifhed of Scotland. He 
is thought by fome to have been a man of property in this 
parifh •, by others, with greater probability, to have been a 
monk who refided here.— This parifh has alfo given birth 
to the prefent Lord Monboddo, a man well known in the 
literary world by his writings on ancient metaphyfics, and 
on the origin and progrefs of lan guage. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In the fouth fide of the pa- 
rifh, the fuel commonly ufed is coal, which is brought 
from Stonehaven or John's haven, the diflance 10 Englifh 
miles. Seventy-two ftone of Scotch coals are fold on the 
fhore, at 8 s. and 9 s. Sterling. A barrel, that is 12 ftone 
«f Englifh coals, is fold for 1 s. 6 d. and is. 8 d. In the 

north 



5oo 



Statijlical Account 



north fide of the parifh, the moll common fuel is peats and 
turfs, which are brought from the Grampian Hills. — The 
pod-roads and bridges are kept in repair by the ftatute-la- 
bour, which is commonly exacted in kind. The crofs roads 
are very much negle&amp;ed. The inhabitants in general are 
much averfe to turnpikes, thinking they would render their 
travelling from place to place, and the carrying their goods 
to market, much more expenfive than at prefent. — Some- 
what more than a year ago, a remarkable whirlwind hap- 
pened at one of the great fairs in this country, called Pal- 
dy fair, and which ftands in this parifh, by which fome of 
the tents in the market were unroofed. It was accompa- 
nied with thunder and lightning, and fucceeded by a hid- 
den fall of rain and hail, which fwelled the fmall river of 
Bervie, which is the largeft in the parifh, and runs near to 
the market-place, to fuch a height, that for feveral hours it 
was impoflible to pafs it even on horfeback. — The language 
fpoken is Englilh, with the provincial accent. Many 
names of places are of Gaelic extraction. — The people here 
are taller and ftronger made than the generality of thofe to 
the north or weft. Several of them exceed 6 feet. They 
are in general induftrious. — The principal manufacture is 
fpinning of flax, and weaving cloth, efpecially linen cloth. 
Being at fome diftance from the fea, the pariftiioners feem 
not to be fond of a feafaring life, and few of them choofe a 
military one. They are in general humane and generous, 
contented and happy. They drefs better, and live better 
in their own houfes now, than they did 20 or 30 years ago. 
At the fame time, the taverns and public-houfes are not fo 
much frequented now as then.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q648600">KINGLASSIE</name>, 
(county of fife.)

By the Rev. Mr James Rejd.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, ifc. 

T T is the opinion of fome, that the name is originally 
Gaelic, and expreflive of the fituation ; others trace it 
from a faint, whofe name was Glafs, and point out a well 
of fine water, called St Glafs's well. The parifh is fitu- 
ated in the preibytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. 
The extent from W. to E. is about 4 computed miles, and 
1 from N. to S. Its form is nearly a parallelogram, and 
it is bounded on the W. by part of Portmoak, Ballingry, 
and Auchterderran ; on the E. by part of Markinch and 
Dyfart ; on the N. by the river of Leven, and part of 
Portmoak and Leflie ; on the S. by part of Dyfart and 
Auchterderran. The diftricT: is partly flat on the banks of 
Lochty and Ore, two fmall rivulets ; at a fmall diftance 
from which, the ground has a regular afcent, and forms 2 
ridges. The foil is partly light loam, and partly ftrong 
clay, with rich meadows on the banks of the rivers. The 
ftreams would abound with excellent trout, were the peo- 
ple retrained from watering their flax in them. The Le- 
ven 



502 Statijlical Account 



ven produces trout of the fame quality with thofe in Loch- 
leven, with pike and fotne falmon. The air in the flat 
part of the parifti is damp, and often occafions rheuma- 
tifms. There are many ftone quarries and coal mines. 
Coal is the only fuel. The mine prefently worked is 
efteemed the beft burning coal in Fife. The coals are fold 
on the hill at 6 d. the load, each load weighing 22 ftone 
Dutch weight. There are 2 moors, both covered with 
ftones, heath, and furze; but being commonties, no attempt 
is made to divide or bring them into a better ftate, which 
might be done at fmall expence. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 998. Population has not varied much thefe 
20 years. The number of fouls was then about 1200, and 
does not at this day exceed it. Though the inhabitants of 
the village have increafed from 150 to 250, the other parts 
of the parifti have fuffered a proportionable decreafe, from 
a number of the fmall farms being thrown into one. Births 
are nearly 25 or 30 annually but as the half of the heads 
of families adhere to fome or other of the Sectaries, the 
births of their children cannot be well afcertained ; as few 
of them are inclined to have their names recorded in the 
parifti regifter, which fubjects them to a fmall expenGe. 
There are 34 farms in this parifti, befides cottagers and 
feuers. The trades are weavers, employed by the manu- 
facturers in the coaft towns, with mafons, &amp;c. 

Agriculture, ifc. — Plantations are in a very profperous 
ftate in many places. The extent of the parifti is about 6000 
acres nearly. The whole rent in money and victual is about 
L. 3000 yearly. There is fcarcely one-third of the land in 
tillage. Above two-thirds in pafturage. The parifti is fuffi- 
cient to fupply itfelf in provifions, and can fend to maket

about 200 black cattle, and 4c horfes annually, betides wheat, 
barley, and oat-meal to a confiderable amount. The breed 
of cattle is greatly improved in fize and quality. Oxen, 
after ploughing is over, fell at L. 20, and fome at L. 24 the 
yoke, for putting on grafs-fields. The breed of draught 
horfes is alfo much improved within thefe 20 years, owing 
to the particular attention of Major Aytoun of Inchdairnie, 
who fent down from England the beft ftallions and Flan- 
ders mares ever feen in this part of the country. Former- 
ly each farmer kept or bred ftieep ; but now there are 
none, except a few ewes and lambs for the ufe of families, 
owing to the general practice of inclofing with ditch and 
hedge and Galloway dikes, and laying down the inclofed 
fields with grafs-feeds. Nearly 1800 cattle, including 
horfes, are paftured here annually. There are fown with 
lintfeed from 80 to 100 acres ; with oats and barley about 
1200; with wheat above 120. Potatoes, turnip and fum- 
mer fallow, occupy 200. Oats and peas are fown in March, 
lintfeed in middle of April, barley from end of April to 
end of May. 

Stipend, Poor, itfc. — The living is 6 chalders victual, 3 
bear, and 3 meal, with L. 40 money. The Countefs of Ro- 
thes has the patronage. The church was repaired in 1773, 
and the manfe rebuilt in 1774. There are 23 heritors 
who pay flipend ; of this number 6 are feuers. The feuers 
only refide. — The ufual number of poor, including their 
children, are between 30 and 40. They are not allowed 
to beg, the parifh funds being fufficient for their fublift- 
ence, and amount in whole to near L. 40 yearly, in land, 
money and collections. 

Prices and Wages. — During fpring and fummer, good 
beef is fold at 5 d. the pound, veal, mutton and lamb, 

from

from to 5 d. and 6d. all Tron weight, within the 

bounds of the prefbytery of Kirkaldy. The lower clafs ufe 
no animal food, but live on meal, potatoes, milk and fmall 
beer, with kail. — A common labourer earns 1 s. a-dav. 
Servants wages are of late greatly increafed. A man fer- 
vant's wages for the plough and cart are from L. 5, 5 s. to 
L. 7, 7 s. yearly. Maid fervants from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is only one village 
in this parifh. — Toll-bars are lately ereclred. — Rent of land 
varies with the foil and crops. Some acres are let at 5 s. 
each, others at 15 s. and L. 1, 10 s. ; and when let for lint- 
feed or potatoes, at L. 3, L. 4, and L. 5. There is a hill 
called Goat-milk Hill, let 20 years ago at L. 25, for fome 
years paft it rents at L. 120 ; it is 24 acres. The rents of 
farms are from L. 20 to L. 200, and the higheft rent is for 
the molt part the cheapefl bargain. Twenty years ago, 
few farms in this parifh were inclofed ; now every farm is 
cither inclofed in whole, or in part, to which the people 
are now perfectly reconciled. — Civilization of manners has

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5182801">CRAWFORD</name>, 
(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Maconochie.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Climate, Soil, l£c. 

THIS parifh was anciently known by the name of 
Douglas-moor, and part of it by that of Friar-moor* 
The Douglas family have ftill lands in this place, and 
that they had once great property in it, appears from the 
fuperiorities of a great part of the parifh belonging to 
Lord Douglas, the reprefentative of that family. At 
what time the name Crawford or Crawford-moor began 
to prevail, I have not been able to learn. The parifh is 
in the prefbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glafgow and 
Air. Crawford, which forms the S. E. corner of Lanark- 
fliire, is bounded by 8 or 9 different parifhes •, but more 
particularly, it has Tweed's-muir to the E. ; Durifdeer to 
the S. ; Crawford- John ta the W. ; and Lamington to 
the N. The length from S. E. to N. W. in other words, 
from the fource of the Daire (the principal branch of the 
Clyde) to the place where the Clyde leaves the parifh, 
is 18 miles. The breadth from the boundary toward 
Wanlock-head to that on Tweed's-muir, is between 15 and 
Vol. IV. 3 S 16

1 6 miles. AH this extent of country, a few appendages 
excepted, is poffefled by 14 farmers or ftoremafters. The 
3 principal rivers in the fouth of Scotland, viz. the Clyde, 
the Tweed and the Annan, have their fources in the hills 
which divide us from Tweed's-muir. The hill called the 
Lauders is chiefly within this parifti, and is the higheft in 
the fouth of Scotland ; its elevation above the fea being 
3150 feet. As to the climate, the following fad may be 
ftated: In January 1785, a man perilhed here in the 
fnow •, his body, which was not found till the month of 
April following, was then fcarcely begun to putrefy. That 
winter was indeed remarkable for fnow and drift, and 
the fpring for froft. At v prefent, (middle of June 179/I), 
the froft, attended with mowers of hail, has been for fome 
nights fo ftrong as to freeze water to the thicknefs of a 
quarter of an inch at leaft. The confequences have been 
hurtful to potatoes, leaves of trees, kail, &amp;c. Our village 
is 30 miles diftant from Dumfries, 40 from Glafgow,. 
and rather more from Edinburgh. There is a vifible 
defcent on every fide, except perhaps toward Crawford- 
John and Moor-kirk. 

Agriculture, itfc. — The greateft part of the parifh con- 
fills of hills or moors. Thefe are abundantly fit for pa- 
fture. Many of them are quite green. Others, which are 
partly covered with heath, have a great deal of the gra&amp; 
called bent, which becomes very luxuriant in the months 
of July and Auguft. In fome high places, there is very 
good mofs, out of which peats are dug, which conftitute 
the principal fuel. In many diftridte where peats cannot 
be dug, the earth is blackifh, and inclined to mofs. The 
valleys confift generally of a fpongy light foil, and fome- 
times of clay, and are all covered during the fummer with 
a very fine verdure. The wet and fwampy grounds pro- 
duce 



of Crawford. 



duce fpratts, which are often cut and made into hay. At 
the fame time, it muft be acknowledged, that the face of 
our country is naked, and how fit foever for pafture on the 
whole, there is walte ground in many places. Forefts or 
natural wood have been deftroyed long ago, of which, 
however, there are fome fmall remains. As to planta- 
tions either of trees or hedges, we have made but little 
progrefs. Stone fences are even in their infancy. There 
are a few trees, fome of which are feemingly of great age, 
about the caftle of Crawford. The late Mr Irvin planted 
fome ftrips round his houfe, which begin to decay alrea- 
dy. Sheep and trees thrive not together. The great ob- 
llacle to improvements in this way, and perhaps in all o- 
thers, arifes from a caufe, which, in all likelihood, will not 
be foon removed ; the principal heritors of the parifh live 
at a diftance from it. — One improvement has taken place 
lately, which may be confidered as preparative to many 
others. The public road from Douglas mill to Moffat, 
which goes through our parifh, has been completed with- 
in thefe 10 years. The Glafgow and Carlifle carriers go 
this road every week, and for 3 years part, one mail-coach 
comes down, and another goes up every day. — The pro- 
portion of arable ground to that of pafture, may be as 1 
to 200 : Some hold it to be no more than 1 to 300. 
There are feveral farms in the higher parts of the parifh, 
where grain has not been fown in the memory of man. 
The proportion of the arable to the ground actually 
ploughed every year, is about 1 to 20. Our fituation and 
climate have been adverfe to agriculture, even in our 
loweft grounds. The common oats were not ripe laft 
year (1790) when the froft came, which was about the 
9th of O&amp;ober. All our crops fince 1782, one only ex- 
cepted, have been hurt more or lefs by the froft. — Our 
foil being wet and fpongy, manure can feldom be pro- 
vided

vided during the winter, and in the fummer, our ftore- 
mafters are employed in a different way. This gives our 
fields an uncouth look, and even renders the crops later 
than they would otherwife be. This defe£t is in fome 
meafure fupplied by the natural fertility of our lands. 

When the feafons are good, no ground in Clydefdale pro- 
duces more plentifully ; but even in the beft years, the 
grain is fmall. Oats and barley are the common, or only 
crops. Peas are fometimes tried, but feldom with fuccefs. 
Potatoes and flax are cultivated for private ufe. Few or 
none take the trouble to -lay down fields with grafs-feeds, 
or to fow turnip. — Heretofore, a great number of cows 
were keeped on each farm ; but ftieep is now the grand 
objeft of attention. The beft of them, that is, thofe come 
to the age of 3 or 4 years, fell from 12 s. to 15 s. the 
head. The ftieep reared here, are thofe with black faces 
and black feet ; confequently the wool is coarfe, and has a 
mixture of black. The ftoremafters, however, look upon 
the black faced ftieep as molt profitable on the whole. 
They are ftrong, which fits them for enduring the colds of 
winter, and they grow to a great file. The wool fold 
here about 9 years ago from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. the ftone. 
None of it is now fold for lefs than 3 s. Part of it goes 
to England by land-carriage, and part of it is Ihipped at 
Leith. It is not the cuftom to wafti the ftieep before they 
are ftiorn. The farmers are apprehenfive left the putting 
of them into the water ftiould prevent their fattening. 
A little more attention, however, begins to be ftiewn to 
the wool, in confequence of the rife of the price. I ftiould 
take the average price of a ftieep's grafs to be at prefent 
2 s. or nearly fo. — There is not a more aftive or intelli- 
gent fet in this country than our ftoremafters. — The pre- 
fent rent of the parifti is L. 3400. The farmers fay, that 
the rents are too high, and that if there happen any fall 



of Crawford.

in the price of flieep, they cannot ftand it. None of our 
heritors take entry money or graiTum, except one. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 2009. The population of Crawford amounts 
at prefent to about 520 perfons, exclufive of Leadhills, 
where the numbers amount at prefent to 970 ; in all, 
1490. The baptifms of children belonging to parents of 
the Eftabliflied Church are commonly from 12 to 14 an- 
nually. The bulk of the people belong to the Eftabliflied 
Church ; about 6 Seceders, and 20 Cameronians. The 
population has been greatly reduced. About 40 years a- 
go, the numbers, I am told, were at leaft double of what 
they are at prefent j and, by all accounts, the farmers were 
then more than double their prefent number. As the 
engrofling of farms went on, the inhabitants thinned. 

Wages, i$c. — The old people fay, that one fervant does 
as much work now as two in former times. This is in 
fome degree requifite, as the wages are alfo about doubled. 
A maid fervant, fit for out- door work, that is, for hoeing 
potatoes, working at hay, milking ewes and reaping corn, 
receives 40 s. in the fummer half-year, whereas, 30 years 
ago, flie would fcarcely have got L. 1. A ploughman re- 
ceives from L. 6 to L. 8 yearly ; befides thefe who live 
in the matter's houfe, and have victuals there, there are 
herds who commonly live in a feparate houfe. They 
are allowed grafs for a certain number of flieep and cows, 
and a certain quantity of meal for board, which in all a- 
mounts from L. 10 to L. 12 a-year. Every fliepherd is 
attended by his dog ; he ftands in the valley, and fends 
the dog up the hill to the Iheep. When the animal hath 
executed in part the commiffion with which he was fent 
out, he turns, looks at his mafter, and waits for further 

orders.

orders. When, by certain words, or rather vocal founds 
he hath learned anew the will of his mafter, he fets off 
again, and moves the fheep in whatever direction he is 
commanded. But in a fevere winter, the bufinefe is more 
ferious. When it drifts, the fhepherds are obliged to 
(land upon the hills all night with the fheep, left they 
fhould be fuffocated in the fnow, which fometimes hap- 
pens. How fevere, however, the weather may be, the 
fheep are feldom fed upon hay. 

Stipend, Sc/jooI, Poor. — The fiipend is L. icoo Scots. 
The King is patron ; but fome fay, that the right is vefted 
in the family of Douglas. The church, manfe, and fchool- 
houfe are old buildings, and not in good repair. — The 
fchoolmafter's falary is L. 100 Scots. The children at 
fchool, confidering our population, and the diftance of fome 
parts of the parifh from the fchool, are numerous, being 
feldom under 30. The quarterly fees are from is. to 2s. 
6d. — Of poor we have not a great number. There have 
not been, at any one time during my incumbency, above 
15 or 16 on the roll. At prefent there is only 10. To 
thefe. the feffion makes a diftribution quarterly. The tunds 
arife from collections in the church, and the intereft of a 
fmall mm of money. We diftribute at prefent, to the a- 
mount of L. 2, 10s. on quarter-day, befide fupplying the 
exigencies that occur during the quarter, which may make 
about 10 s. more. At an average, however, our diftribu- 
tions do not exceed 40 s. while our numbers are fo few. 
What has been now faid of our poor, is to be underftood 
exclufively of Leadhills. The poor of Leadhills, about 17 
in number, are fupported by the Earl of Hopetoun, and the 
collections that are made in the chapel there. 

Lead 



of Crawford. 



Lead Mines. — Leadhills contain the moll famous and an- 
cient lead mines in Scotland. There are two companies 
there, the affairs of which are conducted with great judg- 
ment and ceconomy. The moft confiderable is that known 
by the name of the Scotch Mining Company, of which Mr 
Stirling is overfeer. The firft object that {hikes the eye, 
in this mountainous region, is the fpot of ground round 
this gentleman's houfe. The houfe itfelf is on the fame 
level with the top of Tintock, which is looked upon as a 
very high hill in the part of the country where it is fitua- 
ted. The fpot I mention, cannot amount to more than 3 
acres. It contains, befide an houfe-flead, offices, and 
counting-room, a bowling-green, a garden, and a park 
which feeds two cows, with ftrips of planting, which beau- 
tifully interline and furround the whole. The park is not 
above an acre, yet, as I faid, it feeds two cows. The 
ground within half a gun-ftiot of it, without the inclofure, 
would be highly rented at 1 s. the acre. This ffiews what 
culture will effedl even in a wildernefs. There are nearly 
200 men employed by the Scotch Mining Company. 
Thefe are fubdivided into pickmen, fmelters, walhers, and 
labourers, befides carpenters and fmiths. The payment of 
the pickmen depends upon the quantity of lead found. 
Five or fix of them join, and take what they call a bargain, 
and according as it proves more or lefs productive of lead, 
their wages are more or lefs. But at an average, I am told 
every man receives from L. 18 to L. 20 a-year. A fmelter 
receives fully as much. Moft of the walhers are very 
young, their wages therefore are lefs. The labourers who 
clear away rubbiffi from behind the pickmen, make each 
from L. 12 to L. 14 a-year. Meal and barley are purcha- 
fed by both overfeers, and referved in ftores, out of which 
all the hands employed by the refpedlive Companies, re- 
ceive every week a certain quantity for their families, 

which

which makes part of their pay. They work in the mines 
only 6 hours in the 24. Having therefore a great deal of 
fpare time, they employ themfelves in reading, and for this 
purpofe have been at the expence of fitting up a library, 
out of which every one who contributes to the expence re- 
ceives books. There is a very good fchool in the place. 
1 mall only farther obferve, that the lead has for feveral 
years pad been found very plentifully ; and that it fetches 
a much higher price at market than it did 10 years ago. 
The Earl of Hopetoun receives the fixth bar for rent. His 
bailie, who fees all the lead weighed, and that for the rent 
fent apart, has favoured me with a note of the number of 
bars fmelted at Leadhills, that is, by the two Companies, 
in 1786 and in 1790, and the crops, if I may be allowed 
to call them fo, in thefe feveral years, were to one another 
nearly in the proportion of 10 to 18 ; that of 1790 amounting 
to within a very few bars of 18,000; whereas that of 1786 
amounted only to 10,080. But the product of 1786 is 
looked upon as a very bad crop. The price of lead rofe 
confiderably after the conclufion of the American war. At 
one time it was about a third more. I am told, that at pre- 
fent it has rather fallen a little ; and that the chief vents 
for it are Holland and Ruffia. 

Village of Crawford. — This town, for fuch is the name it 
goes by, confifts of above 20 freedoms, which, till within 
thefe 15 years, were in the form of run-rig. Thefe free- 
doms were not freeholds ; they were all holden of fuperi- 
ors, either ©f the Crawfords or Douglaffes. Befides the 
mailers of thefe freedoms, who were called Lairds, and their 
wives Ladies, there was a fubordinate rank, who feued 
ground for a houfe and a yard. Each freedom confifted of 
4 or 5 acres of croft land, parcelled out in all the different 
parts of the town, with a privilege of keeping a certain 

number 



of Crawford. 



513 



number of fheep, cows, and horfes, on the hill or common 
oafture. This little republic was governed by a birley 
court, in which every proprietor of a freedom had a vote. 
If the proprietor refided not in the place, his tenant voted 
for him. The great bulinefs of the court was to determine 
the proportion and number of fheep, cows, and horfes, 
which the refpedtive proprietors fhould keep on the common 
pafture. As there was but little fubordination in the court, 
it was remarkable for nothing fo much as the noife that at- 
tended its deliberations. From the court that was held 
weekly, the members adjourned to an ale-houfe. The bills 
at the ale-houfe were not cleared above once or twice in 
the year, namely, when fome fheep or a cow had been fold, 
and payment received. Thus the year went round. No 
time was bellowed, in what may be called cultivating and 
improving their property. The dung they put upon their 
fields, as they threw it -out of their byres; and, if they 
found any man more induftrious than themfelves, that was 
difpofed to purchafe it, they took not that trouble. Lime, 
which is at no great diftance, they never thought of driving. 
With the natural, I had almoft faid with the fpontaneous 
produce of the foil, were thefe men content. What a con- 
trail between thefe habits, and the activity and diligence 
of our prefent farmers ! Hence I conclude, that in order to 
excite induftry in a country, fomething more is necefTary 
than that every man have his houfe and his field. It is ne- 
cefTary, that Gothic manners, or the indolent habit of all 
barbarians, be banifhed, and a fpirit of ambition and inter- 
prife be introduced. There is ftill great want of induftry 
in our village ; yet the old people fpeak of the eafy life of 
former times, as making the moft flriking difference be- 
tween them and the prefent. Since the divifion of the 
town, cultivation is mended. There are now more ftone

fences on what was formerly called the town of Crawford, 
than there are in all the parifh befides. One of my neigh- 
bours has been at confiderable expenfe, not only in inclo- 
ling his freedom, and building a houfe, but in improving 
his ground, and planting trees. 

Mifcellafieous Obfervations. — With refpeft to the common 
people in this parifh, and indeed, in all the parifhes round 
me, I obferve a fobriety or regard to moral conduct, which, 
I hope, proceeds from religious principle. The herds and 
their wives, who live at too great a diftance from the pu- 
blic fchool to fend their children thither, are careful to 
teach them not only to read the Bible, but to get pfalms by 
heart, &amp;c. There may be inftances of petty thefts, but 
great or daring ones are. very rare. The greateft nuifances 
to which we are expofed, are ftrolling beggars, who go a- 
bout the country, more efpecially at the time of (hearing 
the fheep, and men in trowfers who pretend to be failors in 
diftrefs. — The prevailing diftempers or ailments in this 
place, are the rbeumatifm and the fcurvy. The humidity 
of our air is fufficient to account for the former, aud I af- 
cribe the latter to the manner of living. Salt mutton and 
beef conftitute a principle article of food. The people in 
general are extremely fond of them, and at the fame time 
are averfe to vegetables. In the mid-land parts of the 
county of Banff, where I was born, flefh made feldom a 
part of the ordinary diet of the common people ; when it 
was ufed, it was eaten indeed without vegetables, but it was 
always eaten in a manner frefli. Both rheumatifms and 
fcurvy were much lefs frequently fubjects of complaint 
there than here.— -The ancient ftate of this parifh furnifhea 
perhaps as much fubjed for fpeculation as the prefent. We 
have 2 Roman roads, and no lefs than the fites of 3 camps,

faid to be Roman, but even the veftiges are greatly defaced. 
There are, however, evident marks of what was the ftate 
of the country in general about 200 years ago. Tower 
Lindlay, which is adjacent to the village on the other fide 
of the Clyde, was, no doubt, a fortified place. The prefent 
caftle fcarcely deferves the name; but the ancient tower 
was famous even in the days of Wallace. There is a tra- 
dition, that it was ftormed by that hero, and 50 En glim- 
men killed in it. It now lies in the form of a large heap 
of earth, all over green. The houfes on the farms in the 
moor were formerly ftone-vaults, fome of which remain. 
Thefe are flill pointed to as the ftrong holds where the in- 
habitants preferved themfelves and their property, at the 
time when the Douglaffes of Clydefdale, and the Jardines 
and Johnftones of Annandale, were carrying on their hofti- 
lities and depredations. — There are hills in the parilh, call- 
ed watches, where perfons fat in order to give notice on 
the firft approach of an enemy. Thefe notices were com- 
municated almoft inftantaneoufly, from the head of the pa- 
rilh to the lower end, by fmoke in the day, and flame in 
the night. — Queen Elizabeth, who had the direction of af- 
fairs in this country during the captivity of the unfortunate 
Mary, fent down a German to gather gold dull in the wa- 
ters of Elvan and Glengonar, both which have their fources 
in the hills where the lead is found. This man wrote an 
•account of his difcoveries and labours, the manufcript of 
which is in the Advocate's library. The place where he 
warned the gold, took its name from the event, and is call- 
ed the Gold Scour. There are verfes ftill repeated in the 
parilh, importing that he made a great fortune. Be that 
as it will, the bufinefs was refumed by order of the late 
Earl of Hopetoun, and, in a little time, difcontinued again, 
as being lefs profitable than common labour. Gold dull

is ftill found on the tops of the rocks, but the fearching for 
it is rather matter of amufement, than cf ferious occupa- 
tion. The particles, I am told, feldom exceed in fize the 
point of a fmall pin. </p>

Irkpatrick has been evidently named after St Pa- 



trick, and is more properly fpelled Kil Patrick. It is 
fituated in the Synod of Dumfries, in the prefbytery of 
Lochmaben. Its form is triangular, about 8 miles on each 
fide. It lies on the S. W. fide of the Annan, oppofite to 
the parifli of Moffat, by which it is bounded on the E. and 
N. On the S. E. it is bounded by Wamphrey, on the S. 
by Johnfton ; on the S. W. by Kirkmichael and ClofeburnJ; 
on the N. W. by Crawford. The general appearance is 
rather bleak, interfperfed with mols and moor, and almoft 
without inclofures. For a mile S. W. of the Annan, it is 
flat and pretty populous. To the weftward it is heathy 
and hilly. At the weftern extremity Hands the mountain 
of Queenfberry, whofe top is about 3000 feet above the

moid, from frequent rains from S. and S. W. but healthy, 
and free from agues. In 1789, there were 204 days wet or 
fhowery. 

Population. — By Dr Webfter's report, the numbers were 
794. The population of the parifh is rather decreafed 
within the lafl 50 years. The number of farmers is one 
half diminiflied. 'Tis Lord Hopetoun's defign to increafe 
them. The prefent population is 617 ; 298 males ; 319 
females. Average of births 16 ; deaths 14 ; marriages 7 ; 
under 10, 156 ; between 10 and 20, 148 ; 20 and 30, 65 ; 
30 and 40, 74 ; 40 and 50, 75 ; 50 and 60, 50 ; 60 and

each family, including thofe of widowers and widows $f m 
Inhabited houfes 132 ; number of perfons to each, (exclu- 
sive of 9 folitary female cottagers,) fully 5. 

Productions, Agriculture, 1£c— Natural productions are 
oak, alh, birch, alder, hazel, &amp;c. Much oak of a large 
growth is dug up in the mofles. There are feveral late 
plantations of fir. Broom and furze abound. We have 
alfo alder, juniper, bird-cherry, crab, mountain am. Wild 
ftrawb . r es, cranberries, nut-berries and others, peculiar 
to moors and mountains. That fpecies of grafs which 
grows on marfby ground, commonly called fpratt, is much 
ufed for fodder. 'Tis fomewhat remarkable, that the land 
where it grows, though not fubjeft to be overflowed with 
water, bears annual cropping, without being manured or paf-

tured except in the latter end of the year. Mofs accumulates 
very quickly upon ftones when expofed to the weather, and 
likewife upon trees. T' -ere are in tillage 4 8 acres ; for po- 
tatoes 35 acres ; barley and big 20 ; almoft all the reft for 
oats. There are of black cattle 625 ; flieep 448 fcores ; horfes 
95. The black cattle in this country are fmall, and moftly 
without horns ; for the, want of which, they are commonly 
preferred. The flieep are all of the fliort kind, large, but 
coarfe woolled. They are tarred very thick, about a Scots 
pint of tar being allowed to 5 flieep. The Englifli flieep 
are coming into repute in the neighbourhood. Lord Hope- 
toun keeps a few Spanifli, which thrive pretty well. In 
general, the parifli mult be prefumed to export provifions. 
But a very few acres are fown with rye-grafs and clover. 
The whole of the parifli, except about 600 acres, is in pafture. 
They fow from the beginning of March to the middle of A- 
pril, and begin to reap in the firft week of September. The 
land-rent of the parifb is about L. 1827. There are about 40 
ploughs, almoft all of the Scotch kind, and as many carts. Al- 
moft every farm in the parifli having a conliderable variety 
of foil, it can only be computed that the arable land, if let 
feparately, would rent from 6 s. to 14 s. ; good bog meadow, 
as it requires little trouble or expence, might yield 12 s. or 
14 s. There is no land capable of tillage, let exclufively 
for pafture. The higheft rent in the parifli is that of a 
flieep farm, viz. L.220. Other flieep farms are rented at 
L. 100, and upwards. Thefe have all more or lefs of arable 
land, from 8 to 30 acres. The average rent of thofe farms, 
©n which there are no flieep, is L.25. The number of 
thefe is increaling. — In 1782 and 1783, much corn was ex- 
ported from this county both by land and fea. The oat- 
meal fold then at ?s. 6d. *he ftone. The poor certainly

depend more on potatoes in this county, than in any other 
in the South of Scotland. 

Stipend, School, Poor, ifc. — The ftipend is L. 72, 4 s. 
including L. 5 for communion-elements. The glebe is 
worth about L.4, 10 s. a-year. The Earl of Hopetoun is 
patron, as curator for the Marquis of Annandale. The 
church feems to have been built in 1676, thatched with 
heath till 1736, then raifed in the walls and dated. The 
manfe was built in 1788. The number of heritors is 9. 
None refide but one inconfiderable proprietor. — There was 
no legal fchool in this parifli till about 20 years ago. The 
falary is only L. 11, and the wages a-quarter, for reading, 
are no more than 1 s. The number of fcholars in fummer is 
very fmall, in winter 40 or 50. Had not the prefent 
teacher been difabled for working as a common mafon, he 
muft have fpurned at fuch a livelihood as this. — -About xz 
poor regularly receive alms ; about L. 7 is collected at the 
church doors. 

Prices, Wages, Zfc—The price of oats within the laft 
40 years has increafed about one third. Beef and mutton 
fell at prefent about 4d. the pound, which is more than one 
third above their price 40 years ago. A man's wages for 
labour in huibandry, are in fummer about 8d. and 10 d. with 
victuals; a carpenter's iod. ; a mafon's is.; a tailor's 8d. ; 
all with vi&amp;uals. The common fuel is peat, dug on almoft 
every farm: when fold at Moffat the average price of a 
fmall cart-load is 2S. As the earnings of common la- 
bourers are fmall, their fubfiftence and accommodation muft 
be fcanty and mean. Small as their expenditure is, I find 
it very difficult to balance it with their earnings. From all 
the information I can obtain, I apprehend the following 

calculation

calculation to be pretty near the truth. The labourer has 
a wife and 4 children, the eldeft 13 years, the youngeft 5.

Antiquities. — There is a Roman road yet to be traced 
running through the parilh from S. to N. It comes up 
the E. bank of Annan, from the ruins of a large camp at 
Burnfwork, in the parifh of Middlebie, and paffes here a 
place called "Tatius-holm, where there are fome remains of 
a fquare encampment of fmall extent. Upon digging, I 
could only find fome earthen ware in fragments, very ftrong 
and coarfe. I have procured from the people who have 
tilled the adjoining fields, a few bits of green and party- 
coloured glafs, and fmall pieces of a fubftance refembling 
marble,, about half an inch broad, round, fmooth, and flat 
on one fide. Some have been found which were perforated 
in the middle. — Near the Roman road where it enters the 
parifli of Moffat, there was found in a mofs about three 
years ago, a piece of gold of a femicircular form, evident- 
ly a fragment, in length 3 or 4 inches. On the outer edge 
it was ornamented with a border, in which were the fol- 
lowing letters formed by cutting through the interitices, 
IOV. AVG. VOT. XX.— There are a great number of 
caims or lurians alfo many circular inclofures on hills and 
eminences, formed by a great quantity of ftones, which 
have now no appearance of having been built. They mea- 
lure in diameter from 100 to 200 feet. They are com- 
monly luppofed to have been ufed for feeuring the cattle 
from enemies and thieves, in a country much infefted with 
both. There are feveral ruins, called by the common 
people towers, which have been furrounded by ditches and 
walls. By 'far the moft remarkable of thefe is the park of 
Achancafs. The walls, which are about 150 feet fquare, 



of Kirkpatrick-Juxta. 523 



and fome parts of which are ftill (landing to the height of 
20 feet, are no lefs than 1 5 feet in thicknefs. The fort 
had been fupplied with water by a leaden pipe, part of* 
which was lately dug up. The place is ftrong by nature, 
from the precipices and morafles by which it is furround- 
ed. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiofis. — The people in general are 
quiet, fober and contented. No murder, filicide nor rob- 
bery, is known to have happened in the parifli. — Almofl: 
every family fpins coarfe cloth for its own ufe ; but unfor- 
tunately there is no conliderable woollen manufacture in all 
Annandale. Great part of the wool is exported to Eng- 
land. — The condition of the people might, in my humble 
opinion, be much ameliorated, if the proprietors of land 
would grant them longer leafes and better houfes, and ei- 
ther inclofe their grounds, where arable, or encourage their 
tenants to do it. By fuch means, many acres not worth 
more at prefent than 1 s. a-year, might be improved fo as 
to yield in a few years 12 s. or 15 s. So eager are the te- 
nants here for tacks, that for a 19 year tack of a very 
fmall farm, moderately rented, 6 or 8 times the amount of 
the rent is fometimes paid as entries. There are particu- 
lar reafons for the Marquis of Annandale's lands not being 
let in long leafes ; but the people have fuch a well found- 
ed confidence in the honour and generofity of the Earl of 
Hopetoun, that they do not feem to fufFer much from the 
want of them. — Fifty years ago, filk. and cotton were very 
rarely to be feen ; now a fervant maid cannot be in drefs 
without both. There were then no watches but the mi- 
nifter's ; now there is fcarcely a man fervant who is without 
one. Clocks, moftly of wood, are alfo very common. Se- 
venty years ago, there was not a pane of glafs, except in 

two 



5*4 



Statijlical Account 



two houfes ; now every houfe has at leaft one glafs window. 
In other refpe&amp;s, however, the honfes of the common people 
have improved little or nothing. Seventy years ago, the 
hire of a man fervant was about L. I, 4 s. of a woman 
fcarcely 10 s. a-year. — The common people were certainly 
more ignorant 50 years ago than at prefent. Several at 
that time had not learned either to write or read •, now they 
can all read pretty well, and all the men at leaft can write. 
Several of the farmers read hiftory, magazines and news- 
papers. The vulgar read almoft nothing but books on re- 
ligious fubje&amp;s. Many of them are too fond of controver- 
fial divinity ; a tafte which the Diffenters are very diligent 
in promoting, and which the few books they are acquainted 
with, are rather calculated to confirm. To difeourage this 
unhappy propenfity, fo common through a great part of 
Scotland, and to recommend books of a more rational and 
inftruclive nature, feems an objecl: worthy of a clergyman. 
. — Inoculation of the fmall-pox is far from being general in 
this country. The common people are ftrongly prejudiced 
againft it. To this circumftance a large proportion of the 
deaths which happen in this parifh is to be afcribed. — P.heu- 
matifm is univerfally allowed to be much more common 
now than it was 40 years ago. I have heard no Satisfac- 
tory reafons alBgned for its increafe. Thinner clothing, 
and the more general ufe of linen next the fkin, may per- 
haps account for it in part.</p>

NUMBER LXVIII. 

PARISH of <name ref="NA">KIRKPATRICK-IRONGRAY</name>, 
(COUNTY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Finnan.</head> 

<p>1 

Situation, Soil, Surface, Air, ifc. 

T, 7 " IRKPATRICK-Irongray, is one of the 10 parifhes in the 
Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, lying E. of the water 
of Urr, and within the prelbytery and Synod of Dumfries. 
It is bounded on the E. within 2 miles of Dumfries, by the 
parifh of Terregles, which is alfo its limit for a good way 
on the S. On the fame quarter likewife, it is divided from 
Lochrutton, by fome miles of a dead running body of 
water, called the Bogrie-lane. The parifhes of Urr, Kirk- 
patrick-Durhain, and Holy wood, terminate Irongray in 
inoor-lands to the W. and a ftream called Speddoch-burn, 
running N. into the river Cairn, alfo divides it from Holy- 
wood, as does the faid river for more than 1 miles down. 
The parifh is computed to be about 9 miles long, and 
though narrow in the E. next to Dumfries, it increafes in 
breadth almoft the whole way to the W. and may be about 
3 miles broad at the centre. The foil is generally dry, 
confifting of a kindly mould, not very deep, mixed with 

fmooth 



5 2 ^ Statiflical Account 



fmooth ftones, which are of fuch a fize as not to flop the 
plough. Of this fort of land there are above 500 acres, all 
arable, for 2 miles up from the eaftern extremity. The 
pariih then rifes into hills, except a track of low land in 
fome parts, on both fides the river Cluden. Thefe hills, 
as well as the fine track of land below, have been moftly 
marled, and though it is faid they were covered with heath 
of old, yet having been ploughed, they have now a green 
furface, and are good pafture ; but though the foil is intrin- 
fically good, the climate is cold, and the crops, though 
luxuriant, are expofed to fliaking winds, and late in coming 
to maturity. Paffing the fummits of thefe hills, the parifti 
flopes into a number of fine farms, little inferior in quality 
to thofe on the eaft fide, though the climate is not quite fo 
warm. After paffing a fort of valley, where there are a 
few houfes, the pariih rifes through a track of arable lands, 
of a cold bottom, into ftieep walks and moors, on the bor- 
ders of Kirkpatrick-Durham, &amp;c. This defcription com- 
prehends only that part of the pariih lying E. of the old 
water of Cluden, and S. of the burn of Cornlee : for to the 
N. and W.. of that winding ftream, there rifes a mountain 
called the Bilhop's Foreft, apparently the higheft, perhaps of 
any at the fame nearnefs to Dumfries, yet of no very fteep 
or difficult afcent in moft places, owing to a very extended 
and irregular bafe, around which are planted feveral large 
and diftinS: farms and properties. This hill is Ikirted along 
the river Cairn to the N. with woods, for 2 miles, which 
reach up the hill in many parts, for more than half a mile. 
Some of the farms extend to the fummit, and others only a 
part of the way. The hill has a heathy appearance at a 
diftance, with fome rocks and moorftones rifing to the view 
at the fame time, while the ftieep find fome green and 
wholefome pafture here and there interfperfed. — The in- 
habitants 



of Kirkpatrick-Ifongray. 527 



habitants in general are healthy ; nor has any thing like 
epidemical fevers taken place among them thefe 16 
years paft. Inoculation has taken place in part here. The 
minifter while in another charge, inoculated 5 children of 
his own, at two different times, with his own hand. Upon 
inoculating 3 at firft, the people feemed to be {hocked and. 
offended •, but when he came to have other two fit fubjecfs, 
he warned his neighbours of his intention to inoculate thefe 
alfo. The example was followed immediately then, by the 
inoculation of 30 children in the parifh, by the hands of a 
common blood-letter from another parifh, who had perform- 
ed at home. They all did well. 

Agriculture, is'c. — Farms here are from 30 to 400 acres, 
and the rent of the beft lands is between 15 s. and L. 1 j 
very little, as yet, amounting to L.x. The rents leffen 
as the parifh approaches to moorland* There are feveral 
excellent farmers in the parifh, who know well how to a- 
dapt the culture to the foil. No great quantity of wheat 
is fown, as the land in general is not fo ftrong as to promife 
luxuriant crops •, and turnips are moflly given up, though 
the foil is well fitted to produce them. Great quantities of 
potatoes are now planted in the country all round Dum- 
fries. The whole operations are performed by the plough. 
They afford, at leaft, one meal in the day, for |ths of the year, 
to the moft of families. Part are fent to market, and fome, 
even at this diftance, are fent to floops, and have fold from 
is. to 2s. the 100 weight. It is believed, (by the writer 
at leaft,) that were no more potatoes raifed than what 
were 40 years ago, there would be a fcarcity of provifion in 
moft years, from the increafe of population j fuch a raft 
proportion of food does an acre of land planted with potatoes 
produce, beyond what the fame could afford when fowu 

with 



528 Statijtical Account 

with any grain whatever. Two crops of oats are common- 
ly taken from the lands at firft, the third is potatoes or 
peas, and the fourth barley, fown down with rye-grafs and 
clover, and to enlarge the barley field, the farmers of late, 
have fallen upon a method of laying dung upon the oata 
ftubble, after harveft, and ploughing it down immediately \ 
which, by a crofs ploughing in the fpring, and the feed furrow 
at lail, affords even better crops than the potato land itfelf. 
This is counted an improvement, as barley is a principal 
fund for paying rents, which is always faleable in proportion 
to the prices that are going at Whitehaven and Liverpool, 
which have afforded here for feveral years paft, from 2 s. 
to 3 s. the Winchefter bufhel. A much greater quantity of 
oats is produced alfo in the parifh than is confirmed in it ; 
partly fold in the market of Dumfries, but chiefly made 
into meal, and fhipped for Greenock and other places. It 
is eafy to fee that the prices will be different in different 
feafons ; being from is. 6 d. to 2 s. the ftone, of 17^ lbs. 
according to the demand from other places. This article of 
oat-meal, the general food of the country, cannot be faid to 
have rifen in proportion to provifions of other kinds ; the prices 
of which are double what they were 40 years ago. — The 
number of horfes may be about 174, of black cattle 1416, 
and of fheep 3080. The cattle are of a middle fize, and 
like other Galloways, are known to be excellent feeders ; 
but as the beft of the land is all arable, the farmers com- 
monly fell their bullocks before they are old enough to feed 
into beef. Of the fheep, 120 may be of the Mug or Bake- 
well kind, and only thrive well upon the good land, the 
ewes generally producing two lambs each, which are fold to 
the butchers in July, for 8 s. or 9 s. a-piece. The wool of 
thefe fheep brings about 14s. or 15 s. the ftone, of 24 lb. 
while that of the moor fheep is coarfe, and fells at about 8 s. 

Ia 



of Kirkpatrick-Irongray. 529 

In the courfe of the minifter's incumbency, upon a fort of 
grofs recollection, there have been fold by different proprie- 
tors, about L. 1600 worth of woods ; confining of oak, afh, 
alder, birch, and hazle. The fmaller kind was manufac- 
tured into charcoal, and fent to the furnaces at Whitehaven; 
the larger kind was fent for fhip-timber to different ports, 
and a great part was bought by tradefmen, and others round 
the country.— There are 7 marl-pits in the parifh, fome of 
which are moftty exhaufted. It is faid, that this manure 
was difcovered and ufed in a farm here, about 50 or 60 
years ago, before it was ufed in any other part, at leaft in 
the fouth of Scotland. Luxuriant crops were raifed by it 
at firft, and the people continued to plough, till the ground 
was reduced to a caput mortuum. They now know well 
how to manage it, by taking fewer crops, and laying the 
laft down with dung and grafs-feeds, though it is found that 
the frequent repetition of marl, efpecially upon thin land, 
does little good, or rather is hurtful, by loofening the foil 
fo much, that the corn -plants are thrown out at a certain 
time. They who have no marl, bring lime to their lands 
from Clofeburn or Barjarg, 2 farms at the diftance of 8 or 
10 miles, or from the harbour below Dumfries, at the 
diftance of 7 or 8 miles. At leaft every farmer now, al- 
moft, brings fome lime, lefs or more, to his pofleffion. — The 
valued rent of the parifh is L. 44 15: 19:8 Scots money, 
and the real rent at prefent is about L.2770 Sterling. No 
fervices are paid by the tenants in general. 

Stipend, School, Poor, ifc. — Stipend and glebe are not 
worth above L. 80 a-year. The walls of the church have 
been built time out of mind, and are ftill firm and ftrong. 
Mr Fergufon of Craigdarroch and Mr Ofvvald of Auchin- 
cruive are vice-patrons. — The fchoolmafter's falary is about 

Vol. IV. 3 X L. 7. 



Statiftical Account 



L. 7. As there are no villages in the parifh, the fcholarg 
are not numerous, feldom 30, even in winter ; and the 
mafter is obliged to teach 2 years in a houfe near the church, 
and alternately other 2 years 3 miles up the parifh. The 
quarter wages are from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. People at a diftance 
from either fchool hire a lad for themfelves, who goes from 
one family to another, along with his fcholars, by turns. — The 
poor have been from 14 to 18. The annual collections may 
be about L. 14. There is L. 6, 10 s. arifing from inteTeft of 
lent money, and they have L. 2, 10 s. of land-rent. None 
beg, it is believed, nor need beg out of the parifh. To af- 
ford relief for the deficiency of crop 1782, a liberal contri- 
bution was made for the poor. In faft, there was no fear- 
city of provifion in the parifh, though dear, as the beft part 
ripens early, and though the corns were covered with fnow 
for fome days in fome of the higheft parts of the moor 
farms. Among the worft things in the police of the coun- 
try, is the permiffion of vagrants and fturdy beggars from all 
parts, especially from the large village called the Bridgend 
of Dumfries, which has no magiftrate. That village is a 
receptacle of people of that fort from the three kingdoms. 
Thefe, from pretence of fifhing or trafficking or begging, fpy 
out what is for their purpofe in the day-time, and in the 
night return, and at times commit confiderable depredations. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 895. Upon an enumeration in 1778, there 
were found 585 examinable perfons. All the alteration, in 
a general view of the parifh fince that time, may amount to 
610. There are 25 heritors, 7 or 8 of whom refide. Of 
DifFenters there are 9 Cameronians and 10 Seceders. 



Mifcellaneous 



of Kirkpatrick-Irojigray 531 

Mifceilaneous Obfervations. — No inhabitant of the parifh 
lias been imprifoned for crimes during the incumbency of 
the prefent minifter, which has continued more than 16 
years. The people, as to individuals, rather than numbers, 
are greatly changed in that period, on account of old tenants 
going out, and new ones coming in. They are fober 
and induftrious. There is not fo much as an ale-houfe now 
in the whole parilh. The licences are fo high, that no pu- 
blic-houfe in a country place can afford to pay them ; and 
the duty upon malt is alfofo high, and fo rigoroufly exacted, 
that the people grudge to pay it. This has retrenched the 
comforts of life to feveral families ; for a little ale was very 
neceffary for a while in winter, when the cows, moftly in 
calf, and fed upon ftraw, yield but little or no milk. One 
improvement, however, has been fallen upon lately in the 
means of living by handicraftfrnen, and fuch as rent no land # 
When the corns are got in, they buy a pig, which they 
ring, and get liberty from their landlords for it to run about. 
This they feed upon offals and potatoes, which they get 
planted fomewhere for work in harveft, and the animal be- 
comes a good morfel at the end of March, and affords a 
mouthful now and then through the fummer. The article 
-of fuel is very fcarce and expenfive, efpecially for feveral 
miles in the lower part of the parifh, where there are no 
peats. And coals are brought 24 miles from Sanquhar; or 
from fome harbour, perhaps a miles below Dumfries, at a 
dear rate, owing -to the high duty that is upon that article, 
when water-born. — A cuftom prevails all over the country, 
of carrying the dead for interment to a diftant church-yard, 
if the anceftors of the deceafed were buried there. In fact, 
there are more funerals here from other pariihes than from 
the parifh itfelf, and the people here follow the fame cuftom, 
if they have burying- places elfe where. — A farm on the eaft 

fide 



532 Statiftical Account 

fide of the hills firft mentioned, commanding a full view ot 
Dumfries, and even beyond it towards Annandale, is called 
Inglefton. — The tradition is, that it was fo called from 
the beacons or fires that were kindled there, or on the hill 
belonging to it, in times of hoftility with the Englifh or bor- 
derers, to give warning to other parts of the country, of the 
approach of an enemy. For the word Ingle (perhaps from 
the Latin Ignis) to this day, is very often ufed for a fire by 
the common people all over this country. — Game of moft 
kinds is as plenty here as in any of the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes. Even the beautiful black cock, as well as the 
groufe, is to be met with on the high grounds. Foxes 
bring forth in holes upon the bifhop's foreft formerly men- 
tioned. When they begin to kill fheep any where in the 
parifh, the huntfman, who is paid by the county, is fent for, 
and he feld'dm fails to unkennel a fox on that hill, or in the 
woods around it. At the fame time, it is obferved, that 
Reynard does lefs injury to the fheep in this neighbourhood, 
than he is known to do in many other parts of the Stewar- 
try ; owing perhaps to the variety of game he catches him- 
felf, and to the wild berries which he finds in the woods for 
his fupport. — Over a water which falls into the river Cairn, 
is an excellent fcone bridge of one arch. It is founded 
upon two perpendicular rocks, and forms a mofl romantic 
fcene. As it is lower than the ground leading to it on each 
end, you are furprifed by the fight of it almoft before you^ 
are aware. It is called the Routing bridge, evidently from 
the noife made by the water immediately above it. Stand? 
irig upon the bridge, and looking up the ftream, you fee ve- 
ry little of its courfe, till it begins, above the level of the 
fpedtator's eye, to tumble in broken water, among large un- 
equal rocks, for about 8 or 10 yards in a rapid defcent, and 
falls in a cataract of about 10 or 12 feet deep, fo near the

bridge, that the traveller feels fomething like dew or fpray, 
as he pates, when the water is fwelled and the wind in the 
fouth. Upon turning to the parapet on the nether fide and 
looking over, you have a fudden contraft, in feeing the wa- 
ter fmooth in a clear day, and the trouts fporting and feed- 
ing in a pool below, which is partly overhung by oaks on 
each fide, while the rocks and bridge are, in fome places, 
matted with woodbine. To this pifturefque fcene, people 
that have time to ride for health oramufement, frequently 
come from Dumfries or elfewhere, as the road is good, and 
the object not much above 5 miles diftant from that town,

THIS parifh is fituated in the prefbytery of St An- 
drew's, and Synod of Fife ; bounded on the W. by 
the parifh of Scoonie, on the N. by Ceres, on the E. by 
Newburn, and on the S. by Largo Bay. It is of an irre- 
gular figure, extending from S. W. to N. E. nearly 6 miles. 
Its breadth is very unequal. The area of the whole con- 
tains 5469 acres. To the traveller, the fouth part of this 
parifli mull afford a pi&amp;urefque and delightful fcene of ele- 
gant country-feats, fkirted with well laid out and thriving 
plantations, populous villages, furrounded with fertile fields, 
hill and dale, wood and water. The foil on the W. to- 
wards the fea, is light, bordered with link ground ; the 
northern parts in general are of a thin black mould, on a 
wet bottom ; in the fouthern, of a black loam, partly on a 
dry, and partly on a wet bottom, interfperfed with fields 
of light land. Rich breaking clay is peculiar to the S. E. 
part of the parifh, and there are fome tracks in different 
direftions, to the weftward of the hill, confifting of clays 

of

of a more obdurate nature, and on a wet bottom — From 
our vicinity to the German Ocean, we are frequently vi- 
fited with cold and damp winds from the E. accompanied 
fome times with much rain. During the fpring and fum- 
mer months, when the fun has had influence to rarify the 
air in the firft part of the day, we may look for a very 
cooling fea-breeze by three in the afternoon. But this is 
common upon all the coaft. We are indeed more ftieltered 
from its influence, than many of our neighbours, from our 
local fituation, and the plantations that furround. To the 
above circumftances, our prevailing difeafes may be attri- 
buted ; for, from the effect of cold and wet, coughs are 
very general, rheumatifm and other inflammatory com- 
plaints are not unfrequent. Epidemic diforders fometimes 
appear, of which the nervous fever prevails chiefly among 
thofe who are muchexpofed in the fpring and autumn, and 
who live at the fame time upon a low and fpare diet. Few 
children are now cut off by the fmall pox, as inoculation 
is generally introduced with remarkable fuccefs. During 
20 years practice, our furgeon has not loft one patient. 

Agriculture, tec. — In improvements, it may be juftly 
faid that this parifti has led the way to all the neighbour- 
hood. An open field is fcarcely to be met with. All is 
inclofed, either with ftone, or with ditch and hedge. Drain- 
ing has not been neglected. Not only the fpouts in the 
wet bottomed land have disappeared, but even the ufelefs 
marfti and the deceitful bog, by draining, paring, and 
burning, have been turned into fruitful fields. The imple- 
ments of hufbandry are much improved. A light well 
contrived plough is introduced. The brake and roller are 
in common ufe. The diminution of the expence of cul- 
ture is no fmall improvement. In place of 6 cattle and 2 
horfes, that feemed to be yoked for mow, 20 or 30 years

ago, and thefe driven by a ftout lad or 2 boys, 2 horfes 7 
reined by the ploughman, now perform the work to much 
better purpofe, and with greater fpeed. Hand and horfe 
hoeing are pra&amp;ifed. When the crop is gathered, it is 
preferved in the barn-yard from vermin, by being placed 
upon pillars of ftone, 2 feet high. Machines for threihing 
have been introduced, but do not come up to expectation ; 
from their very complex conftru&amp;ion, they are apt to go 
wrong ; the horfes have a dead draught, and are made 
giddy by the circular motion. Wherever they can be 
erected upon a fall of water, all the purpofes defired will 
be anfwered. — In the northern parts of the pariflh, there 
are confiderable plantations of fir. Places covered with 
thorns, briars, and furze, 30 years ago, are now filled with 
all kinds of foreft-trees, the annual thinning of which al- 
ready produces a confiderable fum. In 30 or 40 years, 
wood of different kinds will be a moil profitable produc- 
tion. — The value of land is in a high proportion increafed. 
What brought from i6s. to L. 1 the acre, 20 years ago, 
now lets at L. 2 and L. 2, 10 s. and feus at L. 4 Sterling. 

Except on the north Ikirts of the parilh, where bear, 

oats, flax, and a few wretched potatoes, are the chief pro- 
ductions, every perfon poflefling from 500, down to 1 acre 
of land, raifes wheat almoft as good as the beft in Lothian. 
Thofe only who poffefs farms can afford to fallow for 
ttyeir wheat ; but even thefe, as well as the fmalleft tenants, 
raife the greateft proportion of their wheat after clover, 
beans, and potatoes. Upon the beft foil, barley is con- 
ficlered a profitable crop, and oats the leaft advantageous, 
unlefs after pafture. Turnips and cabbage are raifed with 
fuccefs, for the catties winter- provifion. The carrot, the 
'Swedim turnip, and root of fcarcity, have not anfwered 
expectation. The Swedifli turnip, it is fuppofed, will be- 
come very ufeful, when, by experiment, the proper mode

of cultivating it (liall be afcertained, and generally under- 
ftood. — Cattle are reared in confiderable numbers ; much 
attention is paid to the breed. The confequence of which 
is well known, as our cattle have been diftinguifhed for 
beauty and fize even in the London market. Horfes are 
bred, both for draught and faddle. Sheep are fed, not pro- 
duced here. .Every family has fwine. — In our quarries 
are found hard and freeftone. Limeftone is wrought in 

o 

2 different places. There is an extenfive field of marl ; 
and coal may be wrought to advantage. On the eftate of 
Lundin, the coal has been cropped ; but by erecting an en- 
gine near to the fea, a deep feam, which ftretches over up- 
on the eftate of Largo, would be opened. This would am- 
ply fupply the neighbourhood, and afford befides a con- 
fiderable exportation. 

Sea-coaji, Fijheries, &amp; c . — The fouth boundary of this pa- 
ii(h is about 2^ miles of fea-coaft. Largo Bay extends from 
Kingcraig Point to that of the Methul, making a diameter 
of near 7 miles in length, and marked by a ridge of fand. 
The included bay forms a femicircle of about 10 miles 
fea-coaft. The above ridge is called by fifliermen the 
Dike. Of this there is a tradition, although probably not 
well founded, among the oldeft inhabitants of Largo, that 
there was formerly a wall or mound running from Kino-, 
craig Point to that of the Methul, containing within it a 
vaft foreft, called the Wood of Forth. — About 10 years 
ago, fiflx abounded on this coaft, particularly haddock, of a 
very delicate kind. But fince that period, fifh of every 
kind have become fcarce, infomuch that there is not a 
haddock in the bay. All that remain, are a few fmall 
cod, .podMes, and flounders. The filhermen have alfo dif- 
appeared, who, 20 years ago, conflicted the chief part of 
the inhabitants of Largo and Drumochy. At prefent there 

Vol. IV. 3 y ig

is not a fifherman in Largo, and only i in Drumochy, who. 
fifties in fummer, and catches rabbits in winter. — The har- 
bour of Largo is formed by the influx of the water Keil. 
There is a ftone key, where veffels of 200 ton may receive 
or difcharge their cargoes ; but at no great expence it might 
be made to admit of fhips of greater burden. The whole 
bay forms a fafe road-ftead for fhips of every defcription, 
being fheltered from all winds, except the S. and S. W. ; 
and were it better known, might be a mean of preferving 
many lives, particularly when fhips are forced into the 
Forth by ftorms. from the N. E. 

Mountains. — There Is but 1 large hill, well known by 
the name of Largo Law. It is of a conical form, and rifes 
about 800 feet above the level of the fea. Perhaps the 
name Law was given to this and many other hills of fimi- 
lar form, from the flame that did, or was fuppofed to have 
iffued from their tops. The Swedes call flame, ' loa and 
the Danes, ' lue ;' which refemble in found our Scotch 
word ' low a flame. In fupport of this conjeclnre, there 
are, in the poffeffion of Mr James Calderwood-Durham of 
Largo, feveral proclamations from the Privy-council of 
Scotland, ordering fires to be kindled on Largo Law, and 
that of North Berwick, as fignals for the appearance of 
any fhips of the enemy. — Befides this, there are 2 other 
Laws. But it is evident that thefe have been artificial. 
When the cairn was removed from one of thefe, a few 
years ago, a ftone coffin was found at the bottom. From 
the pofition of the bones, it appeared that the perfon had 
been buried in a lingular manner. The legs and arms 
had been carefully fevered from the trunk, and laid dia- 
gonally acrofs it.

ManufaBures and Trade.— The principal manufacture is 
weaving. No woollen cloth indeed is wrought, but for a 
partial iupply to the lower ranks of people. Linen and 
checks are the great articles. Almoft every weaver, and 
a good number of others, have their bleaching ground, 
where they prepare linen, from the value of 9 d. to 4 s. 
the yard. Thofe who can afford to purchafe yarn, work 
check and green linen, which they fell in Dyfart, Kirkaldy, 
Cupar, and Dundee. Others, of lefs ftock, are employed 
in thefe branches by manufacturers in the above towns. 
The greateft proportion of flax is imported ; much of it is 
dreffed and fpun in the parifh. A woman commonly 
fpins 2 hanks a-day, and Ihe is paid from 1 s. to 1 s. 2 d. 
the fpindle. — The farmers deal confiderably in cattle, which 
go to the fhambles in the furrounding country, and not a 
few to Edinburgh ; the remainder are bought for the mofl 
part by Englim drovers. Wheat, barley, oats, beans, and 
fometimes potatoes, are {hipped for Leith and the Weft 
country ; fait, for Dundee and Perth. Wood and iron 
are imported from Norway. There are 3 corn -mills, 
having thirlage ; 2 barley, and 3 lint mills ; 2 falt-pans, 
fupplied with coals from the diftance of 4 miles. 

Population. — At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were 1396. At prefent (179 1) 1913.

Some deduction ought to be made from the average of 
burials, on account of an hofpital in the parilh for old 
men, amounting to 14 in number, who are feldom .admitted 
under 60 years. There are commonly 2 vacancies every 
year; fometimes 3, 4, and 5. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The ftipend confifts of 6 chal- 
ders of victual, L. 36 : 6 : 4, L. 20 Scots for foggage, 5 acres 
of glebe, manfe and garden. The manfe was rebuilt 20 
years ago, and is among the beft in the prefbytery. Since 
the demiffion of Mr Ferrier, who, in conjunction with a Mr 
Smith, minifter at Newburn, formed a fed of Independents, 

a

a lpirit of fchifm has prevailed in this and all the adjacent 
parilhes. Clergy abound here. There being i of the E- 
ftablilhment, i of the Relief, I of the Independents, and 2 
of the Anabaptifts. The number of fouls belonging to the 
Eftablilhment is 1211 ; belonging to Separating, including 
3 of the Epifcopal perfuanon, 702. There are 9 heritors. 

The funds for the public fchool amount to about L. 30 a- 

year. A man of ability and application may look to this 
place as an object, as he would have a numerous fchool 
from the parifh, and the fafe and healthy fituation of the 
place would attract boarders from all quarters. — A t an ave- 
rage, the number of regular poor is 25, each of whom re- 
ceives from 2 s. to 4 s. and 5 s. a-month. The funds a- 
mount to from L. 40 to L. 50 a-year, arifing from money 
at intereft, collections at the church- door, and mortcloths. 
From this ftate of the poor, and their provifion, it may be 
juflly obferved, that the heritors and tenants, upon whom 
the legal fupport of the poor depends, fave annually a con- 
fiderable fum, on account of the management being vefted 
in the kirk-feffion. Were the heritors to appoint a factor 
or treafurer for fupplying the poor, were the poor to know 
that they are entitled to a legal fupport, they would foon 
difcover either their real or fictitious wants, and boldly de- 
mand a fupply ; whereas the prefent mode of fupporting 
them is attended with an oppofite effect. By daily feeing 
and hearing of collections for the poor, the needy will fuf- 
fer much, and work hard, before they can think of being 
claffed among the number; and ftiould this fpirit be at laft 
vanquifhed, either by diftrefs or poverty, their children and 
friends will exert their utmoft, to preferve their needy re- 
lation from what they think a reproach. If any at laft be- 
come beggars, their monthly allowance is immediately- 
withdrawn, with a view to induce them to return to fome 
ufefulnefs in fociety. 

Wages, 



54 2 Statiflical Account 

W ages, Living, Ifc. — Working by contract is now much 
pra&amp;ifed, the gain arifing from which muft be according to 
the bargain they make, and the induftry with which they 
purfue their work. The wages of common labourers and 
hired fervants can be ealily afcertained, the general run be- 
ing from 9 d. to I s. a-day ; hired fervants L. 13 a-year. 
This is to be understood of the man's earnings; and if a 
wife and children be concerned, it is but rare, that any ad- 
dition can be ftated to his income. Female fervants have 
from L. % to L. 4, exclufive of their board, &amp;x. Labour- 
ers and hired fervants who have families, from the above 
account, cannot live fumptuoufly. Except at a birth or 
marriage, or fome other festival, they do not in general 
taste butcher-meat. Meagre broth, potatoes, cheefe, butter 
in fmall quantities, and a preparation of meal in different 
forms, make up their constant fare. All things confider- 
ed, it is aftonilhing to fee man, wife and children, in their 
Sunday's clothes ; all are clean and neat, with faces expref- 
five of contentment. — With respect to the general rank of 
people, their mode of living is undoubtedly improved, both 
as to lodging and diet. — Notwithstanding the jarring opi- 
nions m matters of religion, which may fometimes occalion 
.a d'iftant and referved behaviour, the people in general 
have a kind and obliging turn. They are honest, fober 
and industrious; more forward to fympathife with their 
neighbour in diftrefs, than to rejoice with him in his pro- 
sperity. Tenacious of the peculiar doftrines of Christiani- 
ty, they do not pervert them to encourage licentioufhefs, 
being convinced, that purity of heart and life cannot be 
Separated from the exalted hope which the gofpel in- 
fpires. 

Hofpital. — In 1659, an hofpital for old men of the name 
pf W ood was founded by a Mr John Wood, who was a 

connexion 



of Largo 



543 



connexion of the famous Sir Andrew Wood of Largo. As 
hofpitallers, there are 12 old men of the above name, who, 
with their wives (if thej have any) are accommodated 
with a room and clofet, with an annuity of L. 100 Scots. 
There is a large garden, which fupplies them with vege- 
tables of all kinds. There is alio a porter, who, among 
other parts of his office, calls them to morning and evening- 
prayers, which are given by a chaplain appointed for that 
purpofe. The furgeon in the parilh receives fo much a- 
year for his attendance and advice. The funds arife from 
money at intereft, and an excellent farm adjacent to the 
hofpital. The gentlemen who poffefs the eftates of Largo, 
Lundin, Wemyfs and Balfour, with the minifter of Largo, 
are patrons. Thefe meet on the firft Tuefday of Sep- 
tember, in the hall of the hofpital, to examine the accounts 
of their factor, to fill up vacancies, &amp;c. A dinner is allowed 
by the founder. Of this dinner we lately found an old bill 
of fare, which fhewed the tafte of former times. There 
was charged for wine 3 s. and ale 10 s. The charge now 
is entirely reverfed. 

Eminent and Notable Men. — 1. The faithful and brave 
Sir Andrew Wood, who flourilhed in the reigns of 
James III. and IV. of Scotland, was a native of this pa- 
rifh. Under James IIT. he pofTeffed the barony of Largo 
in tack. But James IV. invelted him in the property of 
it, on account of two lignal victories he had obtained at fea, 
over the Englifli, about the beginning of his reign. It ap- 
pears that Sir Andrew, like Commodore Trunnion, brought 
on more his nautical ideas and manners. From his houfe, 
down almoft as far as the church, he formed a canal, upon 
which he ufed to fail in his barge to the church every Sun^ 
day in great ftate. — 2. After Sir Andrew Wood, the ba- 
rony of Largo came into the pofTeffion of the family of Dur- 
ham, 



544 



Stati/lical Account 



ham, to which the celebrated Mr James Durham belonged, 
being brother to Sir Alexander Durham of Largo. This 
gentleman was diftinguiffied both as a foldier and divine, 
being firft a captain of dragoons, and then minifter of the 
High Church of Glafgow. He was folicited to become pro- 
feffor of divinity in the college there ; but being eminent- 
ly diftinguiftied among his brethren, he was by them ap- 
pointed to the honourable office of chaplain at court. 
While at Glafgow, he had an opportunity of preaching be- 
fore Oliver Cromwell, when he tookoccafion to fpeak with 
freedom of the injuftice of Oliver's invafion. Being after- 
wards feverely challenged by the Ufurper, he calmly an- 
fwered, that he thought it incumbent upon him to fpeak 
his mind freely upon that fubject, efpecially as he had an 
opportunity of doing it in his own hearing. — 3. Alexander 
Selkirk, who was rendered fjamous by Monf. de Foe, under 
the name of Robinfon Crufoe. His hiftcry, di veiled of fable, 
is as follows: He was born in Largo in 1676. Having 
gone to fea in his youth, and in the year 1703, being fail- 
ing mafter of the fhip Cinque Ports, Captain Stradling, 
bound for the South Seas, he was put on fhore, on the 
ifland of Juan Fernandez, as a punifhment for mutiny. In. 
that folitude he remained 4 years and 4 months, from 
which he was at laft relieved, and brought to England by 
Captain Woods Rogers. He had with him in the ifland 
his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, fome powder, bul- 
lets and tobacco, a hatchet, knife, kettle, his mathematical 
inftruments and Bible. He built 2 huts of Piemento trees, 
and covered them with long grafs, and, in a ihort time, 
lined them with /kins of goats, which he killed with his 
inuiket, fo long as his powder lafted, (which at firft was 
but a pound) ; when that was fpent, he caught them by 
fpeed of foot. Having learned to produce fire, by rubbing 
two pieces of wood together, he dreffed his victuals in one 

of 



of Largo. 545 

of his huts, and ilept in the other, which was at fome di- 
ftance from his kitchen. A multitude of rats often difturb- 
ed his repofe, by gnawing his feet, and other parts of his 
body, which induced him to feed a number of cats for his 
protection. In a fhort time, thefe became fo tame, that 
they would lie about him in hundreds, and foon delivered 
him from the rats, his enemies. Upon his return, he de- 
clared to his friends, that nothing gave him fo much un- 
eafinefs, as the thoughts, that when he died, his body would 
be devoured by thofe very cats he had with fo much care 
tamed and fed. To divert his mind from fuch melancholy 
thoughts, he would fometimes dance and ling among his 
kids and goats, at other times retire to his devotion. His 
clothes and (hoes were foon worn, by running through the 
woods. In the want of Ihoes he found little inconvenience, 
as the foles of his feet became fo hard, that he could run 
every where without difficulty. As for clothes, he made 
for himfelf a coat and cap of goats fkins, fewed with little 
thongs of the fame, cut into proper form with his knife. 
His only needle was a nail. When his knife was worn to 
the back, he made others as well as he could, of fome iron 
hoops that had been left on lliore, by beating them thin, 
and grinding them on Hones. By his long feclufion from 
intercourfe with men, he had fo far forgot the ufe of fpeech, 
that the people on board Captain Rogers's fiiip could fcarce 
underftand him, for he feemed to fpeak his words by 
halves. The cheft and muflcet which Selkirk had with 
him on the ifland, are now in the poffeflion of his grand- 
nephew, John Selkirk, weaver in Largo. 

Antiquities. — On the bank of the water Keil, are the 
ruins of the ancient eaftle of Balcruvie, a place once of con- 
fiderable ftrength, occupied of old by the family of Graw-

ford. There is a fquare tower pretty entire. Of the old 
houfe of Largo, one round tower remains. A little fouth- 
wards, in a large park, there is now an elegant modern 
houfe, commanding one of the fineft and moft extenfive 
profpefts in Scotland. About a mile to the weft ward, is 
the ancient tower of Lundin, which now conftitutes a part 
of a modern building, with a Gothic front. — rNear to this, 
in the middle of a plain, are 3 remarkable ftones, ftanding 
upright in the ground, each meafuring 6 yards above, and 
as much it is fuppofed below the ground. There are alfo 
fragments of a fourth, which feems to have been of equaj 
magnitude with the other three. There is no infcription, 
nor the leaft veftige of any character to be found upon 
them. But the tradition is, that they are the grave-ftones 
of fome Danilh chiefs, who fell in battle with the Scot? 
near this place.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7829854">TOWIE</name>, 
(COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Mearns.</head> 

<p>N"ame, Situation, Air, is'c. 

*~T^ HIS parifh formerly was called Kilbartha •, its name 
now is Towie-Kinbattoch, which is probably Gaelic, 
and has been given to it on account of its northern expo- 
fure. It is fituated in the premytery of Alford, and Synod 
of Aberdeen. Its length is about 3^- Englilh miles, and its 
breadth about 2". It is bounded by Strathdon, and Glen- 
bucket on the W. by Cabrach on the N. by Kildrunimy 
and Culhny on the E. and by Tarland and Migvy on the 
S. The general appearance of the country is hilly, but not 
rocky. The hills for the moft part are covered with, 
heath. The only river that runs through this parifli is the 
Don. It is well ftored with trout, and in rainy fummers a 
few falmon get up. By the river-lide, the foil, though not 
deep, is very fertile, and, comparatively fpeaking, early. 
The air is dry and healthy. The moft prevalent diftem- 
per is the gravel, with which this and the neighbouring 
parifhes are afflicted to a very remarkable degree. If it be 

true,,

true, that this difeafe is hereditary, which is probable, this 
may in a great degree account for it, as the men feldom go 
for their wives beyond the bounds of their own or the 
neighbouring parifh- There are fome mineral waters here, 
which, if drunk for any confiderable time, would probably 
give fome relief from this dreadful complaint. But in this 
corner, as well as in many befides, the people have but too 
great a propenfity to believe, that the difeafes of their bo- 
dy, as well as thofe of their mind, are to be cured at once, 
and without that patient continuance which experience fo 
uniformly declares to be necefTary. 

Population, &amp;c — The parilh feems to have been more 
populous formerly than at prefent. According to Dr Web- 
fler's returns, the numbers were 656. There are now about 
550 inhabitants, of whom 282 are males, 268 females. The 
regifter of births and burials has begun of late only to be kept 
regularly. For the laft 6 years, the annual average of births 
is 12 j of deaths is nearly 6. During the fame fpace of time, 
the annual average of marriages is 5. There is reafon to 
believe, that if the pra&amp;ice of inoculating for the fmall- 
pox prevailed throughout the different parifhes, it would be 
very favourable to population. The minifter, encouraged 
by the generofity of one of the heritors who refides in the 
neighbourhood, though not within the bounds of the pa- 
rifh, recommended from the pulpit, a general inoculation 
throughout the parifh, and as an encouragement to the 
poorer fort, added, that no fees to the furgeon would be ex- 
pected from them who could not afford the expenfe. In 
confequence of which, all the children, and young people,

other circumftances that were thought unfriendly to inocu- 
lation ; and of the whole, there was not one who was not 
eafy under the difeafe, and had not a good recovery. One 
girl, indeed, after all hazard from the fmall-pox was over, 
and her recovery in a manner complete, happened to over- 
heat herfelf in running with fome of her companions, which 
brought on a fever that was the occafion of her death. — 
The parimioners here confift, in general, of farmers and their 
families. There is only one diffenter from the Eftabliftied 
Church. There are very few mechanics; the farmers here, 
as is generally the cafe at fuch a diftance from towns, uni- 
ting in their perfon, along with their own profeffion, that of 
mafon, carpenter, and fhoemaker, are, of courfe, remarkable 
for a degree of ingenuity and knowledge, to which the com- 
mon people near the fea-coaft, and where the divifion of la- 
bour is eftabliftied, are ftrangers. The women, when within 
doors, are employed in fpinning coarfe linen-yarn to Aber- 
deen manufacturers, and make from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. a-week. 
The numbers in this parifti, for 10 years paft, have rather 
been decreafing, owing, in a great degree, to the fcarcity of 
fuel. On feveral farms, that were formerly divided among 
3 families, there refides at prefent only 1. The proportion 
between the annual births and the whole population, is near- 
ly as I to 46 ; between the annual marriages and the whole 
population, is as 1 to no ; between the annual deaths and 
the whole population, is nearly as 1 to 92. The number of 
married men, including widowers, is 87 ; and of bachelors, 
reckoning from 20 years of age, 79. Each marriage, at an 
average, produces 4 or 5 children. 

Agriculture. — No wheat is raifed in the parifli, and but 
few turnips or cabbages. The farmers, however, begin to 
be fenfiblc of the value of green crops, and if they get pro- 
per

per encouragement, would pay more attention to them now 
than what they have formerly done. The pariih fupplies 
itfelf with provifions. It always fpares a confiderable quan- 
tity of meal and fome bear, part of which is fold to the 
people that live near the head of the rivers Dee and Don, 
and the reft carried to Aberdeen. To that market, too, are 
annually fent a good many fat lheep. The dealers in black 
cattle carry, every year, from this and jthe neighbouring pa- 
rifties, to the markets in the fouth of Scotland, a confiderable 
number of cattle and cows, where they are brought up for 
Englifh pafture and Englifti markets. A lint-mill has been 
lately erected in this parifh ; and the farmers begin to 
raife fome flax, but chiefly as yet for their own ufe. There 
is a very inconfiderable number of acres in fown or artifi- 
cial grafs. Of hill-pafture, there is a great deal, to which 
the arable ground bears a fmall proportion. Oats are ge- 
nerally fown from the middle of March to the middle of A- 
pril; and when the barley ground is clean, the fooner it is 
fown fo much the better. The harveft generally begins a- 
bout the firft of September. In 1782, though the crop was 
much hurt, there was within the parifh as much whoLfome 
feed, as would ferve itfelf, and give fome aid to their neigh- 
bours ; and though the meal was lels in quantity, and a con- 
fiderable part of it much worfe in quality than ufual, the 
farmers were ftill able tofpare as much as helped to pay their 
rents. A good deal of pains was taken, though without 
much fuccefs, to fix, if poflible, on fome clecifive marks by 
which the good feed might be diftinguiflied from fuch as was 
hurt by froft. Experience taught, that no firefs at all was 
to be laid on the appearance of the grain in its natural 
ftate. The cleareft and beft looking part of it, when fowed, 
often produced the worft crop. The grain too, that yielded, 
when milled, the greateft quantity of meal was far from ha- 
ving 



of Towie.

ving the bell vegetative powers. Neither did it follow, be- 
caufe the grain fprung readily when put into a pot of earth, 
that therefore it might be depended on for good feed. It 
was ofteti found to fpring readily through the ground, 
without having ftrength enough to bring the plant to matu- 
rity. Thefe remarks are confined to oats. As to bear or 
bigg, when it is hurt by froft, it is always believed to have 
an external appearance of being damaged. The upper end 
of the grain is- blackened, which is owing, perhaps, to the 
hulk's being more tender and more fufceptible of impreffion 
than oats. By attending to this diverfity in the hulk of bear 
and oats, the incumbent was led to think, that though the 
hardnefs of the latter prevented any external appearance in 
its natural ftate, [when the grain was injured by froft, yet 
when ftripped of the hulk, this appearance might be ob- 
served. Accordingly, after a narrow infpeftion of different 
fpecimens of oats intended for feed, after they were thus 
ftripped, by being put through the mill, and attending to the 
crops they produced, he was inclined to believe that the 
appearance of the grain in that ftate, its being plump and 
clear, free of Ihrivelling and darknefs of colour, efpecially at 
the extremities, is the bell mark by which found feed-oats 
may be diftinguiftied from fuch as are hurt by the froft. — A 
great proportion of ground lies wafte. The land-rent is a- 
bout L. iooo Sterling. The average rent of farms is L. 20 
Sterling ; and the fize is fuch as to give employment for 
8 fmall oxen, 3 or 4 very fmall horfes, the tenant, a man and 
a boy. 

Prices and Wages. — There is no public market within the 
parilh for beef, mutton or poultry. Cheefe fells at 5 s. 
the ftone. Butter at 10 s. 6d. the ftone being 28 lb. 
£nglilh. The price of hens and ducks is generally 6 d. a- 

piece.

piece. That of eggs i|d a-dozen. The boll of barley fells 
at an average for 13 s. and meal at us. A day-labourer's 
wages are 6 d. with his victuals. A ploughman, getting his 
victuals in the houfe, has L. 5 a-year, and a woman fervant 
L.2, 10 s. 

Stipend, Poor, ifc. — The value of the living, including 
the glebe, which is fcarcely 4 acres, amounts to L. 72 
Sterling. Alexander Leith of Freefield, Efq-, principal 
heritor, is patron. The number of heritors is 4, none of 
whomTelide. The church was repaired in 1744, and the 
manfe in 1 778. — The number of poor in the parifh receiving 
alms is 15. The annual contribution for their relief a- 
mounts to about L. 5, which, with L. 4, xo s. the intereft of 
L. 100 formerly faved, make the whole of the fund for the 
poor. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The fcarcity of fuel, which 
is turf, peat, and heath, brought from hills far off, and the 
diftance from a fea-port, are great difadvantages to this 
parifh. There are 43 ploughs, each of which is generally 
drawn by 8 or 10 fmall oxen. There about 40 fmall carts, 
each drawn by 1 or 2 fmall horfes. — The people in this 
corner are very agile and well-fhaped, induftrious and hu- 
mane. They have no diflike to a military life, efpecially 
when any of the heritor's fons gets a commiffion. Luxury 
is a vice not known in this corner. — Land property is not 
often fold •, when it is, the price is generally about 25 years 
purchafe. — The people here are not remakably given to 
complaints -, but they are not infenfible to their grie- 
vances. They well know, that as yet there is but little 
appearance of liberality in the mode adopted by land-hold- 
ers, of letting their farms. If they happen to have any

regular tack, which is far from being always the cafe, the 
number of years is too fmall, often not amounting to 19, 
•and never exceeding that number. And while the rent in 
money, meal, and barley, is high, the number of fervices is 
very heavy, being commonly expreffed in fuch general, 
or rather ambiguous terms, as puts it into the power of the 
mailer, if he be fo difpofed, to opprefs the tenant. A ge. 
rterous mind will never think, without indignation, on the 
defire which fome proprietors of land in this Highland part 
of the country, have to keep their tenants in a ftate of fla- 
vifh dependence. That the latter mould prefume to think 
for tliemfelves, and the former have no other power of 
coercion but what reafon and the laws of the country allow 
them, is a fentiment fo little relimed by many lairds, that 
a poor tenant, if he is difpofed to cringe, will often be pre- 
ferred to one whofe fpirit and circumftances lead him to 
think of a manly independence. Among the means by 
which the condition of the people in this part of Scotland 
could be ameliorated, the redremng of the above grievances 
is one. If any effectual method could be devifed of banilh- 
ing feudal prejudices, and quickening the progrefs north- 
ward, of a more liberal fyftem in the letting of farms, it 
might be of the utmoft confequence both to mafter and 
tenant. It rauft by no means be underftood, however, that 
what is here faid is applicable to the parifh of Towie, more 
than to other parifhes around it. On the contrary, from 
the well known character of feveral of the heritors, there is 
-every reafon to believe, that were a more liberal plan of 
Jetting leafes to be introduced into this diftri£t, they would 
be exceedingly ready to forward and adopt fuch a benefi- 
cial meafure. — The roads here are indifferent. They were

NUMBER LXXI. 

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="NA">STRACHUR 
and STRALACHLAN</name>, 

(COUNTY GF ARGYLE.) 
By the Rev. Mr Charles Stewart.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, ifc. 

THESE parifhes were united in the year 1650. Stra- 
chur, before that period, was joined to Lochgoilhead ; 
Stralachlan to InverchaOlan. In eredting thefe parifhes 
into one, it was appointed that the glebe and manfe fhould 
be in Strachur, which' is now conlidered as the mother- 
church ; and Strachur is the name by which they are now 
known. Prior to 1650, the parifhes in Argylefhire were 
very extenfive, and incommodious for the clergy and peo- 
ple. Moft of the clergy have Hill 2, fome 3, fome 4 places 
to preach in. The parifhes are often interfered by arms 
of the fea, and chains of high mountains. — Strachur of old 
was called Killmaglafs, from Kill, which meant the refi- 
dence of a faint ; but it is commonly applied to a chapel, 
appropriated to the worfhip of a faint, and a fmall portion 
of ground around the chapel, Which was coufidercd as fanc- 
tified, and ufed for burying thofe who died in the peace of 
the church. Maglafs was the perfon's name who was con- 

fidered

fidered as tutelor faint of Strachur. — Stralachlan was called 
Killvorrie, from Kill, as above, and Moirre, the Virgin 
Mary. Stralachlan itfelf is partly derived from Lachlan, 
the name of a family of confiderable diflin&amp;ion among the 
Highland clans, and whofe refidence has been in Stralachlan 
for time immemorial. The reprefentative of this family is 
chief of the Clan-lachlan. — This parifh is fituated in the 
prefbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of Argyle. It is 18 
Englifh miles in length. From the N. E. for 8 miles, it 
is 6 broad ; for the other 10, only 3 broad. It is bounded 
on the E. and N. E. by the united parifhes of Lochgoil- 
head and Killmorrich ; on the S. by the united parifhes of 
Killmun and Dunoon, and by Killmodan ; on the N. and 
N. W. by Lpchfine, an arm of the fea, which feparates it 
on the N. from Inverary, on the N. W. from Glaflrie. 
— The general appearance is hilly. There are fome plains 
by the fea-fide, and on the borders of fmall rivers, which 
bear a proportion to the hilly grounds only as 1 to 22. 
The hills afford excellent paflure for fheep and black cattle ; 
they are gradually growing green, fince the fheep's flocks 
have been introduced ; the heath is decaying faft, where- 
ever the fheep are allowed to paflure, but it never will be 
totally banifhed ; the foil of the hills has a natural ten- 
dency to produce it. — The diftridt of Cowal, containing 6 
parifhes, is a point of land, flretching from N. E. to S. W. 
between the river Clyde and Lochfine. The N. E. part 
of the diftricl, which joins Perthfhire, prefents a very rug- 
ged and broken furface. The mountains become gradually 
lower and fmoother, as you advance to the S. W. ; and to- 
wards the extremity, comparatively fpeaking, the land is 
low and evenly. — There are a few fpots on the banks 
of the river Cur, of excellent deep foil, a mixture of loam 
and clay, but in general the foil is fharp and thin ; it re- 
quires a conflant fupply of manure to make it produce any

kind of crop 5 if left fallow for 6 years, and not paftured 
by flieep, it is covered with heath. The meadows, in 
warm rainy feafons, give good crops of hay.— The air is 
pure and healthy, although a great quantity of rain falls on 
the hills and valleys, as is the cafe on ail the weft coaft of 
Scotland. The rheumatifm affecTs people of different ranks, 
and in different fituations, owing, no doubt, to the moifture 
and variablenefs of the climate. 

Rivers, Lakes, Sea-coaft, &amp;?c. — The river Cur has its 
fource in the mountains that border on Lochgoilhead ; for 
2 miles it is rough and rapid ; when it comes down to 
the plain, it runs fmoothly, forming a number of beauti- 
ful links. After running about 7 miles, and receiving a 
number of fmaller rivers, it difcharges itfelf into Locheck, 
a lake of 6 miles in length, and £. mile in breadth. The 
bounds of the parifli extend for 3 miles on each fide of 
this lake, which lies, thus far S. E. and N. W. ; it then 
forms a curve, turning S. and S. W. A few falmon, and 
a number of falmon-trout, come up this lake by the river 
Eachaig, which communicates with the Clyde. They are 
caught by angling. A ftill net has been tried on the lake 
with fome fuccefs, but not enough to defray the expenfe 
of attendance. The falmon come up the river Cur in 
Oftober and November, and remain through a great part 
of the winter ; very few in fummer. This was not the 
cafe fome time ago. It would appear the falmon is not 
fo plenty in the rivers fince ftill nets have become fo nu- 
merous on the coaft. The moft remarkable thing with 
regard to * Locheck is, its abounding with frefti water 

herring. 

* There is an old tradition in the parilh regarding the origin of Loch- 
eck. It is faid, the fpace it occupies was once a beautiful flat of arable 
land. The lake is now very deep ; in many places from 60 to 70 fathoms. 
The people in its neighbourhood account it the deepeR of any iqScnt- 
land. 



55 8 Statljlical Account 

herring. They are a dry infipid filh ; and are not du- 
covered in any other lake on the weft coaft, excepting 
this and Lochlomond. This parifh has 18 miles of fea- 
coaft. Lochfine borders it on one fide to the extent of its 
whole length. The more of this loch is partly flat and 
fandy •, partly fteep and rocky. Where the land nigh the 
fea is low, the more is flat ; where the fea comes clofe to 
the foot of the hills, the more is high and rocky. There 
are no dangerous funk rocks on the coaft ; it is in general 
what the failors call a bold* and confequently a fafe fliore. 
Befides the herring occafionally caught in Lochfine, 
there are a few cod and haddocks ; but no boat from this 
parifh is particularly employed in this kind of fifhing. — 
The quantity of frefli water in Lochfine, from the number 
of ftreams that difcharge themfelves into it, and its di- 
ftance from the ocean, renders the fea-ware it produces 
almoft unfit for kelp. This manufacture is feldom at- 
tempted. The inhabitants manure their lands with fuch 
of it as they can get accefs to. The quantity of it that 
mull be laid on the ground is great, and its fubftance is 
exhaufted with the firft crop. About 30 acres are ma- 
nured with it annually for bear and potatoes. It anfwers 
well for bear ; but the potatoes produced by it are of an 
inferior quality. — The river Cur annually carries away 
feveral acres of excellent foil. When fwelled in different 
parts of its courfe, it undermines its banks, which tumble 
down and are carried away. It leaves a heap of gravel 
on the oppofite fide, which takes a long tra£l of years be- 
fore it is covered with fo much depth of foil as to pro- 
duce a crop. In fummer and autumn, by overflowing its 
banks, it often does much damage to the hay and corn ; 
but there is no profpedt. of a canal being cut for it to pre- 
vent this mifchief. The expenfe of this would be too great 
in proportion to the benefit that would be derived from it. 

In 



of Strachar and Stralachlan. 559 



—in Autumn 1780, a remarkable water-fpout fell on part 
of this parifti, particularly on the hills to the north eaft of 
Locheck. It ruined down the hills with fuch force, as to 
tear up the furface of the ground, tumbling down large 
Hones, trees, mofs, and land, which were moftly left in the 
plains that border the lake. Eight or ten acres of very- 
good arable land were entirely deftroyed. The quantity 
of ftones and rubbifh was fo great, that twice the value of 
the land would not be fumcient to defray the expenfe of 
clearing it. Eight inhabited houfes were totally thrown 
down, part carried into the lake, part buried under the fand, 
&amp;.c. Fortunately this happened about 2 o'clock in the af- 
ternoon. The people faw the water ruining down, and 
alarmed at the appearance, left their houfes, betook them- 
felves to the rifing grounds, and flood in the utmoft confter- 
nation, beholding their houfes and effefts carried off. Se- 
veral of the men, in attempting to fave their property, 
were in imminent danger. Had this happened in the night- 
time, many lives muft have been loft. The parifti contri- 
buted generoufly to make up the loffes of the pooreft fuf- 
ferers. Every man who could work, affifted with eager- 
nefs in rebuilding the houfes. The landlord behaved with 
the greateft humanity to the tenants, All the houfes on a 
fraall farm to the north-weft of Locheck, were demoliftied 
by a fimilar flood, fome years before. 

Curious Stones, Sjc. — On a high part of that ridge of hills 
which ieparates Stralachlan from Glendaruel, there is a very 
large ftone, remarkable for its fituation. There is a defcent 
from it on every fide. The profpecl: from it is very extenfive. 
It is called Caillecich-vear or vera. In the dark ages of fu- 
pgrftition, it was perfonified, and faid to have a confiderable 
property in cattle. Cailleuch-vear makes a confpicuous fi- 
gnre in the marvellous tales of the country people, "over a

great part of the Weft Highlands. Her refidence was faid 
to be on the higheft mountains ; that fhe could ftep with 
eafe, and in a moment, from one diftricl: to another ; when 
offended, that fhe caufed a flood to come from the moun- 
tains, which deftroyed the corns, and laid the low grounds 
under water ; that one of thefe floods was the origin of 
Lochow, in Lorn, of Locheck, in this parifh, and of many- 
other lakes ; that the people paid her a fuperftitious vene- 
ration, and were under dreadful apprehenfions of her anger. 
It would be amufing to record the many marvellous tradi- 
tions that prevail in the Highlands, which have an allego- 
rical meaning, efpecially where the allegory can be eafily 
traced. In the inftance of Cailleacb-vear, it is very obvious, 
Be'ir is the Gaelic for a thunderbolt. In the oblique cafes, 
it is pronounced Veir ; as Bein-ve'ir, the name of a very 
high mountain in the parifh of Appin, which fignifies the 
Mountain of thunder. Every thing faid of Cailleach-vear, 
literally applies to the effefts of thunder, which is doubly 
awful in the neighbourhood of high mountains ; nor is it 
furprifing that it fhould be perfonified and fuperftitioufly 
dreaded in ages of ignorance. The mountains of Sierra 
Leona in Africa, which divide Nigritia from Guinea, were 
ftyled by the ancients, the mountains of God, on account of 
their being fubjecl: to thunder and lightning. The fitua- 
tion of Cailleach-vear, in Stralachlan, is much expofed to 
every ftorm. When a ftorm was accompanied with thun- 
der, it may be eafily fuppofed, that fuch as were tending 
herds or flocks around that flone, would be much alarmed, 
would run off, and leave their charge to the mercy of the 
perfon who was fuppofed to produce the ftorm. If any of 
the cattle were amifiing, Cailleach-vear was accufed of ha- 
ving feized upon them, and no further fearch was made. 

On the fame ridge of hills, about 8 miles to the eaftward 
of Cailleach-vear a fmall conical hill rifes confiderably above

the neighbouring hills. It is feen from Inverary, and from 
many parts at a great diftance. It is called Sien-Sluai, the 
fairy habitation of a multitude *. On the top of it, which 
is flat, afhes have been found, and bits of timber half burnt, 
within the area of a circular building, whofe foundations can 
be eafily traced. The area is now covered with mofs of 
confiderable depth. Tradition reports, and it is very like- 
ly, that it was one of thofe alarm-towers fo frequent in 
the north of Scotland. There were chains of them on 
confpicuous high grounds from the weft to the eaft coaft. 
They were conftantly watched when there were any ap- 
prehenfions of the approach of an enemy. By kindling a 
fire or fires, the arrival of a hoftile fleet on the coaft, and! 
even the number of the fhips was announced, in a very 
fhort fpace of time, to the moft diftant corner of the king- 
dom. — There is an obelifk in the midft of a plain field, 
within 80 yards of Strachur-houfe, the refidence of Gene- 
ral Campbell of Strachur. About 15 years ago, when 
the General was building his houfe, there was a number 
of ftones of different fizes about this obelife. He was told! 
that they were the remains of a druidical circle, and gave 
particular orders that none of the ftones mould be remo- 
ved ; on purpofe, that any perfon converfant in antiquities 
might be enabled to trace the circle. The ftones, how- 
ever, were moftly taken away in the General's abfence. 
It does not, however, appear, that this obelifk was any 
part of a druidical circle. It is moft likely that it was 
erefted as a memorial of the death of fome man of emi- 
nence, who had been killed on that fpot ; a cuftom which 
was very prevalent in the Highlands. This obelijk is 10

feet in height. It is very nearly fquare, being 22 inches 
at the bafe, and tapering gradually towards the top, where 
it meafures only 10 inches. Some old people remember 
2 ftones of the fame appearance, one of them much larger 
than the one defcribed ; all within 300 or 400 yards of 
1 ach other. By ploughing and digging the ground about 
them, they fell down, and were broken for the purpofes of 
building. — There is a little round hill nigh the head of 
Locheck, called Tom-a-chorachqficb, ' the man's hillock, 
' whofe legs were of unequal length.' It is faid, that a 
Prince of Denmark, whofe party had been routed in an 
engagement on the coaft, is buried in this hillock, where 
he had been overtaken by his purluers, killed and inter- 
red. He is faid to have been of gigantic ftature. He is 
called ' an Corrachafach mor mae Righ Lochlan ;' the 
great Corrachafach, fon to the King of Denmark. 

Caves. — A cave in the fide of a hill, called Tur-na'n 
caiman, ' the fort of pigeons,' in the farm of Invernaodin, 
is frequently vifited. It is remarkable for the length of 
time a ftone thrown in at the mouth of it, continues to 
tumble down with a remarkable noife, as if it were roll- 
ing over fheets of copper. There is another cave in a 
hill called Carnach mhor, fo wide at the entrance as to ad- 
mit 4 men a-breaft ; it then expands, furnifhing an apart- 
ment, where 50 men in arms may ftand without any in- 
conveniency ; then it becomes narrow, and in advancing, 
there is an apartment equally large with the firft ; and fo 
on alternately, as far as it has been explored. There are 
a number of other fmaller caves in the fide of the fame 
hill. A cave in the farm of Ballimore, in the face of a 
fteep rugged rock, deferves only to be mentioned on ac- 
count of a remarkable man who took up his refidence in 
it, and whofe name it bears. It is called Uamhachoro- 

laich

laich, ' the ftrange fellow's cave :' It is faid, that a man, 
unknown to any perfon, carried his wife and family into 
this cave, which is almoft inacceffible ; that he fupported 
them there, by preying on the neighbourhood ; that he 
avoided as much as poffible being feen ; but that when his 
neceffities obliged him to make his appearance, he ftruck 
the people with fuch awe and terror, that they refufed 
him nothing ; that ' he never particularly oppreffed any 
perfon ; that he left the country after he had reared his 
family. 

Woods. — The woods confift of oak, afh, birch, alder, 
bazel, mountain afh, afpen and elm. Their value is 
known, having lately been cut and fold. A cutting of 
the whole would be worth L. 6000 Sterling. They are 
cut at the end of 20 years. A few of the oaks are re- 
ferved till the next cutting. The mod healthy and thri- 
ving plants are pitched upon ; but though allowed to grow 
to the age of 40 or 60 years, they are not fit timber for 
large mips. They are bought for building boats, for 
couples and rafters, &amp;c to the houfes of country people. 
The bark of the oak brings the greateft part of the mo- 
ney that is given for the woods. The birch, .aider, and 
hazel are made into charcoal, for which there is a ready 
market. An Englifh Company, who have erected a fur- 
nace on the oppofite fhore of Lochfme, for fmelting iron 
ore, have a conftant demand for it. There is alfo a de- 
mand for it from England. The groffeft part of it is ufed 
for fmelting the ore ; the fmalleft or drofs for raducing 
the pig-iron to the proper ftate of that metal. The plant- 
ing is not confiderable. The little that is done in this 
way is only for ornament and fhelter about gentlemen's 
houfes. This, however, by degrees, will lead to plant, 
•with a view of having ufeful timber. Orchards do not

thrive well in this diftricl:. The trees promife w.ell for a 
few years, but foon decay. It appears that not long ago, 
the face of the country was moftly covered with woods. 
It was then a great object, to clear the ground of them ; 
but this fpirit has been carried too far, as there are many 
fpots of ground which would make better returns to the 
landlord, if producing wood, than if paftured, befides their 
-utility and ornament to the country. 

Population. — By Dr Webfter's reports, the numbers 
were 1193. In January 1783, there were icoi. Of 
whom were under 8 years of age, - -221 

Above 8, unmarried, _ . . 

Widowers and widows, - - - 68 

Married, - » . - 342 

The average number of marriages for 10 years back is 
9 yearly; of baptifms 33. It is only within thefe 40 
years that any regifter was kept, and for 2 8 of thefe not 
very regular. Till within 40 years, the population is faid 
to have continued nearly the fame for a long time back ; 
■fince that period, it has decreafed by a third, and is ftiil 
decreasing. There are not now joco perfons jn the pa- 
rifh. — There are 12 weavers in the parifh, who weave 
coarfe cloths and [linens, fuch as the country people wear. 
There is 1 mafon, 3 carpenters ; there are 2 blackfmiths, 5 
tailors, 2 ferrymen, 2 innkeepers. The people are fober 
and induftrious. Noperfon from this parifh has been tried 
for a crime, for many years back. They refpedr, the laws, 
and pay due regard to their fuperiors, civil and ecclefiafti- 
pal. They are all of the eftablilhed religion, and very 
pan&amp;ual in attending the fervice of the church. 



Agriculture t 



of Strachur and Stralacblan.'

Agriculture, &amp;c. — The parifh contains about 39,000 
acres, Scots meafure, which is calculated from the number 
of fquare miles it amounts to. 700 acres, at prefent, are ufed 
for the purpofes of agriculture : Little more than the half 
of which is annually in tillage. This computation is made 
from the quantity of grain fown, which is 312, bolls oats, 
14 bolls bear, 126 bolls potatoes. The woods occupy 
1500 acres; 36,800 are in paftures for horfes, black cattle 
and fheep. The farms are very unequal in extent. There is 
one of L. 200 Sterling of rent; feveral about L. 100; 
fome not more than L. 20. The proportion of arable land 
in each farm is fmall ; the price of labour is high ; the land 
unevenly, and of an inferior quality ; the climate unfavour- 
able for railing crops ; a number of horfes are required for 
the labour, which, through the greateft part of the year, are 
a dead flock on the hands of the farmer. Thefe circum- 
ftances render the arable land of fo little value, that in ta- 
king a farm, it is only looked upon as a conveniency, and 
a rent is only given in proportion to the number of cattle 
for which the farm can afford pafture. At an average, the 
pafture grounds may be valued at 13 d. the acre ; but at this 
rate, the whole rent is laid on the grafs grounds. There 
are in the parifh 175 horfes, 821 cows, 12,280 fheep. The 
average produce is 1092 bolls of oats, 613 bolls bear, and 
1512 bolls of potatoes. The crops that are raifed very nearly 
fupply the inhabitants. About ico bolls of imported 
meal are bought ; but there is nearly an equivalent of bear, 
of meal and of potatoes, fold to diftilleries in the neighbour- 
hood. Upon comparing the number of inhabitants with 
the produce, it will appear that each perfon's fhare is very 
fmall ; but a number of men and women leave the parifh in 
fummer and autumn, and go to public works ; fuch as fi fil- 
ing, cutting wood, manufacturing barks, and harveft-work 
in the fouth of Scotland. The valued rent is L. 267 : 16 : 9 

Sterling.

Sterling. The real rent is L. 2070 Sterling. Services 
from the tenants are almofl totally abolifhed. The princi- 
pal eftates in the parifh are freeholds. The lefler eftates 
hold of the Duke of Argyle, to whom is paid a fmall feu- 
duty. The parifh is divided among 11 heritors ; 6 of whom 
refide. The other have their refidence clofe in the neigh- 
bourhood. — Donald Maclachlan, Efq; one of the Faculty of 
Advocates in Scotland, is principal heritor. His predecef- 
fors lived in a caftle, which is ftill (landing. It is a large 
building, nearly fquare. The height of the walls is 47 feet 
3 inches. Its greateft length is 72 feet 4 inches. It is 
not precifely known when Caftlelachlan was built. The 
tradition regarding it is, that it was built by a lady at a 
time her hulband, the laird, was abroad, ferving in one of 
the crufades. Mr Maclachlan feems refolved to keep the 
caftle in fuch repair as it was in when he fucceeded to it ; 
but finding it inconvenient for a family refidence, he has 
juft now built a good modern houfe clofe by the caftle. 
This houfe is fituated in the middle of a plain, by the fide 
of a fmall river. It fronts Lochfine, of which it commands 
a view for feveral miles. The hills, which have an unbro- 
ken furface and gentle flope, more than half fnrround the 
houfe, and (belter it from every wind, excepting the fouth- 
weft. Certain fpots on the declivity of the hills are plant- 
ed with foreft-trees ; fome of which are already in great 
forwardnefs. The variety of (hades between them, and the 
natural wood will have a very fine effect in beautifying the 
place, which, for its extent, is much admired. Mr Mac- 
lachlan's eftate lies in one continued ftretch on the fide of 
Lochfine. It is 11 miles in length, and at an average a 
mile and an half in breadth. His houfe is about the centre. 
The farms on the eftate moftly border on Lochfine. The 
tenants houfes are nigh the (hore, where they have their a- 
rable grounds-, their pafture lands reach to the fummit of the

hills which feparate the parifh from Glendmule. He has 
more than the half of all the woods in the parifh, which 
make a beautiful appearance viewed from the other fide, or 
from Lochfine. The made they afford, and the delicate 
flavour of a vaft quantity of honeyfuckle, which grows 
ipontaneoufly among them, will be exceedinly refrefhing to 
the traveller, when the line of road is completed, which i 
begun, and carrying on, down the fide of Lochfine. The 
feelings they raife is like that of comfortable clothing in a 
bleak and cold country. There is no object in the Highlands 
more pleaiant than gentle (loping hills, ikirted with wood, , 
and terminating in the fea. Such an objecf Mr Maclach- 
lan's eftate offers to the view through the greater! part of 
its extent. — Lieutenant-General Campbell, Colonel of the 
57th regiment of foot, the prefent laird of Strachur, is al- 
fo a refiding heritor. His predecefTors lived fometimes in 
Lochgoilhead, at a place called Ardgartan, where they had 
a large property, which frill continues in the family, 
fometimes in different farms on their eftate in this parifh. 
They had a confiderable property in the parifh of Arro- 
quhar, alfo in the Lie of Sky. This family is reckoned by 
fome the moft ancient of the name of Campbell. The late 
laird of Macfarlane, vyho, with great genius and afllduity, 
had ftudied the ancient hiftory of the Highlands, was of this 
opinion. The -patronymic name of this family was Mac- 
artbur, (the fon of Arthur), which Arthur,, the antiqua- 
ry mentioned above, maintained, was brother to Colin, 
the firft of the Argyle family, and that the reprefentatives 
of the two brothers continued for a long time to be known 
by the names of Macarthur and Maccaillein, before they 
took the furname of Campbell. Another account makes 
Arthur the firft laird of Strachur, to have defcended of 
the family of Argyle, at a later period, in which the pre- 
fent laird feems to acouiefce, by taking, with a mark of ca- 

detry,

detry, the arms and livery of the family of Argyle, after 
they had been quartered with thofe of Lorn. The laird of 
Strachur has been always accounted, according to the cu~ 
from of the Highlands, chief of the Clan Artuir, (the Mac- 
arthurs), who, like other clans, followed their chief in pre- 
datory and warlike excurfions, and whom he patronifed 
and fupported. Since the abolition of the jurifdi&amp;ion, this 
fyftem is exploded, and in a Ihort time the exiftence of ir 
will be totally forgotten. When the General fucceeded to 
the eftate of Strachur, the family-houfe was but fmall and 
incommodioufly fituated. He pitched on a large plain, on 
the borders of Lochfine, inclofed and furrounded it with 
planting. He formed his garden, confifting of 2 acres of 
ground, and fenced it with a high wall. It is now well 
Hocked, and in excellent order. He has built an elegant 
large houfe, and a very complete court of offices, which, 
perhaps, exceed the proportion they mould bear to the 
houfe. He has formed fome beautiful walks through his 
inclofures, particularly on the banks of a fmall river, which 
runs through his pleafure- grounds. He is going on with the 
Engliffi method of farming, principally with a view to raife 
a fufficiency of green crops, which alone fuit this climate. He 
has called his place Strachur-park ; it is now a very great 
ornament to this part of the Highlands. It is only about 20 
years fince he began, and it is almoft complete. It appears to 
the greateft advantage, viewed from the road that is 
carried down the oppofite ffiore of Lochfine. A large ba- 
fon, which is tormed by a curve of Lochfine, lie3 imme- 
diately before the principal front of the houfe. The other 
front commands a view of the whole pleafure grounds, and 
of the neighbouring hills, one of which appears from his 
windows in the figure of a cone of the mod regular ffiape. 
In a bow which projects from the middle of this front, 
there is a drawing-room, having 3 large windows ; oppofit'e 

to 



of Strachur and Stralacblan.

'to one of the windows is the hill above defcribed. There 
is a particular hill oppofite to each of the other windows, 
not altogether of fuch a remarkable fhape, but fufficient to 
attract particular notice. The General's tradefmen, his la- 
bourers, and even his crofters, have their houfes built of 
itone and lime with flated roofs ; chefe, an excellent inn, 
and the minilter's houfe and offices, which are clofe to the 
General's houfe, contribute much to enliven the appearance 
of the place. Every thing about it has a new, neat, and 
finifhed look.

Stipend, School, and Poor.— Sir Alexander Campbell of 
Ardkinglafs, Bart, and Donald Maclachlan, Efq; of Mac- 
lachlan, are patrons of the parifh. They prefent to the 
living alternately. The flipends, by an interlocutor of the 
Court of Teinds, 8th December 1790, were appointed to 
be 7 chalders I boll of meal, and L. 231 : 6 : 8 Scots money, 
and that both for ftipend and for furnilhing the commu- 
nion-elements. The glebe coniifts of 15 acres of very bad 
foil. The manfe was built in 1780, and is rather above 
the fize of the generality of clergymens houfes. There are 
2 churches in the parifh, in which the minifter officiates al- 
ternately. One of them is in Strachur, clofe to the manfe ; 
the other is in Stralachlan, 6 miles diftant. — There are 2 
parochial fchools, 1 at each of the parifh churches. The 
falary for both the fchools is only L. 8 : 6 : 4 Sterling. 
90 fchokrs, at an average, attend thefe fchools during the 
winter and fpring quarters. From 40 to 50, in fummer 
and autumn. Reading, writing, arithmetic, and the prin- 
ciples of religion, are taught. There are other 2 fchools in 
the parifh, in diftrifts difcontiguous to the churches. The 
inhabitants of 2 or more farms join and employ a young 
man for teaching their children. They give him board 
and lodging alternately in their houfes, and fuch wages as 

Vol. IV. 4 C they 



57° Statijiieal Account 



they can agree for. At thefe othei fchools, there is aboat 
half the number of fcholars that attend the parochial 
fchools. Till within 10 years, there was a fchool in this 
parifh fupported by the Society for propogating Chriftian 
Knowledge. In giving a fchool to a parilh, the Society 
always appoint the fchoolmafter ; and they make it a con- 
dition, that the parifhioners furnifh him gratis with a fuffi- 
cient houfe, garden, grafs and fodder for a cow, and as ma- 
ny dry peats as he may require. The man whom the So* 
ciety fent laft to this parilh, was lame, old, and infirm, and 
being naturally peevifh, the parifhioners and he could not 
be mutually fatisfied. He died in the fervice. The So- 
ciety did not fend a fucceffor ; and though the minifter of- 
fered repeatedly to apply for one, the people would not 
eonfent to the burdens required by the Society, having for- 
merly found them exceedingly troublefome. As the So- 
ciety now have a handfome fund, it is to be hoped they 
will be more liberal. — The average number of poor in the 
parilh is 20. Each of them get from 10 s. to 15 s. at an 
annual difbribution of the funds. The poor confift of el- 
derly perfons, who, unable to earn a fubfiftence, go about 
and get alms from the inhabitants. If any of them are 
difabled from travelling about, there is a meeting of the 
heritors and feflion called, and fuch of the parifhioners as. 
ehoofe to attend, in order to affefs the parilh for their fup- 
port. Every plough of land pays a certain quantity of 
meal, and this is fent to the poor perfon's place of abode . 
befides, fuch a fum of money is fent out of the funds, as is 
thought fufficient to purchafe any neceffar.y of clothing or 
medicine. The fund at prefent is about L. 120 Sterling; 
which has been made up partly by donations, and partly 
by favings in plentiful years. The collections at the 
church-doors amount annually to about L. 14 Sterling. 
Many plans have been concerted by the Commifiioners 



-of Stracbur and Stralachlan. 571 



xT Supply, and the Synod of Argyle, for preventing beg- 
gars from travelling about without the bounds of their re- 
fpective parifhes ; but the prejudices of the people, in ge- 
neral, have been fuch a bar to thefe plans, that they have 
all proved ineffectual. No fine will prevent fome people 
from giving alms to whoever alks it for the love of God. 
Though the mailer of a family mould give ftridt orders a- 
gainft it, his orders will not be obeyed. The beggars take 
advantage of this prejudice, fome from neceflity, others 
from idle habits, will perfift in going about. It is much 
to be wiftied for, that fome criterion could be eftablifhed, 
by which the truly neceffitous could be known. But till 
that is clearly done, would it be proper to difcourage giving 
alms ? Seeing objects of diftrefs, cherifhes humane difpo- 
fitions. Giving daily to the poor, nourifties habits of be- 
nevolence. 

Wages, lie — The price of labour is very high. It has 
rifen very much within thefe 3 years. To this the follow- 
ing caufes have contributed : i. The cotton-manufa£mres, 
the printing and bleaching fields in the neighbourhood of 
Glafgow, have drained this parifli of a number of work- 
men. 2. The herring which have appeared in Lochfine 
and other arms of the fea adjacent, have induced many of 
the beft labourers to become fi/hers, an employment they 
prefer to any work that requires a continued exertion. 
3. The extenfive improvements carried on by General 
Campbell and others, have caufed an uncommon demand 
for labourers. — The wages of a good labourer, from ift 
March to ift October, is is. 2d. a-day, for the reft of the 
year is.; an ordinary labourer has 2d. lefs. The wages 
of a good man fervant, for farm work, when maintained in 
the family, is L. 7 Sterling, and 3 pair of fhoes, worth 12 s : 
Three times as much as it was 40 years ago. A maid fer-

■vant, for common houfehold or farm work, has L. 3 a- 
year, and 2 pairs of (hoes, worth 6s. A labouring man, 
and whofe wife has even a moderate fhare of induftry, can 
maintain a family of 4 or 5 children in a very decent man- 
ner, and give them a fuitable education. There is no in- 
ftance of a labouring man being in indigent circumftances, 
when he and his wife are attentive, and defirous of em- 
ployment. There are few parts of the kingdom where 
this clafs of men has more reafon to be contented with their 
lituation. There being no market contiguous, they lay in 
for their winter provifion the half of a fmall cow or bul- 
lock, weighing from 10 to 12 ftone, Tron weight, or a 
proportionable quantity of mutton, and a ftore of herring. 
This, with potatoes, is their food for half the year. For 
the other half, they live on oat-meal, milk, and fometimes 
freih herring. The potatoes, indeed, generally laft three 
quarters of a-year. Such of them as have a milk cow, 
which mod of them have, gather as much dung as enables 
them to raife a fufficient quantity of this ufeful root. The 
farmers always give them as much land as they can fur- 
nilh manure for. 

Language. — The Gaelic language is univerfally fpoken 
in this parifh. Many of the natives can fpeak no other 
language. The young people, from novelty, go for fer- 
vice to the fouth fide of the Clyde, and learn the dialed! of 
that country. This, with what they learn at fchool, en- 
ables them to underftand the Englifh language, and, in 
fome meafure, to fpeak it ; but ftill their mother tongue- 
is much more familiar to them. In their common conver- 
fation, whichever language they attempt, there is a mix- 
ture of the idioms and phrafes of both. Let fuch as have 
a partiality for the Gaelic, commit it to writing, whilft 
yet its purity may be traced, and it will always afford plea- 



of Strachur and Stralachlan. 573 



fure to the learned, to fludy a language fo nervous, fo ori- 
ginal, and fo well calculated to defcribe the cuftoms, man- 
ners, and amufements of a people who, for fo long a time, 
have withftood every kind of innovation. 

Difadvantages. — The greateft difadvantage this parifti 
labours under, is the difficulty and expenfe of procuring 
fuel. In general, peats are ufed. Thefe are only got on 
the tops of the hills. The fteepnefs of the hills renders 
the leading of them very troublefome. If coals could be 
got free of duty, very few peats would be made in the pa- 
rifli. The heritors and principal tackfmen burn coals 
chiefly. The duty on water-born coals is a great grievance 
to all Argylefliire, and a great bar to improvement. There 
is limeftone in this parifli, but the price of coals renders 
the lime fo dear, that, as yet, it is little ufed in agricul- 
ture. The above grievance is felt the more, that in the 
neighbouring parifhes of Lochgoilhead and Dunoon, they 
get coals free of duty, being lituated on the fide of the 
Clyde, and within the limits of the frith. 

Advantages. — The advantage of being fo nigh the Clyde, 
this parifh enjoys in common with all the diftri&amp;of Cowal; 
butchers, from Greenock and Glafgow, come to the feve- 
ral farms to buy the cattle. The farmers have eafy accefe 
to Greenock, where they have a ready market for what- 
ever they have to difpofe of, and where they can procure, 
and eafily get home, whatever they may want for the ufe 
of their families. The herring which frequent Lochfine, 
are no doubt a great advantage to this diftricl. A clear 
gain, amounting fome years to L. 500 or L. 600 Sterling, a- 
rifes from that filhery. But the filhing, efpecially when 
fuccefsful, has a great tendency to produce habits of idle- 
nets among the people. The method of catching herring 

purfued 



S74 



Statiftical Account 



purfued in Lochfine, requires only occafional exertions •, for 
two-thirds of their time the fiftiers have nothing to do. 
The fmall tenants who follow the fifliing cannot pay pro- 
per attention to their farms. The fifliing generally begins 
in the month of July, and continues till Chriftmas. Each 
boat has 4 men. Each man furnifties his quota of nets and 
fifliing apparatus. The owner of the boat gets a fifth part 
of the clear profits, which varies greatly, even when the 
fiihing anfwers beft. In one boat, each man's fliare of clear 
gain is from L. 12 to L. 15 Sterling, whilft in another the 
mare does not amount to a fixth part of that fum. The 
fuccefsful and unfuccefsful are, however, difpofed to try it 
next feafon ; the former, trufting to a continuation of his 
good luck ; the latter, in hopes of better fortune. In the 
year 1788, 27 boats, and 108 men, from this parifli, were 
employed. Since that period, the herring have not ap- 
peared in fuch quantities as to induce the people to make a 
bufinefe of the fifliing. This fifliing has given the people a 
relifli for feafaring. When difappointed of the fifliing at 
home, a number of the } r oung men go as hands on board 
the fmacks which are fent annually from the Clyde to fifh 
among the weitern ifles. A few of thefe continue failors, 
and are employed in larger veflels that fail on diftant 
voyages. 

Change produced by Sheep-Stocks. — Within thefe laft 30 
years, efpecially lince flieep-ftocks have been introduced, it 
is remarked, that a number of people from this diftrift 
have become failors ; but it appears, that neceflity, and not 
choice, has been the caufe. By joining together 2, 3, or 
more farms, and converting them into a flieep-walk, 12 or 
16 tenants, with their families, were thrown out of their 
ufual line of employment. The fea opened its arms to the 
young and a&amp;ive. Such of the elderly men as could la- 
bour,

hour, took cottaries, and wrought for hire. Many whole 
families emigrated to the manufacturing towns, where a 
change of climate and diet Ihortened the days of the old, 
and enervated the young. From the era of introducing 
iheep-ftocks, a very great change is obfervable in the dif- 
pofitions of the people. Till then, they ftiewed no predi- 
lection for a feafaring life. Till then, their fentiments 
were generally warlike. Round every fire-fide, the enter- 
tainment of the evening was rehearfing tales of former 
times, the actions of brave men, the warlike feats of their 
anceftors. By fuch converfation, the young mind, fired 
with the fpirit of great examples, eagerly panted after an 
opportunity of being fignalized, by furmounting difficul- 
ties, by encountering dangers. Attachment to the chief, 
and a jealoufy of his honour, were reckoned primary vir- 
tues. Thefe were inculcated at an early period of life, they 
were ftrengthened by habit, they prevailed univerfally, 
When the chief, or any of his family flepped forward t* 
ferve in the army, all the young men readily followed him, 
as their fathers had done on fimilar occafions *. — The di- 
ftridf is now thinned of its inhabitants. The people have 
been forced _to leave their native hills. Such as have 
gone have changed their manners, and the old fpirit of the 

Highlander 

* Inftances of this are well remembered, when- the 426 regiment wa» 
firft railed, and particularly when the Heirs of Ardkinglafs and Strachur 
were appointed officers iri Lord Loudon's regiment in 1745. Though it 
was not then the mode to make the officers commiffions depend upon rai- 
ling a certain quota of men, yet the two young gentlemen got moft of 
their company, who followed them as volunteers, from their paternal 
eftates. How different the fentimenrs of the people in 1778 ! When it 
was propofed to raife a Weftern Fencible Regiment, the gentlemen of 
Argylefhire engaged to furnifh a certain number of men ; but though the 
men had an exprefs promife from Government, that they fhould not be 
called out of the kingdom, nor even into England, excepting in cafe of 
an invafion, the heritors were obliged to bribe them high.

Highlander is extinguiflied in thofe that remain. The 
ftieep have baniflied the men. Where, in 12 or 16 fami- 
lies, a hardy race was reared, ever ready to repel an ene- 
my, and gain glory to their country, an opulent tackfman, 
with a ftiepherd or two, occupy the lands. Their conver- 
fation is not of former times. New plans of tending their 
fheep, and improving their wool, occupy their thoughts, 
and engage their attention. In ftiort, the character of the 
Highlanders will foon be forgot. To know what it was, 
recourfe muft be had to Sir John Dalrymple's Memoirs, at 
his entering on the tranfa&amp;ions of Lord Dundee •, or to the 
Sketch drawn of it by the Abbe Raynal, in fpeaking of 
the fettlers in North Carolina. And who can read thefe, 
without regretting that he has no opportunit}', in his own 
country, of feeing the originals ? The Highlanders of old 
did not live either in plenty or in elegance, yet they were 
happy. They piqued themfelves on their capacity of en- 
during hunger and fatigue. They were paffionately fond of 
'mufic and of poetry. The fong and the dance foon made 
them forget their toils. The found of the bagpipe is now 
feldom heard. With the modes of life that nourifhed it, 
the vein for poetry has alfo difappeared. The deer have 
fled from the mountains. A foreft, in the clofe neighbour- 
hood of this parifh, where feveral hundreds of them roam- 
ed at pleafure, is now converted into a fheep-walk. 

Villages. — A military fpirit prevails much among the 
gentlemen of this country ; they would wilh to keep the 
men ; but their lands give fo much more rent by flocking 
them with Iheep, that they cannot withftand the gain. 
The numbers who emigrate yearly to th fouth of Scot- 
land, and to foreign countries, is matter of ferious regret to 
every perfon interefted in the Highlands. To prevent this 
evil, filhing villages are building on the north-weft coaft;

and liberal contributions have been made for encouraging 
people to fettle in them. This plan, however, does not 
promife fuccefs. It is upon too extenfive a fcale. The 
ftrong local attachment of the Highlanders has not been at- 
tended to. By the plan of thefe villages, they will be at 
too great a diftance from each other. It is expefted that 
people will come to them for 60 miles round or upwards. 
This will not take place. If a Highlander is forced or in- 
duced to leave the fmall circle which occupied his firft af- 
fections, he cares not how far he goes from home. Going 
to another parifli, or to the diftricl of another clan, is to 
him entire baniftiment ; and when he has refolved to fet 
out, whether from neceffity or choice, he would as foon 
crofs the Atlantic as he would crofs an arm of the fea. It 
is only an immediate and a very clear advantage that would 
induce him to ftop. The fiftring villages have not this to 
offer. It is only in the courfe of a feries of years, that the 
fettlers have a profpeft of being comfortable. To keep 
the people from emigrating, villages muft be frequent, their 
prejudices muft be attended to, and encouragement held out 
to them to fettle in the clofe neighbourhood of their origi- 
nal homes ; and here it will be found that very moderate 
advantages will fatisfy them. 

Hint for Improvements.— When 3 or 4 farms are thrown 
into one pofleflion, and converted into a iheep-walk, and 
of courfe a number of families obliged to remove, let a 
farm in the neighbourhood be pitched upon, where fuel is 
convenient, where part of the lands is arable, and where 
there is a track of ground capable of cultivation ; let it be 
inclofed, and fubdivided; let houfes be built, and the 
people will flock to it. They cannot at firft pay much 
rent; but by degrees, as they improve the land, and get in- 
to the way of other employments, they will be enabled

fully to indemnify the landlord for his expenses. Where 
fuch a lituation can be had on the fea-coaft, the village 
will do well. The landlord ought to encourage fome ma- 
nufacture of wool or cotton, to furnifh employment for the 
wives and children of the villagers. If this plan were fol- 
lowed, emigration would never be thought of, the popula- 
tion of the Highlands would be found not to decreafe 5 
ufeful hands would be got at a call, for every kind of la- 
bour ; fervants got at moderate rates, for the purpofes of 
agriculture or tending flocks; and what remains "of the fpi- 
rit and manners of the ancient Highlanders, for a length of 
time, be preferved. — Mr Maclachlan has begun a village on 
his property in this parifh. It promifes exceedingly well. 
It is from his plan, and its fuccefsful appearance, that the 
above hints are fuggefted. — If the fums to be expended on 
the fifhing villages, were diftributed in premiums to the 
heritors in the Highlands, for building villages, in propor- 
tion to the number of people fupported in each, every pur- 
pofe propofed by the Society, who have begun the fifhing 
villages, would be effe&amp;ually anfwered. The State would 
be ftrengthened by fea and by land. Ought not the State, 
to encourage this fcheme ?

<p>APPENDIX. 

'"T^HE following particulars refpe&amp;ing the parifli of Kil- 
Malcolm, (No. XXXVI.) were tranfmitted by the 
Minifter fince the account was printed. (See page 374.) 

Name. — It is fuppofed by fome, that thi name of this 
parilh is compounded of the Gaelic word Kil, which figni- 
fies a burying ground, and the name Malcolm, and confe- 
quently that it was the burial place, of fome diftinguiftied 
perfon of that name, in former times. 

Improvements. — The moft remarkable piece of improve- 
ment in this parifh is by Dr Mollefon of Port-Glafgow, on 
the farm of Bradefield, in the eftate of Finlayfon and neigh- 
bourhood of Port-Glafgow. Upon this farm he has built an 
elegant houfe, from which there is a beautiful profpect of 
the Clyde, the town and fhire of Dumbarton, an extenfive 
view of Argylefhire, the high road leading from Glafgow 
to Greenock, the towns and harbours of Greenock and 
Port-Glafgow, &amp;c. He has judicioufly fubdivided and in- 
clofed the lands, with thorn hedges, and belts of planting. 
Though of a mallow foil, it now yields plentiful crops of 
oats, barley, beans and grafs of various kinds. His garden 
produces the plants and flowers common in the climate ; 
and he raifes many from foreign countries, which are ufeful 
in the line of his profeffion. Thefe improvements do much 
honour to his judgment and tafte. The lands were in a 
#ate of nature within thefe 30 years.
