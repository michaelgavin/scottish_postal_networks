PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1002124">LANARK</name>. 

[County, and presbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glas 

govo and Ayr.^) 

By Mr. WILLIAM LOCKHART of Earonald.</head> 



<p>Sitnatun, Extent, and Surface. 

THIS Parifh is situated in the {hire and presbytery of 
Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr ; is between 4 
and 5 miles in length stretching along the Eastern bsnk. 
of the Clyde, and about three in breadth. Th; genera- 
lity of the parifh consists of pretty fiat and improvable 
land 5 but along the Clyde from Bonniton-hll down- 
wards for the space of more than 3 miles, the banks are 
high, precipitous, and rocky, which however are pretty 
generally fringed with natural wood and planting. The 

banks

banks of the Moufs, the only other river of any size, 
and which running from East to West, separates the 
parifli into two distinct parts, are equally precipitous 
and rocky, but also clothed with natural wood, and 
plantations of forest trees. 

The highest ground in the parifh, for there is no hill, 
is Lanark and Lee moors, both being pretty equal in 
height, and about 760 feet above sea level. The town 
of Lanark itself is 6j6 feet 5 inches above the quay at the 
new bridge of Glasgow. 

The parifh may contain above 6000 acres. There are 
probably upwards of 600 acres of coppice wood and plan- 
tations, and 1800 acres of moor ground, which leaves a- 
bout 3600 acres iot cultivation. The moory grounds, 
which also contain some little mofs, belong to two differ- 
ent proprietors. Lanark moor, consisting of about 1500 
acres, is the property of the community : and Lee-moor 
consisting of about 300 acres belongs to the estate of Lee. 
About jo years ago the magistrates, of Lanark, let to the 
inhabitants of the burgh oa leases of 57 years, several 
small lots, at the extremity of their moor or common, at 
from 6d. to is. 8d. per acre, with the view of getting 
them inclosed and improven; but the distance from town, 
about two miles, and other circumstances, prevented 
much improvement from being made upon them I such 
lots however as were situated nighest the town, and have 
been kept fencible, now let from 10s. to 20s. per acre. 
About 20 years ago, the town planted about 60 acres of 
this moor, mostly with Scots pines, which are in a very 
thriving condition ; and their seeds, scattered by the wind 
have of late produced a natural and extensive crop of 
young pines in the moor. 

William Honeyman of Groemsay Esq. Advocate, has 
lately feued from the magistrates between 2 and 300 acres 

«f 



of Lanark.

of this moor at 5s. per acre ; and has begun to plant' , 
and improve it, so that what formerly afforded a small 
pittance to a few half-starved cattle, will soon be enabled 
to maintain families. The expences he has been at are al- 
ready very considerable, but do not intimidate him from 
being still willing to pofsefs and improve more of it, 
which although beneficial to the manufactures of Lanark, 
and to the nation at large, is opposed by a few burgefses, 
who say that they have an immemorial right of servitude 
upon this moor for the pasturage of a certain number of 
cattle, and for fuel, feal, and divot ; and therefore, that 
it cannot be disposed of without being liable to such bur- 
dens, — as to which vident jurisconsult! ; but it must be 
matter of great regret to every well-wilher of his country 
to see so great an extent of improvable ground in the 
neighbourhood of a populous and manufacturing town, 
abandoned to heath and bent-grafs. 

Lee-moorj isin the like rude and uncultivated state, al- 
though equally improvable, and much nearer to coal and 
lime, than the former. This however is the fault of 
the proprietor, or rather owing to that bane of all 
improvement, an entailed estate *. It is considerably 

lefs, 

* He has planted about 80 acres with Scots pine, larch, beech, ash, Sec: 

\ In travelling through Scotland, whenever the stranger meets with any 
1 irge portion of improvable land in a state of nature, he may rest satis- 
fied that the ground is either under a strict entail, or that the proprietor has 
an overgrown estate. In (hort the fact is so gliring, that for the good of 
society and the nation at large, it were to be wifhed, that some measure 
could be thought of either to oblige such proprietors to improve those 
grounds themselves, or to feu or sell them by public roup, at least to let 
them, to people willing to improve them, on such terms as may be fixed by the 
Sfoard 0!' Agriculture lately establiflied. Such a plan would soan bring the 

country

lefs in extent thin Lanark-moor, and thence would re-, 
quire lefs expence to hring it under , tillage : It is to be 
hoped however from the piomising appearance of the 
young proprietor, that it will boon be brought into a state 
of cultivation and improvement. 

Tile South and East parts of the parifh, excepting the 
burrow lands, which consist of a rich loam, are iu gene- 
ral inclined to be li^ht and gravelly. The estates of Lee, 
Cleghqrnj Jerviswood, the Namphlars, and the rest of 
the parifn, consist of a very improvable clayey soil, a- 
dapfed for wheat, provided there were spirit enough in 
the countrj to promote the erection of a flour mill ; but, 
as at present there is no flour mill nearer than Hamil- 
ton, 12 miles ofF, there is no encouragement towards 
the culture of that profitable and useful crop. 

Minerals. There is no coal in the p;;rim hitherto dis- 
covered ; but in the neighbouring parifhes of Carluke, 
Carmichael, and Lesmahago, there are plenty of coal-pits. 
Coal at Lanark sells in general at about 3s. or 3s. 4d. the 
800 weight : C^nnel coal from Lesmahago parifli, sells, 
somewhat higher, which being of a very bituminous na- 
ture, 

country under cultivation, increase its population and manufactures, prevent 
in some measure emigrations, aril would liave the tendency of always pre- 
serving peace and good order in the country. The greater the number of 
proprietors in a kingdom so much the move numerous will he the trienns and 
supporters of its government, as it increases the number of those who are 
materially interested in its welfare. But whenever the whole lands of a 
kingdom, as was the case in France, are absorbed by a few, it is only these 
few that are more peculiarly interested in it. w. Ifave ; for people, whose 
property is in money or the produce of thci; industry, may leave the king- 
dom at pleasure, a . ioaunot pofsibiy, tafcs that warm interest in the fate of 
the country which the proprietor and colonist, who in some meaeure may 
bs 5?.id to be chained to the soil," must necefsarilj do. 



of Lanark, 



turc, and approaching near to jet, is used by the poorer 
sort of people in place of candle. 

There is little or no freestone in the parim. A quar- 
ry has some time ago been opened in Lee-moar ; 
one lately at the Boaihouses in the S. E. corner of the 
parilh; and a coarse kind of freestone is to be had upon 
the Monfs on the Jervisvvood estate, but hitherto has been 
discovered no where else. Limestone is wrought in Lce- 
mcorand Kilncr.dzow on the holders of theparifh, in con- 
siderable quaatities ; and underneath it, is generally 
found a thir seam o T " coal, often sufficient to burn what is 
dug out, into lime. The rocks in the parifh consist ge- 
nerally of a brown :(h micaceous moor stone, which splits 
and breaks into thin pieces unfit for any thing but ruble 
work. Clay fit either for bricks or pottery work, may 
be h,ad in several parts of the parifh. 

The only appearance of mines is in Jerviswood 
grounds, where there has lately been discovered a thic&amp; 
seamj of quartz, bafseting out to the day, intermixed 
with small veins of rich iron ore, but, as such, by no 
means worth the working. As however lead mines fre- 
quently put on similar appearances at the top, there is 
r.o saying what may be discovered on going a little deep- 
er Pieces of very preity jasper have been picked up, 
in the bed of the Moufs, in detached and water-worn no- 
dules ; as also great plenty of ochres, but no iron stone 
excepting about the coal pits at Gillfooton the fkirts of 
the parifn. Close by the old bridge of Lanark have been 
found in a detached and water- worn piece of limestone, 
petrified pholudes and cockle fbclls ; which bridge, by 
general Roy's measurement, is 36 1 feet 5 inches above 
the quay at the new bridge of Glasgow, and 24 miles 
distant from it, 

Etymology 



Statistical account 



Etymology, Language, and Antiquities. The Damnii of 
Ptolomy among other counties, most certainly pofsefsed all 
Lanarkfliire. Ptolomy however makes no mention of the 
; word Lanark, or any of a similar sound. Baxter, with 

others, have deemed Lanark to be the Ugrulentum of the 
anonymous geographer of Ravenna, and not without some 
degree of probability. Baxter's derivation however of Ug- 
rulentum from the Welfh uger lent, which as he says, sig- 
nifies ripa humidi, vel aquce, is totally inapplicable to the 
situation of Lanark, it being situated an a dry and elevat- 
ed situation, 292 feet 1 inch above the level of the 
Clyde. He is equally unhappy in his etymology of Lan- 
ark, which he derives from Lan cerig, i. e. ripa fluminis, 
this town not being situated within view of the river, nor 
upon its immediate bank, but about half a mile from 
it.* 

It is true we have a late author, (Mr Pinkerton) who 
defends the fabulous kingdom of the Stratclyde Bri-. 
tons of Lanarkfliire, and the Welih derivation of 
Lanark ; but he, in aid of his hypothesis is obliged to 
resort to afsertions tptally void of foundation. Thus he 

tells, 

* jfone s in his origin of language arid nations, (a whimsical book,) says, 
that Lanark, " is the same as the Welfh Lanerch, an upper or higher yard or 
" inclosure", which is hardly so improbable as the other. Indeed in the 
"VVellh language we find many etymons such z^Llanetch, a green or a b.ire 
place in a wood ; and Lanherch, a forest, as Lluyd tells us. Lanerch is ac- 
' tually the name of a town on the Clwyd in Wales : and Lan in Welfh as in 
Gaelic, signifies a church, churchyard, or inclosure. ' But the same Lluyd 
in his Welfh preface to the Archealogia tells us, and proves it pretty clear- 
ly, that a very great many of the names of places in Wales itself, can only 
be derived from the Gaelic, the Gael being the original inhabitants of Great 
Britain as well as of continental Gaul, which is farther proved by the tracts 
publiflied in 1737, by Mr Malcolme, minister ot Duddingston, and ot late 
by the two Mefsrs. M'Phersons, so that the etymology of Lanark falls rathe? 
i , tp be sought for in the Gaelic than Welfli.

fells us,* that, " In Clydesdale at present if you will 
" afk the common people about any ancient castle or th6 
" like, they will tell it was erected by the Brett or the; 
" Piks." Now although they ascribe some of their an- 
cient buildings, such as the high church of Glasgow, to the 
Picts, or Peghs, as they call them, yet it is matter of noto- 
riety that the word Bret is utterly unknown to the com- 
mon people of Clydesdale. This he has advanced merely 
for thepurpoe of supporting a favourite system, and to 
mislead in the same way that he, in a former publication, 
had averred that scraps of the second part of his own Har- 
dj-knute were sung immemorially by the common people 
of Clydesdale. Mr Pinkerton also avers that the lan- 
guage of this part of Scotland still retains something of 
the Welfh accent. This is equally groundlefs, nor can 
he point out one single instance of it ; and although nu- 
merous words used in the county are Gaelic, yet none 
are Wellh, unlefs in common with the Gaelic. 

Indeed Mr Pinkerton in his edition of the Vita Sancto- 
rum Scotice, furnifhes us himself uith evident proofs of the 
fallacy of his own averments. In the life of St. Kenti- 
gern or St. Mungo of Glasgow, who flouriflied in 580, 
collected from an old copy in Gaelic, and another in Latin 
by Josceline, about anno 11 80, we learn, cap. 4, that 
this Saint was called *' Kyentyren quod interpretatur 
" capitalis Dominus" which is pure G.ielic at this day ; 
and not Welch. His other name of Munghu " quod 
" (says Josceline) Latine dicitur earns amicus," is not 
Wellh but more probably Gaelic; thus Eun caomb may 
have been spelt Mung hu, the Gaelic pronounceation being 
pretty similar, the literal signification of which is Dear 

bird

fo'rd ; and dear bird, or my bird, is still used familiarly 
to a young friend or youth, which K'-ntigern was when he 
received that epithet from St Servaniis the PictiJJj Abbot 
of Cuirofs. In cap. xi. we learn that Glasgow, formerly 
Cuthurcs, was in the Saint's time, from the monastery 
therein situated, called " Deschu, quod interpretatur 
*' cara familia." Neither is this W-!lh: — Bur the Gae- 
lic words Paisde caomb, i. e. dear children or family, have 
nearly in that language the sound of, and may have been 
spelt Deschu, in that early age, in the same way that Des- 
chu is now pronounced and spelt Glasgow. And in cap. 
xxii. we learn that the Burn, a Gaelic word usf-d i:i iiiis 
county for rirulct, and at present called Mdcndinar, 
that runs by the High Church of Gla-gow ai;d behind 
the College garden, was called Moliendcnor in the Sunt's 
time. Now muilean is a miil in Gaelic, and domhar 
signifies water; from which it is evident, that the lan- 
guage of Glasgow in Kentigern's time, was not Wclfh, 
but pure Gaelic ; and that at this early period the Mo- 
lendinor burn, as it now does, drove a mill.* 

Such 

* Wc (hall, iu farther proof, and to illustrate the language of this parifh

Such being the case, and as in Lanarkftnre there are no 
Welsh words in use, except such as are in common with 
the Gaelic, Ave may venture to affirm that the Stratclyde 
kingdom of Cumbric Britons is a mere dream ; and that 
to derive our proper names from the Cumbric is idle. 
Indeed we cannot resort to the WelGi language for the 
etymon of Lanark, seeing we have a Lanark in Stirling- 
fhire, where no Cumbric Britons were ever settled ; and a 
Drum-Lanark and Lanarkland in Dumfriesftiire, also 
without the bounds of the fabulous Stratclyde kingdom. 

Lanark, or as locally pronounced Lunerick, or Lande- 
rick, is therefore more probably Gaelic. Lan, in Shaw's 
dictionary, signifies land, a house, repository, or a 
church. Learc is the Gaelic for the Billberry, or Blae- 
berry, so common on high and dry grounds. Landerick t 
or Lan na dearca, appears therefore to denote the land, 
house, repository, or church of the Billberries. Lan 
dearcach signifies also Billberry land or repository, pretty 
descriptive of all the Lanarks. But farther, Lan arc 
signifies a full ark, or granary, and Lanark is spelt Lan- 
arc in the old charters, so Lan arc may be the true ety- 
mon, These etymons, though probable, may not be 
just, yet are lefs liable to objection than any former one ; 
nor would we have dwelt so long upon this article, had 
we not wilhed to remove the mist attempted to be 
thrown, by the author above-mentioned, over the histo- 
ry of Clydesdale. 

All the other names of the parifii are Anglo-saxon, un-

and Cleghorn ; which last place may have been the Crou- 
cmdum of Baxter's Glofsarium Antiquitat. Brit, as not 
only the Roman road pafses by it, but the remains of 
a Roman station arc still evident in one of the parks to the 
East of Cleghorn house. 

The Station or camp at Cleghorn, General Roy thinks 
was the work of Agricola. It measures 600 yards in 
length by 420 in breadth, capable of containing two Ro- 
man legions mi the Polybian establishment, or 13,500 
men ; or it would hold one legion with its auxiliaries on a 
much higher establiGiment. Near the S. W. angle of 
this camp, there is a small post or redoubt, that seems 
either to have joined to the camp itself, or to have been 
connected with it by means of a line. 

On the opposite side of the Moufs from Cleghorn, and 
in Lanark-moor, was situated another small exploratory 
camp of the Romans ; and, within about a mile of it 
there is another of a later construction at Castle-dykes, in 
the parilh of Carstairs, through which runs the great 
Roman road from Lugballum, or Carlisle, to the wall of 
Antoninus.* The Roman road from Castle-dykes runs 
through part of L mark-moor, thence pafses the river 
Moufs a little to the Eastward of Cleghorn-bridge, hence 
it goes through the inclosures of Cleghorn, leaving A- 
gricola's camp on the right, and so on by Colly-law, Kill-

* General Roytells us that near the kirk of Carstairs some remains of a bath 
and other antiquities have been found ; so that Carstairs may be the Corda of 
Ptolemy ; and the Castledykes the Coriotitar of the Geographer of Ravenna. 
At the latter place Roman bricks and coins have frequently been dug up. 
The late Sir George Lockhart was pofsefsed of some of those coins, particu- 
larly a beautiful silver one of Nero's ; and within these few years a consi- 
derable number, mostly of Adrian, were discovered, the bulk of which 
I believe are now with the Antiqur.rian Society. One cf them is in my

cadzow, Coldstream and Zuilfhields, to B?.lstane near 
Carluke, bearing the name of Watling-street, or rather 
Biggar. road ; and from thence to the wall. 

About a mile North of Lanark, and upon the very 
brink of Cartlane rocks., on the North of the Moufs, are 
the vestiges of an old stronghold, called by some Castle- 
dykes, and by others the castle of the ghiaw. Perhaps 
from the Gaelic Uaidh, a cave, in allusion to the caves 
or strange artificial archways afterwards to be noticed. 
There aie still evident traces of a wide, or rather a 
double ditch on the land side, which incloses about half 
a rood of ground, and on the side next to the river is a 
precipice upwards of 200 feet of perpendicular height. 
The well was very evident about 40 years ago!, but 
is since filled up. There are at present no remains of 
any building, excepting some slight traces like a foun- 
dation, and some artificial caves or arched ways of a 
very singular construction : one of them, which I 
saw opened, was about 7 or 8 feet in length, and 4 feet 
wide, running in a bending direction towards the center 
of the inclosure from the brink of the rock; the height 
about 3 a feet. This archway was composed of huge 
blocks of freestone, rude and unpcli&amp;ed, intermixt witfe 
the common moorstone of the country. It was not 
arched at top ; but the stones laid horizontally one above 
another, still approaching nearer and nearer, till the sides 
formed a junction, and united at the top. In the bottom of 
the archway was a fat black earth intermixed witht some 
bones in the state of afhes. Several other archways, or holes 
like the above, running in different directions, still exist, 
although not hitherto explored. The most remarkable 
thing attending these vestiges is, that no lime or mortar, 
nor the smallest appearance of lime rubbifti is to be found 

among

among the ruins ; so must have been erected before the 
introduction of mortar by the Romans. 

Arthur's Oven, a Roman work, was no doubt built 
without mortar; but this castle, if a heap of narrow arch- 
ways can be called so, seems by no means a Roman work, 
as no tool, nor the smallest art, has been used upon the 
freestone employed in it. I see by the Statistical Account, 
that subterraneous buildings of a similar kind have been 
discovered in the parifties of Applecrofs (vol. iii. p. 378.) 
and Tealing (vol. iv, p. roi.); and as last autumn, 
there was discovered inLesmahago parifh, near the fall of 
Stonebyres, at a place called Cairny Castle, similar arch- 
ways, in which were found two querns, or hand-mills for 
grinding corn, amongst deers horns and bones of animals, 
I am led to believe that those archways and subterraneous 
pafsages were the temporary abodes of the ancient Bri- 
tons ; that no stone building was erected above them, but, 
if any, only temporary wooden huts, from which, in 
case of being set on fire by an enemy, the inhabitants 
might escape through the subteranneous pafsages, or 
secure themselves in them by covering their narrow 
mouths with stones. Indeed it would seem that Gildas 
had such strange and fox-like habitations in his eye, 
when he wrote of the third vastation of the Scots and 
Picts, (anno 448.) as he brings them, " De arctifsi- 
" mis foraminum caver nicuiis, fusci, vermiculorum, cu- 
" nei, &amp;c*

* The next piece of antiquity is the Castlehill, clofs by, and on the S. 
W. side of Lanark. It has the appearance of an artificial mount; and per- 
haps was originally fortified by the Romans, as General Roy makes mention 
»f a fine silver Faustina that was found here. Upon this hill there former- 
ly stood a castle, which tradition ascribes to David I. The charter by Wil- 
liam the Lion in favour of the town of Ayr, is dated from this castle, or at 

Lanark,

It does no t appear when, or by whom, the old parochial 
church of Lanark, now in ruins, which stands about a 
quarter of a mile to the S. E. of the town, was erected. It 
has been an elegant Gothic building of hewn stone, divid- 
ed in the middle, from one end to the other, by a wall sup- 
ported upon pillars, forming 5 or 6 fine arches : and a- 
round it, is the burial ground and cemetery of the town 
and parifh. This church appears from Blind Harry's 
History of Sir William Wallace, to have been the only 
church of the town in his days. Thus ad ami. 1 297, he 
makes mention of Wallace pafsing 

" On from the kirk that was without the town." 
There is a charter, noted in the general Index of charters, 
in the Signet office, " Wiliielmo Clerkson Capellano mo- 
f c derno ad altare gloriosifsimas Virginis Marias, infra 
" ecclesiam parochialem de Lanark." Granted by James 
iv. and dated at Lanark 18th October 1500. 

The monastery of Franciscans, or Grey Friars, founded 
here by Robert I. in 1314, was situated to the West of 
the present parochial church. In the burial ground belong- 
ing to it, still called the Friar's yards, there lately existed a 
beautiful conical hill or tumulus, which has been recently 

taken 

Lanark, anno 1197; and there are still in its neighbourhood places called 
Kingsons know, Kingsons sta/ie, and Kingsons mo/.c, which favour the tradi- 
tion of its having been a royal residence. That it belonged to the crown, 
appears from the negotiation between John Ealiol and Philip of France i» 
1298, where Philip agrees to give his niece, the eldest daughter of the Duke 
of Anjou, in marriage to the son and heir of Baliol : and in security of the 
lady's jointure, which was J500I. sterling a year, Baliol mortgaged his es- 
tates in France, and some of the crown lands in Scotland, viz. the Castle and 
Castellany of Lanark, Kadzow, Maulsley, &amp;c. This castle was frequently 
in the hands of the Englifh during the 13th century, and I have seen several 
coins of'the first Edward that were found here. A bowling green is now 
erected upon the site of the Castle.

number of human bones was discovered, particularly a 
imman scull of a remarkable large size. 

A general chapter of all the Grey-Friars of the king-i 
tlom was held at this monastery i tth July 1490; where 
the Wardens capitulary being afsembled, they confirmed 
an indenture made between the Lady Beatrice Douglas, 
Countefs of Errol, and the Grey-Friars of Dundee, and 
ordered it to be put in execution.* 

There was also in Lanark, a chapel dedicated to St. 
Nicholas, but where situated I do not know. Mention is 
made of it in a charter granted by James IV. " Steph-

About half a mile to the Eastward of the town are the 
ruins of the Hospital of St. Leonard's, probably founded 
by Robert I. In 1393, Sir John Dalzell, a predecefsor of 
the Earl of Carnwath, obtained from Robert III. to him- 
self in liferent, and to Walter Dalzell his son in fee, the 
♦whole revenue belonging to St. Leonard's hospital within

* The. purport of the Indenture, which is dated in 14S2, is as follows : In 
the year preceding the date of the indenture, provisions being very dear, the 
Grey friars of Dundee not having wherewithall to maintain themselves, 
were obliged to pledge their books, cups and utensils. The Countefs com- 
miserating them, gave them 100 1. Scots or £. 3 :6: S Sterling to support 
them in their extremities, and to enable them to repair their monastery ; 
and in return the Friars ob iged themselves and their succefsors to ce- 
lebrate daily at the great altar a mafs, suhmifsa voce, vel cum tiota, which 
mafs was called mifsa Domini pro anima dictae Beatricis (Comitifsse,) ac pro

heirs fliall provide a qualified person to celebrate 3 mafses 
once every seven years for the salvation of Robert III. 
Anabella his Queen, and all their children for ever. 
The ruins of this hospital have lately been dug up and 
plowed. Sorne human bones, carved stones,, and an urn, 
was discovered among them. The Hospital lands now 
belong to the Burrow, and are held by them of the fa- 
mily of Carnwath, for payment of 20 merks annually, 
which, by the charter, is declared to be for the use of 
the poor. 

Agriculture. The land rises from the town in a 
gentle ascent to the East, and consists of a light dry 
soil, upon a gravelly bottom, with a few acres of mofs in 
the common which lyes to the East of the town. 
There is a considerable declivity from the town upon 
the South, West and North, to the rivers of Clyde 
and Moufs, and an acclivity from those rivers. The 
soil here is partly loam upon a rocky bottom, and partly 
clay. 

The Burrow lands consist of above 600 acres of fine 
rich loam, exclusive of the common. These are in ge- 
neral the property of the inhabitants of the burgh, few 
of whom pofsefs more than 2 or 3 acres, are mostly unin- 
closed, and when rented, generally yield from 1 1. to 3 1. 
the acre. Burrow acres sell at from 50 1. to 70 1. the 
acre- Preceding the year 1750, the burrow acres were 
kept in constant tillage, under a rotation of bear, oats and 
pease ; each burgefj kept one or two cows, and some of 
them a horse or two, which pastured promiscuously up- 
on the common in summer, and upon the burrow croft 
stubble in winter. Since that period, potatoes have been 
introduced instead of the pease crop, and have been 

planted 



16 



Statistical account 



planted in great quantities, being reckoned a more bene- 
ficial crop than pease. They are generally planted, 
bout 4 bolls to an acre, with a dibber ; and are three or 
four times hand- hoed during the summer. Each acre pro- 
duces from 60 to 100 bolls Linlithgow barley measure, 
without dung, which is here seldom or never applied to 
the potatoe crop, as they are found to be much drier, and 
supposed more wholesome without it. Many people 
however have observed that the repeated culture of po- 
tatoes is injurious to the soil : and that the burrow lands 
do not now bear such quantities of good oats and barley 
as formerly. 

Some time ago winter herding upon the common was 
adopted here, and since that happy period, clover and rye- 
grafs have been introduced in considerable quantities, 
and the inhabitants now find it more for their advantage to 
leather their cows upon their grafs fields than to send them 
, to the common. An acre of sown teathering grafs has 
been known to let as high as 5I. 

The lands of the out parilh, till within these 3* years, 
were generally let in small farms for 19 years, the rents 
paid in victual, and the labour performed by the tenant 
and his own family. The mode of agriculture was that 
of keeping a few acres adjoining to their houses in con- 
stant tillage, upon which all the dung of the farm was 
laid ; and the outfields were kept alternately for three 
years in oats, and three years in pasture. Each farm kept 
4 horses, and a few milk cows, the produce of which 
was entirely consumed in the family; a few colts and 
young cows were also reared, the sale of which furnifhed 
the farmer with what little money was needed. 

Since that period, the victual rents have been aboliflied, 
and a spirit of industry and improvement has diffused it- 
self over the p:.rifli. About 23 years ago, a few farms 

were 



of Lanark. 



17 



were let in tack for 38 years, with some little encourage- 
ment towards inclosing : Some of these have been inclos- 
ed partly with stone fences, and partly with ditch and 
hedge, and kept in a fencible condition. Dung is now 
applied to the outfields, and a regular rotat on of crops 
carried on over all the farm. The most approved rota- 
tion seems to be oats from lea; a green crop of pease, 
turnips, or potatoes ; barley sown with grafs seeds ; two 
crops of hay, and three in pasture. By this mode the 
dung is equally distributed over all the farm, and the 
land kept in good condition, being dunged once in eight 
years. 

Some years ago, a considerable quantity of oat-meal 
was yearly carried from this pariih to the Glasgow 
market ; but now, since the introduction of cotton ma- 
nufactures, it is all consumed at home ; and frequently 
Irifh meal is sent up from Glasgow to supply the demand 
at the cotton mills ; nor is this parifh any longer able to 
maintain itself. Oat-meal sells generally at a penny a- 
peck higher than either at Edinburgh or Glasgow; a cir- 
cumstance that ought to encourage the agriculture of the 
parifh, and stimulate proprietors in this and the neigh- 
bouring parilhes, to bring their waste and moor grounds 
under cultivation. 

The Scotch plough drawn by 3 or 4 horses ; the com- 
mon harrow of 4 bulls and 20 iron teeth; the roller, and 
single horse carts, are the most general implements of 
husbandry here. A few light ploughs, made in the pariih 
upon Small's model, are also in use ; and two harrows of 
3 bulls each, with long teeth joined together by a hinge in 
the middle, and two chains at the end, are used with ef- 
fect,

feet, in k reducing rough land. They likewise use . two 
light harrows for grafs seeds. Mr Honjman employs 
two oxen and two horses in breaking up his moor 
grounds ; hut no oxen are used any where else in the pa- 
nlh, excepting at Eonniton, although the saving of oats 
ought greatly to encourage them in a parifli where oat- 
meal gives so high a price. 

Lime is in pretty general use as a manure*; where it 
has not been too frequently applied, it producer fine 
crops ; but where the land has been often limed, it is 
found to succeed best when made up into compost dung- 
hills, and "when led out in harvest and laid Upon lea 
grounds, it is attended with great advantage. There is 
some very good marlt: in the estate of Bonniton, but at 
present it is not dug out for sale. 

There is very litrle wheat sown in the parilh, either 
owing to the want of a flour mill, the scarcity of inclo- 
suves, or the high situation of the district. Some years 
ago, several acres were annually sown with flax, which 
yielded from 24 to 40 stones per acre; but the trouble at- 
tending the different operations, and the distance from wa- 
tering places, prevent it from being sown in quan- 
tities ; so that the general crops in use are barley, 
pats, potatoes, pease, and rye grafs and clover. 

Turnips, though a most profitable crop, are by no means 
in common use. "When the old crofts arc laid out in pas- 
ture for milk cows, great quantities of butter and cheese 
are made ; and the produce of each cow, under proper 
management, yields from 4 1. to 61. sterling annually. 

Oats and pease are sown from the first of March 
to the middle of April, potatoes from the middle of A-

pril to the second week of May, and barley from the 
first to the end of May. In common seasons, harvest 
begins about the first of September, and ends about the 
middle of October. Even in the year 1782, there was 
little or none to cut down after the first of November, 
and the crop for the most part was got in. Harvest 1792 
Was almost equally late, and the crop as unproductive. 
The great rains prevented the corns from ripening, oc- 
casioned their running to straw and lodging, by which 
the grain did not fill ; and it was no uncommon thing to 
send two bolls of oats to the mill, and get on!}' one boll 
of meal in return, although in ordinary seasons and in 
ordinary land we have generally boll for boll.* 

Climate and Diseases. This parifli, from its high, dry, 
and airy situation, is perhaps as healthy a one as in Scot- 
land. Being situated in the centre of the island, it is 
equally free from the Eastern fogs and the violence of the 
Western rains, so that the air is always pure and clear. 
The climate, although drier than about Glasgow, or even 
Hamilton, is certainly somewhat wetter than about Edin- 
burgh, but is more than compensated by the absence 
of the Eastern fogs, so disagreeable in the neighbourhood 
of that city. Spiing droughts frequently retard the crops 
very considerably, and sometimes spring frosts. Hea- 
vy rains in Juiy and August, which are pretty common 
here, have a similar effect in keeping back the harvest ; 
but in general the crops are earlier than in the neigh- 
bouring -

bouring pariflies, and even more so than those lying 
much lower and farther down the Clyde. 

In Autumn fevers and fluxes are pretty frequent, which 
hare been imputed to living too much upon potatoes ; 
but there is no disease peculiar to 'he parilh. The in- 
habitants are in general stout and healthy, and it is no 
uncommon thing to meet with people walking about, nay 
even working, at the age of 80. Two or three have died, 
■within these few years, aged above 90 ; one of them, a 
blacksmith, died at the age of 97 ; but I do not at prejent 
recollect of any person who ever reached his hundredth 
year. 

Natural Curiosities, and Romantic Scenery. This pa- 
rifh contains as much curious, romantic, and varied sce- 
nery, as any in Scotland. The falls ot Clyde principally 
interest th'j stranger, and We mall begin with the upper- 
most one, although to come at it, we are obliged to pafs 
the second fall, or Corra Lin. The uppermost one is some- 
what above ih miles from Lanark, and from the estate 
in which it is situated is called the Bonniton Fall or Lin.* 
From Bonniton house, a very neat and elegant modern 
builrfing, you arrive at the Lin, by a most romantic walk 
along the Clyde, leaving the pavilion and Corra Lin upon 
your right hand. At some little distance from the fall, 
the walk, leading to a rock that juts out and overhangs 
the river, brings you all at once within sight of this beauti- 
ful sheet of water ; but no stranger rests satisfied 
■with this view ; he still prefscs onwards along the walk, 
till from the rock immediately above the Lin, he sees the 

whole

•ther than the Gaelic won} Leum, i. e. leap or fall, differently spelt and 
I vonounced. 



of Lanark. 



whole body of the river precipitate itself into the chasm 
below. The rock over which it falls is upwards of i?. 
feet of perpendicular height, from which the Clyde 
makes one precipitate tumble, or leap, into a hollow 
den ; whence some of it again recoils in froth, and smok- 
ing mist. Above, the river exhibits a broad, expanded, 
and placid appearance, beautifully environed with plan- 
tations of forest trees. This appearance is suddenly 
changed at the fall : and, below it, the . river is narrow, 
contracted, and angrily boils and thunders, among rocks 
and precipices. 

The same beautiful and romantic walk conducts you 
back again, along the precipice that overhangs the river, 
both sides of which are environed by mural rocks, equidis- 
tant and regular, forming, as Mr Pennant exprefses it, a 
*' stupenduous natural masonry from whose crevices 
choughs, daws and other wild birds, are incefsantly spring- 
ing. You descend along the river for about half a mile, 
till you arrive at the Corra Lin, so called from an old cas- 
tle and estate upon the opposite bank. The old castle 
of Corraj overhanging a high rock that overlooks the 
fall, with Corra house, and the rocky and woody banks 
of the Clyde, form of themselves a beautiful and grand 
coup d'oeil; but nothing can equal the striking and stu- 
penduous appearance of the fall itself, which when view- 
ed from any of the different seats placed here and there 
along the walks, must fill every unaccustomed beholder 
with awe and astonifnment. The tremenduous rocks a- 
round, the old castle upon the opposite bank, a corn mill 
in the rock below, the furious and impatient stream foam- 
ing over the rock, the horrid chasm and abyfs underneath 
your feet, heightened by the hollow murmur of the wa- 
ter and the screams of wild birds, form zt once a spectacle 

both 



Statistical account 

both tremenduous and pleasing. A summer-house or pa- 
villion is situated, over a high rocky bank, that overlooks 
the Lin, built by Sir James Carnmhael of Bonniton. in 
1708. From its uppermost room it affords a very strik- 
ing prospect of the fall, for all at once, on throwing your 
eyes towards a mirror, on the opposite side of the room 
from the fall, you see the whole tremendous cataract 
pouring as it were upon your head. The Corra Lin, by 
a late measurement, is found to be 84 feet in height. The 
river does not rufh over in one uniform fheet like the 
Bonniton Lin, but in three different, though almost imper- 
ceptible, precipitate leaps. On the southern bank, and 
when the sun mines, a rainbow is perpetually seen form- 
ing itself upon the mist and fogs, arising from the violent 
dafhing of the waters. 

The next curiosity, on descending the Clyde, that at- 
tracts the stranger, is New Lanark, or the cotton mills. 
The situation of this village is at the western extremity 
of the Bonniton ground in a low den, and within view 
of another beautiiul and romantic fall called Dundaff Lin, 
signifying in Gaelic black castle leap ; and no doubt for- 
merlv some fortrefs has been situated hereabouts, al- 
though no traces now remain, excepting in tradition ; 
■which still points out a rock called Wallace's Chair, where 
that patriot is said to have concealed himself from the 
English. This fall is about 3 or 4 feet high, and trouts 
have been observed to spring up and gain the top of it 
with ease. This fall, the village, four lofty cotton mills, 
and their buby mhaFrtants, together with the wild and 
woody scenery around, must attract the notice of every 
stranger. Below these di e the romantic rocks and wo-ds

frankly feued the site of the village and cotton mills to 
the benevolent Mr David Dale, at a very moderate feu- 
duty. 

The next fall of consequence is the Stonebyres Lin, si- 
tuated about 1% miles below the Cojra Lin. It is so cal- 
led from the nrighbouriag estate of Sronebyres, belonging 
to Daniel Vere Esq ; but the grounds adjacent to the 
fall, on both sides of the river, have lately been feued 
or purchased by Mr Dale. This cataract, which is about 
eighty feet in height, is the jie plus ultra of the salmon, as 
none can pofsibly get above it, although their endeavours, 
in the spawning season, are inceLant and amusing. It is 
equally romantic with the others ; and like the Corra Lin, 
has three distinct, but almost precipitate falls. Wild rug- 
ged rocks are equally visible here, and they are equally 
fringed with wood ; the trees however are by no means 
so tall and stately, being composed of coppice wood. Sal- 
mon, pars (samlets,) horse muscle, or the pearl oyster, 
though numerous below, are never seen above this fall. 

The next piece of natural curiosity is Cartlane Craigs, 
upon the river Moufs, which enters Clyde about a mile be- 
low the town of Lanark. This is a curious and romantic 
den, about a quarter of a mile in length, bounded on ei- 
ther side by a reef of lofty precipitous and rugged 
rocks, which are fringed with coppice wood on the 
north side, and with coppice wood and thriving planta- 
tions on the south. The rocky bank on the north 
side is about 400 feet in height, and it is not much 
lower upon the fouth side. Both banks are finely varied 
with the different appearances of rock, wood and preci- 
pice. At the bottom runs the river Moufs, which scarce- 
ly leaves room for the lonely traveller to traverse the 
den; however, here the celebrated botanist, Mr Lightfoot, 

clambered

clambered in search of plants, and discorcred some rare 
and uncommon ones, as may be seen in his Flora Scoticcu 
At every reach of the Moufs, of which there are many, 
the scenery varies, and wherever you ' find a prominent 
rock upon the one side, you are sure to meet with a regular 
recefs on the other. Caverns in the rocks are here and 
there observable, but none of them worthy of any parti- 
cular description. One, still called Wallace's cove, tra- 
dition tells us, was the hiding hole of that patriot. An- 
other equally trifling, but which bears evident marks of 
the chifsel, is said to have been the abode of a hermit in 
former times, but must have been a mise rable habitation, 
hardly afFording room to lye down in. Considerable veins 
of the spatum ponderosum run through these rocks ; but 
no other mineral has hitherto been traced in this dreary deu 
of foxes, badgers and wild birds. It is somewhat singular 
how the Moufs, instead of following its direct course, by 
jBaronald house, where the ground is lower and unob- 
structed by rocks, mould have penetrated the high hill of 
Cartlane, and formed a bed through solid rock. It seems 
presumable that this vast chasm has originally been 
formed by some earthquake, which, rending the rocks, al- 
lowed the water to pafs that way. 

Lakes, orchards, and mineral springs. There is only 
one lake of any consequence in the parifli, which is on 
theBonniton estate, and upon which there is a bleachfield, 
particularly famous for bleaching threed. It is called 
Lang Loch, although hardly 500 feet in length ; and con- 
tains both Pike and Perch. 

There are no Orchards of any consequence excepting a- 
bout Holmfoot, in the lower part of the parifh. Small ones 
have been lately planted at Castlebank, and at Bafonald in 

the 



of Lanark. 25 

the neighbourhood of the town, which thrive tolerably 
well; but in general the fruit does 'lot succeed so well in 
the higher parts of tins parilh, owing to the great eleva- 
tion. Small fruit, however, such as gooseberries, yield 
considerable returns, a'ld I have known some cultivators 
of them draw from 20 1. to 25 L for a crop, independent of 
other vegetables growing amon,f them. Wild fruits are 
here in great abundance, such as crab apples, hazel nuts, 
geens, bird-cherry called here bagberry, rasp-berries, Roe- 
buck-berries, and strawberries, &amp;c. The fruit of the 
bird-cherry, (pru/ius padus~) , or the bark in winter, is an 
excellent astringent, and a specific in Dinrrhceas and flux :sJ 
The disease common to cows in some pastures, called the 
moor-ill, is cured by it, of which I have been afsured by 
an excellent surgeon now deceased. The Rubus Saxaiilis, 
and Rubus thunuemorus, are to be found along the rocks of 
Cleghorn wood, and at Bonniton, by the talis. 

There are no mineral waters in the parifh other tiian 
the common chalybeate springs, which are found almost 
every where in Scotland. 

Roads, Bridges, and Improvements, already made or 
proposed. The distance to Edinburgh is about 30 miles ; 
and a most excellent turnpike road was made some years 
ago to that metropolis. 

The present road to Glasgow, which is 24 miles from 
Lanark, is in bad repair ; and on account of the great 
declivity to the water of Moufs and acclivity from it, it 
has been found expedient ».o change the tract of the road 
altogether ; and instead of crofsing the Moufs, a new one 
is finifhing, that crofses the Clyde at the old bridge of 
Lanark, and from thence runs along the southern banks

of that rircr by Dalscrf and Hamilton to Glasgow. Thi» 
road, which leads through woods and orchards, and 
keeps the Clyde pretty generally in view, bids fair tu be 
the most beautiful one in Scotland ; and were it continued 
sourhcilyas once proposed, by the Howgate mouth to 
Caxhsle, (thereby flionening the present road from Glas- 
gow to that place,) it would be of considerable advantage 
tc L. ;iark, as at present there is no thorough-fare through 
Lanark to any town in Britain. It will however be mat- 
ter of regret, if some attention is not also paid to the old 
road ay Carluke, as it is the ordinary one to coal and 
lime. 

There are two bridges over the Clyde in the parifh. 
The old bridge of Lanark, consisting of 3 arches, was built 
in the end of last century, and is at present strong and suffi- 
cient ; but from the late great weight of earth laid upon the 
abuttment next the town, it is somewhat doubtful whether 
it may not be hurt b) it. The other bridge is the Hynd- 
ford bridge on the high road from Lanark, and from Edin- 
burgh to Ayr. This bridge, consisting of 5 arches, was 
built a few jear« ago, under the direction of Mr Steven, 
and for elegance and simplicity may challenge any bridge 
of its ize in Scotland. There are three bridges over the 
Moufs, Cleghorn bridge, Lockhart-ford bridge, on the 
Carluke road ; a-d Moufs-mill bridge. 

If ever the proposed canal mould take place between 
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and mould the people of Ayr- 
fhire think of a canal to join it, the southerly tract of 
the Glasgow and Edinburgh canal, pointed out by Luci- 
us in the Edinburgh Herald, would be the most accom- 
modating one towards such junction. The Glasgow canal 
wouic enter the parifti trom Carluke ; and pafsing close 
en by Cleghorti, might there be joined by the branch 

from 



of Lanark

from Ayr, which could be carried acrofs the Clyde a 
little above Hyndford bridge, and from thence by Doug- 
las to Ayr. This would not only accommodate the 
thriving manufactures of Lanark, and the Cleugh iron 
works, but, as it would pafs over grounds containing 
coal, lime-stone and iron-stone, would greatly promote 
agriculture and manufactures of every kind ; besides the 
more general advantage arising from the expansion of 
trade from sea to sea. 

Rental and heritors. The valued rent of the parifh 
u L. 4217 : 19 : 10 Scots, and the real rent upwards of 
L. 3000 Sterling. The principal heritors are Charles 
Wifhart Lockhart, of Lee Esq; Allan Lockhart of Cleg- 
horn, esq. Lady Rofs Baillie, and the honourable George 
Baillie of Je rvis-wood. Besides those named, there are 
six or seven lefser heritors, 55 small ones in the out pa- 
rifh, and 98 proprietors of burrow lands. There are 
only about 3 or 4 heritors that are non residents. 

Population. The population of the parifh, as returnee! 
to Dr Webster 1^1755, amounted to 2294 souls. On 
May 15th 1792, the number of examinable persons, i. e. 
all above seven years of age, by the late incumbent's ex- 
amination roll, amounted to 2693, exclusive of New La- 
nark, or the cotton mills, to which when we add one fifth 
more for the children under 7 years of age, we fhall have 
the sum total of 323 1 ; so that the population of the pa- 
rifh including New Lanark will stand as under.

Burgh. — Lanark is an ancient" royal burgh erected 
by Alexander I. whose charter, together with the after 
ones of Robert I. and James V. are confirmed by Charles 
I. 20th February 1632. Lanark is clafsed with Linlithgow 
Selkirk and Pebles, in sending a representative to Parlia- 
ment. The electors consist of the Common-council and 
Deacons of Crafts. The number of counsellors are 17, 
including the Provost, two Bailies and Dean of Guild, 
and there are 7 Deacons of Crafts. The Crafts-men are 
the Smiths, Shoemakers, Wrights, Taylors, Weavers, 
Dyers, and Skinners. The Deacons form a separate bo- 
dy, called the Deacon'i seat; and have no voiee in council, 

except 



of Lanark. 



29 



except in the election of Provost, Bailies, Dean of Guild, 
and delegate for electing a member of Parliament. 

The number of inhabitants amount to 2260 ; among 
whom are the following handicraftsmen, exclusive of 
journeymen and apprentices : 

Smiths, 1 1 Stockingmakers, 60 

Shoemakers, 80 Watchmakers, 2 

Masons and Wrights, 30 Bakers, 5 
Taylors, 1 1 Butchers, 4 

Weavers, 6o Gardiners, 5 

Dyers, 2 Tanners, I 

Skinners, 1 

I do not know the exact number of Merchants or Shop- 
keepers, but there are four Surgeons, seven AttOrnies, 
or writers, and 50 Innkeepers or publicans ! 

The town is delightfully situated upon the slope of a 
rising ground, 292 feet above the level of the Clyde, and 
65b f.et 5 inches, above the quay at the New bridge of 
Glasgow. There are in it, five principal streets, besides 
lanes and clones. The houses formerly were almost all 
of them covered with turf and straw, and the rooms with- 
out ceilings. Since the erection of the Cotton works, 
many houses have been covered with slate, and ceilings 
are now pretty generally in use. In fhort the town has, 
within these two or three years, put on a decent ap- 
pearance. A nent additional Inn has lately been built, 
which was much needed, as the resort of strangers to 
see the falls of Clyde, the Cotton works, &amp;c. is very- 
considerable. 

There is here a very good meal-market; and within 
these two years, a neat market for butcher meat has been 
erected, together with a slaughter house at some consi- 
derable distance from it. The only other market requi- 
site

site for the inhabitants, would be one for garden stuffs, 
•wli.ch might also answer for potatoes, filh and salt. At 
present garden stuffs are only to be bought at the gar- 
dens. As to filh, were a particular market once esta- 
blilhed, such as are peculiar to the place, as salmon, 
trftuts, pikes, perches, and pars, would more readily 
be exposed to sale ; besides it would encourage the sale 
of herrings and other fifth from Glasgow, &amp;.c. 

Church. The church stands in the middle of the town ; 
is a tolerabh' neat modern building ; but no great compli- 
ment can be paid to its steeple. The steeple contains 2 bells, 
the largest has 3 different dates put upon it at the diffe- 
rent refeDndings; the oldest dateis 1 1 10. The church, tho' 
Large is rather inadequate to the eucreasing number of the 
inhabitants, which circumstance in part gave rise to the 
building of a seceding meeting-house within these two 
or three years. This meeting-house has from 90 to 100 
communicants, and the examinable persons will amount 
to one fifth more. The scceders here are a very orderly 
set of men ; and they and their pastor pofsefs more solid 
religion and good sense, than to listen to the wild schemes 
of anarchy and disorder, said to be inculcated by some 
of their sect, in imitation of the atheists of a neighbouring 
kingdom. 

School. The grammar school here has always been in 
great repute; and many gentlemen at the head of the lear- 
ned profefsions have had their education at it. The 
school has two established teachers ; and Engliih, Latin and 
Greek are taught in the same room. The Rector's salary 
is L 16: 13 : 4: and the second master's is L 8. The 
scholars are from 70 to 80. The fees for Engliih are, 
is. 6 d. per quarter, and for Latin 2s. 6d. The pre- 
sent school-house, consisting of two stories, and slated, 

was 



Lanark. 



was built from the munificence of the lare William 
Sinellie, M. D. well known from hia publications on 
the obstetric art, who bequeathed L. 200 towards re- 
building the school-house, and aho left to it his library 
of books, which are kept in the room immediately above 
the school- room. 

Manufactures. There is a considerable manufactory of 
stockings here, between 75 and 80 stocking frames, being 
constantly employed. The workmen's wages in all are a- 
bout L. 35 weekly. This businefs has increased considera- 
bly within these 7 or S years. About 20 years agu, there 
were no more than 5 or 6 frames in the town. 

Previous to the American War, a very great quantity 
of fhoes was manufactured here for exportation, and sent 
to Glasgow weekly, but since that period the demand is 
considerably decreased. 

Fairs. There are at Lanark 7 fairs in the yecr, all of 
them well frequented. Lammas fair is an excellent market 
for lambs and young colts. This fair some time ago sup- 
plied the Highlands with lambs and flieep ; but of late the 
demand from that country is considerably lefsened. Mar- 
tinmas fair is a good market for black cattle, lint, yarn, and 
coarse linnen. 

History. About anno 978, Buchanan informs us that 
Kenneth 11. held an afsembly, or parliament, being the 
first mentioned in history, at Lanark ; a circumstance about 
which Fordun, our oldest author now extant, is silent. 

Anno 1244, Fordun tells us that Lanark among some 
other towns was burnt to the ground, but docs aot men- 
tion the circumstances. 

Anno

Statistical account 



Anno 1297, same author arlds, that Sir William 
Wallace began here his ftrat great military exploit by 
defeating the English sherriff of Lanarkshire, William de 
Hesliope, and putting him to death in this town. Blind 
Harry relates this event at greater length, affixing the 
same date to it. He tells us Wallace having married a 
lady of the name of Braidfoot, the heiref* of Lammington, 
lived with her privately at Lanark ; that while there, 
a scuffle ensued in the street between Wallace and ar few 
friends, and a body of Englishmen. Wallace being over- 
powered, fled first to his own house and from thence made 
his escape to Cartlane Craigs. The sherriff Hesilrig, or 
as Fordun calls him Hesliope, seized upon his wife and 
put her to death. To revenge which, Wallace gathers 
a few friends together, attacks Hesilrig in the night, and 
kills him and 240 Englishmen. Tradition tells us, that 
the house where Wallace resided was at the head of the 
Castlegate opposite the church, where a new house ha^ 
lately been erected. It also acquaints us that a private 
vaulted archway led from this house to Cartlane Craigs, 
but seemingly without the smallest probability. 

Anno 1310 Bruce, finally recovered Lanark from the 
Englifh. 

By act of parliament 2c June 16x7, anent weights and 
measures, the care of the weights was committed to the 
burgh of Lanark ; " In respect that the keeping and out- 
giving of the weights of old to the burrows and others, 
&amp;c. was committed to the burgh of Lanark." Standard 
■weights were transmitted to Lanark from London at the 
union, but whether they exist at present or not is un- 
known*.

Anew nt families and great men. The families of Lee 
and Cleghorn are the most ancient in the parifli. Sir 
William Lockhart of Lee, the great statesman and gene- 
ral under the protector, and Charles II, and who was al- 
so Lord Justice Clerk, was born in this parifh, and hid 
his first rudiments of education in Lanark school. Dr 
William Smellie author of the treatise on midwifery, 
though born in the neighbouring parifh of Lesmahago 
was educated here. The present Lord Justice clerk, 
("Robert M 'Queen of Braxfield,) so justly esteemed for 
his abilities as a lawer and a judge, was born in the pa- 
rifh, and had his education at Lanark school. The late 
learned and ingenious general Roy, received also part 
of his education here, and was born in the neigh- 
bouring praifh of Carluke. William Lithgow the 
noted traveller was born in the parifh, died in it, and 
is buried in the church yard of Lanark, though no 
vestige of his tomb can now be traced.

mon can get above the Stonebyres fall, and are seldom brought to market. 
Trouts ars to be had almost every day, and are pretty reasonable. And ve-

here into bread comes all from Edinburgh or Glasgow, which greatiy en-

Cot fan Mills, and Village 0 /J\ t w Lanark. New Lan- 
ark, where the cotton mills are situated, is about a fhort 
mik. from Lanark; and is die only village in the parifh. 
It is entirely the creation of the enterprizing and well 
known Mr David Bale ; and as it originated with the 
erection of the first cotton mill, we fhali begin our ac- 
count with the mills. 

f. Mills. In 1784, Mr Dale feued the site of the Mills 
an . \ illagc of New Lanark, from the present Lord Jus- 
tice Cierk, with some few acres of ground adjoining. 
This spot of ground was at that period almost a mere 
morals, situated in a hollow den, and 01 difficult accefs,. 
Its only recommer.aaaon was the very powerful command 
of wat.r, ttiat the Clyde could be made to afford it ; in o- 
ther respects, tfte distance from Glasgow and badnefi of 
the roads were rather unfavourable. 

i he first mill was begun 111 April 1785, and a subtera- 
neous pafsage 01 near 100 yards in length, was also tormed 
through a rocky hill lor the purpose of an aqueduct to it*. 
In Summer * 7 b8, a second one was buil., and was nearly 
rooted in, when on the yth of October, that yeai* tne 
first one was totally consumed by accidental fire, but was 
again rebuilt and finithed in 1789, The proprietor his

In march x 7 86, the spinning commenced, and notwith-

the first mill, the manufactory has been in a constant

from an accurate account then taken, it appears there

The second is the only one as yet completely filled, and con- 
tains about 6,000 spindles. The first one which was burned, 
and now rebuilt has only at present 4500 spindles. In the 
third mill, a considerable number of patent jennies are 
now going bywater, being the first of the kind in Great Bri- 
tain : This invention, and for which, a patent, has lately 
been obtained, we owe to the genius and spirited indus-

* This gentleman has also lately discovered a new method of erecting the 
great gear or large machinery of cotton mills, so as to require one fourth of 
Ws water than commonly needed : arid which is also applicable to corn 
mills. This mode is not only lefs expensive but requires lefs trouble than the 
old one. It also has the benevolent tendency of preserving the lives of 
chi'dren and others that may be entangled by the drum or flia't. He has 
hecn honoured with the thanks of the Board of Trustees, with whom he has 
deposited a model of bis impiovcments.

sease to separate appartments: 

The great improvement arising from Mr Kelly's inven- 
tion of Jennies going by water, reduces very considera- 
bly the number of men that formerly were necefsar/ in 
working the common Jennies. Such being the case, 
widows with large families are much wanted here, as chil- 
dr 11 can manage the patent Jennies with great ease, 
while their mothers are employed in other branches. 

Great attention is paid to the morals of children and 
ott ers at these mills, of which the late incumbent was 
perfectly sensible. Large manufactories have sometimes 
bet n considered in another light, but Mr Ddle and all 
concerned, must here have the voice of the public to the 
contrary. Marriages have greatly increased in the pa- 
ri(h since their erection, as the benefits arising from a fa r 
mily are obvious. Indeed the anxiety of the proprietor 
to have proper teachers and instructers for phildren will 
ever redound to his honour.

tor of the mills for the accomodation of his work people

A great proportion of the inhabitants are Highlanders 
mostly trom Caithntfs Inverncfs and Argylcfhire .. Few 
of those from the west underhand Engilh. In 1791 a vef- 
sel carrying emigrants from the isle of Sky to North A- 
irurica, was driven by strefs of weather into Greenock ; 
about 200 were put afhore in a very destitute situation. 
Mr Dale whose humanity is ever awake offered them im- 
mediate employment, which the greater bulk of them ac- 
cepted : And foon after with a view to prevent fai- 
ther emigration to America he notified, to the people of 
Argylefhire and the isle^, the encouragement given to fa. 
milies at the cottonmills ; and undertook to provide hou- 
ses for 2C0 families in the course of the 1792, these were 
all finifhed last summer, (1793) and a considerable num. 
ber of Highlanders have tf late come to reside at New- 
Lanark. 

Families frcm cr.y quarter pefsefsed of a good moral 
character, and having three children fit for work, above 
nine years of age, are received, — supplied with a house 
at a moderate rent, and the women and Children provided 
with work. The children, both those fit for work 
and those who are too young for it, have the privilege 
of attending the school gratis, the former in the evenings 
the latter through the day. Three profefsed teachers are 
paid by Mr Dale for this purpose, and also seven afsi- 
tants who attend in the evenings, one of whom teaches 
writing. There is also a Sunday school at which all the 
master's and afsistants attend.

In New Lanark there is a fmall congregational meeting- 
houfe for thofe of the feci: commonly called Independents. 
The Highlanders have fomctimes, though rarely, beenfavour- 
ed with a fermon in Gaelic, by preachers of the church of 
Scotland : and it has been for fome time in contemplation, to 
creel a church for conftant worfhip in that language, at leaft 
for one half of the day. The Society for Propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge has been applied to for fome affiftance, which 
probably will be granted, feeing the want of public worfhip 
and inltruclion, among fo great a body of people, muft have 
a tendency to hurt the morals of the prefent, as well as to 
difcourage future fettlers from the Highlands, and of confe- 
quence mult promote emigration. 

Before leaving this article of cotton mills, I cannot help 
noticing a circumftance peculiar to fuch manufactures, 
which may afford a ufeful hint to poor widows with families. 
In moft other manufactures, a woman who has a family, 
and becomes a widow, is generally in a moft helplefs fitua- 
tion. Here the cafe is very different, for the greater num- 
ber of children the woman has, fhe lives fo much the 
more comfortably ; and upon fuch account alone, fhe is of- 
ten a tempting object for a fecond hufband. Indeed, at cot- 
ton mills, it often happens, that young children fupport their 
aged parents by their induftry. 

Mr Dale has fet apart, and inclofed a piece of ground clofe 
by the village, for a burying place. 

Character of the People, C5V. The people are, in general, 
indufirious, though not remarkably fo. They are naturally 
generous, hofpitable, and fond of ftrangers, which induces 
them fometimes to make free with the bottle ; but drunken- 
nefs, among the better clafs of inhabitants, is of late rather 
unufual. It is lefs fo among the other inhabitants j but, 
upon the whole, they are a decent and orderly people ; and" 
VoL * XV - F crimes 



4 2 Statijlical Account 

crimes are feldomer committed here, than in any other parim 
of equal population. The author knows of no native who has 
ever been tried for a capital crime. In fhort, they are gene- 
rally honeft, decent, religious, and drift in their attendance 
% on divine worfhip. Perhaps, there may be one or two indivi- 
duals, who, either from ignorance, or, from violence of 
temper, will not liften to the cool voice of reafon, who chime 
in with the ravings of the Friends of the People, as they call 
themfelves ; but the relt, although fome may with for a mo- 
derate reform, have too much religion and found fenfe not 
to fee, that thofe people have neither experience nor know- 
ledge in matters of that nature, and only grafp at feating 
themfelves in power upon the ruins of their country ; nor are 
they fo weak, as not to profit from the example of a neigh- 
bouring kingdom, where Anarchy fits triumphant upon the 
guillotine, with Murder at her back, trampling upon law, 
liberty, and religion, and treading the rights of mankind 
under her feet. 

Ecclejiajlical State. The King is patron of the parifh. 
Lord Douglas is titular of the teinds of the borough 
lands, and Mr Lockhart of Lee and Carnwath of the reft 
of the parifh. The church, being built in 1777, is in very 
good repair. The manfe and office houfes, being erected at 
the late incumbent's entry in 1757, are not in fuch good or- 
der. The manfe, offices, and garden, cover about a rood of 
ground. The glebe is fcrimply 4 acres ; but the incumbent 
is entitled to the grafs of the church-yard, and. to common 
pafturage in the moor.

Mr James Gray, the late incumbent, fucceeded Mr John 
Orr%nd was tranflated from Rothes to this parifli in 1756. 
No minifter ever conduced himfelf with greater propriety. 
He never meddled with borough politics, but attended only 
to the duties of religion ; and his pious and exemplary con- 
duel: will long be rememberd by his pajifhioners. Mr Wil- 
liam Menzies has of late obtained the prefentation, is- 
agreeable to all the parifli, and has been favoured with an 
unanimous call. 

A very accurate and diftincr. record of births and marri- 
ages is kept by the feffion clerk, commencing in 1648. 

Poor. The poor's funds have been carefully and attentively 
kept, perhaps more fo than was abfolutely neceffary. When 
the funds for the poor are very confiderable, they become in 
fome degree an encouragement to idlenefs and diffipation j 
befides, people do not give alms for the ufe of after genera- 
tions, but to fupply the neceffities of the prefent. It is true, 
the Seffion may err in giving too much to the poor, yet fure- 
ly objects will always occur, among induftrious manufactur- 
ers and tradefmen burdened with great families, where the 
beftowing of a very fmall pittance will not only benefit the 
receivers, but the whole parifh, and eyen the nation at large 

The number of town poof upon the feffion roll amounts to 
45, including 3 orphan children and a lunatic. The inter- 
eft of 400I. the fum amaffed by the feffion \ the collections 
at the church doors ; the rent of \\ acre of land, with the 
fines from delinquents, and a confiderable proportion of the 
fees for proclamation of banns, i e. marriages, have hitherto 
formed the fund for their fupply,

The heritors of the landward part of the pariSh meet half 
yearly, and affcfs them fe Ives for the maintainance of their 
poor. The numhi r of their poor at prefent amounts to 1 1 
and the aiTeffment, including clerk's falary, for laft year, to 
about 27I. Phis mode of providing for the poor, in thejfcnd- 
ward parifh, has been adopted Since the year 1750- Dr 
Anderfon, the editor of the Bee, inveighs warmly againft this 
mode or providing for the poor, alledging that it is contrary 
to law, and invambly followed by a gradual increafe of the 
number of poor- Whatever it may be in other places, from 
the record of this charity, it does not appear that it has 
been the cafe in this parilh. The lands belonging to St Leo- 
nard's hofpital, formerly noticed, are under the administra- 
tion of the magistrates, and yield, communibus antris, about 
35I. yearly, divided among 40 poor perfons monthly. The 
different incorporations likewife divide fome money quarter- 
ly among the families of their deceafed brethren : 30I. Scotch 
are divided by the mini Iter and magistrates, on the morning 
of the firft day of the year, among the poor burgeffes. This 
is a mortification by James Lord Carmichael in the year 
•1662. His lordfhip, in thofe days, had his town residence 
in this burgh, and obferving the better fort of tradesmen 
and inhabitants, celebrating the new year's day with feafting 
and merry making, he, from the benevolence of his difpofi- 
tion, as tradition fays, mortified ^funk) a fum of money, the 
interelt of which is to be given to the poor, that they may 
likeways have it in their power to buy a hot pint, and partake 
in the general feftivity.

thefe 20 years. A blue or black bonnet is now a fingular- 
ity ; hats are in general ufe ; and both fexes appear at 
church, or at a ball, with almoft as much elegance as the in- 
habitants of the capital. The dialed!: of the upper ward or 
Clydefdale, as to pronounciation, is the fame with that fpoken 
in Edinburgh, differing materially from that of the middle 
and lower wards. 

Two cuftoms, almoft. peculiar to the burgh of Lanark, 
perhaps may here be noticed. The firft is a gala kept by the 
boys of the grammar fchool, beyond all memory, in regard 
to date, on the Saturday before Palm Sunday. They then 
parade the ftreets with a palm, or its fubftitute, a large tree 
of the willow k\nd,falix capma, in bloffom, ornamented with 
daffodils, mezereon and box-tree. This day is called Palm 
Saturday ; and the cuftom is certainly a Popifh relic of very 
ancient (landing. The other is the riding of the marches, 
which is done annually, upon the day after Whitfunday fair, 
by the magiftrates and burgeffes, called here the land/mark

the only office he now can reach is that of parifh beadle. His annals con- 
fift of 5 or 6 M. S. octavo volumes ; and although fome of them are triflirg, 
yet in general they are a curious and ufeful repofitory. 

An improvement, which may be followed with advantage in other places, 
took effect here about 30 years ago. A country fid!er,but a man of penetra- 
tion, having made fome money, purchafed about 3 or 4 acres of ground, of a 
dry gravelly foil, confining moflly of floping banks, which did not yield above 
3I. ios. altogether of yearly rent. Thefe grounds were fituated at the bot- 
tom of the town, within 30 or 40 feet of a rivulet, which, paffing through 
the town and butcher market, conveyed away a deal of manure, garbage, &amp;c 
The new proprietor, confeious of the advantages derivable from this fource, 
was at a confiderable expence in driving a mine through thofe 30 or 40 feet 
of ground, (a high bank,) by which, in two or three years time he fo enrich- 
ed his grounds, as to draw 14I. annually of rent ; and now 40I. Sterling a

or langemarjc day, from the Saxon langemark, It is evident- 
ly of Saxon origin, and probably eft.iblifhed here in the reign 
of, or fometimc pofterior to Malcom f. 

The manners of the inhabitants, as to diet and drink, are 
confiderably changed within thefe 20 years, which may be 
exemplified from the public entertainments of the magif- 
trates. Formerly their debauch was a moderate meal, with 
a few bottles of ale or porter, and a dram or two ; and, in 
gala days, a little punch. Now, they have fuperb enter- 
tainments, with punch, port, and even claret. The com- 
mon fuel of the parifli is coal. The ftatute labour is com- 
muted. All animals, common to the fouth of Scotland, are to 
be found here. Rabbets, however, are now entirely rooted 
out": pheafants, fuppofed from Hamilton houfe, have fome- 
fcimes been fhot in the parifli. 

There are few pigeon houfes in the parifli. Crows are nume- 
rous, and do a great deal of mifchief ; as do alfo hares, par- 
ticularly to the fruit trees. The laws, made for the prefervation 
of game, were certainly never meant to prevent proprietors or 
tenants from defending their property againft fuch depreda- 
tors ; and little fcruple need be made of deftroying any one 
of thofe animals, when hurting the property of individuals, 
^though it certainly would be a violation of the law, to do it 
for the fake of game alone. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. Perhaps no (ingle parifli 
Fn Scotland affords more eligible fituations for mills of all 
kinds than this parifh. Sir Richard Arkwright, when here 
in 1824, was aftonifhed at the advantages derivable from 
the falls of Clyde, and exultingly faid, that Lanark would 
probably in time become the Manchefter of Scotland •, as no 
place he hail ever feen afforded better fituations, or more 
ample ftreams of water for cotton machinery.

Lmark, however, has two obftacles to manufactures. 
The iirft, the poverty and uncultivated (late of the country 
around, and indeed of the whole upper ward of Lanarkfhire, 
from which circumftanee meal, and almoft every other arti- 
cle, is dearer than at Edinburgh or Glafgow, coals and po- 
tatoes excepted. But were the country in an improved ftate, 
and did proprietors and hufbandmen do their utmoft to im- 
prove the foil, this drawback, in the courfe of a few years, 
might be got the better of. The next obftacle is the great 
diltance, that raw materials are to be carried ; and thebadnefs 
of the roads. Lanark is 24 miles from Glafgow, and 30 
from Edinburgh : the road to Edinburgh is an exceeding good 
one, but that to Glafgow, which is the principal market, is 
exceedingly bad ; befides, it encounters with a very deep 
ravine, formed by the Moufs within a mile of Lanark. This 
difadvantage is in fome meafure doing away, by a new road 
now forming by Lanark bridge ; over which it croffes to Lef- 
mahago parifh, and from thence runs along the immediate 
banks of the Clyde by Hamilton to Glafgow. The pulls 
here are confiderably lefs than in the former road, and, when 
finifhcd, which will be in fpring 1 794, it will form one of 
the moft beautiful and romantic roads in Scotland. This, 
however, is a partial remedy, nor can any thing effectual 
be done to overcome the difadvantage, unlefs the fouthem 
tract of the canal between Edinburgh and Glafgow were to 
be adopted. 

The want of a flour mill not only obftruc"r.s improvements 
in agriculture, but puts the inhabitants under the neceffity 
of ufing oat and barley bread, or of buying wheaten bread 
at a great price ; all which could be eafily remedied. The 
community of Lanark has a corn mill upon Moufs water, 
which, at a very little expence, might be enabled to grind 
both wheat and oats. Encouragement would there be given 

t» 



4&amp; 



Stattjlical Account 



to the introdudion of wheat crops ; and the inhabitants 
would be enabled to live more comfortably, wheaten bread 
being of all others the mod wholcfome. 

It is of great difadvanrage to manufaftures, that Lanark 
moor, fo improvable and fo near the town, fliould remain 
in a {rate of nature : we already owe a great deal to Mr 
] loncyman ; and if the magiflrates cannot difpofe of any 
more of it, on account of the fervitudc of the burgefTes, they 
may follow the example of the town of Ayr, and inclofe 
that portion of it which is nigheft the town, to anfwer for 
this fervitude ; and were it divided into two inclofures, the 
cattle could pafture alternately in both ; the lbuth moor 
would be fully adequate for this purpofe,* and after fetting 
afide part of the north moor for fuel and divot, the reft of 
it may be either difpoled of to one pi-oprietor, or, which would 
be of greater confcqucncc to the burgh, the magiflrates 
may feu fmall lots to the weavers and others, efpecially a- 
long the high-way leading from Lanark to Edinburgh, very 
favourable to the erection of a village or villages. Thofe 
parts neareft the town would certainly yield equal feu duty 
with thofe at Kirkfield bank, viz. 61. or 81. the acre; be- 
fides, if a village was once eredled, a demand for ground in 
the neighbourhood would naturally follow -, fo that the ma- 
giflrates would be enabled to let pieces of their moor at lead 
as high as 5s. the acre, and the whole remainder of the moor 
would in time be brought under culture. 

* This plan would fave the necefTity and e:pence of two common herds; 
the fees, however, ought Tall to be paid to the magiflrates, and the money 
arifing therefrom fhould be laid out on lime, to be fpread upon the heathy 
parts to twecten the pafture. Nor would it be deemed an improper exac- 
tion, were the magiftrates to ordain, that every burgefs, on getting a cart of 
divots or turf from the moor, fhoulJ, in return, lay a cart of dung upon the 
inclcled ccramon.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009915">SHOTTS</name> 



(County of Lanark, Presbytery of Hamilton, 
Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.)

<p>

ttatne, Siiiia'tion, and Extent. 

X his pariih, in the public records, is called Bertram 
Shotts. The name feems explanatory of nothing pecu- 
liar to the place, and the accounts of tradition are fo ap- 
parently fabulous, as far to exceed the belief of even the 
mod credulous antiquarian. Shotts is Gtuated in the north- 
eaft point of Lanarkshire. It is one of the largefl lowland 
parimes in Scotland, forming nearly an oblong fquare, 10 
miles in length, and 7 in breadth. 

Soils and Value. — The lands which lie towards the corner 
cf the parim arc a mixture of clay and fand ; will yield 5 
bolls an acre, and may be rented at 9 s. Thofe towards the 
S. E. are of a black foil, and will yield 4 bolls an acre ; 
rent 7 s. Along the greater part of the S. and the whole 

Vol. XV. G W: fide 



Statiflical Account 



W. fide of the parifii, the foil is chiefly clay, and will yield 
4v bolls an acre, rent 8 s. By travellers paffing along the 
great road, Shotts is reckoned but a barren and bleak part 
of the kingdom. There is, however, on the 8. W. boundary 
of this parifii, a tra£t of ground, 2 miles fquare, that is lit- 
tle inferior to great part of the land upon the Clyde. It 
yields at an average 6 bolls an acre •, rent 13 s. The lands 
in the centre, and along the north fide of Shotts, arc of a black 
foil, and chiefly fitted for pafture ; when plowed they may 
yield from 3 to 4 bolls each acre ; the grain is but of an in- 
ferior quality ; the rent 5 s. an acre. That part of the 
country lying on each fide of the great road, at the entry in- 
to this parifii from the Eaft, was not' many years ago nearly 
in its original ftate. This the traveller now fees is fubdivided, 
and by (tones raifed from the furface of the land enclofed, 
in a way which promifes to laft for ages to come. The pro- 
prietor, * by continuing his operations, with the true fpirit 
of an improver, has at once beautified the country, and 
nearly tripled the' value of his eitate. A little weft from 
the kirk of Shotts, and upon the great road, the traveller fees 
a fmall trait of country neatly inclofed. Its produce, with- 
in thefe few years, was little more than the Thrafli ; but by 
the well directed indultry of its proprietor;):, it has for fome 
feafons paft yielded crops which vye with thofe of a much bet- 
ter foil. Round the manfion-houfe, which ftands in the mid- 
dle of this lately improved field, there are feveralbeltsofplant- 
ing, which continue to thrive beyond expectation. Were the 
like fpirit. transfufed into neighbouring proprietors, a coun- 
try, hitherto but bleak, might be made more comfortable to 
its inhabitants, and have a better name abroad. 

Manure. — The manure, which fuits all the foils of this 
extenfive parifii, is lime and compoft. The full half of this 
compolt fhould confitt of dried turf, the remaining part of 

dung. 

* Sir John Ingms of Cramond. J Mr David Young of Little Haiifh&amp;w.

dung. This mixture the experienced farmer prefers to pure 
dung, as it is a much better fecuiity againft worms, con- 
tinues longer in the field, and encreafes the foil, where the 
till or gravel comes near the Airface. The indullrious far- 
mer here cafts each feafon a quantity of turf, the more ben- 
ty the better ; this, when properly dryed, he flacks up, and 
after it has been ufed a competent time in byre and fhble, be- 
low and around the cattle, it is carried to the dunghill. When 
from this it goes to the field, it is fo completely rotten, that 
it yields a manure much fuperior to the commit mixed in 
the Held- By alternate ftrata of this turf and fheep's dung, 
much excellent manure is carried from the fold to the field. 

Crops — Upon the fummer fallow, or field to be broken up, 
the fpirited farmer lays on nearly four chalders of flacked 
lime, with a hundred fingle carts of the compoft above de- 
fcribed. The 2d, or perhaps the 3d crop of corn, he lays 
down with rye-grafs. This for the firft year does very well j 
but fhould the field be cut a fecond time, through the luxu- 
riancy of the natural grafs the fown fcarce appears. In the 
lower parts of the p irifh, a crop of peafe comes in between 
the two crops of corn. With the rye-grafs alio a proper 
quantity of clover is here fown. The produce the firft year 
(and there ought to be no more,) may be 200 ftones. The 
ground, after this fucceffion of crops, being paftured 3 years, 
the fame rotation again commences. Lint is often a profi- 
table crop in this parifh, either after the firft crop of corn, 
after peafe, or upon potatoe land. A peck of feed will yield 
4 ftones of fheaf lint. The bear crop through Shotts has of 
late been much difcontinued : for this the ftiffhefs of the foil 
in part accounts ; but there is another reafon which weighs 
more with the farmer. Bear requires that quantity of un- 
mixed dung, which prevents him from making compoft for 
his outfields, a circumftance of late much attended to in this 
country. 

G 2 Rivers.

Rivers. — There are twoCi//«-.r,both of which have their four- 
cer. in- this diftrict. The one of thefe rifes in the N. E. corner 
of the parity and In its pro^refs weftward,dividingShotts from 
Torphichen and Newmonkland, falls into the Clyde 5 miles 
above Glafgow. The other Calder rifes in the S. E. corner of 
this parifli, and moving towards the Clyde nearly in the fame 
direction with the former, in its courfe divides Shotts from 
Cambufnethan. The waters alfo of Avon and Cramond 
have their firft rife in this parifli. The Avon, foon after 
leaving Shotts, bends its courfe n rthward, and empties itfelf 
into the Firth of Forth near Borrowftownnefs. The Cramond, 
between its fource and Mid Calder, crofTes the great Edinburgh 
Road three times, and empties itfelf into the fame Firth at 
the village and kirk, to which, in all probability, it gave the 
names. 

Hills and PrcfpeHs. — The H'wji hill lies a mile E. from the 
Kirk of Shotts. Over this hill the road leading from Glaf- 
gow to Edinburgh has,- for time immemorial, continued to 
pafs. Here it is fuppofed are trie higheft cultivated lands in 
Scotland ; this however is thought to be only a popular mif- 
take ; according to General Roy's mc-nfuration, the Hirft is 
upon a level with the Clyde 5 miles above Lanark. There 
are two caufes which feem to have led into this miftake : 
the waters here iffuing from their fources/at a fmall diftance 
from each other, run in quite oppofite directions ; it fol- 
lows not, however, from this, that the Hirft rifes to the height 
fuppofed ; but only that in this precife point, the Hirft is the 
higheft land between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, the two 
feas into which all thefe waters empty themfelves. In every 
direclion alfo from this hill, the country not only begins to 
fall, but wherever one turns his eye, for upwards of 20 mile?, 
no object comes in to mar the view. All the fpace there-

the range of mountains which, in oppofite directions, bound 
his prolpsft, feems funk beneath him ; though in fact, at a 
certain point fouthward the country begins to rife, arid the 
Clyde, 5 miles S. E. of Lanark, is upon a level with the fpot 
on which he ftands. The Tilling and Cant hills, the one a 
little nmth, and the other a little fouth of the kirk of Shotts, 
lhould here alfo be mentioned, not fo much on account of 
their apparent magnitude, as for the wonderfully extended 
profpec% which in common with the Hirft they afford. From 
the Cant hills, 6 complete (hires, with a part of 8 more, are 
feen. Here the whole country, from Arthur's Seat to the 
hills in Arran, and the weftern termination of the Grampian 
Range, fills the eye. While the obferver turns round, car- 
rying Ins eye from S. to N. the whole fpace from the Pent- 
land, Tinto and Loudon hills, on the one hand, to the Lo- 
mond, the Ochil, and Campfie heights, on the other, fuceef- 
fively comes under his view. Into this extenfive profpech 
with the hills already mentioned, enter the towns of Giaf- 
gow, Paifley, and Hamilton, with villages and gentlemens 
feats not to be numbered. This great ftretch of country, a 
few miles S. E. of Shotts excepted, has the appearance of 
much richnefs and cultivation. 

Proprietors* and Rent. — By various fales on the part of the 
feuers, the number of heritors now in the parifh of Shotts 
have arifen to 45. The chief of thefe are the Duke of Ha- 
milton, Gavin Inglis of Murdifton, Sir John Inglis of Cra- 
mond, and Col. William Dalrymple of Cleland. Of thefe

John Inglis of Cramond, from the year 1378, down to the year 1630, belong- 
ed to the family of Hamilton. The Marquis of Hamilton, at the laft of thtfc 
periods, fold out the greater part of this extenfive Barony.

45 ^'rc may be about n, all of whofe property does not 
annually yield iooo merks Scotch. The valued rent of 
Shotts is 65 661. Scotch. The real rent exceeds 4500I. Ster- 
ling. 

Roads.— .The great road, which at prefent leads from Glaf- 
gow to Edinburgh, pafles through this parifh, and divides it 
nearly into two equal parts. In this, as in the other roads 
formed at that period, a {freight rather than a level line was 
fought. To this abfurd and inconfiderate idea, are many of 
the pulls in it to be afcribed. A bill has been lately obtain- 
ed, to carry a road from Glafgow to Edinburgh, by the vil- 
lages of Ardrie and Bathgate. In this bill there is alfo a 
claufe, impowering Colonel Dalrymple of Cleland to make a 
line, which leaves the Shotts road at Bells-hill, and returns- to 
it at the confines of Whitburn parifh. Each of thefe pafs 
though this parifh, the firft, two miles N. of the Church, the 
fecond, two miles S. of it. In felf defence, the truftces upon 
the Shotts roads have now in many places eafed the pulls in 
it greatly ; and to avoid the Hirlt altogether, the road is now 
carried nearly in a dead level, round the north end of that 
hill. The advantages derived by the public, from the late 
wonderful improvement upon roads, are indeed aftonifliing. 
The journey which, 40 years ago, the traveller could only 
aceomplifh in two days, he now executes in five or fix hours. 
The expedition, and encreafed burden of draught horfes are 
equally ftriking, and ftill more beneficial. The ftatutc work 
of this parifh, though it be commuted, and very regularly le- 
vied, is far from being fufficient to keep the many roads, in 
fo wide a diftrieT; of country, in any tolerable repair. 

Ecclefiajlical Stale. — The prefent kirk of Shotts is a long 
narrow building, fituated due E. and W. What changes 
it has undergone, fince its erection in 1450, do not ap- 
pear 



of Shotts. 



pear * - It got a few repairs fome years ago ; much remains 
itill to be done in this way. The manfe was built in the 
year 1700. Before Mr Bruce's admiffion, it had undergone 
repeated repairs. At that period 1 00 guineas were laid out up- 
on it, which have rendered it, though in a very expofed fitua- 
tion, abundantly fnug and convenient. The glebe confifts of 
44 acres. It might rent'as a fmall farm at 13I. or 14I. Ster- 
ling. In it there is a feam of coal, of the fplint or parrot kind, 
folly 3 feet thick. There are here two ftrata of iron {lone, 
the one refiing immediately upon the coal, the other a foot 
nearer the furface, each from 4 to 6 inches thick : there is, at 
a fmall diftance from this, another feam of coal upon the 
glebe, of the f middy or drofs kind ; this being only two feet 
thick, would, in a country like Shotts, (though it be of an ex- 
cellent quality) nearly exhauft its value in working. The 
living cf Shotts, manfe, glebe, and fire included, is worth 
14CI. Sterling. The Seceders are much more numerous than 
the members of the Eftablilhed Church 

School. The fchool-malter of Shotts, as in many other places 
of Scotland, adts as feffion-clerk. The emoluments, annex- 
ed to his office, may be about 3I. ios. The quarterly allow- 
ance for each fcholar taught Englifh is 2od. writing 2s. Latin

* Anciently the parifh of Bothwei.l extended from the Clyde, '(warning 
along its S. W. borders) all the way to the confines of Weft Lothian. To 
accommodate the inhabitants in the Eaftern parts of this great parifh, the firft 
Lord Hamilton, in the year 14^0, built a chapel where the kirk of Shotts 
now {lands, called St Catharine's Chapel, being dedicated to St Catharine 
«f Sienna. It was not, however, till after the Reformation, that the coun- 
try round this chapel was totally detached from Bothwell, and erected into a 
feparate parifh. 

f After a ftruggle which lafled upwards of fix years, the fettlement of Mr 
Laurence Welli, late incumbent in Shotts, was at length efiedted in the 
year 1768. Soon after this, a meeting-houfe was built, to which the great 
majority of the people called a Burgher clergyman.

There has, for this reafon, been thefe 30 years paft a fuc- 
ceffion.of teachers in Shotts, unknown, it is fuppofed, in any 
other part of the kingdom. It is painful to add, that, either 
through the total want of a fchool-mafter, or the carelefsnefs, 
the imprudence, or incapacity of thofe in this office, the rif- 
ing generation, for thefe ten years paft, have, in the golden 
ieafon of youth, been in a great meafure prevented from ac- 
quiring that knowledge, and thofe habits, which, in the fub- 
fequent part of life, can render them good men, and good 
citizens-. For the fame reafon, connected with the carelefs-* 
nefs, if not obftinacy of Seceders, the parifh records of Shotts 
are fo extremely inaccurate and deficient, that no decifion, 
even for the fmalleft average, could reft upon their evidence. 

Poor. — The poor in Shotts, for many years paft, have been 
fupported by affe Anient. Upon the firft Tuefdays of Feb- 
ruary and Augult, agreeable to a£t of Parliament, the heri- 
tors and elders meet in a conjunct body. After the num- 
ber to be admittted upon the roll, and the fupply to be gran- 
ted each claimant, are fettled, the fum wanted for the enfu- 
ing fix months is laid cn. This the treafurer is authorifed to 
to levy, the one half from the heritors, the other half from 
the tenants, in proportion to their feveral valuations. At 
each meeting a {landing committee is alio appointed, to fu- 
pcrintend the operations of the treafurer, and to give advice

or fupply upon extraordinary emergencies The number 
upon the poor's roll of Shotts may be, comrnunibus dtims, from 
20 to 28. The allowance granted to individuals may be 
each month from 2 s. to 6 s : It often happens that there 
are perfons Handing in need of temporary relief, who wilh 
not to be put upon the roll. Their cafe at each meeting is 
alfo confidered, and a reaionable allowance granted. The 
fum, annually requifite for all the above mentioned purpofcs, 
may be about 50 1. Sterling; of which, 40I. or therea- 
bout, is raifed by affeflmcnt; the mort- cloths and kirk-dues 
make up for the 1 reft. This plan, in a parifh like Shotts, 
where the Sectaries are fo numerous, and the heritors of the 
greateft valuation do not refide, feems to be the only equi- 
table one which can be adopted. 

Population. — The enlargement of farms has produced the 
fame effects in Shotts that it has produced in other places. A- 
long the N. and E. fides of this parifh, the property of 
the Duke of Hamilton, and Sir John Inglis of Cramond, the 
number of inhabitants is much diminifhed. Of this, the 
ruins of many cottages, and even of fome farm (leadings, afford 
the moft fatisfactory proofs. The parifh, however, it would 
appear, has of late been upon the increafe : Within thefe 1 2 
years there have been built in it, and are now poffeffed, 3^ 
cottages and 3 farm Headings. For this the late increafe of 
travellers upon the great road, and the Omoa Iron work, fuf- 
ficiently account. The total decreafe within thefe 40 years 
is dated, along with other particulars, in the following table :

than in the country round the church. An impenetrable till, 
lying at the bottom of a thin fpungy black foil, keeps the fur- 
face generally moiit ; this, with the want of fhelter from tn- 
clofures, and belts of planting, renders the air more penetra- 
ting and chill than in other parts of the country, even of 
the fame height, where thefe improvements have been fo 
happily introduced The inhabitants, however, of Shotts are 
equally, if not more healthy, than thofe who live in a warm- 
er climate*. From the quantity of fuel with which people 
of all ranks are here fo plentifully fupplied, dampnefs with- 
in doors produces none of thefe rheumatic diforders, fo pre- 
valent in warmer climates, where this neceffary article is, 
from its expence, almoft denied to the bulk of the people. 
The renowned and immortal Dr. Cullen, (who began his 
career in this parifii,) when talking upon this fubjecl:, ufed 
to fay that Shotts was the Montpelier of Scotland. 

Collieries. — By feveral late trials, connected with former 
difcoveries, it now appears, that the whole country along the 
South fide of the great road, from the confines of Whitburn 
parifh, is, for 10 miles Weft, and 6 South, all covered with 
coal. In the parifh of Shotts, which occupies a confiderable 
part of this great fpace, there are 4 collieries- The fir ft of 
thefe is Benhar, the property of Sir John Inglis of Cramond : 
with this coal, which is of the beft quality, the whole country 
weft of Edinburgh upon the great road is chiefly fupplied ; 
nine miners have here conflant employment. Thefe bring 
annually from the pitt i2,ocq carts, weighing each cart near- 
ly 7 cwt. The price at the hill, within thefe few years, has 
ri fen from is. to i8d. a cart ; the total annual product of 
this work is pool. Sterling, of which fum, at 6d. each cart.,

300I. Stdriing goes to the miners. Hcllls Migg coal, the pro- 
perty of Colonel William Dalrymple of Cleland, lies 3 miles 
weft of Benhar. The feam is only 22 inches thick ; the pro- 
prietor here employs 3 miners, more with a view to two 
ftrata of iron ftone, of an excellent quality, than to the coal, 
which, partly from its inferior quality, and partly from want 
of market, fells at is. the cart, the purchafer plcafing himfelf as 
to quantity. Mr Cleland of Auchinlee, and Mr Cuming of 
Crofs-ha!l, towards the Weft end of the parifli, have great fields 
of coal upon their lands. Mr Cleland's feam is upwards of 3 
feet thick. Mr Cuming's in fome places is 3, and in other 
places 9 feet thick ; each of thefe gentlemen at prefent only 
employ two miners ; but did the fale profper, it would give 
bread to a much greater number. Mr Cuming's coal is con- 
netted both with the ball and ftratum iron-itone. 

Fuel. — Plentiful as the coal is through this parifli, yet, in 
the middle, and along the north fide of it, peat is chiefly ufed. 
This is almoft at every man's door,, and is prepared at a time 
when, according to the mode of farming here practiced, little 
elfe is done. 

Propofed Canal. — A canal leading from Edinburgh to Glaf- 
gow was laft fcafon the fubjetl of much converfation. Of the 
three tracts propofed, if coal be the leading objeel, the one 
South of the kirk of Shotts furely merits the preference. 
Beds of free-ftone, fome of them of a very fine grain, are fre- 
quent in this parifli, and the whin-ftone in the centre or* it 
may be find to be inexhauftihle. 

Iron Works, — The Omoa iron work, the property of Co- 
lonel William Dalrymple of Cleland, lies on the confines of 
this parifb, towards the South- Weft. It was erected in 1 7S7. 
The fituation of this work is peculiarly eligible. The Colonel 
has throughout his eftate here, which is of confiderable ex- 
tent, a feam of coal 2 feet 5 (riches thick ; 2 feet above the 

coal, 



of Shotts.

coal, bail iron-ftonc is found* the balls lying pretty near each 
other. This (tone is fuperior to any thing of the kind, hither- 
to found in this part of the country : 3 cwt. of calcined ftone 
yield i cwt of metal ; it fmelts alfo without the help of iron 
ore. Two feet nearer the furface there are two ft rata of jron 
ftone, each from 6 to 9 inches thick. Below the 2 feet 5 
inches of coal, there is another coal 9 feet in thicknefs, of an 
excellent quality. There is here each day raifed 36 tons of 
coal, 26 tons of which go to the furnace ; the other ten, from 
their frr.allnefs, being unfit for charring, either ferve to blow 
the engine, or are fold to the country. Nine tons of calcined 
ftone a-day go to the furnace, which cafts at the interval of 
18 hours, and yields about two tons of pig iron, generally of 
an excellent quality. There is here a cupola blown by the en- 
gine, which produces caft work of any form employers pleafe. ' 
Orders of this fort, anfwered by Colonel Dalrymple, have 
given great fatisfaclion. The coal is raifed here from i8d 
to 2od per ton, (the coal falling below 4 inches fquare ex- 
cepted), which brings the miner only 94d. a ton : Ball iron 
ftone in railing 2s. 6d : Stratum iron ftone 1 8d. There are 
employed here 40 miners, befides other 40 fmelters and per- 
fons otherwife engaged, and 1 2 horfes. The weekly expence 
at this work is Sol Sterling, which finding its way to farmers 
and workmen of every clafs in the neighbourhood, improves 
their fituation beyond what hitherto they had experienced, 
in this inland country. Another iron work is, againft the en- 
fuing fpring, (1794^ to be erected upon Mr David Young's 
lands of Little Hairihaw, which ly about a mile S. W. of the 
kirk of Shotts. The gentlemen engaged in this work fay, 
there is throughout the parilh of Shotts fuch a profufion of 
coal and iron ftone, as might, and in all probability foojr will 
employ feveral fuch furnaces as the one now blown in it.

Should this prophecy he verified, what a change in die ap- 
pearance and producl of Shotts may be expeekd ! 

Prices of Labour and Provifions. — An expert ploughman 
gets I 2l. Sterling annually ; an affillant about 1 8 years old, (A. 
Sterling ; a herd about i 2 years old, through the herding fea- 
fon, 20s; a dairy maid, or houfe fervant, annually, 3I. 16s; 
each of thefe have bed and board furniflicd ; a day-labourer 
from March to November 1 4d a-day ; die four remaining 
months 1 1 d a-day. During the harveft fcafon, men receive 
1 4d. women lod. with provifions furnifhed. A tailor gels 
8d. with his victuals ; a mafon and carpenter, each finding 
their own provifions, 2od. Each of thefe claffes of labourers 
have, within thefe laft eight years, rifen one third in their de- 
mands ; at prefent, however, wages feem rather to be moving 

in an oppofite direction. Meal throughout tin's country 

may be rated at l-yd. a peck below the Grlafgbw market. The 
great quantities of Merfe meal brought from the Dalkeith 
market, and carried through this parifh to Glufgow, con- 
tribute chiefly to produce this effect. Frefli butter fells at 
Sd. a pound ; felted butter per {tone 12s ; fkim'd milk cheefe 
5s. 4d. a (tone •, butter and cheefe weight 22 oz ; a hen 1 4d ; 
chickens from 8d. to iod. a pair, eggs ^d a dozen. Carriers 
picking up and carrying thefe articles, either to Glafgow or 
Edinburgh, heighten their prices very much to thofe who 
dwell upon the great road. 

Eminent Men. — Shotts has given birth to two perfons flill 
alive of very diftinguifhed merit; viz. Gavin Hamilton Efq; 
of Murdiflon, the mod celebrated hiftory painter now in 
Europe, and John Miller, Efq-,* profeffor of law, in the 
univerfity of Glafgow, well known to the world by his in- 
genious publications.

Aituqidlies.— There is upon the great road, immediately 
below the church, a copious fountain of excellent water, 
known by the name of CatSs or Kate's W ilk This name it no 
doubt got from St. Catharine to whom it was dedicated. A- 
bout a mile South- Weft from the kirk, there is a fmall conical 
mount, called Laws-caftle. This name feems to indicate, that 
fome fortrefs had once ftood upon it ; but if there ever did, 
there is no veftige of it now remaining, except perhaps a 
quantity of ftones of enormous weight and fize, 

Chara£Ier of the People. — Although there are 10 houfes 
licenced to fell malt and fpiritous liquors of home manu- 
facture, they are chiefly fupported by the travellers on the 
great road. Even in thofe parts of the parifh, where public 
houfes abound moft, intemperance is not a prevailing vice. 
The people, with a few exceptions, are induftrious and fo- 
ber. Since the prefent minifter's connection with Shotts, 
and he believes for many years before that period, criminal 
profecutions have been unknown, one profecution for mur- 
der excepted, where the libel was not proven. Each, it 
would appear, fober and contented with the fruits of his own 
induftry, feels but little of thofe paffions whofe indulgence 
terminate in ignominy and death. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The perfect command of 
fuel is the principal advantage which the inhabitants of this 
parifh enjoy. It is rather furprifing that this circumftance, 
connected with fo eafy an intercourfe between Glafgow and 
Edinburgh, has not, long ere now, paved the way to the in- 
troduction and growth of manufactures in Shotts. This, 
however, had not trade lately received fo fevere a check by 
the war, would in all probability foon have been the cafe. 
The fields of mofs with which, for two miles on each fide 
of the great road, this parifh is interfered, are a difadvantage 
from which the proprietors of Shotts can promife themfelves

no deliverance, The flatnefs of the fields, and the barren 
hill, which lies at the bottom of the mofs, exclude every idea 
of cultivation, from the mind even of the moft adventurous 
improver. It may be added, as another di fad vantage, that 
throughout this extenfive parifli there are but two or three fmall 
villages, and that in other parts of it the houfes are fo dif- 
tant from each other, that the education of children cannot 
be obtained, without much fatigue to the young one?, and ex- 
pence to the parents.

Climate, Difeafcs, Hills, fcrY.— The air is rather moift, from 
the frequent rains which prevail in the weftern p-irts of Scot- 
land, but this circumftance does not appear to affect the 
health of the inhabitants, many of whom die of old age. 
Confumptions, fevers, and fore throats, are the molt com- 
mon difeafes in this parifli. The moft remarkable hill in 
the parifh is the Mi/ly-Latu, which rifes to the height of 1240 
feet above the level of the fea ; and commands from its funi- 
mit an cxtenfive and varied profpeel over 12 counties, inclu- 
ding the Frith of Clyde, and the ifknds of Aryan, Bute, Ail- 
fa, &amp;c. This hill is furrounded by the muirland part of the 
parifh, which abounds with game, and affords tolerable paf- 
ture for fheep. 

Lakes, Fi/b, Birds, Rivers, and Mills. — There are two 
lakes in this parifli, CaJHefemple Loch, and SjhieenfideLoch. The 
former was, fome time ago, attempted to be drained* with- 
out fuccefs, and is now made a moft beautiful piece of water, 
containing above 400 acres, in which there are plenty of pikes, 
perches, and eels. It alfo abounds with fwans, geefe, ducks, 
teals, bitterns, and other kinds of wild fowl. The beauty of 
this piece of water is confiderably increafed, by the well dref- 
fed grounds and good quantity of wood which furrounds it. 
GhieeufideLoch is fituated in the muirs, and contains about 
21 acres it forms an excellent refervoir, for fupplying two 
large cotton mills in the village of Lochwinnoch. The prin- 
cipal rivers are the Calder, whofe banks, from a union of 
wood, water and rugged rocks, exhibit a variety of roman- 
tic and pi&amp;urefque fcenery, and the Black Cart. The Cal- 
der flows into CaftlefempleLoch, and the Black Cart is the 
inlet from it. On thefe two rivers, 7 very large cotton 
mills have been creaed within thefe few years.

Woods. — There are not above 30 acres of natural wood in 
this parifh, but the proprietors of Caftlefemple have made 
very extenfive plantations, which, from the goodncfs of the 
foil, and the attention paid to them, are in a very flourifh- 
inff ftate. They extend at prefent to above 400 acres, and 
will probably receive confidcrable additions from the prefent 
proprietor. It may be worthy of remark, that in thinning 
fome plantations at Caftlefemple, from 29 to 35 years old, 
each larch fold at from 1 2 s. to 22 s, and the beft of any of 
the other trees did not bring a higher price than 5 s. 

Roads. — The roads were fomc years ago in a wretched ftate, 
hilly, narrow, and almoft impaffable in wet weather, but many 
of them are now excellent, and great improvements may im- 
mediately be expected, from two new lines of turn-pike road, 
propofed to be carried through the parifh to Kilbirnie and 
Port-Glafgow. The turn-pike roads in this parifh are con- 
nected by private roads, to the making and repairing of which 
laft the converfion of the ftatute labour, amounting to above 
100I. Sterling a year, is folely applied. 

Eccleftajlkal State. — The greater part of the inhabitants at- 
tend the eftabliftied church, and there are not above 10© Se- 
ceders, Burghers, &amp;c. in the parifh. William M'Dowall, 
Efq-, of Garthland is patron. The ftipend confifts of 127 bolls 
of meal, and 2I. of vicarage ; and although the glebe contains 
only fix acres, yet from its fituation it is worth about ill: 
Staling yearly. An augmentation has been lately propofed 
to the heritors by the patron, to which they have unanimouf- 
ly agreed. The church is very well finifhed, and contains a- 
bout 1300 people ; the manfe is beautifully fituated about 
300 yards fiom the village, and 320I. have been lately ex-

pended in putting it into complete repair, and building a new 
fet of offices. 

School.— The fchool, which is fituated in the village, is com- 
modious, and the f.dary of old amounted to 200 merks ; but 
as the parifli is divided by the lake, the proprietor on the 
fouth fide wifhed to have a fchool in that didrict, and ob- 
tained 50 merks. The people eroded a fcbpoUboufe at their 
own expence, and the emoluments of the teacher employed 
by them arc about 1 7I. Sterling yearly : the falary and emolu- 
ments of the parifh fchoolmaftcr amount to about 30I. an- 
nually. 

Poor. — The number of poor on the parifli roll is at pix- 
fent 20, and they receive from is. 6d. to 4s. each, per week. 
This fupply arifes from 70I. or 80I. collected annually at the 
church door, and from the intereft of a few donations, and 
of a fmall fund belonging to the poor. There are two fo- 
cieties eftablithed in the parifli, for fupplying the neceffities 
of indigent members, and their inftitution has been produc- 
tive of much advantage. 

Antiquities* . — The old Chapel, or college of Cafile-Sem- 

pk 

* A very fine brafs cannon, with the arms of Scotland, and J. R. S. en- 
graved on it, was found many years ago in the lake, where other 6 are re- 
ported by tradition to have been loft. Several canoes have been lately found 
in the lake, about 5 feet below the furface, which evidently prove the large 
forefts that muft have formerly exifted.in this nait of the country, as they 
jiave been formed in a rude manner, like the Indian canoes, out of fingle trees. 
About 60 years ago, a ladle of Corinthian brafs was found within a mile of 
the village, and the handle ftill remains entire, at the end of which there is 
a beautiful ram's head. It is in the poffeffion of Mr Barclay, inn-kcercr at 
Lochwinrioch.

is ufed as a burying place. The Pail, or Pele, an old cattle, 
Hands in an ifland in the lake, and has been formerly a place 
of confiderable ftrength, to which the lairds of Semple re- 
treated in feudal times, when unable to hold out in the caftle 
of Semple againlb their powerful enemies. 

Minerals, Magnetic Roth, &amp;c. — Coal, lime, and free- 
ftone abound in different parts of this parifh, and a very fin- 
gular magnetic rock has been difcovered two miles from 
Caftle-Semple. The compafs was fenfibly affected all round 
the rock, to the diftance of 150 yards. The effect was moft 
remarkable on the eaft and weft, fide of it, and in every direc- 
tion it was greater, as the compafs was nearer to the rock it- 
felf. In its immediate vicinity, or nearly in a perpendicular 
direction above it, the pofition of the needle was very un- 
fteady and irregular, and as the compafs was gradually brought 
nearer the ground, the deviation from the magnetic meridian 
was more remarkable, and the vibrations more rapid. When 
the compafs was fet on the ground, the north pole of the 
needle invariably directed itfelf to one very fmall fpace of the 
rock, on whatever fide of it the needle was placed. 

Houfes and Manufac7ures.--When the prefent incumbent was 
fettled in this parilh, no new houfes were building in the vil- 
lage ; and although from its vicinity to Paifley, feveral people 
were employed in weaving filk, gauze, and lawns, as well as in 
the manufacture of thread, which is carried on to a confider-

able extent, yet it had a very poor appearance. Since that period 
53 new houfes have been built ; many additional feus have been 
granted by Mr M'Dowall the proprietor ; and the population, 
the wealth and the induttry of its inhabitants have been in- 
crenfed in a mod furprifing degree, within a very fhort time. 
The local fituation of Locliwinnoch is extremely favourable, 
irom its being in the neighbourhood of coal, lime, and free- 
ftone, and from its being abundantly fupplied with fine fpring 
water ; but its rapid increafe has been principally occafioned 
by the erection of two large cotton mills, by Meffrs Henflon, 
Burns and Co. and Meffrs Johnftons and Co. The mill erec- 
ted by Meflrs Henfton, Burns and Co, employs at prefent 
140, and when finifhed will employ about 350 people. The 
wheel is 24 feet diameter, and is fupplied with water from 
a circular dam, built acrofs the river Calder, 19 feet 8 inches 
high, and 85 feet in circumference ; the number of fpindles 
in this mill will amount to 9144. The mill erected by 
Meffrs Johnftons and Co, which is 164 feet long, 33 feet 
wide, and 35 feet high, is fupplied with water from the mill 
of Meffrs Kenfton, Burns and Co, employs at prefent 240 
people, and when the machinery is completed, will employ 
5oo : the wheel is 2 2 feet in diameter and io feet broad \ the 
fpindles in this mill will amount to 19,485. A cotton mill 
has been erected half a mile from the village, on a fmaller 
fcale, which will employ about 80 people : Meffrs Johnftons 
and Co. are at prefent procuring a very large field, adjoin- 
ing to their cotton mill, for bleaching, which is carried on 
with great activity and fpirit by Mr Henry Wilfon, in a dif- 
ferent part of the parifh : 339, 612 yards of dimities, mufli- 
nets, jaconets, and booked muflins, from iod. to 20s. per 
yard, and, 4000. fpinels of thread and yarn, were bleached by 
him in 1791, and 45 people were employed in the work.

Ale- HouJ is.— In this parilh, there are 14 ale-houfes, which 
ihould be confiderably dimimfhed. It is to be expected from 

fome refoJutions lately publifhed, that the juftices of the peace, 
to whofe fuperintendance this material object. ,of police is 
committed by the Legislature, will take this fubject ferioufly 
into their confideration, and apply an effectual remedy to an 
evil, which is productive of the rnoft pernicious confequen- 
ces to the health, the morals, and the induftry of the people.

Longevity.— Margaret Patton, who was born in this 
parifh, is mentioned by Lynch on health, as a remarkable in- 
ftance of longevity. Her picture and a print from it, which 
the writer of this account has feen, were done from the life, 
by J. Cooper in 1739, with the following infcription : " Mar- 
" garet Patton, born in the parifh of Loghnugh, near Paifley 
" in Scotland, living in the work-houfe of St Margarets, 
*' Weftminfter, aged 138 years." 

Rent and Proprietors. — The valued rent of the parifh is 
6692I. 6s. 8d. Scotch, and the real rent about 7600I. Ster- 
ling. Mr M'Dowall is proprietor of a confiderable part of 
the parifh, and the remainder holds of him as fuperior, 
with a few exceptions. The other proprietors amount to 
120, and the uncommon number of them feems to have a- 
Tifen, from the feus granted by the families of Dundonald 
and Semple, who were formerly proprietors of the greater 
part of this parifh. They refide in general in the parifh, mar- 
ry into each other's families, and cultivate their own property, 

to

to which they are particularly attached. Thsir houfes are 
comfortable, many of them extremely good, and the old woods 
of plane and afh trees, with which they are univerfally fur- 
rounded, contribute much to the beauty of the country. 

Agriculture, Farm Rents, Produce, &amp;c. — The arable land 
of this parifh amounts to 5476 acres, of which 14^4 are year- 
ly in tillage ; and it is all enclofed with ftone walls, hedges, 
or funk fences, with a hedge planted at a proper diftance 
from the bottom, which is a very ftrong and beautiful fence. 
The rent of the land is from 12s. Sterling to 2I. per acre ; and 
the farms are generally let for 19 years, at from to nol. 
annually. A certain proportion of the arable land is likewifc 
let to the manufacturers in fmall lots. The tenants are bound, 
by their leafes, to plow 2, and reft 4 years, and to have on- 
ly one third of the farm in tillage. They put their whole 
manure on the fir ft year, and lay down the fecond crop with 
rye-grafs and clover, which is a confiderable improvement, 
though it has only become a common practice within thefe. 
few years. Oats, (which are fown in March and reaped in 
September,) and potatoes, are the principal crops in this pa- 
rifh. Barley, or rather bear, is likewife raifed in fmall quan- 
tities j and the culture of flax has been attended with fuccefs, 
and has entitled many of the farmers to premiums. From 
the nature of tire foil, which produces very fine pafture, worth 
from 5s. to 30s. a great quantity of butter and cheefe is an- 
nually made and the farmers principally depend on the falo 
of thefe articles, and the rearing of cattle, to the breed of 
which they are particularly attentivei 

Horfes, Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c. — -The horfes are remarkably good,* 
and the milk cows fell at from 61. to lih The total 
number of thefe, and the other live ftock, are as follows :

Prices of Labour and Provif.ons. — Men fervants hired by the 
year receive from 10 1. to 12 1. j maid fervants 4 1. ; mafons 
per day, from 2 s. to 2 s. 2d ; wrights from is. 8d. to 23, and 
mill-wrights as high as 2S.-6d ; a day-labourer from is. 4d. to 
1 s. 8d ; oat meal fells at from 16 s. to 17s 6d. per boll ; beef 
and mutton from 4d. to 7d, per !b ; butter from iod. to 1 id •, 
cheefe, made of fkimmed milk, from 2d. to 3d, and of fweet 
milk, from 4^ to 6d ; eggs at from $cf. to pd. per dozen ; 
potatoes from 10s. to lis. per boll ; hens from is. 2d. to is. 
6d ; and chickens from 4d. to 6d. each. 

Advantages and Hints for Improvement. — The advantages of 
this parifh arife from the plenty of coal, lime and free-ftone 
in the greateft part of it ; from its vicinity to Paifley, Port- 
Glafgow and Greenock ; from the good roads already made, 
(including the new lines of road to be immediately fee on foot) 
and from the rapid increafe of manufactures, which mull 
very confiderably augment the value of the land. With 
thefe advantages, it is hoped that many of the feuers and 
farmers, who perfift in the old fafhioned fyftem of agricul- 
ture, may be induced, from the example of others, and a re- 
gard for their own intereft, to ufe better implements of 
husbandry, to follow a proper rotation of crops, and to at- 
tempt the culture of turnips, which are particularly adapted 
to the foil of this parifh.

monument of the unfortunate monarch j and fome derive the 
name of the parifh from the vanguifhed being obliged to .

tion.

riflics of Twynebolm, or Tivynebame, (as it is anciently and 
perhaps more properly wrote,) and Kirk-Chrijl, is objong;

the extent is about y mics by 2 j though, from the remoteft 
houfe in the one end to the remoteft houfe in the other, the 
dire£t diflance will not bemuch above 6 miles. The river Dee 
divides them from Kirkcudbright, upon the S. S. E. and S. 
E. and the water of Tarf from Tongland upon the E : A 
fmall bay of the fea wafhes the coafl. from the W. to the S. 

Surface and Soil. — The furface is moftly high-land, and, feen 
at a diflance, looks like an elevated plain •, but when entered 
upon, it rifes into knolls and arable hills, with fmall valleys and 
fome merfe land upon the borders of the Tarf and the Dee, 
until you approach the extremity towards the N. W. by N., 
when the view is bounded by hills covered with heath.— 
The foil is various, and generally formed from rag, and what is 
called in this country, ratten Jlone, decompounded by the in- 
fluence of fun and air, &amp;c. and fallen into earth. A great part 
of the foil lies upon this kind of rock, and fome of it upon 
a till bottom. There are clay, mofs, gravelly, and fandy 
foils, though very little of this laft. In general, the foil is 
light, dry and rich, and, when properly managed, repays the 
induftrious farmer with exuberant crops of grafs and corn. 

Climate and Difeafes.—h. good deal of rain falls generally 
upon the weft coaft, and thefe parifhes have their fhare of 
it, but not more than what is neceffary, confidering the dry- 
nefs of the foil. — Bordering upon the Weftern Ocean, our 
frofts in winter are of fliort continuance, and fnow very fel- 
dom lies fo long, as to do material damage to the ftore far- 
mer. The height of the ground in general, the drynefs of the 
foil, and the fea air, all contribute to the health of the inha- 
bitants ; fo that for 3 1 years, no epidemical djfeafe * has

Inoculation is almoft univerfally pra&amp;ifed amongft all ranks, 
w hich prevents the ravages of that loathfome difeafe die 
fmall-pox. 

Lakes, Rivers, Fijb, Mills, &amp;c. — The variegated furface, 
and the riling hills, make this parifh, for we fhall now confider 
them both as one parifh, under the name of Twyneholm, a- 
bound in rivulets and fprings. There are two lochs or lakes, 
the one upon the extremity of this parifh, and dividing it 
from Girthon, called Loch-Whinnion, abounding in yellow 
trouts ; the other called the Loch of Trojlrie, abounding in 
pikes. The river Dee, (which is navigable the whole way it 
runs along this parifh, and upon which there is a ferry boat 
between it and Kirkcudbright) abounds with falmon, grilfe, 
trouts, fea-trouts, and hirlings •, and at the fouthern extre- 
mity of the parifli, there are fome fmall cod and whitings 
taken by lines. The water of "Tarf, (navigable for vefTels of 
50 tuns burthen up to its lower bridge, upon which, in this 
parifh, there are a flour, a barley, and a corn * mill, ) has 
fome falmon, abounds in yellow and fea trouts, hirlings, and 
pars, a fmall red fpotted trout never found but where there 
are falmon. The burn of Twyneholm, which divides this pa- 
rim in the middle, and which drives a corn and a barley mill, 
abounds in all the fpecies of fifh found in the water of Tarf, 
except falmon. Another ftream of water, which runs along 

almoli 

have left this corner. The flow, nervous, and even an epidemical putrid fe- 
ver, frequently, during the above period, furroundtd thtfe parities and fome 
belonging to them were brought home from neighbouring parifhes, in the 
worft kind. But no fever, for the above period, has either fpread or become 
epidemical.

almoft the whole S. W. extremity of the parifh, abounds in 
trouts, and alfo drives a barley and a corn mill. The Lake 
of Glengnpe abounds in large yellow trouts. The three mills 
above mentioned are remarkably well fituatcd for exporting 
their flower, barley, and meal. The corn mill lies clofe upon 
the fmall bay of the fea. The other two lie, the one within a 
mile, and the other within half a mile of the harbour above 
mentioned, upon the water of Tarf, and not above two miles 
from two harbours upon the water of Dee, where velTels of 
confiderable burthen can eaGly come. 

Population. — As the feflion records have never been regu- 
larly kept, the ancient ftate of the population cannot now 
be afcertaincd. The variations, however, of the number of 
people within thefe 40 years, will appear from the follow- 
ing ftatement- A late aft of Parliament, now repealed, pre- 
vented the regiftration of births, marriages and burials, fo

Statijiical Account 



MamifaEhires and Village, — Several years ago, a gentleman 
generally efteemed, and of a remarkable mechanical genius, 
under the patronage of Lokd Daer, built a houfe in this 
parifh, not fur from the river Dee, for diftilling Britifli fpi- 
rits. An alteration in the diflillcry laws, and other circuni- 
ftances, occafioned him very foon to drop this branch of 
bufinefs ; upon which he propofed to convert the houfe in- 
to a manufacturing houfe for cotton : but the ftagnation of 
this branch of bufinefs put an immediate (lop to that under- 
taking alfo. It is now, by the fame gentleman, joined in com- 
pany with others, under the fame patronage, converted in- 
to a woollen manufacture ; and they have erected a teafing, 
or fcribling, and a carding machine, which are driven by a 
fmall ftream of water j they have alfo feveral hand jeanies. 
Upon account of fome improvements made in the machi- 
nery, they have greater demands for their yarn, than others 
engaged in this branch of bufinefs : and if the war now raging, 
the failure of credit in general, the lcarcity of money, or the 
incrcafing value of that article, do not put a flop to this ma- 
nufacture, a village begun nigh the above building will ra- 
pidly increafe, and increafe not only the population of this 
parifh, but that of Kirkcudbright alfo. There are, properly 
fpeaking, as yet no villages in this parifh ; for a few houfes 
built upon the military road below the church, and the be- 
gun village above mentioned, do not deferve that name. 

State cf Property, Rents, bfc— More than the one half of 
the parifh in value, though not in extent, belongs to the Earl 
of Selkirk. His Lordfhip's rents, however, amount not to 
the one half at prefent. Eight of the proprietors, either farm 
the whole, or a part of their own lands. The average rent 
of the arable land, except three farms in the N. part, runs

from i os. to til Sterling per acre. There are two farms let 
for grazing, without the liberty of plowing, for il. is. and 
tl 3s. Sterling per acre. Since 1763, the arable land yields 
above four times the rent it drew then : And one farm, be- 
longing to the Earl of Selkirk, yields 14 times the rent it 
paid in the year 1 761 ; yet the rents are better paid, and 
the farmers live better, than they did at that period. 

Cuitivailbh, Inchfures, Iffc. — This is a country fully bet- 
ter calculated for grazing than for the plough, though it 
pro rge crops when properly refted and manured. 

Hence the belt farmers have constantly in view the me- 
lioration of their grafs. Though fenfible of the benefit of 
uiures, and even willing to pay 7^-d. per cent per annum 
of the money Md out upon them, very little as yet is effectu- 
ally done in that way, owing to our (tones being hurt by the ac- 
tion of the fun and air, which makes the fences foon give way j 
ou^ ground, interrupted by rocky and gravelly knolls, renders 
hedging and ditching ineffectual, unlefs a degree of labour, 
care, and attention be given them, which the farmer has nei- 
time nor inclination to beftow. The want of wood fcr 
coping expofes the young thorns to the ravages of cattle j 
and a polled Galloway cow, if once me can thruft in her 
nofe, with (hut eyes v/ill force her way through a ftrong 
hedge. To remedy thefe defects, Lord Selkirk plants his 
hedges in a (tone facing, and builds up the ftones for coping 
and fencing. One thing is ftill wanting ; viz. that his Lord- 
fhip mould agree with a gardener, or fkilful workman, to keep 
his hedges in proper order, at fo much per rood, the tenants 
paying the expence along with the rent j this he has already 
done with refpect to clearing his eftate of moles.

Statiflical Account 



Manures.-— The manures, ufed are flicll marl, fca fhelh;, 
water lathing, paring and burning the furfV.cc, and dung. 
Shell marl, as a manure in thh part of Scotland, was firft 
uncovered and Ufed in this parifii, it being above 60 years 
fince it was applied for that jmrpofe. Of all manures, when 
the ground is gently ufed, and not worn out by ihe plough, 
it remains the Iongeft ; its efie£ts are mod confpicuous upon 
the grafs, producing the different clovers, particularly the 
white, and grafles of the belt quality and kinds ; and caufing a 
great luxuriance in their growth, and decpnefs of green in 
their colour. The quantity hid upon an acre is from 40 to 
60 cart loads, drawn by two horfes There is flill a large 
quantity of this excellent manure in the parilh, partcularly 
in Lord Selkirk's grounds. Sea fhells are of two kinds \ 
ihofe that are brought in by every tide, into the fmall bay at 
the S. corner of the parifli, and carted off at the ebb ; and a 
pretty large bank running along the fide bay, and beneath an 
arable field, called dry land JJjells. The firft, wet with a con- 
Cderable mixture of fand, are heavier to lead, but fpeedier 
in their effect. The quantity laid upon an acre of each is 
from 20 to 30 tons. Lime brought from England, and land- 
ed at the fide of the Dee, or the Tarff, colls the farmer is. 
Sterling, the Carlyfle bufhel of fhells, equal to three Winchef- 
tcr bufhels. From 30 to 70 bufhels unpacked are laid upon 
an acre. Leading a ftream of water over the furface of a 
ley field with the plough or the fpade, called ivatcr-tathwg, 
prevailed very much formerly in this parifh, before the ufe 
of the forementioned manures became fo general, and produ- 
ced excollent grain and grafs. It leaves the land hard bound, 
and unfit for the other manures, which produce little or 
no effec~r, upon water-tathed land ; and it cannot be repeated 
with any profit but at a confiderable diftance of time, except 

upon 



of Twynehohn and Kirk-Chrijl. 83 



upon meadow and grafs grounds. Paring and burning is 
in general the worft hufbandry, except upon a deep mod/ 
foil, with a clay bottom, when fo much of the mofs is burnt 
as to allow the plough to reach the clay, and mingle it, mofs 
and allies together ; then it produces luxuriant crops of grain 
and gr.ifs. Dung, the principal manure in farming, is too 
little attended to in this country : The want of inclofures 
and draw yards, mod of the cattle lying out in winter, are all 
realbns why fo little attention is paid to this valuable article. 
What is collected is generally expended upon our third crop 
ground, in producing potatoes and a few turnips. One of 
the three firil are generally laid on ley, or ground unbroken 
up ; and if laid on at lealt one year before it is plowed, they 
gradually fink into the ground, mix with the roots of the 
grak, are productive the fiift year, and do not fo foon fink 
out of the reach of the plough. Sometimes they are laid 
upon a fdlow, and the author has known them laid in the 
month of May upon the fpringing corn. 

Ploughs, Crops, £fc. — Our ploughs, light, drawn by two 
horfes, or three when old ley is broken up, without a driver, 
are moftly of the Englifh kind, with the Scotch head, which 
is found to anfwer bell in ftony ground. Though formerly 
the ox plough generally prevailed, yet it was totally laid a- 
fide, till Lord Uaer revived it, by ufing both oxen and heif- 
ers on a farm which he is improving in this parifh. One of 
the three firfl: kinds of manure above mentioned being laid u r 
pon the ground, it is fown with oats the firfl: two years. The 
third year dung being laid upon the field, if the farmer can 
procure this article, it is partly planted with potatoes, and fown 
with turnips, and the reft of the field either fown with peafe ' 
and beans, or left fallow. The fourth year, it is fown with 

I j 2 barley,

barley, rye grafs, rib'd grafs, and the different clovers, cut 
for hay one year, and paflured 8, then again broken up for 
corn. Wheat feldom turns out a profitable crop, owing to 
the wetnefs of our climate, and other caufts. 

Experiments tried with our rotten-done quarries, where 
the three firfl kind of manures are not to be obtained, might 
have a happy effect. In many places remote from ihele arti- 
ficial manures, mofs and turf are plenty. Kilns made of fods 
or turf might be erected, and the half dried peats burnt to 
afhes, at no great expence, which are well known to be an 
excellent manure for turnip?, grafs and grain. There are dif- 
ferent opinions, with refpe£t to the quantity, to be laid upon 
an acre, of the manures of the firft three dalles mentioned •, 
fome thinking a fmaller quantity, frequently repeated, heft ; o- 
thers, a large quantity laid on at once, and not repeated for 
fome considerable length of time. This depends in a good 
meafure upon the foil, and upon the manner of cropping the 
land. When the ground is treated, as above mentioned, and 
is kept fo long in pafture, the large quantities are, perhaps, 
beft, as having the mod effect upon the grafs ; and as it is by 
fermentation thefe manures operate, fuch a quantity, as will 
fully promote this, wiil he found neceffary, while a fmal- 
ler quantity will only produce a partial fermentation •, as 
beer, not having a fuilicient quantity of yeft, is always mud- 
dy, fluggifh and never clears. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions. A farm fervant receives 
from 61. to 9I. Sterling yearly, befides lodging, walking, and 
food. A cottager's benefit, when converted into mency, a- 
mounts to about 1 si. Sterling yearly. A reaper in harveft 
receives from 17s. to il. 5s. during the feafon. A woman 
fervant from 2.1. to 4I. Sterling yearly. A day-labourer's 

wages 



ofTwyneholm and Kirk-Chrift. 



wages are from iod. and is. in winter, to is. and is. 6d. in 
fummer, without victuals : A mafon's and joiner's per day, 
without meat is. 6d : A taylor's 8d. with victuals. The prices 
of all forts of provifions frequently vary, and depend very 
much upon the Whitehaven, Liverpool, and Glafgow mar- 
kets, to which we have ready and eafy accefs by fea. 

Horfesand Black Cattle. — There are a good number of hor- 
fes bred in this parifh, both for ufe and fale. They are 
moflly of the draught kind. The old breed of Galloways, fo 
highly valued for fpirit and fnape, and which continued a 
long time after the wreck of the Spanifh Armada, when feve- 
ral ltallions were thrown upon this coaft, is almoft entirely, if 
net totally extinct. The price of our horfes is from tcL to 3 oh 
Sterling. Our cattle, fo highly valued by the Norfolk farmers, 
are for the moft part polled, long haired, fhort and thick leg- 
ged for their height, ftraight backed, round bodied, well fpread 
at the loins, and deep dew-lapped. Our calves fuck their 
mothers \ none are fold to the butchers ; the males are cut 
young, the females generally about one year old ; and when 
cut, or [paved, they then with us obtain the name of lieifers. 
At one year old, they will bring from 2I. to 5I. Sterling •, at 
two they will bring from 4I. to 9I ; at three from 61 to iol. 
The bed of our two-year-olds are almoft always fent with 
our three-year-olds to the Englifh market. Our farmers can- 
not be too careful to preferve this breed ; for any trials to 
meliorate it by crofflng with other bulls, have hitherto failed,

perimenr, bought one of Mr BakewelPs bulls. He put the 
half of his cows to this, and the other half to a Moorland 
bull, bred upon his own eftatc. He fed the product equal- 
ly, till they were fent to market at Norfolk, when thofe bred 
from the Galloway bull, brought confiderably more money 
than the others, befides being eafier to feed. 

Slurp and W o'A. — Our Sheep are of five kinds. In the up- 
per part of this parifli, where there are two (beep farms, the 
flocks are of two different kinds : the one, a filial! fheep, with 
flecked or fnrittle face and legs, and fine wool. This breed 
has been from time immemorial in the country. The other, 
black faced and black legged, with large coarfe wool, brought 
lately from the head of Nithfdale. The wool of the firft kind 
fells at from 8s. to 10s. per (tone ; the wool of the other at 
from 4s. to 63. In the lower part of the pariih, there is the 
long legged Englifh Mug with wool, long, fine, and fit for 
combing ; and the broad fhort legged, fine, fhort woolled 
kind, called the Culley breed. There is a fifth breed, of the 
fmall, white faced, fhort fine woolled fpecies, which differ in 
nothing from the Cheviot breed. The wool of thefe different 
kinds feils at from 12s. to 16s. per ftone : 281b. Avoirdupois 
makes our ftone of wool. Lord Daer, who, in many in- 
ftances, has materially contributed to the advantage of this 
country, has introduced a breed from a Spanifh ram in his 
poffeffion 5 but as yet, there has not been time to reap the 
benefit of this improvement. 

Woods and Plantations' — The old timber found in our mof- 
fes fhows plainly, that woods had formerly abounded in this 
pariih, though they are now entirely gone, except the above 
mentioned wood at the old Gaftli of Cumpfton. There are 

fome

fomc other finall plantations, in different parts. But, in a 
few years, the rifing grounds along the Dee fide oppofks to 
St. Mary's ifle will be covered with wood, Lord Daer having 
already planted with difFereat kinds of trees a great many 
ncres of ground, and defigning to adorn Lord Selkirk'^ ex- 
ter.five eftate, in this and the neighbouring parifhes, with Mat- 
tered plantations. Wood, indeed, unlefs flickered from the 
W. or S. W. winds, does not thrive. Northern and Eaftem 
expofures are the bed in this country, for planting every 
kind of trees. 

Fuel, — Peats, turfs, and furze, or whins, were the general 
fuel of the inhabitants of this parifh till lately. The mofics 
in the lower part of the parifh being exhaufted, and the im- 
provement of the land having in a great meafure banifhed 
the firze, coals from Whitehaven, the duty being now ta- 
ken of, are the fuel already ufed by a great number of the 
inhabitants of this part of the parifh. The Northern part 
Hill make ufe of peats and turfs, as the modes abound in that 
quarter. The coals are fold for a guinea per ton } as it is' cal- 
led, though it confifts of 36 cwt. 

Church, School, and Poor. — The church, which is placed ex- 
actly in the center of the parifh, at the fide of the military 
road, where three other roads meet, was built in the year 
] 730, and the manfe in 1763. The ftipend is 59 1. 17s. 6d, 
all paid in money. The glebe confifts of near 30 acres, 
being the two glebes of Kirk-Chrift and Twynehame joined 
together at the church. The Earl of Selkirk is patron.— There 
is an eflablifhed fchool hard by the church ; the number of 
fcholars is about fixty. If once a houfe was built, and other 
f unds, provided for the fchool-mafter, were fettled, the living

will be worth between 30 1. and 40 1. Sterling yearly.— The 
poor are liberally fupplied by the weekly collections, and by 
the private charity of the inhabitants, who are opprefled by 
Irifh beggars and other vagrants •, owing to the military road, 
from the border of England, to Port-Patrick palling through 
the mid [I of the parifh. There is no funk money belonging 
to it. 

Roads and Bridges. — In the year 1 763, there were no good 
roads in this parifh •, a little after that period, the military 
road from the border of England to Port-Patrick was made, 
which paries through the midft of the parifh, and has contri- 
buted greatly to the improvement of the country. After 
this,, a road was made to Kirkcudbright, by the bridge of 
Tongland, which parts from the military road at the church 
of Twyneholm,' and another road from the military road at 
the Gatehoufe of Fleet to Kirkcudbright, by the ferry boat 
over the Dee, which panes through this parifh. An Act. of 
Parliament to convert the ftatute labour, contributes in fome 
meafure to keep all thefe roads, except the military one, in 
repair. But the beft directed roads in the parifh, are two 
from the church of Twynehame, (the one to the ferry boat 
of Kirkcudbright, and the other to the bay at the extremity 
of the parifh); and a third from the ferry along the fide of 
the Dee, till it joins the latter one at the faid bay ; opening 
;\n eafy communication from Kirkcudbright to the parifh of 
Ikrrgue, and a fpacious bay called Balmangan Bay. Thefe laft 
mentioned roads were planned and directed by Lord Daer, 
and executed moflly at his expence. As good roads are the 
fir ft and mod neceffary improvement in any country, though 
much hath been done, yet there (till remains much to do, not 
enly in this parifh, but in every part of the country ; and as

the converfion money at the prefent rate is totally inadequate, 
fome other method muft be adopted. Upon thefe accounts; 
the above mentioned noble perfoii propofed a bill to the 
county for their approbation, drawn up on the molt liberal, 
and at the fame time the mod equal plan. Opposition was 
made to it through miftake, through prejudice, and through 
party, and a clamour raifed againft it, which obliged it to be 
dropt for the prefent ; but till fome fuch plan is adopted, our 
roads will go to ruin, and will never be conducted upon a 
libera! plan. The bridges are four ; one over the Tarf, near 
the foot of that river, one over the Kirk-burn of Twyneholmi 
upon the military road nigh the church, and two others over 
fmaller ftreams. 

Antiquities \. — There are the remains of two old buildings 
in this parifli, both of them belonging to the Eail of Selkirk: 
The one, called the Cajlle of Cumpftone, is placed in a pleafant 
fituation, nigh to the junction of the rivers Tarf and Dee, fur- 
rounded with a fmall fpot of natural wood, the only one in- 
deed in the parifh. The other old building is fituated in the 
farm of Nuntown, oppofite to St Mary's Ifle. There are two

old burial place of Twyneholm, which was fituated about a gun-fliot from 
the prefent, nigh one of the doons, and not far from three of the moats, 
(but of which no veftige now remains, it being part of a corn field,) there was 
turned up by labourers employed by him to remove part of an old fence, a 
round piece of gold which he fuppofed to be the handle of a coffin. This 
piece he fent to Edinburgh, and received for it only three guineas, the perfon 
that bought it alledging that it. was not gold; but, as he obferved, if it ha* 
not been of that metal, the dealer would not have given fo much.

led the Gallows- Hill s hut, as the figure, ufc, and defign of 
thefe relicts of antiquity have been fo often explained by 
others, a repetition here is unnecr.fiury. 

Propofnl hnprovemenis. — There is a creek at the fide of th * 
Dee, very nigh the manufacturing houfe formerly mentioned, 
that might eafily be turned into a good harbour, flieltered 
from every ftorm. The adjacent field is commodious for wet 
and dry docks, fuch as they have at Liverpool \ the ftream 
of water that drives the machinery would ferve to clean 
them ; fpring tides 30 feet perpendicular ; and there is at the 
fame time confiderably more than 17 feet of water upon the 
barr at the mouth of the river. A great road opened from 
the kirk of Twyneholm to the N. N. W. through an open- 
ing in the hill of Glengape, would give accefs to manures 
landed in the Tarf or the Dee, for wild and barren grounds. 

Difadvaiitages- — The wetnefs of our climate, the fcarcity 
of fuel, and no rock fait upon our coaft, with other caufes, 
render that neceffary article at times fcarce and dear. For 
thefe two years pad, the fcarcity of this article has been 
fo great, about the term of Martinmas, as materially to hurt 
the fale of our fat cattle. This might be eafily remedied by 
allowing rock fait to be imported, or fait ready made from 
Liverpool, at the Scotch duties- One of thefe meafures ought to

of what metal the inftrument was made, or where to be found, or of what 
kind the coins were, no information can now be obtained. There have been 
feveral coins found nigh to thefe moats, but none of them are prefcrved.

ty of weights and mea/ures, which univerfally prevails both in 
England and Scotland, demands the attention of the Legifla- 
ture. In London a done weight of feveral commodities is 16 libs 
avoirdupoize j in Liverpool, or Whitehaven, the fame nominal 
quantity of the fame goods is only 14 lib. ditto ; in Dumfries, 
or in that part of this county that lies upon the other fide 
of the river Urr, a Scotch (tone of any commodity is 24 libs ; 
in New Galloway, which is in the fame county, it is 261b, and 
in all this part of the country round Kirkcudbright, it is 28 
Jibs, ditto: In other places, only 22 libs, make the ftone. 
Almoft every county in England has its bufiel, and every 
county in Scotland its peck, all differing one from another. 
The Winchester bufhel is now generally ufed in this county, 
to meafure all forts of grain ; and an hundred weight of pota- 
toes and a peck are the fame. 

Characler and Manners. — The people in general are chear- 
ful, fober, induftrious, and humane -, of an afpiring and in- 
dependent fpirit. There are not at prefent above four men 
in the ftation of fervants, that were born and educated in 
this parifh. Seventeen young men, if not more, within 
thefe few years, have gone to England, America, and the 
Weft Indies, in the mercantile line ; three to the fea ; befides 
feveral families that emigrated before the commencement of 
the American war. Since the year 1763, there is a vaft dif- 
ference in the houfes, drefs and manner of living. There 
were then only two houfes covered with flate ; now there are 
about thirty. Englifli broad cloth, and fancy vefts of cot- 
ton, are the drefs of the men, when they go to church or 
market. Siik cloaks and bonnets, printed gowns, and cotton 
ftockings, the drefs of the women. In the year ; 763, there

Now it is ufed in every family. In 1763, at Martin-

parifh, our remotenefs from public market making it necef- 
fary to fait provifions for winter •, now there are about forty, 
befides a great many fwine, a pig being kept and fed by al- 
moft every houfeholder, together with lamb and mutton in 
fummer and harveft ; butcher meat, of one kind or another, 
making a great part of the diet of the farmers and their fer- 
vants, which, perhaps, is cheaper upon the whole, than the 
low diet upon which they were formerly fed.

Name, Extent, and Situation, 



JL he etymology of the name cannot be afcertained with 
precifion. If it be of Gaelic extraction, fome information 
may be received from thofe quarters where that language is 
underftood. There are other two parifhes of the fame name, 
the one a few miles from Invernefs, and in that' county ; the 
other in Rofs-fhire. This parifli extends about 4 miles from E. 
to W. and 3 from N. to S ; and lies at an equal diftance from 
Elgin on the W. and the river Spey on the E ; the poft road 
paffing along it on the S.

nrier period been covered by water, as there are evident 
marks of the fea having receded from the coaft : The reft 
is a good deal more elevated, and of an unequal waving fur- 
face. The fea coaft, which is about 4 miles in extent, is 
low and fandy ; it contains no creek nor landing place of 
any kind. Our grain, which is our only article of exporta- 
tion, is (hipped from Speymouth or Lofsiemouth ; and our 
great article of importation, which is coals, is imported at 
the fame harbours ; the former of which is at the diftance of 
4 miles, and the other of 6. It is proper here to mention, 
that this, as well as feveral other neighbouring parilhes, was 
formerly ill fupplied with fuel •, but now, that article is ren- 
dered much lefs expenfive, by taking off the high duty on 
coals, that was laid on with little attention to political c- 
conomy, and which has lately been abolifhed by the ex- 
ertions of a great ftatefman •, to whom this country is more 
obliged on account of that meafure, and many others, than 
to any other native of this part of the united kingdom. 

Climate, — The air is dry and falubrious, and the peo- 
ple in general healthy ; there are, however, few inftances of 
remarkable longevity to be met with. The climate here, like 
that of all that narrow tra£r, of land, which lies along the fouth 
fide of the Moray Firth, is mild and temperate to an extra- 
ordinary degree : Its fuperiority, in that refpe£l, over the 
high country, is moft remarkable in the fpring months. Of- 
ten in that feafon, while all the operations of husbandry are 
going forward in the low parts of Moray, there are many 
places in the high country, diftant only a few miles, where 
thefe operations meet with a total interruption, from the in-

Soil and Cultivation; &amp;c— The foil is various, and, though in 
general light and fandy, is of a kindly and fertile nature, ex- 
reedingly well adapted for railing turnips, potatoes, barley, and 
ill kinds of artificial gralles. And a confiderable part of it 
,vould be extremely fit for wheat, if there were any opportuni- 
y of procuring fuffieient quantities of manure. Notwitbftand- 
ng the mildnefs of the climate, and the kindlinefs of the foil, 
igriculture has made but (low advances. Some patches of 
urnips are indeed to be feen, and a few acres are fown with 
frafs feeds but the fields in general are rather in a ftate of 
jad cultivation. This feems to be occafioned, in a great 
neafure, by the expence and difficulty of conftrucling fuf- 
icient inclofures •, there being no ftone quarries in the pa- 
i(h, nor any Hones in the fields fit for this purpofe ; and 
horn hedges are fo long of coming to perfection, and fo diff- 
icult to be fenced when they are young, that no tenant, on 
i leafe of ordinary endurance, can attempt them with any 

profpe6t 

* It may likewife be obferved, as a farther proof of the excellency of tins 
:limate, that in the end of the laft, and beginning of the prefent century, 
vhile there was fo great a deficiency in the crops, in many parts of Scot, 
and, as bordered on a famine, owing to the cold and wet feal'ons ; in Moray, 
it that period, the land was fo productive, as not only to fupply its own in- 
labitants, but alfo to fpare confiderable quantities of grain for the fubfifh— 
:nce of their neighbours. And it is a fact well afcertained, that in thofe year* 
f fcarcity and dearth, people came from the mire of Angus, to purchafe 
)at meal in this country, for which they paid at the rate of 30 s. per bcl!.

profpetT of fuccefs. The farms alfo are of too fmall extent 
for carrying on any fubftantial improvements in agriculture. 
There are a few that may contain from 60 to 100 acres ; 
but the common run is from 20 to 30. 

Farm Re/its and Ploughs, &amp;c. — The rent of land varies 
according to the nature of the foil •, there are fome fields let 
for 20s. per acre, while others are below lag. ; the average 
rent may be from 10s. to 15s. The ploughs, of which there 
are above 100, fome of Engliih, fome of Scotch conftrucTion, 
are drawn chiefly by a pair of horfes. In this branch of 
farming, an improvement has been introduced about 20 years 
ago, which now begins to be pretty generally adopted ; that 
is, plowing with two oxen, harnelTed in the fame manner as 
horfes. This method is warmly recommended, and the ad- 
vantages of it fully explained by the late Lord Kaimes, in his 
book called The Gentleman Farmer. 

Produce, Exports, isfc. The produce of this parifh, con- 
fids principally of barley and oats ; befides fupplying the in- 
habitants, it exports annual'y a confiderable quantity of grain ; 
which mud increase yearly, partly by the increafing improve- 
ments of agriculture, but chiefly by the ufeof potatoes, which 
are now almoft univerfally cultivated, and during a great part 
of the year, are, in a manner, the principal fubfiftence of a 
confiderable number of the inhabitants. This food, which 
at firft was not in general ufe, becomes more and more fo e- 
very day, from the various modes that have been difcovered 
of drefling it, by different feafonings, at little or no expence. 
They make an excellent diih with milk, but above all with 
onions, which are raifed in abundance in this county, and 
fold at fuch a moderate price, as to come within the reach 
of the pooreft inhabitant.

State of Property, Plantations, &amp;c. — Four fifths of this 
parifh are the property of the Earl of Fife *, whofe planta- 
tions are executed with uncommon tafte and judgement, 
and add much to the beauty and ornament of the country. 
In fome places, he has planted moors and hills of great ex- 
tent, but what makes the moll beautiful appearance, is a num- 
ber of little rifing grounds, all of which he has covered with 
fingular good tafte, and fo as to make their appearance with 
relation to each other extremely beautiful. In all thefe plan- 
tations, the Scotch fir at prefent predominates ; but his Lord- 
fhip every year caufes a great many of thefe to be cut down, 
and the voids to be filled up with beeoh, oak and other de- 
ciduous trees §. Befides thefe plantations, Lord Fife has 
planted hedges, and hedge rows in particular places along 
the high ways, that fhew much fancy, and will afford con- 
fiderable utility and warmth ; the hedge rows, before they 
were planted, were pollards of a confiderable fize, and are 
thriving exceedingly well. A fmall plantation, at the place 
where the road to the houfe of Innes leaves the high road, 
two miles eaft of Elgin, from the beauty of its lines, muft 
ftrike every traveller, and the hedge rows are continued a 
confiderable length along the high road. In mentioning the 
high road, it is but juftice to Lord Fife to let it be known,

* About 26 years ago, his Lordfliip purchafed the eQate of Innes ; and 
being at that time proprietor of confiderable eftatcs in the adjacent parifhes ; 
the eftate of Innes, and the lands of Urquhart, lately acquired by an exchange 
with the family of Gordon, he became poffeffed of fo large a fracl of proper- 
ty all contiguous, and comprehending a great variety of ground, that he ha9 
been enabled to execute plantations of very large extent. 

§ Previous to the year 1779, at which period about one half of thefe 
plantations were formed, there were always planted in each acre 3000 Scotch 
firi : Since that time the proportion has only been uoe to each acre.

that fince he became proprietor of Inr.es, all the highways 
within the parilh have been properly attended to, judkiouily 
directed, and, by a regular application of the ftatute labour, 
kept in a ilate of good repair \. The only other heritor is 
Mr feouft of Leuchars %, who has about one fifth of the 
real rent of the parifh. He is at uncommon pains to raifc 
and fence hedges ; he has planted ftripes and belts about the 
ground round his houfe to a very coufiderable extent, befides 
feveral clumps fimilar to thofe executed by Lord Fife. Thefe 
clumps, like his Lordlhip's, at prefent confift chiefly of Scotch 
firs •, but the plantations around his farm, and about his houfe, 
arc all deciduous trees of the bed kinds ; oak, afh, and witch 
elm, with a proper mixture of larix, which are all uncom- 
monly well preferved, befides being kept under the hoe for 
feveral years after they are planted. The water of Loffy runs 
through the property of this gentleman ; that river fwells 
iometimes to a great height, and frequently flooded the low 
ground on each fide ; but of late, with great induftry and 
merit, embankments have been conftrudted, that will contain 
the river, and in a great meafure prevent future inundations : 
By this circumftance the value of his lands is conliderably 
raifed. 

Lakes, 

f The houfe of limes, one of Lord Fife's numerous feats, had been many 
years ago partly deftroyed by accidental fire. Since his Lordfliip became its 
poffeffor, it has been repaired at a very confiderable expence, and fitted up 
in the mod fafhionable ftile ; a large addition has been made to the gardens, 
and the grounds about the houfe have been laid out in the beft tafte ; the 
whole makes now one of the moll pleafant and elegant places of refidence in 
the North. 

\ Before Mr Innes fucceeded to this eftate, it had been in the poffcflJoo 
of a gentleman who paid very little attention to improvements of any kind. 
Since the prefent gentleman became proprietor, it has undergone a very 
great alteration to the better.

Lakes, FiJIj, Water Fowls, fcrV.— There is one lake in this 
parifh called the Loch of Cotts. Pike is the only full it con- 
tains : In winter it is frequented by a confiderable number 
of fwans, and, in the fpring and autumn, by flocks of geefe, 
ducks, and other water fowls. At the upper part of the 
parifh, there is another lake called Lochnabeau, partly in this 
parifh, and partly in Lhanbryd. Lochnabeau is in the middle 
of what was formerly an extennve bare moor •, about 20 years 
ago Lord Fife planted the moor, and particularly carried his 
plantations round the verge of the lake. Thefe plantations 
are now far advanced, and by their vicinity to the water, 
which is uncommonly limpid and clear, form a moft beauti- 
ful and delightful fcene. 

Stags. — This improvement, however, has been attended 
with one inconvenience. In fome fevere winters, feveral 
years ago, a few flags and hinds came down to the low coun- 
try from the Duke of Gordon's forefts of Glenfiddich and 
Glenavon ; of late years they have taken up their refidcnce in 
the neighbourhood of Lochnabeau, and the plantations a- 
round it, and are become fo fond of their new habitation, 
that they have never returned to their native forefts ; on the 
contrary, they increafe every year, by breeding, and by the 
addition of frefli emigrants. Thefe animals make 3 very 
fine appearance, and afford much pleafure and amufement 
to the fportfman ; it is therefore to be regretted that they are 
fo hurtful to plantations and agriculture. Throughout the 
fummer, they paflure in the night time on the corns ; in the 
winter on turnips ; and in the fpring, as the winter crops of 
rye and wheat are then fartheft advanced, they are particular- 
ly deftrucYive to them ; but the Items of potatoes feem to be 
their favourite food, as they are known to pafs through fields 
»f corn in order to broufe on them. Upon the whole, it were

much to be wifhed, that they were either driven back to their 
antient habitation, or utterly exterminated. The lad mea- 
iure has been fuceefsfully followed by a worthy nobleman in 
the weftern part of this county, celebrated for his extenfive 
and flourilhiug plantations, who kept hounds for the folc 
purpofe of extirpating tliofe deftructive animals. I need 
hardly fay that the nobleman 1 mean is the Earl of Moray. 
If thefe plantations have attracted the deer to this corner, it 
has been remarked tint they have not been favourable to 
the increafe of hares and patridges : this may be owing tu 
the protection which they afford to beafts and birds of prey. 
Were gentleman to give fmall premiums for the deftruction 
of thefe vermin, it would prove more effectual in pref^rving 
the game and increaGng its numbers, than all die game laws 
that ever were, or ever will be enacted, 

Church, School, and Poor. — The prefent incumbent, who is 
a bachelor, had his prefentaiion from the Duke of Gordon ; 
but the patronage of the church has fince been conveyed 
to the Earl of Fife, at the time that the exchange of lands 
took place between his Lordfhip and the family of Gordon. 
The ftipend, by a decree obtained Febriiary 1793, is 8 chal- 
ders victual and 40I. Sterling, including 5I. for communion 
elements. The glebe confifts of 5 Scotch acres. Some 
years ago, the minifter entered into a contract with the heri- 
tors, for keeping the manfe and offices in repair during his 
incumbency, for which he receives an annuity of 15!. Ster- 
ling, befjdes 30L paid per advance. The church was com- 
pletely repaired about 18 years ago. — A new fchool-houfe 
was then built ; the fchool-mailer's fahry is 12 bolls of oat 
meal, and 6 bolls of barley. — The average number of poor in 
this pavifh is about 20. „The funds for their fupport aiife

a great difference to the better may be remarked in their 
clothing, their cleanlinef:«, and every other circumflance that 
tends to make life more agreeable. Their habitations have 
likewife been very much improved ; within lefs than the pe- 
riod above mentioned, there have been upwards of 50 neat 
farm houfes built in this parifli, either by the landlord or the 
tenant. 

Character. — Though the number of ale-houfes, mentioned 
in the table, may, at firft appearance, feem to bear hard upon 
the fobriety of the people, it is to be remarked, that only two 
of thefe houfes retail any confiderable quantity of ale or whif- 
ky. The people in general are very fober, and diligent in their 
feveral occupations ; their efforts of induftry being as well 
directed as their fituation and circumflances will permit. 

Antiquities. — The fite of the old priory f has lately been 
converted into an arable field \ and the name of Abbcy-nvell, 
which the country people ftill give to the fountain that fup- 
plied the Monks with water, is the only memorial of it that 
jiow remains. 

Propofed 

f In the nth century, the whole of this parifh was King's property. As 
early as the year II Z5, a priory, dependent on the Abbey of Dunfermline, 
■was ere«£Le] at Uiquhart. It was very liberally endowed ; all the lands now 
tailed the Lordfhip of Urguhart, the lands of Fochabers, as well as feveral o- 
thcrs in this county, together with a part of the fifhing on Spey, appertained 
to it. It appears that about the year 1345, this cell, as well as that of Pluf- 
cardene fell into diforder ; and the Roman Pontiff having commiffioned the 
bifhops of Scotland, to enquire into thofe irregularities, it was foon after fepa- 
rated from Dunfermline, and conjoined to Plufcardene, with which it continu- 
ed united till the Reformation. At and before that period, the priors began 
to feu out the lands, referving only in their own poffeffion the manor places 
anvl mills; the revenue which by that method they drew from thence, if we 
*tke int» the account the teinds, multure*, and fcrviccs, would even at this

Prepoftd Bridge. — This account ought not to be conclud- 
ed, without mentioning the fatisfatlion entertained in this pa~ 
rifh, and the reft of the country, at the late prof peel: there 
was of a Bridge acrofs the Spey. At prefent the ferry is 
extremely troubiefome, attended with fome danger, and nc- 
celfurily very expenfive to travellers. If there were a bridge 
thrown acrofs that river, the commerce and intercourfe of the 
country would be very much increafed j travelling would be 
rendered much more eafy and comfortable ; and, above all, 
it would be fmgularly ufeful for the march of the King's 
troops ; this, in the winter, being the only road by which 
they can pafs either South or North, For thefe reafons it is 
univerfally hoped, that meafures for a bridge acrofs the Spey, 
which have been begun, and generoufly promoted, by a molt 
illuftrious family 4" in the neighbourhood, will be taken up 
by government, and aided by the fubfeription of every per- 

fon 

day be nearly adequate to a moderate rent. The priory was fituated a little 
to the eaft: ot" the prefent church, in the midft of a morafs, and probably went 
to ruin foon after its union with Plufcardene. In the year 16^4, the greater 
part of the materials were carried off to build a granary near the fhore at 
Garmouth ; the remainder, foon after that period, was employed in repairing 
the manfe, and inclofing the church-yard. 

In the year 1160, the Moravicnfes, or inhabitants of Moray, (for what 
caufe is not now known) took up arms ; they were met in the moors 
of Urquhart by the King's army, which was fent to quell the infurrection, 
and, as we learn from fome of our hiftorians, were, after an obftinate re- 
finance, defeated there with great {laughter. As the inhabitants of Moray 
were at that period, according to Buchannan, of a refllefs and turbulent dif- 
pofition, all the families engaged in this rebellion were difperfed through 
the different provinces of Scotland. It is faid that thofe who were then re- 
movedinto the Northern Counties, received the name of Sutherland, which 
their defcendents ftill retain, and that thofe who were fent to the South, 
affumed the firnamc of Murray, which they likewife have tranfmitted f 
their pofterity.

end, and are likely to be continued Eaft-ward to the river

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Cushny, Mini/let:</head>

<p>

Name, Form, Extent, Rivers, and FiJJj. 

t fi origin of the name of this parifh is unknown. It 
is commonly pronounced Eai. Its extent varies from 3 
to 4 miles in breadth and length, and its form is yftry irregu- 
lar. The river Don divides it from Monymufi: on the South. 
The rivers Ury and Shevoch bound it on the North and 
N. E. And the fmall river Gady runs into the Ury at the 
Eaftern extremity of the parifh. The Ury and the Gady 
produce eels and trouts, but there are no falmon found in 
thefe fmall rivers, except in the fpawning feafon. 

Soil, Cultivation and Roads.— The foil of the greater part of this 
parifh is, in general, extremely fertile. The lands near the 
church are very rich and early ; the harveft commonly be- 
gins eight days fooner here than in any of the neighbouring 
parifhes. A fmall part of the parifli lies South of the high

mountain of Benochie, and the lands there are neither fo 
early nor fo fruitful as thofe on the North fide. The new 
plan of farming is gaining ground here, but very (lowly, and 
is far from being general. This perhaps is owing in fome 
meafure to the farmers being attached to the old huibandry, 
but more to their being at a great diflance from the means 
of improvement, and to the roads being exceedingly bad. 

Propofed Canals. — A canal from Aberdeen to Inverury a- 
long the fouth fide of the Don, and another from Inverury 
to Old Rayne, is at prefent projected. If thefe public fpirited 
enterprifes fucceed, they will be of very great importance to 
the diftricl: of Garioch, whatever profits the firft fupportero 
of the fcheme may derive from the undertaking. Before 
lime and marie were ufed in agriculture, the lands in this 
parilh, and in the whole cliftrict, were confidered as the befl: 
lands in the county, and the Garioch was commonly called 
the Granary of Aberdeen. But of late years the parilhes on 
the fea coait, which were not naturally fo fertile, have been 
more improved ; and this di(lri£t, for which nature had done 
fo much, has received but little afiiftance from art. But if 
the canals take place, it is probable, that the diftricl of the 
Garioch will become one of the mod fertile and molt valu- 
able diftricls in Scotland. 

Ohjlrucllons to Improvement . — The farmers are in general 
not opulent. The leafes are too fhort : And very high mul- 
tures at the mills are a great bar to agriculture, in this and fe- 
veral other neighbouring parilhes. In this parifh the eleventh 
peck of corns ground at the mill is fometimes paid ; and com- 
monly the thirteenth peck is paid for multures and fervices. 
One of the heritors in this parifh propofes to take ofF the 

multures

multures, and it is hoped he will be imitated by the ether 
proprietors in the neighbourhood. 

Oimate and pifeafei. — The air, in general, is pure and 
very healthy, and few epidemical difeafes prevail. The 
rheumatifm is the mod common diforder, which, in this 
diftria, is felt more by people of better ftation, than by the 
poorer fort of people. 

Fore/} and Fruit Trees. — There is a great number of large 
afh, plane, beech, birch, elm, oak, pine, fir, walnut and 
chefnut trees, all above 60 years old, near the houfe of Weft- 
hall. There is likewife a very great number of apple, pear, 
cherry, geen and plumb trees, which, though much neglec- 
ted for thefe 40 years, commonly bear fruit.* There are 
fome very large old Scotch firs near the houfe, * and, half a 
mile diftance from it, there are two thriving plantations of 
young Scotch firs; 

There is likewife a large plantation of Scotch firs on that 
part of the eftate of Pittodry, which lies in this parifh. At 
Tillyfour there is a confiderable number of fruit and other 
kinds of trees, befides two large plantations ; the one of 
Scotch firs* and the other of hazel. It is a moll beautiful ro- 
mantic place, and a very pleafant fummer feat. 

Population. 

* Mr John Horn, Advocate, about 90 years ago, beautified this place 
very much with feveral plantations of firs, which throve fo well, that it is 
laid he hinifelf was buried in a coffin, made out of a fir tree of his own plan- 
ting. He likewife made out a fine avenue from the entry of his houfe, 
which at laft afcends a pretty little green hill, on the top of which he built a 
fmall lodge, of two rooms, and cahVd it Parnassus. He ornamented his 
feat with a great number of pleafure walks, with ftatues in them, which 
fhow a great deal of tafle, confidciing how long it is fincc thefe walks w*r«

miles north from Aberdeen, and 9 from Inverury ; and 
the road from Aberdeen to Huntly paffes through Old Rain, 
a poft town on the Southern extremity of the parifh. The 
river Urie divides it on the S. W. from the parifh of Oyne. 
The figure of the parifh is- nearly a fquare, each fide of which 
is about two miles, and the church is very centrical. There 
is a hill upon the north fide of the parifh covered with heath 
and hard weeds ; and the reft of the parifh is pretty flat, 
with a few gently nfing fpots. 

Soil 



of Rayne. 



Sail and Cultivation. — The in-field foil is generally a rich 
loam, with a clay bottom } and, when well managed, produ- 
ces good crops. The prefent miniftcr has often had a re- 
turn, after a crop of turnips, of 14 bolls of good bear, upon 
an acre fowed with ten pecks. The out-field, which con- 
ftitutes more than two thirds of the arable ground, is gene- 
rally of a light loamy foil, and, when dunged and limed, 
produces grain of a (harper and better quality, than the 
in-field. The large farms, which are very few, are plowed 
by oxen, of S or 10 in a plough. But the greateft part of 
the parifh confifts of crofts, or fmall holdings, plowed by 
two horfes, and fometimes two horfes and fWo cows, and that 
very imperfectly. The tenants are at no pains to clean their 
grounds of a great deal of weeds, fuch as runches or wild 
muftard, knot-grafs, couch-grafs, and wild oats. Indeed 
there are too many fmall crofts ; and the occupiers of them 
are fo poor, that their cattle have not ftrength enough to 
plow and drefs them properly. As there is plenty of peat 
mofs, which moft of the parifhioners have a right to, the pro- 
prietors have by this means broken down the pofTefiions, and 
raifed their rents ; but this has been a bar to the improvement 
of the ground. A better mode of farming, however, has of 
late got in among fome of the tenants, who bring lime from 
Aberdeen, and lay down an acre with turnips yearly, and the 
year after fow it with bear, and red clover and rye-grafs 
feeds. They already fee the great advantage of thefe little 
improvements, and they will doubtlefs foon extend them far- 
ther ; and others will be led to follow their example. Their 
great diftance from lime or manure of any kind is no fmall 
obftacle to improvement. 

Produce, Seafons and Wages.— The. principal grain raifed 
in the parifh is bear and oats ; of the in-field, generally one 
1 third

third is bear and two thirds are oats. Every tenant plant* 
as many potatoes as ftrves his own family, and fometimes a 
few more, which are fold at fid. the peck of 16 lib. weight ; 
but there is little demand for that article. We generally 
fow our oats about the middle of April, and our bear from 
the beginning to the middle of May. Our potatoes are 
planted about the beginning of May. In an ordinary year, 
our bear is ripe by the 20th of Auguft, and our oats by the 
firft week of September. We have very few labourers. A man 
fervanr/s wages is from 6 1. to 8 1. a year ; and a maid fer- 
vant's from 2 L 10 s. to 3. 1. Sterling. 

Fuel and Plantations. — On the N. E. fide of the pa- 
rifh there is an extenfive peat mofs, which affords excellent 
fuel, though it confumes a great deal of the farmer's time in 
cafting, drying, and bringing home his peats, and which 
might be applied with more profit to the other purpofes of 
agriculture. This mofs feems once to have been covered 
with oak, alder, and hazle trees ; as oak trees of a large 
flze are ftill found at a great depth, and fo frefii as to be of 
fonie ufe. There are at prefent but a few acres planted 
with trees in the parifh, and thefe are the common Scotch 
firs. There are alfo a few afh, elm, and plane trees, on 
different fpots of ground. 1 

Minerals, Roads and Wild ^iiadrupeds. — Such ftones as 
are in the parifh are of the hard iron kind, but they are eafi- 
Iy blown with gun powder, and dreffed for building. Our 
roads are kept in tolerable repair. As there is a great deal 
of broom in the out-fields, hares are very common, and there 
are alfo fome polecats and foxes. 

Climate. — The air is dry and remarkably wholefome, as 
the whole county of Garioch is, and many of the people live 



of Ray ne. 113 

a great age. Rayne lies in an open country, having one ridge 
of hills to the S. W. and another to the N. E. The dry- 
nefs of the air is owing to this local fituation of the parifb. 
The clouds are attracted by thefe ridges of hills on each 
fide, and fogs often reft upon the tops of them, while the in- 
habitants enjoy a clear and dry air in the open country. 
Sometimes again, when the clouds break into rain on the 
hills, or on the fides of the hills, the ficirts only of the fhow- 
er reach us in the open country. 

Difeafes. — We have no epidemical difeafes. — In fpring and 
autumn fome fevers appear among the poor people, who live 
upon a low diet. Thefe are generally of the nervous kind ; 
but when the patients apply timeoufly for medical afliftance, 
the fever often gives way to wine and bark, and good atten- 
tion to air and cleanlinefs. We have many flight fore throats, 
that are relieved by bliftering and gargling. Many of the 
parilhioners are fubject to fcurvy, and other cutaneous dif- 
orders, which appear upon their faces, hands and legs. This 
perhaps arifes from the poornefs of their food, confifting of 
pottage, brofe and fowens, oat-meal cakes, kail, potatoes, 
:urnips and milk. They ufe little ale, and that not of a good 
quality. But the moll fatal difeafe is pneumotua^ or confump- 
:ion, which cuts^ff 7 or 8 young people every year. And 
what is very melancholy, there are at prefent more than 20 
serfons affli&amp;ed with real fcrophula, and the number of 
uch has increafed of late ; while the parifhioners intermar- 
y with one another, they never pay attention to this matter. 
Religious prejudices againft inoculation for the fmall-pox 
ire wearing away, and the praftice of inoculating children 
s getting in. But till it univerfally prevail in a country like 
his, it will not be a real bleffing. The infeftion is com- 
nunicated from the inoculated to the children of thofe who

flill retain their old prejudices; and thus we have the ImalU 
pox raging every year in a place where, (as the writer here- 
of remembers,) about 30 years ago, the diftemper ufed to 
come about only once in 4 or 5 years. Among the female 
fex, who are moftly employed in the fedentary work of knit- 
ting (lockings for the Dutch market, chronic or low hyfteric 
complaints arc very common.

Manufacture . — The only manufacture is the knitting of 
ftockings, in which ail the. women are employed, and fome 
of the boys and even Id men. It is fuppofed, that this ar- 
ticle may yield to the parilh about 400I. Sterling. The hofe 
are of that coarfe kind, which bring for working the pair 12 
or 1 4 pence Sterling ; and fome of the women will knit two 
pairs, or two pairs and a half in the week. If it were not 
for this laft article, the rents of the fmall crofts could not be 
paid, as the crofters have no other way of earning money, but 
by annually rearing a young ox or cow. 

1 

Exports and Cattle. — There is annually about 200 bolls of 
meal carried out of this parifh to the Aberdeen market j and, 
as nearly as can be found, 180 cattle, young and old, bought 
up and driven to the fouth country, by dealers in that arti- 
ticle, worth at an average 3I. a head- There are very few 
horfes reared, and not above 200 fheep kept in the parifh. 

Proprietors, Rents, &amp;e— The grofs rent of the whole parifh 
in money, and meal at 10s. per boil-, is about 1 300I. Sterlings 
and the valued rent 2544I. Scotch. The proprietors are Alex- 
ander Leith of Freeneld, James Horn Elphinftone of Logie, 
John Forbes of Blackford, Alexander Leflie of Wartle, and 
' Alexander Stewart of Loanhead, Efquires. The medium 
rent of the in-field is 20s. Sterling per acre. There is meal 
paid for the out-fields, at the rate of from 2s. to 8s. or 9s. 
the acre. Some of the fmall crofts are rented as high as 30s; 
per acre. 

Church, end School,.— -The prefent ftipend is 42I. Ster- 
ling, 32 bolls of meal, and 16 boils of bear; but a procefs 
of augmentation is in dependence. The manfe was built in 
1751 for icool. Scotch. The fchool-houfe was lately built 

P * for

Statiflical Account 



for tffl, Sterling, and the fchool-mafler's falary is but eight 
bolls of meal. The heritors in general are averfe to the giv- 
ing of a legal falary. 

Poor. — The average number of poor that receive alms is 
from 15 to 20. The annual fum expended for their relief is 
about 20I. Sterling, which is all produced by the collections in 
the church on Sundays, excepting the intereft of 90I. Sterling 
appropriated to them. Thefe 1 5 or 20 perfons live in houfes 
of their own, and there is not one in the parifh that begs 
from door to door. Notwithstanding this, we are much 
trpubled with beggars, efpecially from the Highlands in 
fummer, when we mud fometimes ferve half a dozen of them 
in one day. 

Obftacies to Improvement.- — There are here, as in the neigh- 
bouring pari flies, great bars to improvement. The lime is dif- 
tant 23 miles. Many of the tenants have no leafes. Since 
1782, fome have fallen a little in arrears with their rents, and 
feem to want that fenfe of fecurity which ftimulates indus- 
try. When a pofleiTion is vacant, there is not always the 
proper diftincYion made between a good and fubflantial ten- 
ant, and one who promifes a great rent, but often fails to 
pay it. 

Mills, Multures, Services, bfc. — There are five mills in 
the parifh. At firft the conftru&amp;ion of a mill was a work 
of ingenuity, and the proprietor obliged his tenants to grind 
all their corn at his mill. But it requires no great genius 
now-a-days, to conftruct a mill. The tenants pay thirlage, 
and are reftrifted to a particular mill. This fometimes a- 
mounts to the 1 7 th peck. They pay alfo multures, or the price 
©f grinding, which is often the 3 2d peck. They pay alfo to 

die 



of Ray ne. 1 1 7 

the miller a lick of goodwill, or a bannock, which tenants have 
fometimes allowed to be meafured ; and there are inftances 
where another unmeafured lick has crept in. Even the feeds 
fifted from the bannock are fometimes paid. When all thefe 
items are added together, they amount at fome mills to a 

' twelfth or eleventh part of the whole corn carried to the mill. 

, This is a fevere tax upon the induftry of an improving 
tenant. Sometimes too the corn that grows on farms thir- 
led to a mill, is obliged to pay multure, whether the corn be 
ground at that mill or not. Except the expence of grinding, 
all thirlage fhould be commuted to the tenant, in order that 
he may reap the benefit of his own induftry. But we have 
one inftance here where even this is prevented, the ten- 
ants of one eftate being thirled to the mill of another. Ano- 
ther abfurdicy is, that Jhillen, i, e. fhealing, or hulter corn, is 
meafured by the tackfman of the mill, and is paid, not in 
fhealing, but in meal. There are accordingly great com- 
plaints that the corn is not well (healed. Another evil is, 
thatthereis a mill peck, which generally holds as much fhealing 
as will grind to three and fometimes four pecks of meal. 
For the fhealing of the ftock, the tenant pays meal meafur- 
ed with a ccg, or wooden difh, that pays for a certain quan- 
tity of fhealing. There is alfo another cog for fmall quan- 
tities of fhealing. And if all thefe meafures were accurate- 
ly fixed and proportioned, there would be lefs injuflice ; but 
that is not the cafe. The multurer is allowed to mend them 
or make them anew, or alter them as he pleafes. There 
ought to be a book kept by the proprietor of the mill, and 
figned by him and the multurer, and the principal tenants, 
in order to afcertain the exact contents of thefe feveral mea- 
fures. We have alfo fome Gothic fervices done by the tenants., 
that ought to be abolifhed, fuch as reaping, earing, plow- 
ing,

ing, harrowing, driving out clung, and bringing home lime and 
other articles to the landlord gratis. 

Antiquities and Character. — We have no antiquities, ex- 
cepting two Druidical temples, which are common in every 
parifli of this county and Come cairns, under one of which 
there is a tradition that Irvine, the laird of Drum, lie3 buried. 
It is reported that he was {lain in purfuing Donald Lord of 
the Ifles, after the battle of Harlaw, in the year 141 1. The 
bifhop of Aberdeen had formerly a houfe at Old-Rain in this 
parifh. The people in general are fober, regular and induf- 
trious, and are as contented with their condition as moft peo- 
ple. ;

Origin of the Name. 

The antient name of the parifla is faid to have been 
Caerben. It is evidently derived from the Celtic or Gaelic, 
and fignifies the high fort or town. Caer in that language 
fignifies a fortified town or place, and ben, high. Doctor 
Clapperton of Lochmaben, a gentleman well known for 
his knowledge of antiquities, is of opinion that Camden, the 
Englifh antiquary, with his followers, are miftaken, when 
they make Caerleveroch the Caerbentorigum of Ptolomy, while 
others, from mere conjecture, make it the Uxellum. That 
Horfely, another Englifh antiquary, has milled the late Rev. 
Doctor Henry of Edinburgh, to Bardenna in the parifh of 
Keir, which he makes the Caerbentorigum of Ptolomy, or 
the Carbantium of the Geographer Revennas. Nothing, 
he afferts, can be more abfurd, as Caerben is obviouily poin- 
ted out, both in the Caerbentorigum of Pto omy, and in the 

Carbantiam

Carbantium of the Geographer Revennas. The Cae rben- 
torigum of Ptolomy was fituated at the mouth of the Novius 
Fluvius or Nith. Agreeably to this, there is, clofe upon the 
Ihore, where the river now empties itfelf into the fea, about 
a mile and a half to the S. E. of the church, a high riling 
ground, called the Barron Hill, upon which has flood a Caf- 
tle or Fort, ftill known by the name of the Cajtle-Hill, or 
M'GullocHs Cajlle ; and, about a mile and a half to the Weft, 
there is a place called Torrorie, in both of which the word 
Caerbeiilorigum is ftill retained. 

Situation, Hills, tsfc. — It is fituated on a promontory in the 
S. E. corner of Galloway, in lat. 54. 55 m. It is bounded 
on the N. E. by the p;irifh of Caerlcveroch in NitLfdale, from 
which it is feparated by the Frith of Nith about 3 miles. 
On the S- E. the firft land to be feen is the county of Cum- 
berland, in the North of England, from which it is feparated 
by the Solway Firth, about 10 miles. On the Weft, it is 
bounded by the united parifhes of Colvend and Southwich ; 
and, on the North, by the parifh of New- Abbey or Sweet-heart. 
It was anciently within the diocefe or bifhopric of Galloway, 
and now, with 9 other parifhes, lying betwixt the water o 
Urr and the river Nith, is within the Prefbytery and Synod 
of Dumfries, from which it is diftant about 11 miles. From 
the North, where it joins New-Abbey, it ftretches about j| 
miles to the Weft, and upon the fhore, which is nearly paral- 
lel, it runs about 6 miles. Its breadth may be about 3 miles, 
but it varies. From Weft to North there is a ridge of hills, 
which terminates in Crofell, or Crowfell, which is the high- 
eft hill in the S. of Scotland, and a confiderable part of which

towards the more, and prefents to the eye a rich, beautiful, 
•and extenfive profpect, fields well inclofed, and in a high ftate 
I of cultivation ; with feveral clumps and belts of planting. 

Climate and Diseases. The climate is healthy. The inha- 
bitants are not fubject to any local difeafe. Formerly the 
ague is laid to have been frequent ; now it has almoft entire- 
ly difappeared. This, by fome, has been attributed to the 
necefiary operations of agriculture, the wet and morafs 
grounds being now moftly drained. By others, however, of 
more knowledge and experience, it has been attributed to a- 
ilother caufe. Formerly, many of the inhabitants went intd 
Lincolnfhire for employment during the harveft, and re- 
turned infe£ied with tKis difeafe •, now they have work fuf- 
ficient to employ them in the parifh, and the difeafe is fel- 
dom a complaint. Innoculation is frequent and fuccefsful.

and W. a considerable tra£i lies upon lime-ftdne. Upon the

* In 1784, Robert Rjddell, Efq; of Glenriddell, employed Mr William 
M'Cartney land-furveyor, to takeforhim the height of this hill. The following 
is a copy of Mr M-Cartney's letter to him. " Sir,— Being the other ;!ay at 
" Crofell, and recollecting the converfation we had about its height, I rcfol- 
" ved to afcertain it. 1 made my obfervations from a bafe on the fhore, of 
" a mile in length, and the refult was as follows : viz. Douglas Cairn, on 
" the fummit of the mountain, i8yj,fay 1900 feet in round numbers, and 
" Knockendoch, or the nbi th wing of the mountain, 1500 feet above high wa- 
" ter mark. I adjufted the level before obfervation, for, by an experiment, t 
" fouiid that it pointed two feet too low, in every hundred yards." 

In 1440, William Earl of Douglas, the laft warden of the weft marches, 
aflembled the bail laitds, freeholders, and eldeft borderers of his wardenry 
at Lincluden. There he corrected and improved the border laws; a copy 
of which is to be found in the Lord Maxwell's manufcript of the laws of the 
1 marches. In thefe laws, this hill is mentioned as one of the beacona for a- 
I larming the country, during the frequent incurfions made by the Engliffa.

Exports. — The crops are more than fufficient to fupply the 
inhabitants. Wheat is generally carried to Dumfries. A 
confiderable quantity of barley, oats, and potatoes, is export- 
ed to the Whitehaven, Lancafher, and Liverpool markets, and 
frequently to the ports of Clyde. Potatoes were firfh export- 
ed from this, in any confiderable quantity, in December 1774, 
by the late Peter Greggan, tenant in the farm of Kirkhoufe. 
For feveral years fince, a quantity has been raifed, equal in 
value to the whole rental of the parifh about 40 years ago. 

Black Cattle and Horses. — The cattle are generally of the 
Galloway breed, and when fattened for the butcher, or for the 
South of England, they weigh well for their fize. It is cer- 
tain, however, that the parifh is capable of feeding in pro- 
portion, cattle of a larger kind. This has been proved by 
William Craik, Efq; of Arbigland, who made the experi- 
ment; whilfl a confiderable part of his eftate was kept in 
pafture, he introduced the Bakewell breed, and found that

there are a few in the parifh, but of them little at prefent 
can be faid, as they were but lately brought into this part of 
the county. Th.e kind of Sheep that produces the belt wool, 
and appears to be of moft advantage to the farmer, is of the 
Bakenuell breed. They were firft brought into this parifh by 
the late Peter Greggan formerly mentioned ; and with 
regard to wool, have fince been much improved. Their 
wool was lately compared with that of a Spanifh ram, fent 
to William Craik, Efq; by Sir John Sinclair, and found 
to be equal to that of the Spanifh, if not finer in quality.

Agriculture. — This parifh is generally allowed to have 
been the firft in the South of Scotland, in an improved ftate 
of agriculture. This muft as generally be afcribed to the 
fuperior knowledge, and unwearied attention of the prefent 
William Craik, Efqj of Arbigland, formerly mentioned, 
whofe example has had a mod ufeful influence.

of oats to the acre, fown by this plough, are found to be fufu- 
cient, whereas 8 and fometimes 9 Winchefter bufhels to the

fown by this plough are allowed to be better headed, and 
of fuperior quality, to any fown by broad caft. This has al- 
ready been experienced by fome of the farmers in the parifh, 
who have followed Mr Craik's example ; and it is expected, 
that, where the land is fuitable, felf intereft will make it more

generally prevail. Ploughs of this conftrucHqn are made in 
the parifh, at 61. 6s. each. Mr Craik has ufed the fame 
plough, in (owing all kinds of grain, excepting pulfe, for 
thefe 30 years paft, and it is ftill in good repair. Four oxen, 
with two horfes, and two men, were formerly ufed in plow- 
ing. Now, two horfes, with one man, who holds the plough, 
and drives the horfes himfelf, arc found fufficient even for

This rotation is propofed, to make a fummer fallow unne- 
cefTary. It is fuited for a good loamy foil, and where there 
is accefs to lime, marl, or any natural manure. Where to 
thefe there is no accefs, there might be difficulty in finding 
a . fufficient quantity of dung. There is now no distinction 
made between the croft and the out-field.

rality of fentimcnt, and for his e::crtions in promoting the 
improvement of his country, he has had few equals. Through 
a life prolonged to the extraordinary length of above 90 
years, he Has cultivated thefe virtues ; and, even at this ad- 
vanced age, he has the rare felicity of being ft ill capable of 
communicating, and of enjoying the pleafures which arife 
from converfation, and from the fociety of his friends. 

Divifton and Value of the Parj/b. — The parifh, as at prefent 
poffefied, is divided into 36 farms, and of thefe, one is gene- 
rally kept in pafture. The whole land of the parifh is twice 
doubled in rent within thefe 40 years. The eftate of Arbig- 
land is at prefent five times the rent that it was 37 years 
ago. This great advance evidently proves the attention and 
induftry of the proprietor and tenants. 

Villages, — KirHbean. — There are 3 villages in the parifh, 
Kirkbean, Prefton, and Salternefs. The village of Kirkbean 
formerly confifted of farm houfes chiefly, with a joiner's and 
a blackfmith's houfe. At prefent, there are two joiners 
houfes, one blackfmith's houfe, two grocery fiiops, two ale- 
houfes, with ftveral others, inhabited by the labourers and 
cottagers belonging to the neighbouring farms. This vil- 
lage is pleafantly fituated. It ftands upon a place almoft 
furrountfed with little hills, and rifing ground, covered with 
wood. From the W. defcends a fmall rivulet, which, among 
the wood, forms a beautiful cataract, and then, running gent- 
ly through the village, in the centre of which there is a 
bridge, it empties itfelf into the fea. The proprietor Mr Os- 
wald, in the iate fet of a neighbouring farm, has referved a 
p^rt of this village, to accomodate the poor on his eftate, 
with free houfes j a mark of that benevolence and humanity 
which alone can add dignity to affluence, and of which^

during the late refidence of the family in this parilh, the in- 
digent have fo liberally received. 

PreJIw. — This village takes its name from the eftate of 
Prefton, upon which it (lands. It formerly belonged to the 
regent Morton, and is now the property of Mr Oswald. 
It is faid to have been a burgh of regality, and had the privi- 
lege of 4 fairs in the year. A crofs, of about 7 feet in height, 
raifed on a bafe of ftone wall, about 4 feet fquare, is ftill 
{landing. Nothing now remains of its ancient privileges, 
but at this crofs poinds have lately been comprifed. Some 
years ago, this village was inhabited by 24 farmers ; at pre- 
fent there are only 3, with their cottagers. 

Salternefs. — This village ftands clofe upon the fhore, due 
fouth of the church. It was built by the late Richard Os- 
wald, Efq; of Auchencruive, with the view, it is faid, of a 
coal trade. A trial for coal was made in its neighbourhood, 
but without fuccefs. It is now chiefly inhabited by perfons 
who keep furnifhed rooms, to accomodate fuch as, during 
the feafon, come to it for the benefit of fea bathing. 

Sea Coaft, Toivcr, Lime-Jione, Sec. — The points of land, 
are Salternefs and Borron. Salternefs, from whence the a- 
bovc mentioned village takes its name, has been considered 
by fome feamen, notwithftanding the charts now publifhed 
of the South-Eaft, to be the fouthmoft point of land in Scot- 
land. The name now appears to be corrupted. It is faid 
to have been originally, S6uthnvkkntfs\ i. e. the fouthermoft 
point, probably from a parilh in its neighbourhood, called 
Sotitkwuk. Upon this riefs, or point of land, a tower is erec- 
ted for a land-mark for veflels on their way alonsr this coaft. 
A part of it was built many years ago, by fome merchants

in Dumfries, then carrying on a confiderable trade with Vir- 
ginia. It was afterwards raifed to its prefent height, by the 
late Mrs Oswald of Auchencruivc. This tower, at prefent, 
is of great advantage to the navigation of this coatt, and would 
ibll be of greater advantage, were lights placed in it. As 
limeftone abounds in its neighbourhood, the fea, every tide, 
Waffling that kind of rock, it is believed, that if here a fmall 
harbour was built, a confidefable trade in that line might be 
carried on. Veflels often come to anchor at Salternefs, in 
3 or 4 fathoms, at low water, in the language of fcamen 
" to Jlop the tide.'* 

Bay. — Carsethorn bay on the eaft fliore, and at the mouth 
of the river Nith, is confidered as a fafe anchoring place. 
Several palls of wood for veflels to make faff. to have been 
put in the beach by the town of Dumfries, who levy a fum 
for tonage, from all veflels difcharging their cargoes upon 
this more. All veflels from Dumfries, when meeting with 
contrary winds, anchor in this bay. Veflels bound for Dum- 
fries frequently lye in the bay, until the fpfing tides furnifli 
them with water fufficient to Carry them Up. Ships from the 
Baltic, laden with timber for Dumfries, generally unload here, 
as veflels, drawing n or 12 feet water, cannot always with fafe- 
ty go above this. There are 3 fathoms water in the bay, and 
out in the channel the water rifes 5 fathoms perpendicular. 

"Ildes.- — The courfes of the tides are as follows. Out of 
the Nith, the tides run nigh fouth to the Borron point, for- 
merly mentioned ; they then take their courfe weftward. 
Upon this ftiore the tides flow 5 hours, and ebb 7. It is 
high water on the full and change days of the moon, at half 
paft eleven o'clock. Many fand banks ly off" this coaft, and 
fueh is the rapidity of the tides, that veflels getting aground

upon them, have been up-fet and wrecked. The flood, in- 
deed, is more dangerous than the ebb, as it has been known 
to tumble a {hip's anchor over and over. It is the general 
opinion of the inhabitants, natives of the parilb, that this 
frith is gradually (hutting up. This opinion is not founded 
on the tradition of their fathers only ; it is founded on then- 
own obfervations. The navigation of the frith they find is 
becoming daily more difficult ; new Tand-banks frequently 
appear; and, upon the S. W. of the parifli, many acres are 
now excellent fait pafturc, which not long ago the tidus 
covered, when they confided of (leach and fand. 

Fifk. — Several kinds of fifh abound on this coaft, fuch as 
flounders, fkate, cod, foles, (hrimps, &amp;c. Turbot are rare. 
It is an obfeivation of the inhabitants, founded on expe- 
rience, that herrings frequent this coaft periodically. AbouX 
6 years ago, they were found in vaft fhoals ; from that peri- 
od till lately, few could be feen ; at prefent (1793) they every- 
where abound. 

Ecclefiajl'ical Slate. — The manfe was built about 1730, 
and enlarged about 1769. Like many public buildings of 
this kind in the country, it was not fufficiently executed ; and 
now the heritors propofe to give it fome repairs. The church 
was built in 1776, and, in its ftrudlure, it is elegant, conve- 
nient, and fufheient. The glebe, which at prefent lies ic- 
parated, but a part of which is now propofed to be exchan- 
ged, confifts cf about 13 acres.. The ftipend, by decreet of 
1 ft February 1650, is 4 chalders of grain, T meal and T bear, 
Linlithgow meafure ; 500I. Scotch in money, with 50 merks 
for communion elements. The Duke of Queensberry is pa-

Bijlinguiped Men.— The late Admiral John Campbell 
was the fon of the Rev. Mr John Campbell, for forrie time 
minifter of this parifh. He was born in the manfe of Kirk- 
bean, 6th Februray 17x9. The account of his life, lately 
publiihed in a London Magazine, is in many circumftances 
erroneous. — John Paul, who fome years ago, took the

hpufe of the Earl of Selkirk ; hi, attempts to burn the town 
of Whitehaven, out of whofe harbour he had ferved his ap- 
prentice-fhip, and his .conduit to his native country, during 
the American war, are inltances of ingratitude and want of 
patriotifm, generally known, and over which, for the honour 
of humanity, we would wifli to draw a veil. 

Antiquities.— -The cafiles of Cavern, and IVeaths, a part 
only of each now (landing, were once the property of the 
Regent Morton *, and by him frequently inhabited. The 
whole of that barony, excepting two farms, is now the pro- 
perty of Richard Alexander Ofwald, Efq ; of Auchencruivc, 
who, while occafionally in this part of the country, rehdes 
at the caftle of Cavens. Upon the N. W. on the farm of 
Ardrie, at the foot of that ridge of hills formerly mentioned, 
which terminates in Crofell, there is a Druidical circle (till

Advantages 

* Upon his forfeiture, thefe caftles, with the batony of Prefton, upon 
which they ftand, were granted to the family of Nithsdale, one of whom 
gave to a fecond fon the chief part of that Barony, and fewed out the reft. 

f At a little diftance to the eaft of this, there was lately difcovered a 
K'.Jl vaen, or ftone coffin, iri which was found an urn. The fides and ends 
of it were built with fmall ftones, and covered with thin broad ones. The 
(tones aie ftill in ufeful prefervation ; they make a part of a divifion dyke, 
upon the farm. To the fouth of this, another was found, but of its conftruc- 
tion the writer has not yet been informed. In the centre of the parifh, nigh 
the public road, ftood a Druidical temple, which was lately deftroyed, for the 
purpofe of clearing the ground, and building farm houfes. Several urns have 
been turned up by the plough. One was found in the foundation of the pre- 
ftnt nianfe.

Advantages "and Dif advantages. — From the natural fitua- 
tion of the pnrilh — the extent of fea coaft, upon which there 
is plenty of fleach and fome fea weed, with the bays and har- 
bours formerly mentioned, it muft poffefs many advantages- 
No farmer in the paiifh is above two miles diftant from the 
harbour, where he can fliip the produce of his farm, and re- 
ceive the higheft prices given in the country. The want of 
fuel is the only difadvantage under which this parifh labours. 
Co il brought from Cumberland, in the north of England, is 
the common fuel, which, to the farmer, and more particularly 
to the labourer and the indigent, is a very grievous expence. 
This, however, in fome meafure has been leiTened, by the 
the late repeal of the duty upon coal carried coaft-ways, for 
which this parifb, in particular, is much indebted to the 
the right honourable Henry Dundas. 

Charatler of the Inhabitants. — A confiderable number of 
die inhabitants of different ranks and conditions of life, are 
induftrious, fober, active, and charitable. In their religious 
fentiments, they are rational and liberal, and, in their political 
opinions, they are manly and loyal. As a proof of their 
loyalty to his Majefly, and their attachment to the prefent 
form of government, they have already fubferibed 10 1. to 
be applied in furnifhing with fhoes, made in the parifh, their 
brave and gallant countrymen now on the continent, Cl fup- 
" porting order, regular government, true liberty and reli- 
" gion." It is expeded that a very liberal fubfeription will 
foon appear.

JL his parifh was anciently named Inverugie, and often 

Longley, the church being fituated not far from the old place 

of Inverugie, on thofe pleafanr. and extenfive downs called 

the Link of St-Fergus. The church was removed from this 

fite anno 1616, when the church and parifh aflumed the 

name of its patron faint, to whom the 17th of November, 

according to the Scotch callendar, was facred. This parifh, 

though it belongs to the county of Banff, is fituated in that 

diftrict of Aberdeen, called Buchan. * The coaft is warned

13th Century. The parifh of St Fergus, and fome other fmall eftates, feem to 
have been given off by the ancient Earls, but there ftill remained an im- 
menfe eftate, fituated in Banff and Aberdeen fhircs, to which William Cum- 
ine lucceeded by his marriage. 

The Cumines continued to enjoy their vaft fortune until the year ijoS. 
This name, then one of the raoft poweiful in Scotland, violently oppofed the 
fucceffion of King Robert Bruce to the Crown, but were completely over, 
thrown by him at Inverury. The king, according to Fordun, purfued the 
Cumines as far as Fyvie, where, having difperfed them, he encamped for 
for fome time, until the parties which he lent out had burnt the Earl of Bu- 
chan's eftate. In the Parliament holden at Perth, anno 1.320, the King di- 
vided the Earl's lands among his own friends. To the family of Douglas 
he gave the greateft part of the parifhes of Crimond and Longmav, and a 
part of the parifhes of Tyrie and Aherdour. This appears from a charter, 
which Archibald the 10th Lord Douglas obtained from King Robert, 
" DileBo et fdell nojlro, Archibaldo DE Douglas, pro homagio et fervitio 
« fuo" of the lands of Rothfay, Crimond and Cairnglafs, Sec. in Buchan. 
Upon the family of Crawford he bellowed the barony of Kelly, com- 
prehending part of the parifhes of Tarves, New-Deer, Old-Deer and Lon^. 
fide. Thefe lands reverted to the Crown by the forfeiture of Alexander 
Earl of Crawford, and a confidersble part of them was beftowed by King 
James II. on James Gordon of Methlic, Anceftor of the Earl of Aberdeen, 
(Cbarta in pub. arcbiv.) King Robert gave to the family of Errol the 
parities of Crudcn, Slain?, and part of the parifhes of Logic, Ellon, and 
Udney. To the Marischal family he gave the parifh of Peterhead, part of 
Longfide and Old-Deer, the lands of Auchines in the parifh of Rathen, Pit- 
tendrum in Pitfligo parifh, and Troup, in the parifh of Gamrie. John 
Cumine, the fourth Earl of Buchan of that name, had, before his forfeiture 
and out-lawry by King Robert, given the barony of Philorth in portion 
with his daughter Margaret, who was married to Sir John Ross, fecond 
fon of the Earl of Ross, who difponed thefe lands to Hugh Earl of Rofs, his 
btother, by a charter, dated at Invcrnefs 1316. This barony was then of great 
extent, comprehending the parifh of Frafersburgh, moft pare cf Tyric, Abetv

Soil and Surface. — The foil in general is a rich chy, and 
when properly cultivated is abundantly fertile- The appear- 
ance of the parilh is an alternate fucceffion of little rifing 
grounds and valleys, but no moor or barren ground. The 
piece of ground called the Links of St. Fergus, is perhaps 
one of the moft pleafant plains in Scotland, extending along 
1 the 

cout, Pitfligo, and Rathen, (which Tail comprehends the gre.iteft part 
cf Strichen parilh,) together with feveral lands in the parillies oi' Turrill" 
and King-Edward. This, together with the whole eftate of Rofs, was en- 
tailed by William Earl of Ross, on his cldeft daughter Euphani, who was 
married to Sir Walter Leslie, and the heirs of her body; whom failing, 
to Janet hisfecond daughter, who was married to Sir Alexander Frascr 
of Cowie, anceftor of Lord Salton. By this marriage Sir Alexander 
Fraser got this barony, a confiderable part of which continues to be the 
property of Lord Salton. 

A part of the ancient Farldom of Buchan was fituated in the Thanedom 
of Formartine, which is that diitriel of Aberdeenfhire, that is bounded by the 
river Don on the South, and the Ythan on the North. This part of the 
Earl £f Buchan's property remained with the Crown, until David N.

Sect Coajl, Minerals, Zsre — The (hore in the parifh of St, 
Fergus forms two fegments of a circle ; the one, beginning 
at the mouth of the Ugie, terminates at the Scotftown Craig* 
and the other reaches from this Craig to Rattray-head, the 
property of Mr Harvey of Broadland. The rocks both at 
Rattray and Scotftown afford plenty of lime-ftone, which at 
low water is eafily quarried. At Scotftown as well as at Craig- 
Ewan, hard by the mouth of the Ugie, there is abundance 
of excellent granite ; and, all along the coaft, an inexhaufti-r 
ble quantity of fhells, which are now ufed as manure 
with great advantage. From thefe two rocks of Craig- 
Ewan and Scotftown, a very trifling quantity of kelp is made 
every fecond year.

dung, or fea-weed, was bear, which was fucceeded by two crops of oats, and 
a crop of beans or pcafc, and this was followed by a crop of bear, fotnetimes

formed a fociety for encouraging agriculture, and gave pre- 
miums for fallow, fown grafs, and turnips. By this encourage- 
ment, and by obferving the great advantage that accrued from 
early grafs, hay, and green crops, the farmers were induced to 
fallow, fow turnips, and lay down their fields in grafs; and at 
prefent, fome of them have generally one third of their farm 
in grafs, and a very confiderable number of cattle are every year 
fed on turnips. Although improvements in agriculture have 
made but little progrefs, as yet, in this parifli, it is a curious 
fact, that until the greateft part of the leafes were expired, 
there was nothing done in that way. This is chiefly owing 
to a well-placed confidence in the proprietor, who has never 
yet ejected a tenanr, although many of them have had no 
leafes for upwards of 20 years. Many offers of an increafe 
of rent have been made for every farm, as foon as the leafe 
expired ; but the poflefibrs, or their heirs, if they inclined to 
remain, have been allowed to continue in their farms, and 
no rife of rent has been exacted. The proprietor, wifely judg- 
ing that improvement fhould precede a rife of rent, has been 
at great pains to lead them to better management ; and al- 
though the encouragement given has not had all the effect 

that 

.carried oats for three or four years. The fourth year, the return feldom 
doubled the quantity of feed that had been fown. The fifth year, they fallow- 
ed the out-field, but gave no manure of any kind ; and the fixth year they had 
a tolerable crop of oats. The ground was then allowed to reft for feme 
years, and it was feldom before the 4th year, that it got a green fuiface. It 
ino fooner had this appearance, than it got one plowing in winter, and was 
fuffcrcd to remain in that ftate for a year, and then had a fecond plowing, 
and was fown with oats. If there was any part of the field, that had not 
undergone the firft plowing, the furface was dug up with the fpade, and 
therewith dykes were made of 2 or 3 feet in height, which having been cx- 
•pofed to the winter froft and rain, were in fpring pulled down and fprend 
Aipon the ground, from which the furface had been taken. This ground was 
Ihcn flcwcd, aacUeldom failed to prodiicc one geed crop of oats.

that might have been expeded, the mode of farming is much 
changed. Inftead of 6 horfes in a plough, they never ufe 
more than 4, and many ufe only 2, without a driver. Some 
plow with 6 oxen, fome with 4, and fome with 2 j but the 
horfes and oxen are of a much larger frze than formerly, and 
the Berwick-fhire plough is now generally ufed. 

Produce, Seafons, &amp;c. — The crops now raifed are oats, 
weighing from 14 to 16 ftone, Amfterdam weight \ bear from 
17 to 19 ftone ; beans, peafe, turnips, potatoes, and a little 
flax. The feafon of fowing is from the latter end of March 
to the beginning of June ; and the harveft commonly begins 
after the middle of September, and is finifhed about the end 
of October. The rotation of crops, followed by the beft far- 
mers, is turnips or fallow, bear laid down with grafs feeds, 
and after 3 or 4 years in grafs, two crops of oats are 
taken. If, after this, the ground is clean, beans are fown, but 
if otherwife, turnips or potatoes, and then bear and grafs feeds. 
Wheat has been neglected, although it is well adapted to the 
foil ; but as the heritor has kept fome good farms in his own 
hand, (when the tenants have died, or removed of their own 
accord,) to accommodate farmers from thofe countries where 
wheat is cultivated, it is to be hoped, that this grain will in 
a few years make a principal part of the crop of this parifh. 
The greatcft part of the foil here being a llrong clay, and 
all of it on a rich clay bottom, it is clear, that the carfe 
mode of plowing and cropping would fucceed well here. 
When this mode is introduced, the true value of this foil 
will be known. 

Farm Rents and Improvements. — The tenants being nu- 
merous, the rents are various. Some pay 90 1. in money and 
grain; and fome 2I. or perhaps even lefs. Every man who has

a horfe has alfo a cart. Some ufe no horfes, but do ail kinds of 
farm work with oxen. One farmer, James Clarke in Ne- 
ther-hill, ufes oxen for his threlhing machine, which is the 
only thing of the kind, that has as yet been introduced in this 
part of the country. It is to this indufhrious honelt man, that 
we are indebted for introducing the Ihell fand as a manure, 
which now turns out to fo great account, that many acres, 
which would not formerly have produced double the quanti- 
ty of the feed, now produce weighty crops both of grain and 
hay. 

Exports. — This parifh always produces more grain than 
is fufficient for the fupport of its inhabitants ; and even iu 
the year 1782, had the produce been kept within the parifh, 
there would have been no need of any foreign fupply. About 
1600 bolls of grain are exported annually ; butter and 
cheefe to the value of 600 1. Sterling j fat cattle, horfes, 
and fheep, to a confiderable amount ; and a fmall quantity of 
hay and potatoes. 

Population. — The population of this parifh is fomewhat 
lefs than it was 40 years ago. The following table (hows

the value of the thread whitened here annual! y, is about

gie is carried on by Mr Seller with fuccefs ; and a diftillery 
of whifky, by William Lillie, and Co. at the fame place^ 
turns to good acount. 



Difcafes.— The fmall-pox carried off great numbers for- 
merly ; but as inoculation is now become general, this difeafe 
is lefs fatal. The fcurvy, with which many people here 
were affected, is not fo general, owing perhaps to the more 
liberal ufe of vegetables. Fevers, and often confumptions, 
prove fatal in this and the neighbouring parifhes but the 
moft terrible difeafe, that has been known in this part of the 
country for a century, is the putrid fore throat, which was 
not known here before December 1790. The number of 
deaths were more than double that year, owing to ravages 
made by this difeafe. 

Language and Etymologies. — The dialect called broad Bu- 
fchans is fpoken here. It is thought to approach nearer to 
the ancient Gothic, than the language of any other diftricl: in 
Scotland. As the Picls were the antient inhabitants of the 
Eaft coaft of Scotland, they impofed names on the different 
places, expreffive, (in their language,) of their fituation or 
ifome particular property. It is not eafy to affign any good 
reafon, for attempting to derive the names of places in this 
country from the Celtic, as there is no evidence, that it was 
inhabited by the Celts. The names of, all the places in this

panfli, and the adjacent country, plainly appear to lie Go- 
thic, Saxon, or Danifii. For example, South-ejju; Midd/e-efte, 
and tiorlh-rffie, iignlfy the South, Middle, and North pafture, 
or feeding place, from the Teutonic Rfien, to feed. Pittin- 
hrath, compounded of the Saxon Pit, and Heath, the name 
of a well known fhrub. Pit/our, the hollow trench •, Pitjligo, 
anciently PitJIignch, the llaughter hollow. Cruden was cer- 
tainly a part of the ancient Cruthenica, or Picrifh kingdom, 
fo called ftom Cruthen the fir 11 king of the Picls. Dar, the 
name of a neighbouring pariih, fignifies a valley, and is very 
expreulve of the fituation of that place. Broadland, the land 
of bread. Crhnond, anciently Creichnion,\ the low or little 
mount. Lonmay, anciently Longmay, the long green, &amp;c. 

Woods. — At prefent there is no wood in the parifh, ex- 
cept a few old planes at Inverugie. % The proprietor has 
paid much attention to the raifing of wood on his other eftates, 
particularly in the parilhes of Deer and Longfide, where he 
has planted 940 Englifh acres. They were all planted with 
Scotch firs, which fucceeded in about one fourth of the whole, 
and that part lias been filled up with barren timber of dif- 
ferent kinds. Where the Scotch firs have failed, the larch 
and fpTuce have come forward ; and it feems probable, that 

bv 

i 

\ There is clear evidence, that, at fome former period, a gre.it part cf 
this parii'h has heen covered with wood, chiefly oak, aller, birch, h.:zel, and 
willow, the remains of all which are found in the modes. No roots or trees, 
however, of the Scotch fir have been found, which fhows that this kind ot 
wood is not proper for this part of the country. It would appear that the 
woods in this country had, at one time or other, been deftroyed by fire, as the 
mark* of that element are vifible on many of the roots and trees that are dug 
up in the moffes. It may not be an improbable conjecture, that this happen- 
ed a/ no 1308, when King Kobert Bruce defeated CuMlNB Earl of Bu:han, 
near Inverury. Fordun, ^| after narrating this defeat, adds, " ccmitat^rr. d;

other trees may be brought up. Many drains have already 
been made, and feveral thoufands of larches and fpruces have 
been planted, and the fame improvements are carrying 011 
through the whole. 

Roads and Bridge. — The principal roads, through this pa- 
rifh, are thofe leading from Peterhead to Fraferburgh and 
Banff, and from Peterhead to Old Deer. They are kept in 
tolerable repair by the ftatute labour, bur "will never be 
good roads until turnpikes aTe eltablifhed. It is not to be 
imagined that any man will work a day on the roads, when 
he may redeem his labour for 3d. If ever a mail coach be 
eftablifhed, for the accommodation of the country north of 
Aberdeen, the courfe muil be by the coaft fide, at lead in 
winter, as the other road by Fyvie is often impaffuble, on ac- 
count of the depth of the fnow ; and the certainty of paf- 
fengers, from the towns on the coaft, efpecially at Peterhead, 
where there is always a great refort of company for the 
benefit of the mineral well, will make the road by the coaft 
fide eligible in fummer. The only bridge in this parifh is 
that over theUgie, on the road from Peterhead to Fraferburgh 
and Banff. It confifts of two arches. This bridge was built, 
in confequence of an act of Parliament for that effect, in the « 
reign of James the VII. of Scotland^ and II. of England. *

unfortunately engaged in the rebellion in 1715, the patron- 
age fell to the Crown. The ftipend is 90 1, including one 
chalder of bear, and three of meal, valued at 5 1. 6 s. 8d. per 
chalder. The glebe is about 8 acres of good land. The 
church was built in 1763, and the manfe in 1766 : and both

Schools. — -The fchool-houfe was built anno 178'). The 
falary of the fchool- matter confifts of 10 bolls of meal paid 
by the parifhioners, and 3 1. 9 s. paid by heritors. He draws 
2 1. from the kirk-feiTion as their clerk, befides what he re-

• Eminent Men. — It might be proper, under this article, to 
give a fhort account of the molt eminent family in Scotland, 
the Cumines, who were Earls of Buchan, * and either pro- 

T 2 prietors 

% The chief of this family was Cumine Lord Badenoch, of whom were 
defcended the Earls of Buchan and Monteith, and 32. knights §. This fac- 
tion, with the Earls of Mark and Atholl, with whom they were connected 
by marriages, ruled the kingdom as they pleafed, during fome years in the 
latter part of the reign of Alexander the II. and during the firft part of 
the reign of Alexander III. 

The male line of the antient Earls of Buchan failing in the perfon o£ 
Fergus^, the lad Earl of the ancient race, his daughter Marjory married 
William Comine of the houfe of Badenoch, who in his right became Earl 
of Buchan about the beginning of the 13th century. His poderity continued 
to enjoy this great eftate for 100 years, and were the moft powerful fubjedls 
in the kingdom. This Earl founded the abbey of Deer, and endowed it with 
a confiderable revenue in lands fituated in the county of Aberdeen, Anna 
1218. H*. was conllituted great judiciary of Scotland by Alexander II. in 
i2Zo ; and his brother Walter was by the fame King created Earl of Mon- 
teith, he having married the heirefs of that family, by whom he got a large 
eftate. The Cumines being now fo rich and powerful, they became formi- 
dable, not only to the nobles, but even to the King. They were called to 
anfwer before the King and Eftates, anno 1255, for their various acts of 
tyranny, opprejisn, murder, and facrilege, and not appearing, a fentence of out- 
lawry and forfeiture was pronounced againft them ; but Government was too 
weak to put this fentence in execution. The faction, greatly irritated by this 
fentence, refolved to take the firft opportunity of getting the king's peifon 
into their power \. Walter, Earl of Monteith, was the principal actor in 
this plot ; and having along with him William, the »d Earl of Buchan of

Marr, and others of their adherent", they entered the royal apartments 
at Kinrofs, early in the morning: of the »8th of Otflober iaj 5 , and made the 
Icing a prifontr before lie was awake, and carried him to Stirling. They 
then difmiffed his Majefty's (ervants, and filled all places of truft with their 
own adherents. So great was their power, that the king, after he had recov- 
ered his liberty, thought it prucL-nt to give them a full pardon. 

Alkxandfr, the 3d Earl of Buchan, of the name of Cumine, was 
JufHciary and Lord high Conftable of Scotland, and' was appointed one of the 
fix governors of the kingdom, after the death of King Alex.a nder HI. He 
founded an hofpital at Turriff, anno 1 272, for twelve poor hufbandmcn, and 
another at Newburgh, both in Aberdecnlhire. John, the 4th Earl of Buchan, 
conftable of Scotland, was one of the arbiters chofen on the part of John 
Baliol, in the competition for the Crown between him and Robert Bruce. 
At this time, John Cumine, Lord Badenoch, comriionly called tjie Black 
Cumine, claimed the Crown of Scotland, as being defcended of Hlxasilda, 
daughter and hcirefs of Gotueric, fon and heir of Donald king of Scotland. 
It is well known how this affair was determined by Edward I. of England. 
To the Black Cumine fucceeded his fon John Cumine, Lord of Badenoch, 
commonly called the R;d Cumine Scotland had now for a confiderable time 
groaned under the yoke of Englifh fcrvitude : Baliol had meanly given up 
his pretended right to the Crown to Edward ; and Bruee had fecretly inti- 
mated to his friends his intention of afferting his title to the royal dignity. 
Cumine, ever mindful of his own intereft, made a folemn engagement with 
Robert, to aid him with all hi» power in mounting the throne, provided he 
fhould be rtftured to the large poifeflions which his family had formerly enjoy- 
ed ; but, after deliberating upon the affair, he began to doubt the event : If 
the attempt failed he was undone ; and he did not know how to retract : His 
own black heart fuggefted the deteftabic remedy : His hopes of great rewards 
from England induced him to divulge the whole fcheme of the Scottifu' 
patriots to Edward ; and Bruce, finding that he was betrayed, with difficulty 
efcaped to Scotland, where, difcovering clear proof of the villany of Cumine, 
he purfued him to the church of Dumfries, whither, from confeious guilt, he 
had fled for refuge, and punifhed him as his crime deferved, on the tenth 
of February 1306. Having no iffue, he was the laffc Lord Badenoch, of 
the name of Cum:ne. The flaughter of the RcJ Cumin: by Bruce infpir-

ed the whole clan with a defire to revenge his death. They continued vio- 
lently to oppofe Bruce ; but, by defeating the Earl of Buchan at Inverurie, 
an/id 1300, he put an end to the greatnefs of this too powerful family. Bruce 
purfued the Cutnines to Fyvie, where they were entirely difperfed. He en- 
camped there, until the return of the parties which he had fent out to burn 
the Earl of Buchan's eftate : The Earl was then forfeited and out-lawcd e ^[. 
. At what particular period the Chutnss became proprietors of this parifh, 
is not certainly known ; but it would appear, that they were in poffeflion of 
this eftate before the Cumines fucceeded to the Earldom of Buchan. Sir 
Reginold Ciieyne of Inverugie was the founder of the Carmelites houfe in 
Aberdeen; and, befides other revenues, bellowed upon it 40s. f yearly out of 
his lands of Blackwater, in this parifh. He had, by his wife, a daughter of 
Cumine, Lord Badenoch, two fons ; Sir Reginald, who, in 1267, was prc- 
moted to the office of Lord Chamberlain of Scotland^ ; Henry Cheyne, the 
Chamberlain's brother, was elected Bilhop of Aberdeen, anno Iz8r. He was 
one of thofc who fworc fealty to Edward, anno 1296. As he was nearly re- 
lated to the Cumines, he adhered to that party, and was obliged to leave 
this country, and take refuge in England, where he remained in exile until 
King Robert was pleafed to recal him. He was fo happy in being allowed 
to refume his functions, that he applied all the revenues of the lee, which, 
during his abfence, had increafed to a very confiderable fum, in building the 
bridge over- the Don at Aberdeen. This bridge confifls of one Gothic arch 
72 feet wide at the water, and the height, from the water to the top of the 
arch, is 60" feet. He died anno 1329, having been bifhop of Aberdeen 48 

years.

From Cheyne of Inverugie, were defend d tie Cheynes of FJfclmtnt, Arnage, 
Pitfichie, and Straloch, all which are now extinSi. 

Curisitan Cheyne, a daughter of Straloib, was married to Sir Alexander 
SeTON of that ilt, who bravely defended the town of Berwick againft King Ed- 
ward* and the whole Englifb army, anno 1333 . Edward having fummoncd the 
town to furrender, threatened, in cafe of refujal, to put to death Sir Alexander's 
two fons, then in his hands, the one as an boftage, and the other as aprifoner; but no- 
thing could prevail with the bravt Sir Alexander to give up the town as long as it 
was poffible to defend it. The perfidious Edward, thereupon, mojl barbaroufy exe- 
cuted the twi young men, William and Thomas Setons, in view of their father 
and mother ; which Jhociingfpeilacle they bore with J mfl uncommon degree cf forti-

: to that of the Jlatljlkal phik[opher we flraU content ourfclves 
with giving in this place only a brief iketch of the character of 
the great Field Marlhal Keith, brother to George, laft Earl 
of Marifchal ; and with throwing a few anecdotes of his mofh 

illuftrious 

1540, he got charters |j on many lands lying in the counties, Caithncfs, Inver- 
nefs, Meray, Banff, Aberdeen, Kincardine, Angus, Fife, Linlithgow, &amp;c. 
It is faid, that after Queen Mary's captivity, he took no concern in public 
affairs, and by living a retired life in his caftle of iDunottar, he got the name 
of William in the Tower. He fo much improved his eftate, that at his 
death it was reckoned worth 270,000 merks Scots, or 14,208k 6t. 8d. Sterling. 
This eftate was fo fituated, that in travelling from the north point of Caith- 
fwfs, to the borders of England, he could lleep every night on his own 
ground, f 

This noble Lord died in an advanced age in 1581, and was fucceeded by 
his grandfon George, the 5th Earl Marifchal, one of the moft eminent mert 
of his time. After having lludied at Geneva, under the famous Theodore 
Eeza, he travelled through Italy and Germany, where he vifited the Land- 
grave of Hesse, Prince of the Catti, who, underftanding who he was, re- 
ceived him kindly, and treated him with great magnificence, as a Scotch 
defcendant of the ancient Catti. In 1589 he was fent ambaffador extraor- 
dinary to the court of Denmark, to efpoufe the Princefs Anne in name of 
James VI. of Scotland, and I. of England. Being poffeffed of a great eftate, 
he appeared with all the luftre and magnificence with which the wealth of 
Scotland could adorn him, and that chiefly on his own expencej. In 1593, 
he made a noble foundation of a college at Aberdeen, and obtained from the 
Crown, for the fuppoit of it, the lands and houfes belonging to fome of the 
r-Jigious at Aberdeen, which had not been fued off before the Reformation.

f This Earl was a zealous promoter of the Reformation, but off fifed all violent 
proceedings in that affair. When the Confefon of Faith was prefented to Parliament,

illuftrious anceftors into the notes. This great man was born ] 
at Invertjgie, in this parifii, and was baptized i6th June 1696,  
by the names of James Francis Edwako. * He early en- 
tered into the military fervice abroad, rofe to the higheft j 
rank in the army, and was inferior to no general of his time ] 
in military capacity. He accompanied his brother Earl 1 
Marifehal to the battle of Dunblane, and afterwards went 
abroad to feek preferment at the Spanifh Court ; but not 
finding a quick promotion there, he entered into the Ruffian 
fervice, and was by Peter the Great promoted to the rank of 
a general officer. He afterwards entered into the fervice of 
Frederic III. King of Pruffia, who raifed him to the rank of 
Field Marifhal. He commanded that king's armies fometimes 
alone, and at other times along with his Majefty, until the 
fatal battle of Hochkirchen, on the 14th October 1758. The 
Field Marfhal, returning from a feparate command, found 
that the King had encamped in a very improper place, and 
inftantly told his Majefty that Daun would furprize them that 
night. His prediction proved top true ; and the Field Mar- 
fhal, making a glorious defence, was unfortunately killed. He 
was buried in the church-yard of Hochkirchen, but the 
King of Fruffia had his corpfe taken up, and fent to Ber- 
lin, where he was again interred with the greateft military 
honours. |

Antiquities. — As this parifh has, for upwards of 500 years, 
been only a part of a larger eftate, and never divided into 
fnv.dl properties, we cannot expecl to find (lately manfions 
here. Some peices of ftone and lime are to be met with, 
hard by the mouth ©f the Ugie, where it falls into the fea, 
and here, it is faid, was the ancient refulence of the family 
of Cheyne. They afterwards built another caftle, to which 
they alfo gave the name of Inverugie, * at the diftance of 
more than a mile weftward, on the fame fide of the river. 
The fite of this caftle does honour to the judgement and 
good tafte of its founder. Here the Ugie forms a femi- 
circle before the caftle, and the area of this femicircle is ter- 
minated, by Mount-P leaf ant  a fteep rifing ground on the op- 
pofite fide of the river. The caftle is now in ruins, but the 
two courts are almoft entire ; part of them ferves as a gra- 
nery, and part is ufed as a brewery for porter and beer. 
Within a few paces of the wall of the North court, are the 
remains of an ice-hoife, which perhaps was the firft of the 
kind in this country. — On an eminence N. W. from the 
caftle, there is an artificial moat, where, it is probable, the 
ancient proprietors held their courts for the diftribution of 
juftice. 

Character and Manner of Living. — The people in gener.il 
are very hofpitable, kind to ftrangers, intelligent and conten- 
ted. They have fuch an attachment to their native foil, that 
few of them chufe to leave it. From Buchan there never 
were any emigrations, and indeed there can be no reafon for

• This continued to be the refidence of the fucceeding proprietors, until 
the attainder of Lord Marifchal, who unfortunately engaged in the rebel- 
lion 1715. The precife time when this caftle was built is not known; but as 
one part of it, now in ruins, was called the Cbeync V Tc wr, it is probable that 
it was built by that family.

any, as every man, who is difpofed to work, can always have 
good employment and good wages, either as a mechanic or 
a labourer. Although few of the farmers have leafes, from 
many years experience, they confider themfelves as perfectly 
fecure, and in no danger of being removed, while they live 
peaceably and are punctual in the payment of their rents, 
which are very moderate, when compared with thofe of the 
neighbouring eftates. They are fenfible the heritor could 
have more rent than he draws from them. He has abolifh- 
ed all cuftoms and fervices ; and, if any of them build good 
houfes, a proper allowance is made. The kind and indul- 
gent manner in which they are treated by the proprietor, 
has ftrongly attached them to him. They are fenfible that 
he is happy in beholding their profperity, and will not from 
thence take any advantage to raife their rents above what 
they can bear. The manner of living here is greately chang- 
ed within the laft thirty years. The farmers now appear at 
church and market drefTed in Englifh fuperfine cloth, and 
many of their wives and daughters in cloaks and bonnets. 
The man-fervant is as expenfively arrayed as his matter, and 
the drefs of the maid-fervant is little inferior to that of her 
miftrefs. The food of the inhabitants formerly confided 
phiefly of oat meal, and fometimes of fifh, but thefe gener- 
ally falted and dryed ; owing to this caufe, the fgurvy was a 
common difeafe. They raifed few vegetables, and turnips 
were often brought by fea from Aberdeen. Every cottager 
now has, his turnips, cabbages, potatoes ; and many of the 
farmers have their mutton, fed by themfelves for fummer 
food, and the greateft part of them kill a fed ox cr cow, for 
winter provifion- \

■ _ Origin of the Name. 

JL he word Dollar is faid to be Gaelic. According to fome 
it was formerly fpelt Do/lard, from doll, a plain, or vale, and 
ardy a hill, or high land. This is perfectly applicable to its 
real fituation, the principal part of the parifh behig a beauti- 
ful plain or valley, of about an Englifh mile in breadth, lying 
along the foot of a high range of hills, known by the name o£ 
the Ochil- Hills. According to others, it may be expreffed Doil- 
lar, fignifying a hidden or concealed place. This alfo is 
expreffive of its real fituation •, which is low and not feen at 
any great diftance, when one approaches it in any direction; 

r 

Situation, Extent, Form, and Appearance. — It is fuppofed t6 
be equally diftant from Stirling, Kinrofs,'and Dumfermline ; 
"ul is reckoned about 12 Englifh miles from each. The

middle and principal part of the parifh, in which both the 
church and the town (land, is an extenfive and gently Hop- 
ing plain, beautifully interfperfed with fmall villages, farm 
houfes, and inclofures ; and, taking in with it a fmall part 
of Muckart on the Eafl, and Tillicoultry on the Weft, it 
forms a kind of amphitheatre, of an oval figute, of about 3 
miles in length, and one in breadth ; bounded by the Ochil- 
hills on .the North, and a rifing ground on the South. This 
beautiful plain would feem to have been laid down, and 
fmoothed by the great hand of nature, to be the fcene of fports 
and exercifes, fuch as thofe of the ancient Olympic games. 
.It is of a fouthern expofure ; and, when viewed from the 
rifing grounds, particularly on the South, the pleafed and 
admiring beholder would be ready to pronounce it the moft 
delightful fpot in the world. 

River and Fi/b. — The water of Dovan which runs from 
E. to W. nearly divides the parifh. The Dovan is not na- 
vigable, being a fmall but beautiful ftream of pure limpid 
water. Its channel, at a medium, may be about ico feet in 
breadth. Here it gently glides over a bed of pebbles, where, 
finding itfelf at eafe (as it were,) after having been daflied 
and broken in its narrow and rugged channel, through the pa- 
rifhes of Glendovan and Muckart, it feems to fport itfelf m 
many beautiful meanders ; winding from fide to fide of the 
valley, as if loth to leave the delightful haughs of Dollar. 
But at times, when fwelled by heavy rains, which come 
down in torrents from the hills, it fuddenly overflows its 
banks to a confiderable extent, to the no fmall damage of 
the farmer, whofe lands arc fituated by the fide of it. The 
river, being fmall, does not admit of many kinds of fifh ; yet 
there are very fine frefh-water trouts, of a confiderable fize, 
taken in it, as well as fparrs, in great numbers. In harveft, 

fea

iea trouts are likewifc killed in it, from 2 lib. to 4 lib. weight. 
And, in the feafon, falmon are caught from 5 lib. to 20 lib. 
About 20 or 30 years ago, falmon were found in Dovan in 
jo-eat plenty ; but, from the illegal and murderous manner of 
killing them with fpears, at an improper feafon, their num- 
bers of late have greately. decreafed. As there are but few 
or none killed now, but by gentlemen in the way of fport, 
or by fome of the poorer fort of the people, for the ufe of 
their families, the prices cannot well be afcertained. 

Bridges. — There was a very good ffcone bridge over the 
jBovan nearly oppofite t'o the church ; but fome years ago it 
was carried down by a flood. At prefent, a wooden bridge is 
about to be put over it, near the fame place, by the volun- 
tary fubfcriptions of a few public-fpirited perfons in the 
neighbourhood ; which will be of very great convenience 
to the people in this place, particularly upon the fabbath j 
as many of the parilhioners have to crofs the Dovan in their 
way to church. The want of a bridge would not have been 
felt fo much here 20 or 30 years ago, as the people in this 
place were very expert at crofling the river on Jlilts. f And 
there are ftill fome who crofs it in this way. But fince the 
time that the bridge was built, this practice has been gene- 
rally laid afide. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The air in this place is remarkably 
pure and healthy ; the country being free and open, neither 

cumberd 

I Thefe ftilts were two branches of a tree, of a proper ftrength, with a 
cleft or fmall branch preserved in each, of a fufficient widenefs to receive a 
perfon'3 foot, about 18 or zo inches from the root end. Upon which the 
pcrfon being mounted, with a foot on each cleft or projecting branch, and the 
top or fmall end of the ftilt in each hand, they ftalkcd through the river a* 
the fords. This they called Jiilthg.

cumbered with woods, nor infected with marfhes The 
purity and fweetnefs alfo of the water, (which, perhaps, is 
exceeded by none,) coming through rock or fand, and free of 
metallic fubftances, mud alfo contribute greatly to the 
health of the inhabitants ; and this blefling they ufually en- 
joy in an uncommon degree. As a , remarkable inftance of 
this, the minifter, in the whole courfe of .his parochial vifita- 
tion from houfe to houfe, did not find one fingle fick perfon 
in the parifh ; and fcarcely any complaining of ailmentts, fuch 
as coughs, fhortnefs of breath, &amp;c. ; though it was in the 
month of December, when complaints of this nature are 
more frequent ; efpeeially among fuch as are advanced in 
life. Some few were indeed labouring under the natural in- 
firmities incident to old age •, there being feveral who were 
arrived at the advanced age of 80 and upwards. The falu- 
brity of the air is alfo much owing to the drynefs of the foil, 
which readily imbibes' the rains that fall upon it; while 
the many fmall rivulets, which come down from the higher 
grounds, carry off the fuperfluous'waters, without allowing 
them to ftagnate on the furface, and to breed noxious vapours 
to be exhaled into the air. Epidemical difeafes are therefore 
unknown here ; except thofe which are of a common and 
general nature. Such as the fmall-pox, chin-cough, &amp;c. 
The fmall-pox, at times, carries of!" many of the children ; 
inoculation not having yet got much into practice. 

Soil and Surface, Sheep, Wool, and Cultivation. — The foil in 
this parifh is of various kinds. That of the Ochil-hills, 
which lie towards the North, is partly rocky, partly moffy, 
and partly gravel. The hills are covered with a beauti- 
ful green ; but part of the foil being now wafhed off by the 
ftorms, in the courfe of time, the rocks in fome plaees begin 
to appear. 1 hey afford excellent pafture for fheep ; cf

which about 1640 are fed upon that part of them belonging 
to this parifh. The mutton, and efpecially the wool, produ- 
ced upon the Ochils, (as they are fometimes called,) is confi- 
dered as of a fuperior quality ; particularly that upon the farm 
called Craiginnan, which is the property of the Duke of Ar- 
gyll. Towards the foot of the hills, the foil, in general, is 
light and gravelly, caufing a quick vegetation. In dry fea- 
fons, it is indeed apt to be parched ; but in wet feafons, the 
crops are moderately good. The greater part of the flat-ly- 
ing ground in the bottom is likewife of a light gravely na- 
nature, and ufually yields rather an early harveft. Along 
the banks of the Dovan, the foil is moftly of the haugh 
kind ; and fome of it a deep clay. Upon the fouth fide of 
the Dovan, the ground is rather wettifh and clayey, but, with 
proper attention and culture, it is capable of very confidera- 
ble improvement. And fome of the farms, which are under 
proper management, make very good returns. 

Produce, Seafons, &amp;c. — The ordinary crops raifed in this 
parifh, are barley, oats, peafe, beans, and potatoes. There 
is alfo fome wheat and hay ; but not much. The ufual time 
of fowing oats, peafe, and beans, in this parifh, in ordinary 
feafons, is the months of March and April, and the barley 
in May. It is ufually over by the 20th of the month.— The 
harveft commonly begins towards the end of Auguft, or be- 
ginning of September ; and, excepting fome late fpots, is 
over by the tenth of October. As foon as the barley, oats, 
and peafe are got in, the potatoes are taken up and houfed, 
which concludes the harveft work. 

Improvements. — Agriculture, in this parifh, until within 
thefe few years, has continued much in the fame ftate that 
it was about 150 years ago ; the feuers, who poffefs the

grcatcft part of the parifh, following the fame fyRem of 
farming, that had been handed down to them by their fa- 
thers. What indeed proved an infurmountable bar to im- 
provement, was, the lands of different proprietors lying 
ihterfperfed with one another, commonly called run-rig, 
which wss a cafe that very much prevailed through many 
parts of Scotland •, but it is now hardly known in this part of 
the country. About 16 years ago, a very confiderable part of 
the beft lands in the parifh, which lay in that ftate  were di- 
vided ; when the different proprietors got their refpective 
proportions of ground laid together, each by itfelf. This has 
been productive of feveral very defirable confluences ; 
fuch as, cutting off endlefs quarrels and difputes, that were 
continually taking place between the different proprietors, or 
their tenants, about their encroaching or trefpaffing upon 
one another ; and fo eftablifhing peace and harmony amongft 
neighbours, inftead of flrife and variance. It has alfo open- 
ed up a door to improvements of every kind. For, immedia- 
tely upon the ground being divided, the different proprie- 
tors inclofed and fub-divided, with ditch and hedge, their re - 
fpedHve proportions of land. And the feveral inclofures are 
•now alternately under oats, barley, hay, pafture, &amp;c. to the 
no fmall benefit of the proprietors, and the pleafure of the 
traveller. Some late purchafers are carrying on very confi- 
derable improvements in the modern ftyle ; the agreeable and 
beneficial effects of which are daily appearing. 

Minerals. — This part of the country abounds in coal, of 
different qualities. Three coal-works are going on at pre- 
fent in this parifh •, two upon the South fide of the Dovan ; 
the one at Mellack, the property of the Duke of Argyll ; the 
other clofely adjoining to it, but belonging to Lord Alva. 
Upon the fcsorth fide of. the Dovan, and near to the town 

of 



of Dollar. 



161 



of Dollar, there is another coal-work, belonging alfo to the 
Duke of Argyll. Thefe works employ in whole about 18 
working people ; befides a horfe gin for drawing the coals. 
From thefe coal-works, and thofe of Blarngone, (in the pa- 
rifh of Foflbway, but immediately upon the border of this 
parifh on the S. E.) very great quantities of coals are annu- 
ally carried many miles into Strathern, on the North fide 
of the Ochil hills. — Iron-ftone is alfo found in different parts 
of the parifh, and faid to be of very excellent quality. It is 
working at prefent by the Dovan Company, who are nowe- 
recting a public work at Sauchie, fome miles to the weft- 
ward, in the parifh of Clackmannan. * The Ochil hills con- 
fift^chiefly of whin-done ; but freerftone alfo is found in dif- 
ferent places of the parifh. 

Hills-, Rivulets, tsfc. — The only hill's in this parifh, are 
the Ochils, They begin in the parifh of Dumblane, imme- 
diately Eaft from the SherrifT-riuiir, and firetch in an eaftern 
direction many miles into Fife. In this parifh they are of 
confiderable height •, perhaps fome thoufand feet. They are, 
as already obferved, of a beautiful green ; afford excellent 
pafture for fheep, and produce mutton of the fineft flavour. 

Vol. XV. X From 

* Some time ago, a vein of JLe^d was .difcovered in the Ochil hills, a little 
a'oove the town of Dollar ; and wrought by a Company for feveral years. 
From this work, a confiderable quantity, both of Lead and of Copper .Ore, 
is faid to have been fhipped off for Holland. But it is faid that the Company, 
fomehow difagrecing among themfelves, gave it up. Neverthelefs, it is be- 
lieved, that if a Company of fpirit were to make a thorough trial, it might 
turn to good account. Silver Ore, in confiderable quantities, is likewifc 
faid to have been found in the Glen of Cart, or rather of Cairn, on the Weft 
of Caftle- Campbell ; but that it did not anfwej- the expence of working it. 
Pfbbles, of confiderable value, have alfo been found upon the top of a hijl 
above CaMe-Campbcll, called the White JVi/p.

From their verdant fides, many beautiful rivulets of the fin- 
ed water are daily -gliding down, for the health and refrefh- 
ment of the inhabitants who dwell below. 

Roads. — There are two high- ways paffing through this 
pnrilh, leading from Stirling to Kinrofs. The one is upon 
the fouth fide of the Dovan ; and the other upon the north 
fide. That upon the fouth" fide of the Dovan is only in pari) 
formed, but not gravelled •, and as it paflfes through clay 
grounds, it is fcarcely paiTable in winter. But that upon the 
north fide of the Dovan, as it partes along the foot of the O- 
chil hills, where the bottom is a hard channel, is equally firm 
and paflable at all feafons ; and therefore is moft frequented. 
The proper ftage upon that road, between Stirling and Kin- 
rofs, is Dollar. The greateft fault of it is, that it is too nar- 
row ; for, in fome places, two carriages meeting can do no 
more than pafs. Were it only widened a little, nature has fuf- 
fkiently gravelled it. They who have marked it out at firft, 
humouring the nature of the ground along the foot of th^ 
hills, have formed it much after the nv.'.nncr of a ferpen- 
tine walk. It is very much frequented, not only by thofe 
* who travel from Stirling to Kinrofs, but alfo by thofe who 
go to Perth, Dundee, &amp;c. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has decreafed, 
very little within thefe 40 years.

Bleachficlds and Mills. — There is a very fine bleachfield in 
this parith beautifully fituated on the banks of the Dovan. It 
was erecled by Mr William Haig, the prefent proprietor, in 
the year 1787. The machinery, which is excellent, is driven 
by water from the Dovan, while the canals, boilers, &amp;c. are 
plentifully fupplied, at all feafons, with the fined filtrated 
water from the hills. The trade of this field has much in- 
creafed fince its firft commencement. For the firft and 
fecond years, there were fcarcely 6 acres of ground under 
cloth. Whereas, in the prefent year, 1793, there are 20 acres 
covered with it. The greateft part of the cloth, bleached at 
this field, is the diaper, or table linen of Dunfermline, the

firft town in Britain, (we may even fay in the World,) for 
this manufacture ; the table linen made there being, both in 
point of quality and variety of patterns, incomparably fupe- 
rior to what is to be found any where elfe. Nor can any 
place fupply the demands to London, and other places for 
that article, upon the fame terms. Befides, the author is 
well informed, that improvements are daily making in feve- 
ral branches of that bufinefs, which promife to be of great 
fervice with regard to the elegance of the patterns *. The 
new chemical method of bleaching, by the oxygenated muriatic 
acid, has been tried at this field with much fuccefs. In the 
year i 790, Mr Haig gained a premium from the Honourable 
Board of Truftees for that method of bleaching. Since that 
time, he hath made feveral valuable difcoveries, both as to 
the preparation and application of this acid, and finds it very 
ufeful •, particularly at the end of the feafon, when the fun 
fo greatly lofes its influence. He then finifhes off goods by 
this^ method of bleaching, which otherwife could not be 
done until the next year. By this method, he bleaches cotton 
goods through the whole feafon ; and finds it much better 
adapted for cotton than for linen. In this parifli there are 
two mills for grain, one of them has machinery for making 
barley, and rollers for grinding malt. There are alfo two 
waulk mills for fcouring cloth, &amp;c.

% The fchoolmafters, eftablifhed in this parifli, have, from time immemo-

Antiquities. — In the neighbourhood of the town cf Dollar, 
there are two little round mounds * , about a quarter of a 
mile diltant from each other. But the principal antiquity in 
this parifl), is the venerable remains of Castle Campbell-^ ; 

anciently 

paid upwards of 1,61 1 1. Sterling. At his death, he left for the ufe of the 
poor in this parifh, 300 merks Scocch money. — Mifs Jean Gray, his only 
chijd,of refpectable memory, fome few years before her death, which happen- 
ed in the year 179a, fold both of thefe baronies of land ; that of Teaffes for 
33,5001. Sterling, and that of Foffaway for 6.500 1. Sterling ; amounting in 
whole to 20,000 1. Sterling. At her death fhe left many confiderable lega- 
cies : among thefe there was 50I. Sterling to the poor of this parifh, and a 
very elegant folio bible to the kirk-feffion, for the ufe of the minifter. 

* In the one of thefe, fome years ago, were found two urns, filled with 
human bones ; but upon what occufion,or by whom they were depofitcd there, 
is not known. The other mound remains in the fame ftate it hath been time 
immemorial. — Towards the end of the laft century} a man was burnt for 
a wizard, at the foot of the Gloom Hill, not many yards from the town of, 
Dollar. 

f It would feem not to be now known, ivhen or by ivham this venerable 
pile of building \\-as firft erected. But the ruins plainly fhe;v, that it had 
been defigned for a place of ftrength ; and therefore was probably built in 
the turbulent days of old, whet; family feuds fo unhappily prevailed among 
the Scotch barons. Nor can we difcover the precife period when it came 
into the poffcffion of the family of Argyll : Buf, (rnm the inventary of their 
titles, that family appears to have poffeffed that barony, and the lands belong- 
to it, called the LoriDSHrp 01 Campbell, fo far back as the year 1463. The 
lands were then held of the bifhop of Dunkeld. Formerly, it went by the 
name of the Castle of Gloom : but for what reafon, we are not certain. 
Tiadition, indeed, which wifhes to inform us of every thing, reports, that it 
was fo called from the following circumflancc : A daughter of one of our 
Scotch Kings, who then refided at Dunfermline, happening to fall into dif- 
grace for fome improper behaviour, was, by way of punifhment, fent and 
confined in thiscaftle; and flic, (not rclifhing her fituation, which probably 
might be in fome vault or other) faid, that it was a gloomy prifon to her. 
Kcnce, fays tradition, it came to be called the Caftle of Gloom. Very near to

»t on die Coaft, there Is a green hill, which rt ill goes by the name of GUom. 
Hill, the property of Mr John Moir, wiiter to the fignet. 

And now that we have mentioned tradition, we fhall prefent the reader 
with an anecdote concerning this place, from the fame fource, which, perhaps, 
may be more curious than true. In going down from the caftle, towards the 
point of the rock which overhangs the glens, there is a pafiage cut down 
through the rock to the fide of the burn, in the bottom of the glen. This 
pnffagc is faid to be from top to bottom more than 100 feet deep, and fix feet 
wide. The defign of it was to get water conveyed, or brought up from the 
burn or rivulet below, in the time of a fiege. This feems the more likely, as 
it appears to have been cut out with fteps, which arc now moftly filled up 
with earth. This paffage, partly from the trees, and partly from the fiight- 
ful rocks overhanging it, is now become fo dark and gloomy, that a perfon 
can fee but a very little way down into it : and indeed, to look into it, would 
be fufficient to make a perfon of weak nerves fhudder. It is called Kemp's 
Score or Cv rT, from its having been made by one of that name ; who is faid 
to have been a man of gigantic flature and ftrength, and at the fame time of 
a very bold and refolute temper. It is reported, that he had committed many 
depredations, and at laft was fo daring as to enter the palace at Dunfermline, 
and carry off the King's dinner; but that a young nobleman, who happened 
to be in difgrace for improper behaviour towards the King's daughter, hear- 
ing of it, purfued the faid Kemp, and having cut off his head, threw the body 
a into the water of Dovan, a little above the back mill, and, as his name was 
VTir.r.tAM, fo the place where this happened, is called Willie's Pool, to 
this day. But on his carrying the head with him to Court, lie obained his 
pardon, ar.d was received into favour again. 

But to return to the caftle, that ancient feat of the Argyll Family : The 
name was, by an aifl of the Scotch Parliament, in, or before the year 1493, 
changed to that of the Cajllt of Campbell, by which name it has ever fine'e been 
denominated. It is reported, that this was aniongft the firft of thofe places 
in Scotland, where the facramer.t of the Lord's Supper was difper.fed, after 
the Reformation. And it is certain, from his own hiftory, that the famous 
fouN Knox, the Scotch reformer, did preach here. For he tells us, that, up- 
on his being called over by the English. Congregation at Geneva, who had 
cliofen him for their paftcr ; he fent over his family before him, but he hiru-

guiflied for their attachment to religion, liberty, and patrio- 
tifm. And the prefent worthy head, and reprefentative of 
ghat noble Family, treading in the fteps of his illuftrious an- 
ceftors, dignifies and adorns the exalted ftation which he fills- 
By the lapfe of time, and the violence of ftorms, a very con- 
fiderable part of Caftle-Campbell is now fallen dowrt j and 
other parts of it are nodding over their foundations. The 
tower is yet nearly entire. The afcent is by a fpiral ftair, 
which is continued to the top. It is vifited by moft ftrang- 
crs who come here ; and though it is a pretty fatiguing walk 
up to it, yet when they reach the lop of the tower, which is of 
confiderable height, they are much pleafed, not only with the 
Vol. XV- Y view, 

Tclf remained behind in Scotland, for fome time ; during which, he parted to 
Archibald, whom he (tiled « the Old Earl of Argyll," then refiding at 
the Cattle of Campbell, and there he taught, or preached, certain days. It is 
not improbable, therefore, that he difpenfed the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup- 
per the:e, at the Fame time. One of the company, who was then flaying 
with the Earl at CafHe Campbell, was the laird of Glenorchy, one of the an- 
ceflbrs of the prefent family of Breadalbane ; who importuned the Earl to 
defire Mr Knox to flay fome time with them; but Mr Knox could not con- 
fent to it. This Archibald was the 4th Earl of Argyll ; and is faid to have 
been the firft. man of quality who embraced the Proteftant Religion in Scot- 
land, and contributed all in his power to bring about the Reformation. 

The Caftle of Campbell continued to be the occafional refidence of the 
family of Argyll, as appears from the fervices which the vaffals were obliged, 
by their charters, to perform to the family, when refiding there ; until that 
magnificent building was burnt down by the Marquis of Montrose, about 
the year 1644 ; and ever fince it has been in ruins. And not only the Caf- 
tle of Campbell, but the whole of the parifhes, both of Dollar and Muckart, 
were burnt , the inhabitants being vaffals of the family of Argyll, excepting 
one houfe in Dollar, which they imagined to belong to the Abbey of Dun- 
fermline. There was likewife only one houfe faved from the flames, in 
Muckart ; which they imagined to be in the parifli of Foffoway ; being near- 
ly adjoining to it. Befides that, there was a fheep-houfe that efcaped the 
general conflagration. Every other houfe in both parifhes was, by the 
Grahams, burnt to the ground.

view, but more particularly with the furrounding fcene, 
which is truly enchanting. 

Romantic Savery around the Cojlle. — The fituation of thefe 
venerable ruins is fo me what retired backwards amongft the 
hills, with a beautiful opening before it, as it were a kind of 
vifta, through which to view the plains below : And being 
pretty high, it commands a confiderablv extenfive profpett 
towards the Forth, and the adjacent country. It is fituated 
upon the top of a round mound, which would feem to have 
been partly formed by the hand of nature, and partly finifh- 
ed by art. It ftands a little back from the point of a high 
rock ; having a deep ravine or glen upon each hand ; with very 
fteep banks, whofe declivity commences from the very foot 
of the walls on both fides, and is almoft wholly inacceffible. 
In the bottom of the glens, run murmuring rivulets of the 
pureft water, which come down from the mountains behind, 
and unite their ftreams immediately below the caftle. Each 
of the rivulets furnifhes a beautiful cafcade, to entertain the 
eye of their vifitants, and fomewhat reward them for the fa- 
tigue they have had in climbing the hill. The mound on 
which the caftle ftands, was formerly disjoined from the 
mountains behind, with a fofse, or ditch, (helving down to 
the bottom of the glen on both fides, which renders it almoft 
inacceffible on every fide ; the entry, then, being by a draw- 
bridge, which was let d^wn or taken up as occafion requir- 
ed. The banks of the glens, on both fides, are beautifully a- 
dorned with natural woods, which nearly cover the faces of 
the rugged rocks with which this romantic fcene is inter- 
fperfed. It is almoft furrounded with hills. Immediately 
behind it, is the hill called the White Wifp ; which fo much 
overtops all its fellows, that it furnifhes a rich and extenfive 
profpe£t. From this elevated fituation, looking towards the

country, as far as the hill of Tintoc in Clydefdale. Then 
turning to the North, one fees the mod part of the (hires of 
Perth and Fife, as far Baft as Dundee, and the German O- 
cean ; with the Lothians on the oppofite fide of the Forth. 
A little to the South-Wed of the White Wifp, is the place 
called the Kings Seat ; where, according to tradition, the 
Jcings of Scotland, then refiding at Dunfermline, fat, and 
viewed the hunting of the wild bears, which then haunted a- 
mongft thefe hills ; whence feveral places, particularly in the 
farm of Craiginnan, immediately above the Caftle, are named, 
fome of them, the Bears t/eti, and others, the Bear's Know, 
to this day. Thus, the fcene around this ancient feat of 
Campbell, confiding of rocks, and woods, and glens, and 
mountains, contains a pleafing mixture of the beautiful, the 
piclurefque, and the awfully romantic. 

Literary Shepherd. — There is living at prefent in this pa- 
rifh, in a very advanced age, a man who was bred up, and 
lived merely as a fhepherd, and who received only a common 
education ; and yet pofTelfes a valuable library of books, con- 
taining upwards of 370 volumes ; confiding of folios, quar- 
tos, octavos, duodecimos, and decimo-quartos. They are u- 
pon many different fubjc&amp;s, as divinity, hidory, travels, voy- 
ages, &amp;c. befides magazines of various kinds, fuchas the Scots, 
the Univerfal, and the Chridian magazines ; a complete fet 
»*of the Spectator, Guardian, Tatler, Rambler, &amp;c. They 
are all of them his own chufing and purchafing. They 
are neatly bound, and lettered on the back. His name is 
upon a printed ticket, and parted on the infide of the board 
of each volume ; with a mark, generally of blue paper, cut on 
purpofe, and placed in each volume, to prevent folding in the 
leaves. The books are all clean, and in excellent order. Be-

was born in this parifh, and baptized on the nth of October 
1712, and has lived in it from his infancy. His brother Wil- 
liam, and his fifter Margaret, who are a few years younger, 
live in the fame houfe with him, and all the three remain 
unmarried. 

General Char after, &amp;c. — The people are fober, regular, and 
induftrious in their different profeflions and employments ; 
and live in peace and harmony with one another. The com- 
mon employment of the women, except fuch as are engaged 
with farmers for husbandry work, is that of fpining wool for 
the manufacturers in Stirling, Bannockburn, &amp;c. They all 
enjoy, in their refpective ftations, a reafonable fhare of the con- 
veniences and comforts of life ; and fome feem well contented 
with the condition in which Providence has placed them. 
They are much of the ordinary fize, and fpeak the Englifh 
language tolerably well, without any remarkable provincial 
dialect.

T his parifh is fituated in the S. E. corner of the coun- 
ty of Berwick. Ics borders are waflied on the South by the 
river Whitaddei-, and on the Eaft by the German Ocean, 
near which it joins the lands belonging to the town of Ber- 
wick upon Tweed, commonly called Berwick Bounds. Its 
form is irregular, much refembling the letter g. — Its length 
from S. to N. is between 3 and 4 miles ; its breadth towards 
the northern extremity is above two miles, though at one 
place, towards the South, it is only the breadth of the mini- 
ftcr's glebe, which is all that feparates the parilh of Fouldcn 
from the Berwick bounds. Its original extent was very fmall, 
confiding only of the barony of Mordington, and the eftate 
of Edrington, till the year 1650 ; when the lands of Lammer- 
ton, (of much greater extent than the whole of what before

that period conftitutcd the parHh,) were disjoined from the 
parifli of Ayton, and annexed to Mordington. Limmerton I 
had originally been either a feparatc parifli, or a chapel of j 
eafe to Ayton. * The building in which public worfhip 
was performed ft ill remains, and is now the burying place I 
of the family of Lamer ton. The writer of this article has 1 
not been able to learn the etymology of Mordington. Lam- I 
inerlen is probably derived from the French, la met; expref- •]

Surface and Soil. — On the South, towards the river Whit- 
adder, the ground is flat, and riles by a gentle and gradual 
afcent'to the North, for more than half the length of the 
parifh j when it attains a very confiderable elevation above 
the level of the fea, to which the lands again gradually def- 
cend on the eaft of this ridge. For fome fpace from the 
Whitadder, the foil is a ftiff clay, well adapted for wheat 
and beans ; from thence to the fea fide, the land is a light 
loam, on a rotten rocky bottom, which renders it excellent 
for raifing turnips and found for grazing fheep. The rnqft 
elevated part of the ridge is thin and poor, though the great- 
eft 

* Tin: church or chapel of Lammerton, is noted to have been the place 
where J -kig James IV. of Scotland was married to Margaret, daughter 
ef Henky VII. of England, in the year 1503 ; which paved the way for the 
happy Union, firflr, of the two Crowns, and afterwards of the two kingdoms. 
Some alledge, that it was built on puipofe for the celebration of that mar-

fihfc King of Scotland granted to the clergyman of this parifh, and his fuc- 
ceffors, in all time coming, the liberty of marrying peoplt -without proclamation

tradition.

eft part of it has been plowed, and it feems all capable of cul- 
tivation. 

Climate and Sea/ens. — The drynefs of the foil, and its vi- 
cinity to the fea, render the air pure and healthy, and occa- 
fion a quick and early vegetation. There are no difeafes pe- 
culiar to this diftricl. In the lower part of the parifh, as in 
moft of the flat grounds in this part of the country, the ague 
was formerly prevalent among the lower claffes of the peo- 
p!a. The caufe of that diftemper, which arofe chiefly from 
the exhalation of the vapours from the ftagnated water, in 
wet and marfhy grounds, being now in a great meafure re- 
moved, by the mode that is fo generally adopted through this 
county of draining and inclofing the fields, the difeafe is 
lefs frequent. And the fame reafon may perhaps be given 
for the decreafe of comfumptive complaints, throughout the 
whole of the lower parts of Berwick-fhire. The prejudices 
of the country people in this quarter, againft inoculation for 
the fmall-pox, are gradually wearing away ; and confequently 
that diftemper is becoming much more mild, and lefs def- 
trucHve than formerly. Though the inhabitants in general 
are healthy and robuft, yet there have not been many re- 
markable inftances of longevity in this parifh. Some howe- 
ver have appeared. 

Agriculture.— -The fituation of this diftricb, as well as the 
foil of a very confiderable of it, is peculiarly favourable to 
the purpofesof agriculture j the lands, in general, being of 
a dry and manageable foil, which the flcilful farmer can turn 
to the greateft advantage ; and the climate being fo favourable, 
that grain of every kind, even in the lateft and moft back- 
ward feafons, is commonly brought to full maturity. Be- 
fides .which, it has- the command of two of the beft and

molt ufeful manures, lime and clung •, both of which are to 
be got in the town and neighbourhood of Berwick, which is 
only 4 miles diftant. Thefe local advantages have not been 
unattended to, by thofe perfons who occupy the lands. Great 
quantities of Hove are annually bought, and are employed 
both in improving the wafte lands, ami in manuring thofe 
that are already improved. And evtn dung is now begin- 
ning to be brought in confiderable. quantities from Berwick, 
a practice which, if perfevered in, muft in time greatly add 
to the fertility of the foil ; and, notwithftanding the expencej 
with which the purchafing and driving of it is attended, will, 
without doubt, ultimately turn out to th* advantage both of 
the proprietors and tenants. 

Produce and Experts. — Nor is lefs attention paid to the 
management than to the manuring of the lands. Unfetter- 
ed by thofe prejudices, and that obftinate attachment to an- 
cient cuftoms, which are fo great a bar to cultivation, and 
have fo much retarded the progrefs of agriculture in other 
parts of Scotland, a fpirit of improvement as well as of induf- 
try is difcernible among the farmers in this and the neigh- 
bouring parifhes : In confequence of which, every fpecies 
both of white and green crops are raifed, and, in general, in 
the greatefl perfection ; particularly barley, oats, pcafe, tur- 
nips, and artificial graffes. Though the foil is, in many pla- 
ces, fuitable for wheat and beans, yet they are raifed in fmal- 
ler quantities than the other kinds of grain ; probably be- 
caufe the former does not fo readily fall in with a rotation, 
in which green crops are chiefly ftudied, and becaufe there 
is not, in this part of the country, a ready market for the lat- 
ter. Potatoes are raifed not only for home confumption, but 
great quantities from this neighbourhood are alfo annually

flapped at Berwick, and fent to London, Newcaftle, and dif- 
ferent parts of Yorkdhire. This parilh alfo produces a much 
greater quantity of grain, than is fufhcient for the fubfiftence 
of its inhabitants, which is either difpofed of in Berwick, 
where it generally meets witli a ready market, or fold td 
the millers in the neighbourhood, many of whom carry on a 
great trade in meal, barley, &amp;c. 

Turnip Husbandry. — The time of Towing and reaping the 
different kinds of grain, is the fame with , that of moll of 
the other parilhes in the lower part of Berwir;k-fhire, with 
the advantage of being as early as any of them. Turnips 
are generally fown from the end of May to the beginning of 
July. Though they are fometimes fown in what is called 
broad-cafi, that is on ridges made up in the fame manner as 
thofe on which barley, oats, or any other grain are common- 
ly fown ; yet they are more frequently raifed on drills, from 
24 to 30 inches wide. This latter method is preferred, on 
account of its giving an opportunity for hoirfe hoeing, and 
thus occ-ifioning lefs manual labour, and qonfequently lefs 
expence in thinning and cleaning them. When they afe 
brought to maturity, which is generally about the month of 
October, they are made ufe of for feeding cattle and fheep, 
either on the grounds on which .they are raifed, or on neigh- 
bouring grafs fields, into which they are carried; or they are 
■brought home for the purpofe of feeding black cattle in 
houfes or (hades. On the light and dry foil, the feeding of 
faeep on the ground where the turnips grow, is reckoned a 
moft valuable improvement, as the land, loofe and friable,' 
both by nature and by the frequent plowing necefTary for raif- 
ing the turnips, attains, from the conftant trampling of th6 
fheep, a fubftance and folidity which makes it highly fit for

plowing ; and from the great quantity of dung left on the 
furface, infurcs a luxuriant crop of"gr.un and hay in the fol- 
lowing years. When the turnips are brought home for feeding 
cattle in the flail, they likewife become a ufeful and a valua- 
ble crop, net only from the immediate profit which arifes 
from them, but alfo from the great return of manure which 
they afford for fucceeding crops. From the favourable na- 
ture of the foil, the turnip-husbandry is conducted on an ' 
extenfive fcale in this, and many of the neighbouring parifhes. 
And as great attention is paid to the cultivation, fo great 
improvements have of late been made in the conftru&amp;ion of 
the utenfils for fowing and for facilitating the operations of 
the husbandman, in rearing this ufeful plant. The greateft 
enemy to the culture of turnips, is a fmall infect, which in 
fize and fhape very much rcfembles the flea. It commonly 
attacks the plants at a very early period, immediately after 
they begin to vegetate ; and in fome feafons makes fuch 
dreadful havock among them, as not only to injure, but fre- 
quently totally to deftroy the crop. The beft remedy againft 
this evil is to fow them early and very thick •, 4 lib. at lead 
or 5 lib of feed to the Englifh acre- This feems a method 
well calculated, to infure a crop of turnips. The fly feldom 
remains many days on the ground, and when fuch a quanti- , 
ty of feed is fown, though the firft growth may be dellroyed, 
yet as every fucceeding fhower, or even dewy night, for a con- 
fiderable time, occafions a frefh vegetation of feed that has , 
been buried deeper in the ground ; it is next to a certainty 
that fome one of thefe growths will efcape the ravages* of the 
fly, and produce a fufficiently plentiful crop. Many have I 
been the inftances of the propriety of this theory, in this pa- 
rifh, within thefe few years. In their more advanced ftatc, 
turnips are in fome feafons attacked by a caterpillar. Though 
• the injury which they receive from it is frequently confidera- jj

l)!e, yet it is feldom fo great as to occafion a total failure of 
the crop. 

Sivedi/h Turnip,— It may not be improper in this place to 
mention that the Ruta Baga, or the Swedijh turnip, has been 
cultivated with considerable fuccefs by the two heritors of this 
parifh. In a country like this, where flock occupies fo 
much attention, and renders fuch benefit to the farmer, 
fome root or plant feems wanting to give to the cattle, 
between the time that the turnips begin to fhoot, and of 
courf:, to ceafe to afford nourifhment, and the coming in of 
the grafs* The ruta baga feems admirably calculated for 
that purpofe. For befides being later of (hooting than the 
turnip, it lofes not its nutritive qualities after it has (hot, but 
retains all its juices and folidity : Whereas it is well known 
that a turnip, after it has put forth its flower, becomes dry, 
light, and reedy, and in every refpe£l unfit for feeding either 
cattle or fheep. Horfes too feem very fond of it ; and one of 
the gentlemen above alluded to, has this winter given them to 
his out-lying young horfes,' who eat them with great eager- 
nefs. He was led to try this experiment, from obferving 
that when theft young horfes broke out of the field, they 
conftantly fed on the ruta baga, though in the fame field 
there was a large quantity of turnips, which they never of- 
fered to touch. Another extraordinary quality of the ruta 
baga is, that it feems impoffible'to make it rot ; though bit or 
trod upon by cattle or horfes, it never rots, but whatever part 
of the root is left, nay, if fcooped out to the fhell, it remains 
perfectly frefh, and in fpririg puts out a new Rem. It is 
needlefs to obferve that the oppofite of this obtains with 
the turnip. The culture too of this valuable root is perfectly 
fimple : When firft attempted in this parifh, the gentlemen 

Y 2 followed 



1 8b Statijlkal Account 1 

followed the rules laid down in the news-papers, viz. Railing 
the plants in a hot bed, and then tranfplanting them into 
the field. This method never anfwered ; they rofe to no fize ; 
but on their trying then; by the feed fown in the field, and 
managed in every fcfpett the fame as turnips, (only fown a 
month earlier) all their expectations were gratified, and 
good crops followed. Both roots and leaves are alfo excel- 
lent for culinary purpofes ; and for that caufe, numbers of 
people in this neighbourhood now raifc a few in their gar- 
dens for the pot. Before concluding this article, it is worth 
mentioning, as an example of what feeding will do, when 
carried on, according to the above fyft'em, by a confront fuc- 
ceffion of green food : There is an , ox at prefent in the parifh, 
bred by one of the heritors, which, though only 4 years old, 
is allowed by all judges to be above an hundred ftones 
weight ; i. e. the weight of the four quarters only. He ne- 
ver has been houfed, and never got any thing but turnips, 
grafs, and a little hay. His dam, when in calf of him, was 
bought for 6 1. Sterling. 

Rotation of Crops — The ufual rotation of crops is, fir ft oats, 
then turnips ; after thefe, barley v.-ith grafs feeds, which 
makes the fucceeding crops hay ; and the ground, upon which 
it is raifed, is commonly allowed to remain in grafs for paf- 
ture fome years ; after which it is again taken up, and ma- 
naged according to the above rotation. Two crops of oats 
are fometimes allowed after the land has lain long in grafs : 
But in no other cafe are two wnite crops allowed to fucceed 
each other, and the tenants are feldom permitted to have 
more than the half of their lands in tillage. Wheat is gene- 
rally fown on the ftrong clay lands after plain fallow ; and on 
the dry grounds it is fometimes fown after clover, ley, and fome 
times on the lands where the turnip crop has failed. There is 

always 



of Mordington. 



always, however, a great proportion of the lands in grafs ; and 
as the fields are generally laid down in good order, they not on- 
]y afford greater profit to the farmer in this ftate, than he 
could derive from the fcanty produce of a conftant fuccefhon 
of corn crops, but alfo amply repay him for the reft he gives 
them, by the luxuriant crops which they yield when taken up, 
after having been paftured for fome years. By this mode of 
management, to which the tenants are bound down in their 
kales, the lands are not only kept clean, and freed from thofe 
noxious weeds, which are fo prejudicial to the grain fown, or 
the plants raifed on them, but are alfo prevented from being 
impoverifhed by oyer- cropping. 

River, Fi/Ij, and Mills. — The river Whitadder, which wafh- 
es the fouthern boundary of this parifh abounds in trouts, 
eels, &amp;c And at certain feafons of the year, large quanti- 
ties of falmon, and falmon trouts, come up, which afford good 
fport to the anglers. In fpawning time, great numbers of 
falmon go up the river, even almoft to its fource, to depolit 
their fpawn. Till of late years, great havock ufed to be made 
among them at that feafon, by the country people ; but fince 
the paffing an a£t of the Legiflature, for preferving the fifh in 
the river Tweed and the'ftreams running into it, thefe prac- 
tices have been greatly checked, by the exertions of the magis- 
trates and proprietors, to the great benefit of the valuable 
"*fifhings on the Tweed. On the eftate of Edington, befides a 
mill for other kinds of grain, there are two mills for grind- 
ing wheat, in which about 300 bolls are every week made 
into flour. 

Coajf, and Sea Fijh. — On the coaft, which, towards the Eaft 
of the parifh, is very bold and rocky, there are abundance of 

all 



J$2 



Stati/lical Account 



all the kinds of fifh that are to be found in the mouth of 
the Frith of Forth, which are fold at very reafonable rates. 
Lobfters and crabs are in plenty, but there are no oyflers or 
mufcles. The lobfters are almoft all carried to London by 
fmacks that come along the coaft for that purpofc, at ftated 
intervals. 

Minerals, Game, cjrV — In the rocks on the coafl, great 
quantities of lime- (tone are to be found, though not of a 
good quality : Coal and iron ore alfo make their appearance, 
and immenfe blocks of free-ftone of the fineft fort. The 
ufual kinds of game, which are to be found in the lower 
parts of Berwick-fhire, are here in great plenty. On the 
higher grounds in this parifh, dotterels are fuppofed to ap- 
pear fooncr than on any parts in the fouth of Scotland. 
Woodcocks are often found in the early part of the feafon, 
poor, weak, and exhaufted, probably from their long flight 
acrofs the German Ocean. 

Population. — If, as is generally fuppofed, the monopoly of 
' farms, and the abridgement of labour, in confequencc of the 
improved (late of agriculture, uniformly operate to the 
diminifhing the number of the inhabitants, certainly the de- 
'creafe of the population of this parifh ought of late years to 
have been confiderable ; as the whole lands, except what are 
in the poffeflion of the proprietors are, at prefent, farmed by 
three tenants, one of whom is not refident, but farms to a 
confiderable extent in a neighbouring pari fit. From any en- 
quiries, lvowever, which the incumbent has made, he does 
not find that the decreafe has been fo great as might have 
been expected. And he fhould imagine, that, if a full invefti- 
gation were made of the matter, there would be lefs caufe 
than is generally fuppofed, for regretting that union of farms,

which now fo generally prevails in this and many other 
parts of Scotland. It would indeed be unlucky, if a mode 
of farming, which muft be allowed greatly to increafe the 
moft ufeful and moft necefliiry commodities of a country, 
mould have a tendency to diminifh the number of its inha- 
bitants. For there cannot be a doubt, that by the prefent 
fyftem of hufbandry, which prevails in this part of the coun- 
try, the grounds produce a much greater quantity of every 
rpecies of grain, and afford fuftenance to double the number 
of cattle, fheep, and fiock of every kind, than they did be- 
fore this mode was adopted. Its being carried on by fewer 
hands, in confequence of the abridgement of labour, and a 
greater proportion of the lands being thrown into grafs, 
though it muft no doubt diminifh the number of the people 
employed in the purpofes of agriculture, and in many pa- 
rifhes, where that forms the fole employment of the inhabi- 
tants, render fuch parifhes lefs populous ; yet it does not 
follow, as a juft inference from thence, that the number of 
inhabitants in the country at Large is thereby diminilhed. It 
lias only the effect of making the fuperfluous hands betake 
themfelves to other occupations, and thus become the means 
of increafing the number of our manufacturers, and furnifh- 
ing labourers for other ufeful and important purpofes ; fuch 
as making and repairing the public roads, inclofing and drain- , 
ing the fields, &amp;c. And there cannot be a doubt, that even 
in this county, where the monopoly of farms is perhaps car- 
ried to a greater length, than in any other county in Scotland, 
it will be found, when the extent of its whole population is as- 
certained, that the number of its inhabitants is rather increaf- 
ed than diminifhcd : And that the diminution in many of fhc 
parochial diftricts, from the caufes above mentioned, is more 
than counter-balanced by the additional increafe in the towns 
and villages. This reasoning will appear the more conclu- 
de.

five, when the fact is dated, that the population, whatever

ally nigh doubled, firtce the lute eminent Dr Webfter made

Employments. — Like mod of the other parifhes in the coun- 
ty of Berwick, the chief employment of its inhabitants is 
hufbandry. 'Till of late, there were indeed two manufac- 
tures carried on within the bounds of the parifli, though 
none of them on an extenfive fcale, the one a ftarch, and the 
other a , foap manufacture. They are both, however, given 
up, at leaft for the prefent. Befides thofe employed in the 
purpofes of agriculture, there are, as in all other country pa- 
rifhes, a few who follow fuch mechanical occupations, as arc 
requifite for the accommodation of the inhabitants ; fuch as 
joiners and fmiths, for manufacturing the utenfils of huf- 
bandry — tailors, weavers, &amp;c. There is one fifliing boat 
belonging to the parifli, which gives employment to 5 fiflier- 
men, who are 3s active and induitrious as any in this part of 
the coaft. 

Prices of Labour. — The wages of men fervants who get 
their board in the houfe, are from 7I. to 81. a year ; of wo- 
men fervants, from 3I. to 4I. Servants who have families, 
and live in feparate houfes, are not paid in money, but re- 
ceive a certain quantity of meal or grain, have a cow grazed,

tlieir coals brought home, and feveral other perquifites, the 
whole of which may amount to 1 61. a year. Day-labourers 
commonly receive is. 4i. per day in fummer, and is. in win- 
ter, except in hay-time, and during harveft, when there is a 
confiderable advance in their wages. Thofe who take work 
by the piece generally earn a confiderable deal more. There 

; has, for thefe fome years paft, been a gradual rife on the price 
of labour for weeding turnips, probably owing to the gradu- 

i al extenfionof the tu aip-hufbandry, which requires a great- 
er number, and confequently makes a greater demand for la- 
bourers. The wages are now rod. per day ; whereas, a few 
years ago, they feldom exceeded 6'd. This fpecies of labour 
is generally performed by women and boys, who are very 
expert at it. 

Roads. — The great poft road from Edinburgh to London* 
by Berwick and Newcaftle, runs through the Eaft fide of this 
parifh. The road from Dunfe to Berwick panes through 
the South part of it. This, as well as all the other great and 
leading roads through Berwick fhire, is made and repaired 
by the money which is levied at toll-bars, which have lately 
been erected. The inftitution of turnpikes has been of the 
greateft utility to this country. Formerly, the roads were of- 
ten in fuch a fituatiori, as to render impoflible, either for car- 
riages or horfes to get through 5 whereas, there is now an 
open and an eafy communication, at all feafons of the year, 
for horfes and carriages of every defcription. The crofs 
^roads are alfo in a rapid ftate of improvement ; they are 
made and up-held by the ftatute labour, which is commuted. 

Heritors, Rent, &amp;c— There are only two heritors in 
this diftrift, both of whom refide. The real rent of the pa- 
tifh is about 2ccol. Sterling. The valued rent is 2,045!.

Churchy School, and Poor.— The church was built in the 
year 1757, and the manfe a confulerabie time before. The 
latter ha.s lately undergone a complete and thorough repair, 
and is now comfortable and commodious. The ftipend is 
paid partly in money, and partly in grain ; the amount of 
the whole, including the glebe, is, communibus annis, from 
85I. to 90I. .Alexander Renton, Efq; of Lammerton is 
patron. The author of this account has been greatly in- 
debted to this gentleman, for his obliging information and 
afliftance in drawing it up. The fchool-mafter's falary is 
7I. per annum. The poor are maintained chiefly by affeff- 
ments on the heritors and tenants, the collecTions in the 
church being trifling. Until within thefe 10 years, there 
never was a perfon on the poor's roll. Since that time they 
have not been numerous. At prefent there are only two 
that receive a weekly aliment. 

Antiquities. — Monuments of antiquity are not very numerous - 
in this parifh : We have, however, a camp of confiderable ex-j 
tent, which, from its form, is unqueflionably Danifb. It is 
fituated on the N. W. extremity of the parifh, and commands, 
a beautiful profpect over a vaft tracl: of country. It feems tol 
have been a well chofen ftation for the predatory excurfions 
of barbarous ages, and alfo for keeping up a communication j 
with the fea, from which it is at no great diftance. It is fur- 
rounded by two deep trenches, which arc ftill very entire \\ 
the mounds of them feem once to have been faced withl 
ftones. Many of thefe ftones have been carried away forj 
different purpofes : what is remarkable, a kind of ftone has 
been found there, which is not to be feen in any other parti 
of the country, except in the bed of the river Whitadder, 
from whence they mufb have been brought, a diftance of]

the camp (lands is called Hab or Hobcbejer. A little to the 
South-Eaft of this camp is a hill of no great height, but rifing 
abruptly, on which feveral unfortunate women were burnt 
for witch-craft, fo late as the beginning of this century. It 
is (till called the Witch's Know §. Edington Castle, the 
ruins of which now (how its former llrength, alfo demands 
our notice. It is lituated on the banks of the Whittadder, 
near the fouthern extremity of the parifh, on a fteep rock, 
totally inacceffible from the Weft ; at the foot of which the 
river flows. In feudal times, it was an excellent protection 
againit the inroads and depredations of our neighbours, on 
the other fide of the Tweed. It has been a folid and fub- 
ftantial building, as what remains of the walls are compofed 
of immenfe (tones, (trongly cemented together. 

Advantages and Di/udvant.iges. — The advantages, attending 
the fituation of this parifh, greatly overbalance any difadvan- 
tages to which it may be liable. Situated within 4 miles 
of Berwick, (to which there is an excellent road,) the in- 
habitants can with great eafe procure whatever may be want- 
ed, either for convenience or luxury. There alfo they find 
a ready market for whatever they have to difpofe of ; the, 
farmer, in fome degree, for his fat flock of every denomina- 
tion, and always for his ccrn ; and the cottager for his eggs, 
butter, cheefe, or fowls. And, in like manner, they can be 
fupplied with whatever they (land in need of, as well and as 
cheap in Berwick, as in any place in the North of England.

with his buyers, whether it be wool, cattle or fheep •, Ber- \ 
wick being on the ftraight road to Morpeth, Sunderland and I

repair thither at particular feafons, and carry off whatever we ' 
have to part with. ' Tis difficult then to fay, what would melio- 1 
rate the fituation of the inhabitants of this parifli. Fuel pre- \ 
fents itfelf as the readieft means of making their Itate more ? 
comfortable. At prefent they are, 'tis true, 7 miles from coals ; 
but as it is good road, and the tenants drive fo many loads to 
each cottager, this inconvenience is the lefs felt, more efpe- 
cially as the prime coft is very moderate. But there is a rea- 
fonable hope that even this drawback may fhortly be remov- 
ed ; as there is no doubt, that, on the northern extremity of 
the parifh, there is a workable coal, which, it is underftood, 
the proprietor intends ere long to open up, and which will be 
of the greateft benefit to the parifli, as well as to the neigh- 
bourhood. 

Charafler. — Actuated by a fenfe of thefe advantages, the 
inhabitants of this parifh are induftrious,- frugal and orderly, 
fubmiffive to the laws, and attentive to the wifli of their fu- 
periors. No inhabitant has been convicted of a crime be- 
fore a Court of Juftice, in the memory of man. And what 
fhews the regularity of their conduct: in the mofh confpicu- 
ous light, is, that in July 1792, when themoft atrocious riots 
prevailed in this county, on account of the inftitution of 
turnpikes, not one inhabitant of this parifli was carried be- 
fore a magiftrate, or even fufpe&amp;cd of being concerned in 
thofe fhameful enormities which difgraced the county : 
though perhaps the burden, (if there be any,) falls hcavieft 
on them, being fituated at the eaftern extremity of the coun- 
ty, and though they, who pay toll, do not travel ten yards on 

the road, on their way to Berwick.

By the Rev. Mr. William Osburn, Minifter.</head>
        
<p>


Etymolegy of the Name. * 

T he origin of the name is generally fuppofed to be Gae- 
lic, and Tillicoultry compounded of the three words, Tullick, 
cut and tir. Thefe words fignify literally, the mount or hill 
at the back of the country, and feem to refer to the Kirk-hill, 
and the Cuninghar ; a rifing ground, which begins near the 
houfe of Tillicoultry and the old kirk, and runs in a S. E. 
direction till it reaches the Dovan. This rifing ground has 
a ftrikingly romantic" appearance, as one approaches it, 
either from the Eafl: or the Weft. And as it interfects a 
beautiful plain, which begins at the Abbey-Craig near Stirling, 
and extends to Vicar's Bridge, it has juflly been diftinguifhed 
as the termination of the plain, or ftrath. But the author of 
this account hopes he will not be accufed of affectation, if 
he ventures to give a Latin derivation, and confiders Tillicoul- 
try as compounded either of Tellus culta, or Tellus cultorum 

Dei. 



Statijlical Account 



Dti. If the firft be adopted, we may fuppofe the name took 
its rife, from the place having been once in a high flate of 
cultivation, probably from the introduction of the Italian agri- 
culture. But if the fecond, it may denote the refidence of 
fome of the Cttldecs, or a place appropriated to the worfhip 
of God, either by the Culdees or the Druids. For on the 
fouth end of the Cuninghar, the rude remains of a Druidical 
circle are ftill to be feen, and on the north-eaft extremity of 
the rifing ground, the old church was fituated. The writer 
hereof is no admirer of the Gaelic ; but as Gaelic deriva- 
tions are at prefent falhionable, and as every place in this 
country is fuppofed, by our learned antiquarians, to have an 
old Gaelic name, he is afraid little attention will be paid to 
thefe Laiin etymologies. It muft, however, be allowed, that 
Tillicoultry is no great corruption of Tel/us culta, or of Tel- 
Ins cultorum Dei. 

Situation. — Tillicoultry is an inland country parifh, and 
prefents little uncommon or fplendid for defcription. It 
comprehends a confiderable part of the Ochils, where thefe 
hills are higheft -, but the principal part of the parifh lies at 
the foot of the hills, verging towards the fouth. The river 
Dovan wafhes its banks on the north. 

Appearance, Form, &amp;c. — The appearance of the parifh, 
whether we view the hills or the plain, is beautiful and plea- 
fant. A great part of the low ground is enclofed, and af- 
fords a variety of agreeable landfcapes, and the beauty of the 
fcene is much encreafed by the windings of the Dovan, 
which in miniature refemble thofe of the Forth. The fhape 
of the whole parifh is a rhomboid or an oblong, which lias 
the two longeft fides on the E. and W. each measuring al- 
moft 6 Englifh miles- 1 he S. fide of the oblong meafures

near 25 miles, and the N. fide one mile- The low grounds 
taken alone form alfo an oblong, the length of the fides 
from E- to W. being rather more than 2^ miles, and the 
breadth from S. to N. about 1^ mile. 

Extent and Ekvation. — Tillicoultry confifts of more than 
6000 Scotch acres, of which quantity, 4000 are in the 
Ochils, and the remaining 2000 acres form the low arable 
ground at the foot of the hills, and to the fouth of the bank 
dykes. About 1100 or 1200 acres cf arable land, by far the 
beft and moft valuable in the parifh, lie between the bank 
dykes, at the foot of the hills, and the loweft part of the 
banks of Balharty and Coalfnaughton, fouth of the Dovan, 
and about 800 or 900 acres lie fouth of the river, from the 
foot of the banks. The hills, according to an ac~tual furvey, 
exclufive of the Mill-Glen farm, contain 2902 acres. The 
elevation of the ground, on the north banks of the Dovan ; 
at the bridge, is not more than 20 feet, or at moft 30 feet 
above the level of the Forth, at fpring tides ; and the S. W. 
corner of Tillicoultry, which approaches neareft to that river, 
is diftant from it about 3 miles. The ground at Coalfnaugh- 
ton is near 300 feet above the Dovan ; and at Balharty it is 
about 300 feet. 

So/7 and Surface. — The foil is in general dry-field, rich in 
quality. When properly taken care of, it bears excellent 
crops, both of corn and hay, and gratefully repays the labour 
of the husbandman. At the foot of the hills, the foil is a 
fine quick loam, but not very deep. The crofts are, in many 
places, covered with ftones almoft innumerable, fmooth in 
their furface, and in general twice as large as a man's fiffc. 
They appear to be natural to the foil, and not brought thi- 
ther by any inundation ; but many entertain a different opi- 
nion

nion. Some farmers think them an advantage to the crops, 
as in hot dry fummers they keep the ground moifi and cool, 
and in winter warm. Vaft quantities have been gathered, 
which, in labouring, proves a great eafe both to the plough 
and the ploughman. The haughs, near the Dovan, prefent 
a deep loam mixed with fand, and the foil is very different 
from that of the crofts. The farm of Gutters is in part clay, 
and bears fine crops of wheat as well as other grains. The 
lands fouth of the Dovan are much inferior to thofe on the 
north fide. In fome places, the foil is a clay, of a cold na- 
ture •, in others it is a light loam, mixed with fand and gra- 
vel, on a till bottom, and in others it is a deep rich loam. A 
confiderable part of the ground is covered with heath, and 
would not be eafily improved, either for tillage or paftur^. 
Perhaps the beft improvement would be, to enclofe the 
moors, and to plant them with Scotch firs, larches, and o- 
ther foreft trees. 

Agriculture. — In the county of Clackmanan, agricultural 
improvements are much attended to, and have been brought 
to great perfection. Richer crops of wheat, barley, or hay, 
are feldom to be met with ; and the ploughs ufed, and the 
mode of ploughing, are no where furpaffed. A plough and 
ploughman were fent this fummer from Clackmannanlhire to 
Windfor, to give a proper fpecimen of plowing on his^Ma- 
jefty's farm. 

Crops and Multures, &amp;c. — The farmers in Tillicoultry 
do not pretend to take any lead in agricultural improvement. 
They profit, however, by the obfervations and the practice 
of others. Two horfe ploughs are getting into general ufe, 
which are a great improvement in husbandry. The crops

principally attended to, are oats and barley. Wheat is too 
much negleded, except by Mr Johnfton, and even peafe 
and beans. Crops of turnips are feldom to be met with, 
and cabbages are never raifed in our fields. It is difficult 
to afcertain the rent and produce of the land per acre. The 
farms are commonly let at a certain rent in cumulo, and the 
farmers, not knowing the meafure of their fields, feldom pay 
attention to the produce of particular acres. The refult of 
many enquiries is, that an acre of the beft land, well manur- 
ed, will produce from 7 to 10 bolls of oats, each boll weigh- 
ing 14 or 15 ftone, yielding about a boll of meal. The oats 
generally produce 14 pecks of meal, befides paying the mul- 
ture, and all other mill-dues. The multure is no lefs than the 
13th peck. An acre of the fame land will yield from 7 to 
n bolls of bailey, each weighing about 18 or 20 ftone. At 
an average, however, an acre will not yield above 6 or 7 bolls, 
whether of barley or oats. Our dry-field barley is remar- 
kably good, being very thin in the rind ; and is reckoned, by 
maltmen and diilillers, equal to any raifed in the Carfe. A 
good deal of wheat has of late been fown in the farm of 
Gutters, and an acre commonly produces from 8 to 10 bolls. 
Forty bolls of potatoes have been raifed on an acre, and one 
farmer in particular had 18 bolls on the 4th of an acre. The 
Writer of this account had accefs to fee a remarkable crop of 
potatoes, raifed in Mr Barclay's garden, the produce being 
no lefs than 1 05 pecks, or 6 bolls and 9 pecks, raifed from 
one peck planted. 

Farms, Rents, Pajiurc, Stock, &amp;c.~ The farms are in general 
fmall, and there are only 5 tenants whofe rent exceeds 50 1.

Hill Farms, Sheep and Wool— The hills have a verdant 
and beautiful appearance. They afford excellent pafture for 
fheep, and are divided into 5 farms. They will maintain 
about 3500 fheep ; and, at an average, an acre will not only 
maintain, but fodder one fheep. The pafture is grafs, inter- 
fperfed with heath, bent and ling. The heath is fhort and 
wearing out. The Mill-Glen and Fore-hill farms are infe-

» For 15 years paft, almofl. all the farms, which have been let, have been ta- 
ken by ftrangeis from other pariflies in the neighbourhood, and who are Se- 
teders. Jf the prefent fyftem prevail for other 15 years, the greateft part, if 
not the whole of the parifh, will be poiTcffed by perfons not belonging to 
the eflablifhed church. It is but doing jultiee to a worthy man, (whofe 
fweetnefs of temper, benevolence of heart, and gentlemany behaviour, will be 
remembered with pleafure, at leaft while the prefent generation lafts,) to men- 
tion, that Mr Barclay MaitlaND improved and beautified the pariin in a 
high degree, by his numerous inclofures and plantations. His tafte and atten- 
tion every where appear. Mr Tait alio merits piaife for his improvements 
on the lands of Harviefton, which he has wholly enclofcd. He has carried on 
his improvements, for many years, with much fpirit and judgment, and, it is 
prefumed, with great advantage to himfelf. His uniform practice has been to 
fallow his fields, and, after manuring them well with dung and lime, to fow 
them with barley and gmfs feeds. One of his inclofures, which contains 5 
and a half Scotch acres, has been let this feafon for grazing, at 4 guineas 
per acre, the reBt being 23 1. z s. Sterling.

rior to none in the Ochils, for producing excellent mutton 
and fine wool. The wood of thefe farms is much fuperior 
to that of Bruich and the back hills, as the pafture is natur- 
ally much finer. The farms are commonly fupplied from 
Tweeddale with young fheep of the black-faced kind : the 
farmers fometimes breed young fheep, which, on the whole, 
they find better, ftronger and more profitable, than thofe 
from Tweeddale. But as the hills are ftormy, they cannot 
keep the lambs in winter. All the Mill-Glen farm is good 
paftnre, but in the reft of the hills, there are near 400 acres 
of little or no value, as they are covered with channel and 
mofs. The very bed white fleeces yield about 4 lib. of wool, 
valued at iod. per pound ; and the heft fmeared fleeces 6 lib. 
at 5d. or 6d. The average weight of a white fleece is about 
2% lib. and of a fmeared one, 4 lib. The whole of what 
was formerly a common]: is now the property of Mr Bruce, 
except Bruich, which belongs to Mr Tait, and as much as 
will maintain 48 fheep. 

Hills and Minerals. — Benceeugh, the property of Mr 
Johnfton, is the higheft in the Ochils, and is 230© feet a- 
"bove the level of the Forth at Alloa. The Ochils prefent a 
considerable variety of ftrata. The fummits of the central 
parts, particularly Bencleugh, are compofed of granites, both 
red and gray. Many varieties of thefe are extremely beau-

1769, Mr Barclay Majtland commenced a procefs againft thefeuers, for 
a drvificn of the common hill, which contained about 300 acres. The pro-

next chain, of which the Kings Scat is the higheft, and be- 
longs to that clafs called fecondary mountains, confifts of 
Qirata of Argillaceous Schijlus. Below this, in various parts, 
are found craigs or rocks of Bafal/es, or whinftone. The 
Caftle Craig is of this fort, and is peculiarly interefting to the 
naturalift, as it is in part compofed of nodules of whin-ftonc, 
exhibiting concentric crufts of decompofed ba'fakes, like the ' 
coats of an onion, furrounding a harder nucleus. Garnets 
are not uncommon in the micaceous Schiftus, which forms 
the {hade between the granitical and argillaceous Schiftus. 
There are many veins of copper in the hills. * Iron-ftone, 
of an exceeding good quality, has been found in many dif- 
ferent places. Some veins in Watty-Glen are as rich as any 
difcovered in Scotland. The Dovan Company have a leafe 
of the iron-ftone belonging to Mr Bruce, and have employed, 
during the greateft part of this year, 64 miners and ro wo- 
men bearers. At an average, each miner gains 1 s. 6d. per 
day, and a bearer 8d. A great many Jlrings, or veins of 
rich iron ore of the kidney kind, have been difcovered in 
the hills, equal in quality to any difcovered in this coun- 
try, and by no means inferior to what is brought from Eng- 
land. Some fmall trials have been made with one of the 
veins, and it is to be regretetd that they are discontinued.

* Some of thefc were wrought near 50 years ago, to a very confiderablc 
extent in the Mill-Glen. Four different kinds of copper ore were difco- 
vered, the thickeft vein of which was about 18 inches. The ore, 
when wafhed and dreffed, was valued at 50 1. Sterling per ton. A Company 
of gentlemen at London were the tackfmen, and for fevcral years employed 
about 50 men. After a very great fum of money was expended, the works 
were abandoned, as unable to defray the cxpencc.

ferent mtnerals,fuch as filver, lead, cobalt, antimony, fulphur, 
and arfenic, but no proper trials have yet been made. A fmall 
edge ftratum 6f dark blue clay, 2* feet thick, was lately 
found, which, it is thought, will prove exceeding good for 
building furnaces, and making fire bricks. There is plenty 
of free-ftone of a good quality for building ; and ftones have 
been cut in the quarries from 8 to 10 feet in length. 

Coal. — The whole parilh, fouth of the hills, abounds with 
coal, which is the property of Mr Bruce, except in Mr John* 
(Ion's eftate. The coal has not been wrought to any great 
extent, unlefs where it is drained by the prefent level. There 
are 4 different feems of coal which the level drains. The 
nrft is a mixed cherry coal, 3 feet thick, and 1 2 fathoms 
from the furface. The 2d is a rough foft coal of an excel- 
lent quality} 6 feet thick, and 15 fathoms deep. The 3d 
is a remarkably good clean fplint, i\ feet thick, and 20 fa- 
thoms deep. And the 4th, which is reckoned the princi- 
pal feam, is about 5 feet thick, and lies at the depth of 30 
fathoms. It is a hard durable fplint well adapted for expor- 
tation and the foreign market, particularly Holland. Only 
the 2d and fourth feams have been wrought ; -\ the roofs are 
all good, except that on the 2d feam, where it runs towards 
the crop. But it is very valuable, as it contains balls of iron- 
ftone in the roof, of an exceeding good quality. Eighty acres 
of the 2d feam, and 20 of the fourth, may ftill be wrought 
by the level ; but by erecting a fteam engine, an immenfe 
quantity may be gained. The Devon company have been 

tackfmen 

f Twenty pickmen ufed to be employed in the coal-work ; and about 
3000 cbalders of great coal were exported anntially from the harbour of Alloa ; 
but for 4 years paft, the working of the coal has been difcontinued. There 
is no doubt, however, but that, in procefs of time, the coal will be a moft pro- 
stable concern, as there are inexhauftible fields of it to be found.

fackfmen of the coal for more than a year and a half, but 
have wrought none, except a very fmall quantity for land 
fale. The defign of taking a coal, without working it, is in- 
eomprehenfible. While coals remain under ground, they are 
of no value, either to the proprietor or the tackfmen. 

Gate Mail.— .The great coal, when led to the fhore of 
Alloa for exportation, pays a tax of fourpence Sterling per 
chalder to the family of Mar, called Gate Mail. It was origi- 
nally demanded, for the liberty of exporting the coal from 
the Pow of Alloa , and becaufe the road leading through the 
eftate to the harbour was a private one, though ufed by the 
public. This road is repaired by Mr Erfkine at a consider- 
able annual expence ; at the fame time it feems extraordi- 
nary, that there is not a public road leading from Tillicoul- 
try to a public harbour, and to a market town, in which a 
cuftom-houfe is eftablilhed by authority. 

River, Floods, Fijh, Pearls, Swans, &amp;c— The Devon is 
a beautiful river, but not navigable. After running in the 
Ochils about 8 miles in an eafterly direction from its fource, 
it makes a wide circuit round Muckart. Then taking a 
wefterly courfe at the Crook, and forming the romantic fall 
at the Caldron Lin, it divides the arable land of Tillicoultry, 
into two almoft equal parts. The valley, through which it 
pafles, is diftinguilhed by Newte in his Tour, as being one of 
the mod pleafant places, or, as he exprefTes it, the Tempe of 
Scotland. The Devon frequently fwells with rain, and o- 
verflows its banks J. It abounds with excellent trout

the deep pools, pikes and eels are found. Salmon come from 
the Forth in great numbers to fpawn ; and we have plenty 
of delicious fea trouts, both white and grey, in the harveft 
and fpring. In fome places, the banks of the Devon prefent 
fingular concretions of hardened clay, in a great variety of 
fantaftic fhapes. Pearls of a fmall fize have been found in 
the bed of the river  and, in very fevere winters, fwans have 
been known to refort to its banks. 

Rivulets and Burn Trouts, &amp;c. — The hill burns, or rivu- 
lets, abound with trouts of a very delicious quality and fla- 
vour, and are taken in great numbers after rain. None were 
ever difcovered in the Glooming-fide Burn, though it has plenty 
of water, and remarkably fine ftreams and pools. Trouts 
have even been put into it, but without the defired effe£t. 
This is fuppofed to arife from fome bed of fulphur, or other 
mineral hurtful to fifli, over which the burn paffes. 

Birds and Shiadrupeds. — The birds are the fame as in the 
neighbourhood, and it is needlefs to fpecifiy them, as they 
are enumerated in the ftatiftical account of Alloa §. Till 
of late, the buifinch was a ftranger here, but he is now fre- 
quently to be met with. The woodlark ought to be particu- 
larly mentioned, as one of our fweeteft, warblers. He be- 
gins to fing early in the fpring, and continues till late in har- 
veft. Like the nightingale, he is frequently heard ringing in

dotterels. The muir-fowls are not fo frequent as formerly, 
as the heath is wearing out, and in confequence of this the 
fhelter is not fo good. The birds of paffage are fwallows, 
cuckoos, fieldfares and woodcocks ; and we are alfo vifited at 
times with herons, ducks, and fea gulls. Eagles are fometimes 
feen on the hills. The wild quadrupeds are, hares, rabbits, 
foxes, hedge-hogs, weafels, polecats, badgers and otters. The 
fkin of the otter is valuable as a fur, and fetches a good 
price. 

Orchards and Plantations. — There are two fmall orchards, 
planted chiefly with apple trees, which contain about fix 
acres, and, fome years, bear confiderable quantities of fruit. 
Above 100 acres are planted with foreft trees, and many of 
the inclofures are furrounded with fingle rows of planting. 
All kinds of foreft trees thrive well, particularly oaks, elms, 
allies, beeches, planes, and Scotch firs *. 

Climate. — The air is healthy, dry, and warm, fubjetT: neither 
to fogs nor damps. Snow does not lie long on the low ground, 
particularly between the Devon and the hills, which is pro- 
bably owing to the natural warmth of the air or foil. The

plenty of excellent water. 

Difeafes. — There are no difeafes any way peculiar to Til- 
licoultry, § or that can be faid to be prevalent. Epidemic 
difeafes, fuch as fevers, fluxes, the fmall-pox, the mealies, 
and the chincough attack us at times, but not more frequent- 
ly than they do others. Rheumatifms are not uncommon, 
as the people are much expofed to rain and cold, in follow- 
ing their employments in the fields, if Within thefe 25 
years, a great many young perfons have died of confump- 
tions, but the author is not able, either to afcertain the num-

prevalent. And people have been known to recover, after 
remaining in them 30, or even 40 days. The ague ufed to 
be frequent, but it is now almoft unknown. This happy 
change is perhaps owing to the lands being better drained 
than formerly, or to the houfes being kept more cleanly,

§ The Iaft time the plague was in Scotland, it did not reach Tillicoul- 
try, though a good many perfons died of it at Alva. One man however ha- 
ving died fuddenly in the Wefler town, the people were afraid to touch the 
corpfe, or even to enter the houfe. It was pulled down, and the fmall emi- 
nence, which this occafioned, was called Botchy Cairn. 

U It is worth mentioning that one WiLi-i am Hunter, a collier, was cured 
in the year 1758, of an inveterate rheumatifm or gout, by drinking freely of 
new ale, full of barm or yeft. The poor man had been confined to his bed 
for a year and a half, having alrrfoft entirely loft the ufe of his limbs. On 
the evening of Handfel Monday, as it is called, [i e. the firft Monday of the 
New Year, O. S.) fome of his neighbours came to make merry with him. 
Though he could not rife, yet he always took his mare of the ale, as it paiTed'

quencc was, that he had the ufe of his limbs the next morning, and was able 
to walk about. He lived more than ao years after this, and never had the

warm, and dry. The dyfentery was unknown here for ma- 
ny years. It has, however, appeared of late three different 
times, and carried off a good many perfons, chiefly women. 
As this alarming malady always broke out in the end of har- 
veft, fome have been apt to imagine, that, if it was not caught 
by infection, it arofe from the colds and damps to which 
the people were expofed in reaping, or to a frequent ufe of 
potatoes not brought to a proper ftate of maturity. The 
people have in general an averfion to inoculation for the 
fmall-pox, yet this prejudice is beginning to wear away %.

Caufes cf the Increafe. — By comparing Dr Wcbfter's lift 
with the number of inhabitants during the two laft years, 
there is an evident increafe. It is perhaps owing to the e- 
ftablifhment of the Devon company in the neighbourhood of, 
and the working of iron-ftone in Tillicoultry, that the num- 
ber of the inhabitants has fo greatly encreafed fince the be- 
ginning of the year 1792. It is fomewhat remarkable, that 
when the lifts were taken in January 1 792, all the mafons, 
miners, and labourers were employed, but there were fcarce- 
ly any of the labourers employed in the parilh. 

Prolific Mothers. — There are at prefent living in Tillicoul- 
try eleven married women, who have been delivered of twin 
children. One of them has had twins two different times, 
and another, in the year 1765, about three years before the 
birth of her twins, brought forth three children at one 
birth, all boys and of a good fize. Two of the children died 
in the firft month, and the third, a healthy child, died of the 
fmall pox when two years old. But what is ftill more uncom- 
mon, in the year 1752, Katherine Hunter, the wife of George 
Sharp a labourer, brought forth four children at one 
birth, — two males and two females. They were all baptiz- 
ed, but being fmall and weakly, none of them lived above 
three weeks. 

Villages and Houfes. — Tillicoultry contains three villages, 
. JV'Jlerloivi t Earl/loiun and Coalfmvghton, and all the inhabi- 
tants 



\ 



of Tillicoultry. 20$ 

tants live in thefe except 36 families. Of thefe families on- 
ly three refide in the Ochils. The houfes confift of nothing 
but the ground floor, except 8, of which, 5 houfes have on- 
ly one ftory raifed above the ground floor, two have 2 ftories, 
and one has three ftories, and there are only three houfes, 
the manfe included, which are fubjed to the duty on win- 
dow lights. 

Manufactures. — Tillicoultry has been long famous for ' 
weaving a courfe woolen cloth, called Tillicoultry Serge. It 
is a fpecies of fhaloon, having tuorjhd warp and yarn waft, 
and is reported to have been wrought here, as early as the 
reign of Mary Queen of Scots. The average price is is. 
Sterling per yard. Though the manufacture has now, in a 
great meafure, left us, and gone to Alva, ( like the arts and 
faiences, from Eajl to Wejl^) yet all the cloth of this kind is 
fold in the markets, under the name of Tillicoutry Serge. It 
is much to be regretted, that more attention is not paid to 
this manufacture in the place where is was invented, or at 
leaft brought to the greateft perfection. About 50 years a- 
go, a ferge web from Alva would not fell in the market, 
while one from Tillicoultry remained unfold. But this is by 
no means the cafe at prefent. The author of this account 
can give no precife ftatement of the quantity of ferge 
wrought here, as the ftamp mafter keeps no lift. He fup- 
pofes, however, that he ftamps annually 7000 ells of ferge, 
and an equal quantity of plaiding. Some of the weavers are 
now employed in making muflins, but as this branch is ftill 
in its infancy, it is impoffible to fay with what advantage it 
may be attended. 

Prices of Labour and Proviftons. — The prices of labour, 
and of many of the neceffariss of life, have rifen much, and.

are (till rifing. It may be faid to be nearly double of what 
it was 50 years ago. For example, the wages of a taylor 
per day, befides his diet, was 4d. Sterling, now they are 8d •,

now it is is. and fometimes more ; of a pound of butter, 5d., 
now pd. or iod. and of a pound of cheefe, 2d. now 4d. 

Roads. — The roads along the hill foot have a gravel bot- 
tom, and* are tolerably good, and likewife the road which 
leads from the hill foot to Coalfnaughton by the bridge. But 
the fouth road, which comprehends a fpace of more than 
1 Englifh miles, is in a wretched ftate, having been much 
neglected of late years, and the greater! part of it never ha- 
ving been properly made, at leaft to the eaihward Coalfnaugh- 
ton. I 

Church. — The patron and fuperior of Tillicoultry, is James 
Bruce, Efq; at prefent a minor, and an enfign in the army. 
He is alfo titular of the teinds, and all the heritors and feueis

• His immediate anceftors were the . late proprietors of Kinrofs. He is

pofed by Pinkerton, with a great degree of probability, in his collection 
of ancient Scottifh poems, that Sir John Bruce of Kiurofs was the author 
of the well-known, and much efteemed poem, Hardtknute, which has 
been commonly afcribed to Mrs W'ardlaw. It is probable, alfo, that Sir 
John was the author of the Vision, and fome other excellent Scottifh poem*.

|| The old church and manfe were fituated near the houfe of Tillicoul-

granted to it by King Malcolm, together with the tythes and pertinents. 
But after the Reformation, the family of Mark became heritable proprietors 
of the church, parfonage, . vicarage, and io acres of gebe. And as the abbot 
and convent of Cambufkcnneth had fet the teinds in tack to the Colvills of 
Culrofs, the proprietors of Tillicoultry, John Earl of Marr, May 30th 1628, 
ratified the tacks, and alio the feu charters, and infeftment of the glebe ; and

fills of 120I. Scotch, including communion-element money, 
34 bolls of oats, 24 bolls of barley, and 6 bolls of meal. It 
commenced in the year 1648, and fince that time there has 
been no augmentation. The minifler has the privilege of 
getting his coals for paying the collier the price of working, 
and he has alfo property in the hills, for maintaining 7 or 8 
flieep. The glebe was exchanged in the year 1730, when 
the manfe was removed to its prefent fituation. It lies in 4 
different pieces, and ought to confift of 13 acres. 

School. — There is a parochial fchoolmafler, whofe falary is 
iool. Scotch. He has alfo a dwelling houfe and garden. 
His annual income, including falary, and all emoluments, 
both as fchool-mafter and feflion clerk, is extremely fmall, 
and feldom exceeds 20I. Sterling. The fchool is kept in the 
Weftertown, which is by no means centrical or convenient 
for the reft of the parifh. The fchool wages are low, and 
Englifh, writing, and arithmetick are taught for 2s. per 
quarter, Englifh alone being only is. 3d. 

poor. — The poor are maintained without any affefTment, 
and there are no beggars. The capital of the poor's money 
is 212I. Sterling, and the annual average collection at the 
church door, has been about 12 guineas, for 18 years pafh 
The intereft of the capital, together with the collections, 
and the profits arifing from the mortcloths, proclamations of 
marriages, and incidental fines, conftitute the funds by which 
the poor are maintained. The number of perfons at prefent

by giving them money, buying cloths, paying their houfe rents 
and fchool fees for their children. Till within thefe 4 years, 
intereft at 5 per cent, has been received for the poor's money, 
but the rate at prefent is only 4 per cent. The annual ave-

occafionally alfifted, ns ; and of children whofe fchool wages 
are paid, 5 s or 6s. The lowed ftated weekly allowance is 
6d, and the higheft is from 1 s. to 1 51. 

Proprietors. — Befides Mr Bruce, there are other 9 heritors, 
namely, Lord Cathcart, John Johnfton, Efq; of Alva, John 
Tait, Efq; of Harviefton, John Harrower, John Paton, Hugh 
Hamilton, Marion Dryfdale, James Ure, and Robert May.

the year 1634, when it was fold to William Alexandp r of Menftry, a 
Poet of great genius, and afterwards created Earl of Stirling. Several 
of his poems are printed in Drummond of Hawthornden's Collection, and 
his Parane/is, or exhortation on government, which is dedicated to Prince 
Henrt, the fon of King James VI. does great honour, both to the prince 
and the peer. The «uate was next purchafed by Sir Alexander Rollo of 
Duncrub, in the year ,644; by Mr John Nicolson of Carnock in Stir,

price paid by Lord Tillicoultry being 3,494 I. Sterling ; 
by Mr Barclay Maitland 15,0001. and by Mr Bruce 
24,000. Before the lail fale, a part of the eftate was fold 
to Mr Johnston of Alva ; but the feus,-| which Mr Barclay 
purchafed at different times, were fully equivalent to this 
part. This eftate, which, for a century and a half, has been 
always floating in the maiket, and has io frequently changed 
its proprietors, is now ftriclly entailed, and will remain in 
Mr Biuce's family, the entail of the eftate of Kinrofs having 
been transferred by act of Parliament to Tillicoultry. The 
number of the old feus, or parts, was 40, but they are now 
nioftly bought up, and again united with the eftate, or in 
the poffeffion of Mr Tait. The lands of Killtown, where 
1 illicoultry houfe is fituated, and the lands of Colerjlcwn or 
Co/lititown, belonging to Mr Johnston, were not fued. It 
is difficult to afcertain the quantity of land belonging to 
each of the feus, as more or lefs fcems to have been given, 
according to the quality and value of the foil. One origi- 
nal 40th part at Drimmy contains at prefent, nearly as 
much arable land as a 40th part and a half at Ellcrtown, and 
near as much as two 40th parts at Cairnftown.^ Tillicoultry 
pays an annual feu- duty of 7 I. 6s. Sterling, and 166 bolls of 
fait, called King's malt. This is a part of the Lordfhip of 
Stirling, having been originally paid at the caftle of Stirling, 
for the ufe of the King's family, but w^s transferred, at an 
early period, to the Earl of Marr, as a fecurity for fome 
money lent to the Crown. 

Ancient 

f Lord Colvil feued the greateft part of his eftate to his tenants, whom 
he diftinguifhes in his charters, as avid, kindly, native tenants, and refcrved to 
himfel£a certain annual feu-duty, which appears to have been the old rent. 

^ It appears from the meal paid as feu duty by the feuars of Cairnftown, 
and the money paid by the other feuar?, that a boll of meal, and 3s. 4d. Ster- 
ling, were confidered as being of equal value, in the conclufion of the 16th, 
and beginning of the 17th centuries.

Ancient CKvrtcr.— Between 5C0 and 600 years ag', Tilli- 
coultry belonged to the family of Marr ; and an original 
charter, granted by King Alexander III. of Scotland, in 
the 14th year of his reign, is ftill in the pofl'effion of Mr Er- 
skine of Marr, who has obligingly favoured the author 
with a copy. This charter is twice referred to by Bifhop 
Kieth, in his hiftory of the Bifhops. It is elegantly written 
on parchment, with a very fair hand, and fine ink, and is in 
every refpecl: a remarkable curiofity. The whole parchment 
is near a fquare of o| inches, and the writing only meafures 
6 inches by 8 §.

Emt* -nt men.— Lord Colvil, who was raifed to the peer- 
age by James VI. in 1609, was a man of a military genius, 
and ferved with much reputation, in the wars u/ider Henry 
the IV. of Franee. Returning to Scotland, loaded with ho- 
nours, he refided at Tillicoultry, and in his old age, revifited 
the French court. As he appeared in the old fafhioned mi- 
litary drefs, which he had formerly worn in the wars, the 
courtiers were all amazed when he entered the royal prefence. 
But no fooner did Henry obferve the old warrior, than he 
clafped him in his arms, and embraced him with the great- 
ell affecTion, to the utter aftonifhment of all prefent. After 
his return, Lord Colvil fpent much of his time at Tillicoul- 
try, and was particularly fond of walking on a beautiful ter- 
race, at the north end of the Kirk-hill, and of repofing him- 
felf under a thorn tree, the venerable trunk of which ftill re-

on a (tone, and looking up to the thorn tree, describing his 
battles, he fell down the Hoping bank of the terrace, and, it 
is faid, was killed on the fpot, in the year 1620. It may not 
be improper to add, under this article, that in the popilh le- 
gends, Tillicoultry is mentioned as having been vifited by St. 
Serf or Servanus, and the fcene of fome of his pretended 
miracles. St. Serf lived in the end of the 6th century, and 
there is a particular account of him in WintorCs Chronicle ||, 
a manufcrfpt in the Cottonian library f. Notwithstanding 
the very remote antiquity of St Serf, his memory is dill, in 
fome degree, preferved, though his name is almoft en- 
tirely forgot ; but he is reprefented, by tradition, as a holy 
man, who travelled about the country, with a Scape Goat J, 
which was unfortunately killed. There is a heap of {tones, 
called Cairn Cur or Gur, which feems to have been intend- 
ed to perpetuate the ftory of the goat. The name has an e- 
vident affinity to the Latin word Caper, and to the Gaelic, 
Gcbhur t which fignifies a goat. 

Antiquities". 

tj Winton, the author of the chronicle, was canon regular of St An- 
drews, and prior of the monaftery of Loch Leven, and lived in the end of the 
14 century. 

f An excerpt from this chronicle was lately publifhed by Pjnkerton, in 
the Appendix to his collection of Old Scottilh poems. One of the miracles 
reported to have been performed by St Serf, was, the raifing two young men 
to life, who appear to have been brothers. The account given of this in the 
chronicle, if not very elegant, has at leaft the merit of being abundantly 
brief : i 

" In Tullycultry, til a wif 

" Two fonys he raifit frae ded to lyf." 

i In Win-ton's chronicle, in place of a fcape goat, mention is made of a 
ram. The killing of the ram occafioned another miracle. The ftory is a- 
bundantly ludicrous, and as ludicroufly related by the poetical biographer :

Characler y &amp;c— We have our good qualities as well as 
our bad. Publicly to expofe the one might give offence, and 
* could do no good. To praife the other might appear often- 
tation and flattery. It is, however, but juftice to mention, 
that the people are fober and induftrious, and attached to 
the King and Conftitution, and to the Prefbyterian form of 
worfhip and Church Government. The men moftly betake 
themfclves. to country work, or to employments connected 
with hufbandry. Few of them enlift in the army, and not 
many of them engage in the feafaring line. The women are 
thrifty and laborious, attentive to their families, and are much 
employed in fpinning worfted and woolen yarn ; particu- 
larly the latter. All ranks drefs better and finer than they 
formerly did. . And as an inftance of refinement in the fur- 
niture of the houfes, it may be mentioned, that in the year 
1764, there were only 9 or 10 clocks in the parifh, whereas, 
at prefent, there are above 60. 

D {/advantages. — It is apprehended, that Tillicoultry will 
decreafe in the number of its inhabitants, from the following 
caufes : — 1 ft The divifion of the common in the hills. — 2d 
The fale of many of the feus, each of which maintained fa- 
milies •, — 3d The neglect, of the coal ; and, 4th, The fmall 
attention and encouragement which is given to the weaving 
of Tillicoultry ferge. It muft be acknowledged, however, 
that the eftablifhment of the Devon Company, in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood, will, perhaps, overbalance all thefe 
apparent difadvantages, though the writer of this account is 
by no means fanguine in his expectation of that effect.

Extent and Surface. 

X his pariih is about 3 Englifh miles in length, and near- 
ly as much in breadth. The German Ocean bounds it on 
the S. E. The face of the country is confiderably diverfified. 
Clofe upon the (bore lies a narrow ftrip of land almoft level 
with the fea : Adjoining to this, a bank or rifing ground, of 
confiderable height, extends the whole length of the parifh. 
Above this ancient boundary of the ocean, which is fleep in 
fome places, and dopes gently in others, the ground rifes by 
an unequal afcent towards the N. W. A chain of little 
hills, whofe fummits are covered with heath, run along the 
Si W. boundary, and a rifing ground, fome hundred yards 
above the level of the fea, terminates the view on the N. E,

Rivulets, Cafcades, Milt, Cave, &amp;c— Two fmall rivulets, 
arifing on the fide adjacent adjacent to Garrock, at fome dif- 
tance from each other, add not a little to the agreeable va- 
riety. In fome places they form deep gulfs, in others beau- 
tiful cafcadcs ; now they are fecn meandrmgamidft corn-fields 
or pafture grounds, then they run under two done arches •, 
and afterwards, dafhing among craigs and fragments of rock, 
unite their ftreams a little below the church. Havinz con- 
tnbuted to diverlify and adorn a tract of fome miles, they 
add to the conveniences of life by fupplying with water the 
only corn mill within the parifh. Down the ftream, in a fe- 
queftered retreat, where there is fcarcely any thing to be feen 
but the firmament, and a wide expanfe of ocean, there is a 
cave of fuflicient height to admit a man in an erect pofture. 
This fubteraneous abode gradually turns lower towards the 
extremity, and feems originally to have been formed by the 
dafhing of the waves, though it is now diftant from the fhors 
a full quarter of a mile, and more than i feet above the 
prefent bed of the rivulet. 

Villages, Sea Coaft, Shipiviecks, bfc— -The opening of the 
land here bears a ftrong refemblance to a creek or harbour, 
which tends to miflead fuch as are unacquainted with the 
coaft, which is flat and rocky. A fmall village of 15 houfes, 
built upon the beach, contributes to this miftake, and while 
it feems to promife afliftance to the diftreffed mariner, al- 
lures him to deftruction. Several veffels have fuffered fhip- 
wreck by attempting to run afhore at this place ; and the ut- 
moft exertion of the people at land has feldom been effec- 
tual to refcue their crews from the fury of the waves. This 
place is called the Houghs of Nether Benholme, lies almoft in 
a direct line with the church, and is nearly fituated in the 
middle between the fifliing towns of Gurdoti and Johnjhaven ; 

one

one of winch is in the parifh of Bervie, and the other in this 
parifh. 

Fj/h, Kelp, &amp;c— The coaft abounds with fifh of various 
kinds. Cod, ling, fkate, halibut, and fome turbet are caught 
from March to the end of July : Haddocks, fmall cod, whit- 
ings, and a few flounders, are taken all the year round, but 
in great^t plenty from October to the middle of February- 
Crabs and lobfters, limpets and periwinkels, are likewife 
in abundance. Numbers of porpoifes ? feals, and fometimes 
whales, are feen clofe upon the coaft. The rocks produce 
dulce and tangles, with various fea-weeds, which are con- 
verted into kelp. What quantity of this article may be an- 
nually exported is uncertain. It cannot be 'inconfiderabla, 
however, as the people employed in making it are able to 
pay a yearly rent of 1 2I. to the proprietors, for liberty to 
crop the growth of their rocks. 

Climate — -The climate varies confiderably in different 
parts of this parifh, according to the expofure and height of 
the ground. It is often mild and temperate upon the fhore, 
\vhe,n it is cold and piercing in the more inland parts. Dur- 
ing the fpring and fummer months, thick mifts frequently arife 
from the fea ; fo that the air along the coaft is damp, though 
not unhealthy, being purified by the North and Weft winds. 
The-fe winds are both fo frequent and ftrong here, that 
young trees are generally obferved to incline towards the S. E. 

Soil.— The foil upon the fhore is light and gravelly : in 
fome places, nothing but naked ftones appenr ; but where 
thefe have been covered with earth brought down from the 
higher grounds, either by human induftry or the winter 
rains, good crops are produced, when the feafon is not re- 
^rkably dry. Farther up, the foil is deeper and more fer- 



2,20 



Statijlical Account 



tile. A few farms on the S. W. fide of the parifh are light 
and gravelly. Of fome the foil is a deep rich loam ; but in 
the middle, and on die N. E. fide, it chiefly inclines to clay. 
Part lies on a cold tilly bottom, and part on rock •, but having 
the advantage of a fouthcrn expofure, and being fheltered by 
the rifing grounds from the North, it produces luxuriant 
crops, when properly cultivated. In the interior parts lies a 
confiderable tract of moor, where the qualities of the foil 
are various. Some places are wet and fpungy, others dry 
and gravelly ; but the greateft part is capable of being culti- 
vated. 

Plantations. — The number of acres occupied in planting, 
both of moor and pleafure grounds, does not exceed 50. I he 
Scotch fir is not found to thrive here ; but the larch and 
other foreft trees make confiderable progrefs in dens, and 
fuch places as are fheltered from the feu air. Clofe upon 
the coaft, great trouble and expence is neceffiiry to raife trees. 
They require to be planted very thick, and after all feldom, 
come to any fize. 

Agriculture * and Produce. — None of the proprietors of this 
parifh, who cultivate their own grounds, ftri&amp;ly adhere to 
any particular rotation of crops. Nor are the tenants bound 
to follow what their mailers do not praclife- In hufbandry, 

where 

* In fo little repute was farming before the year 171a, that the proprie- 
tor of Brotherfton found it neceffary to give premiums in order to induce 
tenants to rent his farms. To one he gave a prefent of jco mciks Scotch, 
and fatm-ftocking to the value of 2000 merles, free of intereft for three years; 
to another the fame fum in a prefent, and 3000 merks value of ftock for his 
farm, free of intereft for 4 years. There is no ncceffity now for holding out 
pecuniary temptations to the farmer. Since the above mentioned period, the 
rents are tripled, and numbers are ftill ready to offer a confiderable advance, 
\vh;n the leafe of a farm expires. 



of Benholme. 221 

where much depends on the feafon, it is perhaps better to 
leave the practical farmer unfettered. If he is poflefled of 
difcernment, he will naturally adopt that mode of cultivation, 
which, on a foil (imilar to his own, lie obferves to fucceed 
bell : if he is bound to fellow a certain rotation, he can pro- 
fit but little either by his own or his neighbour's experience. 
Some reftri&amp;ions towards the end of the leafe, to prevent 
the land from being ever-cropped, are doubtlefs neceffary, 
and generally made by every proprietor, when he lets a farm. 
The general practice of the farmers in this parifti, when the 
foil is light, is to fow wheat after fallow which has been 
limed and dunged ; then barley, to which fucceeds peafe ; and 
then barley again, with clover and grafs feeds, which are al- 
lowed to continue in the ground from 2 to 5 years. Oats 
are generally fown, when the by or fward is broken up ; 
next fucceeds barley and then fallow. Where the foil in- 
clines to clay, the common rotation of crops is wheat, beans, 
barley and grafs feeds, which are feldom allowed to continue 
longer in the ground than two years •, oatsi barley, and then a 
fallow. Befides the crops already mentioned, a confiderablc 
quantity cf turnips is annually raifed ; but very little flax, 
except what is ncceflary for the ufe of private families. This 
may be owing in fome meafure to the want of lint-mills in 
the neighbourhood, or more probably to the nature of the 
foil, which in general is not adapted to the growth of this 
ufeful plant. Potatoes, yams, and cabbages, are likewife 
planted in the fields, and turn to good account. Some at- 
tempts have been made'of late to introduce early oats, and 
it is to be hoped their utility, in a foil which is naturally 
late, will foon recommend them to general ufe Seed time 
and harveft greatly depend on the feafon ; when that is fa- 
vourable, they begin here to fow in March, and to reap a- 
bout the firft of September. Wheat is generally fown in 

Odober.

O&amp;ober. A greater quantity of every fort of grain is raifed 
within this parifh than is nccefiliry for its fupport. The prin- 
cipal extraneous manure made ufe of here is lime, which is 
chiefly brought by land carriage, from a quarry in the parifh 
of St Cyrus, not two miles dillant. Many fanners, however, 
find their account in. importing it from the Frith of Forth, 
and even from Sunderland- All agree that it is an efl'ential 
yequifite in farming. Forty bolls have commonly been al- 
iotcd to an acre ; but many begin to think that a much great- 
er proportion is neceflary for firong land. 

Ploughs, Cattle, is'c. — There are from 36 to 40 ploughs 
in this parifh. About 6 of thefe are drawn by oxen, which 
are chit fly made ufe of where the land is rugged. When 
it is in an improved ftate, horfes are employed, and 2 are 
thought fuflicient for a plough. The Scotch plough is gene- 
rally ufed here, and feems beft adapted to the nature of the 
foil ; though feveral Norfolk wheel-ploughs are employed 
with advantage on fuch farms as are free from (tones, and in 
a high ftate of cultivation- Confiderable attention is bellow- 
ed on rearing, but very little on feeding black-cattle, though 
the demand for butcher meat daily increafes. Nor has this 
inducement hitherto prevailed on the farmer to feed more 
fheep than is neceflary for the ufe of his own family. 

Rents, Inclofures, Leases, £sV. — By a furvey of the county, 
taken in 1774, this parifh contains 4721 Englifh acres, of 
which nearly a fifth part is uncultivated. The refl is divid- 
ed into 20 farms. Twelve of thefe yield from 50I. to 210I. 
the other 3 from 2cl. to C©1. Sterling of yearly rent. The 
belt arable land is let at from il. to ll. 17s. an acre : And, 
when it is divided into fmall portions, from il. to 2l. 6s. 
Land qf an inferior quality is not let by the acre, but by the 

piece, 



of Benholme. 11$ 

piece, as parties can agree. There may be about 4 or 5 final! 
farms let in this way, the yearly rent arifing from each of 
which will not amount to 20I. Sterling. Several farms aTe 
inclofcd, but a greater number flill lie open. In this refpeet 
there is great room for improvement here. The farmers, in- 
deed, are not infenfibie to the advantages ' of inclofmg, but 
it is fcarcely to be expected that they will lay out the necef- 
fary expence to make inclofures, on fo fhort a leafe as 1 9 
years. Unlefs proprietors hold out fome inducement, either 
by increafing the length of their leafes, or advancing the ne- 
cefTary fums at a moderate intereft, it is to be feared that 
many of the fields will continue long in their prefent naked 
and expofed (late. The valued rent of the parifh amounts 
to about 3980I. 9s. 8d. The real rent may be about 1800I. 
Sterling. 

Eccleftaftkal State. — The patronage of the church was, 
fome time after the beginning of lafl century, vefted in the 
proprietors of the eftates of Benholme, Brotherfton, and Ne- 
ther Benholme, who continue to exercife their right by 
turns *. Two of thefe gentlemen conftantly refide in the 
parifh, and a third, occafionally. The church, which (lands 
nearly in the centre, and moft agreeable part of the parifh, is 
an old irregular Gothic building. On the Eaftend,a part is 

raifed 

• About the beginning of the raft century, the greateft part of the pro- 
perty within this diftridl belonged to Earl Marisciial, whofe ancient domi- 
nion, in thefe parts, can now only be traced from records and monumental in- 
fcriptions. Not long after that period, all this parifh, except Balandro, 
formed the eftate of Benholme, and belonged to a proprietor of the name of 
Keith, who was probably a younger branch, or near relation of the Maril". 
chal Family. It was afterwards divided among his heirs into four portions, 
which now compofe different eftates of Benholme, Brotherfton, Nethcr.Bcn- 
holme, and Knox.

|| All the inhabitants of this parifli, except a few, who continued their 
attachment to the Epifcopal religion, were regulat attendants on puHic wcr- 
fhip, as eftablifhed in the Church of Scotland, til! about the year 1763. At 
that time, the minifler's anxiety to improve the church-mufic, led him to 
adopt the more approved method of fmging without intermiflion, or reading 
the line, as it is called. This gave umbrage to many, who had been accuftcm- 
ed to hear every line fcparately fiveii out by the precentor or clerk, before 
the congregation joined in the pfalm. They were forced to acknowledge 
that the pfalm»dy would be improved by fmging without interruption ; but 
they urged, that many who could not read, would, by that means, be entirely 
excluded from joining in this part of public worfhip. Whether a regard to 
the good of others, was the real, or only the ojltnfible caufe of this oppofition ; 
or whether it proceeded from a dread of innovation, they pel filled in it. They 
remonflratcd again and again ; and when their remonftrnnces were not at- 
ti ded to, abandoned the church, built one for themfclves in Johnfhaven, ond 
invited a minifter of the Scccffion to fettle among them.

Peer. — The number of poor in this parifh is confiderable, 
owing to the variety of aged arid infirm perfons, who come 
from neighbouring parifhes, and take up their refidence in , 
the town of Johnfhaven, when they are no longer fit for 
country work. Seldom fewer than 30 receive a monthly al- 
lowance from 2s. to 4s. and fometimes 5s. each, according 
to their neceffities. Small fums arte likewife occafionally dif- 
tributed among fuch as are in ftraitened circumftances, yet 
not fo indigent as to require a reguiar fupply. It is general- 
ly undcrftood, that the members of the Seinon have a claim 
on whatever effects may be left by any one, who has been 
admitted on the poors-roll, to the full amount of the fum ad- 
vanced ; fo that few folicit this affiftance, except thofe who 
are really in want. The means of relieving fuch are derived 
from various fources, of which the chief are, the coile&amp;icns 
in the church on Sundays, which laft year exceeded 35I. 
Sterling ; the intereft of different fums, bequeathed for the 
ufe of the poor, in the lands of Benholme and Knox; the 
favings of former contributions *, with better than 81. annu- 
ally for feat-rents, amounting altogether to more than 6ch 
Sterling. The diltribution of this fum falls within the pro-

vines of the minifler and elders, who make it their bufinefs 
to become acquainted with the fituation of the parifhioners, 
to fupply fuch as are in want, and to difeountenance beg- 
ging. Few beggars of courfe belong to this parifh ; but it 
is much infefted by vagrants, efpecially from the North. 
Befides the other charitable donations, under the manage- 
ment of the kirk-feflion, there is a fund for teaching poor 
fcholars, and fupplying them with books. An annual col- 
lection is likewife made at the church doors, for the Infir- 
mary of Aberdeen, which entitles the poor to medical ad- 
vice and afli fiance, when they labour under any bodily dif- 
trefs, and likewife to proper accomodation, while their cure 
is performing. In few places, perhaps, are the induflrious 
and deferving poor better provided for than here. Befides 
the fources of affiftance already enumerated, they find a con- 
tinual fupply in the charitable difpofition of their more opu- 
lent neighbours.

From the above ftatement it appears, that though the num- 
bers in the country part is diminhhed 60, yet the town of 
John (haven being 266 more numerous than it was 1^1753, 
the population has increafed on the whole 206 (ince that pe- 
riod. It is evident, however, from the following table, that 
the population has been gradually diminishing fince the year 
1773. The union of feveral fmall farms into one has con- 
tributed to thin the country, and increafe the number of 
town's people. But while one clafs of inhabitans was be- 
coming more numerous in Johnfliaven, various caufes con- 
fpired to difperfe another. It appears, from undoubted au- 
thority, that the fea- faring people, with their families, in that 
town, about the year 1753, were, equal to a third of the 
whole inhabitants of the pariah ; but in 1793, they did not 
exceed a-fixth part of that number •, fo that this clafs of h 
habitants has been rapidly- declining for the laft 40 years.

230 Statijlical Account 

FiJJjery. — About the year 1722, Johnshaven feetms to 
have ranked among the firft fifhing towns in Scotland 26 
boats were then employed in the fiihery, 1 3 of which car- 
ried eacli from 8 to 10 tons burden, the other 13, from 5 to 
6 tons. A large boat's crew, including one or two boys, ge- 
nerally confided of 10, a fmall boat's, 8- Three of the crew 
were called Jkippers, who had a {hare in the boat, kept her in 
repair, and became bound to indemnify the proprietor of the 
town for the fum of 10c $ merks Scotch, which he advanced 
to-affift in building the boat ; and alfo to pay a yearly rent of 2L 
1 os. Sterling. To defray this cxpence, the (kippers were en- 
titled to every fifth fifli taken, befides their own deal or fhaie^ 
Large boats were employed from the beginning of May till 
the firft of Auguft, in catching cod, ling, &amp;c. or in what is 
called the out fea fijlnng, from the fifhing ground lying at the 
drftance of 40 or 50 miles from fhore. In favourable wea- 
ther, they generally continued one, two, or three nights at 
fea- During the months of Auguft and September, they 
brought a fufficient quantity of coals and peats from the 
Frith of Forth to fupply the neighbourhood through the 
feafon : after which thefe large boats were laid up for win- 
ter. The fmall boats were then employed in catching had- 
docks, whitings, &amp;c till the end of February, when the 
near great Jijlwig, about 8 or 10 miles from land, commen- 
ced. In this they were engaged, always leaving their lines 
at fea one, night or more, according to the weather, till the 
beginning of May, when the large boats were again launch- 
ed into the deep. The great fifli were purchafed by Mon- 
trofe merchants, faked and fent up the Mediterranean. The

of Benholme. 



fmall fifli found a ready market in the Frith of Forth, and 
the price of them formed a ftock for the fifners to trade with 
in Autumn. 

Caufes of its Decline. — Tn this manner was the fifhing fuc- 
cefsfully carried on till the year 1 743, when two of the boats 
foundered at fea. This was a fevere ftroke, and followed 
by another, a few years after, equally deftru&amp;ive to the fifh- 
ing, though not fo fatal to the crews. As the boats were 
returning from the fea in 1756, a tender intercepted 3 of 
them, and imprefled the ftouteft of their men. A demand 
from government of every fifth man to ferve on board the 
fleet foon followed. The fifhers were obliged to comply with 
the neceffity of the times, by either going themfelves, or 
bribing others in their ftead : and thus purchafed protections 
for thofe who remained, at a great expence. Reduced in 
men and money, they were unable, by the end of the war in 
1763, to fit out more than 8 large boats, and as many fm all- 
in 1768, they were harrafied by Prefs-gangs y and forced to 
raife a new levy, at the rate of 10I. or a man. Diftref- 
fed with fo many demands, and deprived cf the means of 
fupplying them, many (lout young men abandoned the fifh- 
ing, and bound themfelves apprentices to colliers, in order 
to avoid ferving on board the navy ; — a fervice, from which 
the impolitic, though fome times neceffary, meafure of im- 
preffmg is calculated to create averfion. The boats were now 
poorly mann'd, and unable to go to fea, unlefs in verv fa- 
vourable weather. Through the poverty of their owners, 
they fell to pieces, one after another, till the year 1776, 
when they were reduced to 5. The commencement of a 
new war created a new demand for men. Tenders and 
prefs-gangs perfecuted them at fea and fhore, and prevented 
them from earning bread to their families. It therefore be- 
came 



Statijlical Account 



came ncceflary to ftrain the laft nerve, which many of them 
did, by raifing the enormous contribution of 15I. for every 
man who was demanded, in order to procure protections for 
the reft. But now, by an unwarrantable breach of good 
faith, protections ferved only as a pa/sport to the Navy. One 
of the boat-mafters was imprelTed with his protection in his 
pocket, and died on board the Salt/bury (hip of war going 
out to the Weft Indies. The exadions made on the fifhers, 
during laft war, gave a decifive blow to the fiftiery at Johns- 
haven ; and deprived the nation of a valuable nurfery 
for hardy feamen. It is now reduced to one large boat in 
fummer, and 4 or 5 yawls in winter, whofe crews confift of 
old men and boys, fcarce fit to manage an oar. Thus do the 
unjuftifiable means, which are had recourfe to for the tem- 
porary fupport of any ftate, frequently tend to its final de- 
ftruction. Had greater moderation been ufed in demanding 
levies from Johnfhaven, during former wars, it might ftill 
have retained its rank among fifliing towns, and been able, 
on the pre fen t emergency, to contribute to the general fup- 
port of the nation. 

Another caufe concurred in depopulating the fea-faring 
part of the town, though the ruin of the fifhery can only be 
afcribed to the hardfhips impofed on the fifhers by levying 
and imprefiing them. Many no doubt returned from the 
wars richer than when they went away ; but, after being 
accuftomed to a navy life, they returned with ideas above 
fifliing, as may be fuppofed, when the cafe of handing a fail 
is compared with the labour of tugging at the oar. The 
prize money and wages many of them had gained, ferved to 
purchafe fmall vefiels, which they employed in the coafting 
trade ; and their habits of induftry, acquired in early life, by 
degrees raifed them to larger. But the harbour of Johns- 
haven being unfafe for veflels of any confiderable burthen in 

winter 



of Benhoime. 233 

winter, it becknfc neceflary for them to quit their native 
place, where their property could not be protected, and to 
take up their refidence where {hips might be fecure in all 
feafons. Owing to this caufe, 15 mailers, of veffels from 50 
to 150 tons burden, with their families, have removed to 
Montrofe fine? the year 1766. An equal number of veffels, 
about the fame burthen, ftill belong to John (haven, which 
cannot be brought there with fafety duiing winter. The 
mailers of thefe have hitherto ftrugglcd with the inconve- 
nience of having their families in one place, and their pro- 
perty in another, nearly one half of the year ; but it is more 
than probable, that they will follow the example of their 
neighbours, unlefs fome material improvement is made upon 
the harbour.' 

Pier and Propofed Improvement. — Afniall pier or wharf has 
been ere£led of late, by means of which veffels may load and 
unload at any time of the tide, in favourable weather ; but 
till a bulwark is raifed to break the force of the fea, it never 
can become a place of fafety ; and any thing fhort of that can 
add little to the profperity of the town. The expence necet- 
fary for this purpofe, according to an eftimate made by an 
architect, who viewed the ground in 1754, would not ex- 
ceed 900' 1. Nature has indeed laid the foundation, and like- 
wife furnifhed the materials for building a proper harbour: 
On the eaft fide, a ledge of free ftone rocks, about 30 yards 
broad, reaches from high water, at neap tide, to low water at 
fpriiig* tide, which are feldom overflowed except in fevere 
ftorms. On the Well fide, a number of flat rocks run out 
from the beach S. S. W. into the open fea, clofe by the fide 
of which there is 6 or 8 fathom water. The South end of 
thefe is covered by half tide, when fmall veffels may enter 
the harbour, though they cannot, until near full fea, reach the 

Vol. XV. G g prefcnl

Statiftical Account 



prefcnt warf. In ordinary tides the depth of the harbour is 
from 10 to 12 feet, which might be farther increafed at no 
great expence, as the bottom is a foft marly rock. 

Probable Advantages — Were the advantages arifing from a 
fafe harbour at Johnshaven confined to the town or even 
neighbourhood, they might be thought fcarcely equivalent to 
the expence neceflary to procure them : But when it is confi- 
dered that a great part, one half at leaft of the county, would 
profit greatly by this improvement, the expence 'mull appear 
inconfiderable. If the utility of the defign were attended to, 
it is highly probable that the time of its execution might not 
be very diftant. Many obfiacles, which have hitherto pre- 
vented manufactures from flourifhing in this part of the 
county, would then be removed and the expence of land 
carriage, which is more or lefs a draw back upon every branch 
of trade, would be greatly diminifhed. To yeflels employed 
hi the coafting trade it would prove of the utmoft confe- 
quence, as they might find an eafy and fafe retreat here from 
the ftorm, in certain winds, when it would be deftrudlion 
for them to attempt landing on any other part of the coafl, 
betwixt the Frith of Forth and the Murray Frith. 

'Trade and Commerce. — The trade here chiefly confifts in 
importing coals and expbrting grain. A fufficient quantity 
of the former article is brought in fummer from Sunderland, 
and the Frith of Forth, to fupply the town and neighbour- 
hood through the year. Some cargoes of lime are alfo 
brought from the fame places, for the ufe of the farmer. Till 
of late, Montrofe was the only market for grain in this neigh- 
bourhood, when two merchants in Johnshaven were tempt- 
ed, by the fituation of the place, to commence dealers in 

grain 



of Benhohne. 



235 



grain. The adventure has not only proved advantageous to 
themfelves, but highly beneficial to the neighbourhood. The 
farmer being enabled to deliver his grain in lefs than one half 
the time which was formerly required, has it more in his 
power to embrace a favourable feafon when it ofTers. This 
is of the utmoft moment here, where the nature of the foil, 
in many places is fuch, that it can only be plowed to ad- 
vantage between wet and dry. The fhort cariiage, therefore, 
gives them a decided preference above other merchants, who 
live at a greater diftance, fo that they purchafe moft of the 
barley produced for many miles around, which they either 
convert into malt, for the Norway market, or fend to the 
Frith of Forth. From 3000 to 4000 bolls of grain are an- 
nually exported 

MamifaElures. — A manufacture of fail cloth has of late 
been eftablifhed in the town of Johnshaven, by a Company 
of Dundee merchants. This affords employment at times to 
about 50 men, befides a number of women. To form a fair 
opinion of any undertaking in its infancy is difficult, but 
were the harbour improved, there is every probability that 
this would fucceed, as it would then labour under no local 
difadvantage.

Prices of Labour and Proviftons — Of late the price of la- 
bour and provilions has grer.te!y increafed ; 5 1. per annum 
would have been confidered as high wages for the belt plough- 
man a few years ago ; now 8 1. would be offered in vain. 
From 30 s. to z L were the common yearly wages of female 
fervants ; of late they receive from 3 1. to 4 1 ; a day-labour- 
er within thefe few years thought himfelf well paid with 8d, 
but now expects i s. per day. Except amor.g houfe carpen- 
ters and mafons, who daily receive from is. 6d. to 2s , the 
advance of wages has not been fo rapid in other occupations. 
As many employed in thefe, however, are paid by the piece, 
their income cannot be mentioned with certainty. Butcher 
meat, within the laft 30 years, has rifen from one id. to f\ 
per pound, and many other articles of provifion in a higher 
proportion. 

Minerals. — In this parifh there are feveral quarries of free 
{lone, and one in particular upon the eltate of Benholme, of 
an excellent quality. All the rocks on the coall chiefly con- 

fift

fill: of this fort of ftone ■, but what is found within flood 
mark, being impregnated with faline particles, always retains 
a moifture, and is therefore improper for building dwelling 
houfes. Mill ftone of a good quality is found in many pla- 
ces along the fhore. 

Roads and Bridges. — The poft road leading from Montrofe 
to Aberdeen runs through this parifli, in a line almoft parel- 
lel with the coaft, and nearly at the diftance of a mile from 
it. Not far. from the church, and near to each other, there 
are two ftone bridges upon this road, which contribute much 
to its improvement. A different direction, however, would 
be neceffary to render it completely eafy, as the ground, both 
on the Eaft and Weft fides of thefe bridges, rifes to a confi- 
derable height. From the nature of the foil, and the difficul- 
ty of bringing gravel from the fhore, the high way has hither- 
to been deep in winter. Nor are the crofs roads in ,a better 
ftate. The ftatute labour is infufficient, and is performed with 
reluclancy. A turnpike has often been propofed through 
this county, and will doubtlefs in the end be found the only 
means for promoting focial intercourfe, by rendering travel-' 
ling more comfortable. 

Difadvantages. — Deep roads and a bad harbour arc 
the only material difadvantages under which this diftrict la- 
bours. Fuel is no doubt fcarce ; but were the harbour im- 
proved, the opportunity of landing coals at all feafons, would 
prevent the want of any other kind of fuel from being felt. 
At prefent many poor people frequently pay an exorbitant 
price for this neceffary article, and are often obliged to en- 
dure the rigour of the cold, from not being able in fummer 
\o lay in a fufficient fupply. 

Antiquities.

ylnt 'iquities. — Among the few antiquties in this parifh, may 
be mentioned a fquare tower, which was the ancient refi- 
dence of the family of fienholme, and is Mill kept in repair, 
though not inhabited. From its peninfular fituation, thick- 
nefs of walls, and battlements on the roof ; tbis building 
feems to have been originally intended for a place of 
flrength ; and before the ufe of artillery, was probably not 
ill calculated to refill the fudden attack of an enemy. When 
this flrong hold was built is uncertain. On the fummit of 
the neareft hill to the fea, except one, bordering with the 
parifh of Cyrus, and commanding an extenfive profpect, 
flands a rough ftone, in the circumference of a ftony circle, 
commonly called the Cloach Stone. It is more than a foot 
thick, rneafures 8 feet along the ground, and rifes nearly 6 
above its furface, in an inclined direction towards the North. % 

Char abler 

\ As there is no phec in the neighbourhood, except one at the South corner 
of the parifh, clofe by the fhore, where ftones of the fame quality are found, 
it appears to have been brought from thence, not without confiderable difli- 
culty, the intervening fpace being a pretty fteep afcent of more than a mile. 
It would feem therefore to have been erefted for fome ufeful purpofe, per- 
haps with a view to perpetuate fome memorable event. Tradition fays, a bat- 
tle was fought near the place, and the number of flint heads of arrows, found 
rn the fide of the hill where it flands, affords fome reafon to credit this le- 
port. Between this and the coafl, a great quantity of human bones has been 
dug up, in the courfc of improving the land, for nearly the fpace of a mile a. 
long the rifing ground above Johnshaven The bottom and fides of the graves, 
containing thefe bones, were all lined with rough ftones. It is difficult to ac- 
count for fo great a fpace being occupied by dead bodies, on any other fup- 
pofnion than that of an engagement : At the fame time, it Items doubtful 
whether fuel) a degree of attention would be bellowed in burying all the dead 
Cain in the field of battle, unlefs we confider it as mark of regard from the 
futvrvors, to thofe who had probably fallen in defence of their country. 
There were no arms in any of thefe graves ; but one or two have been found, 

in 



o/Benbolme. 239 

Charatler and Manners— Smuggling, which former- 
merly tended to debauch the morals of the fea-faring-people, 
is no longer carried on within the bounds of this parifh. 
Drunkennefs and fighting are confequently little heard of. 
Any petty fquabbles, that now happen, feldom proceed far- 
ther than high words. A few profecutions for fcandalhave re- 
formed the obnoxious practice of abufive language, which 
was much in ufe, and taught the generality to bridle their 
tongues. Frugality, fobriety, and induftry, are the diftm- 
guifliing chara&amp;eriftics of the country people. The inhabi- 
tants of Johnshaven are not deficient in the two firft of thefe 
virtues, though there is (till room for amendment with re- 
gard to induftry. Among every rank, however, both in 
country and town, there is charity enough to " cover a mul- 
" titude of fins." ") 

To Conclude. — About 50 years ago, the Excife officer's fa- 
mily was the only one in Johnshaven that made ufe of tea ; 
when the tea kettle was carried to the well, to bring in wa- 
ter 



in ftone coffins of about 4 feet long, at a place called Moat Hill, not far 
from the manfion houfe of Benholme. (3n an eminence bordering with Gar- 
vock, called Kinchet, or, more properly, King's Scat Hill, there is a large heap 
of flones or Cairn, where, according to tradition, a King fat in judgement ; 
among other complaints, many were- lodged agaiuft Melvile of Allardice, 
at that time Sheriff of the county, for his opprLffion. The Royal Judge, 
either wearied with the complaincrs, or enraged at the offender, faid, proba- 
bly in a peevifh humour; " I with that Sheriff were fodden and fupped in 
" brofe." Such was the favage barbarity of the times, that the Barons, who 
were little accuftomcd to the formalities of a trial, laid hold on thefe werds, 
and put them literally in execution, The place where the deed was perpe- 
trated, lyes at the bottom of the hills, on the lide next Garvock, is not unlike 
the cavity of a kiln for drying corn, and ftill retains the name of the Ssek- 
kif's Kettle.

ter, numbers both of children and grown pepple followed it,

eight day clock would have created equal furprife. Now the 
tea kettle has loft the power of aftonifhing, having become 
a necefiary piece of furniture among the meaneft : and. one 
can fcarcely enter a houfe where he is not put in mind of 
the fleeting of time from fome one corner of it.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6907005">MONZIE</name> 

(County of Perth, Presbytery of Auchterarder, Synod 
of Perth and Stirling.) 

By the Rev. Mr Geor.ge Erskine, Minister.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Name. 

JL^Lll competent judges of the Gaelic agree that the 
name Monzie is derived from that language. But they differ 
a little about its orthography or fignification. Some think 
it mould be wrote Monieu, which fignifies Deer Hi//, as pro- 
bably at that period, the hills abound with that fpecies of 
game. Others think it fhould be wrote Moniui, which fig- 
nifies hill foot, and is very expreflive of the fituation of the 
ha! itable pr.rts of the parifh. But a third clafs maintain, and 
with the greater! probability, that it fhould be wrote Moeghe, 
wnich fignifies good plain , as the low lying grounds are pret- 
ty fertile. 



Extent, Form, and Situation.-— The extent of this parifh is 
very confiderablc, being from E. to W. 7 Engltfh miles, and 
Vol. XV. Hh f rom 



24 2 Stati/lical Account 

from N. to S. at the greateft breadth, 12 miles. Its figure 
is irregular, perhaps fomewhat fimihr to the crofs. It U 
diftant from the town of Perth 14 miles, and from the town 
of Crieff, 3 miles. The parifh is a mountainous diftricl:. It 
lies on the fouth fide of the Grampian hills. The habitable 
part of the parifh is divided into the back and the fore part, by 
a ridge of very high hills 4 miles in breadth. Each of thefe 
habitable parts is a narrow valley, enclofed by hills all the 
length of the parifh, from E. to W. 

Sail, Surface, Cultivation, and Produce, tzfe. — The foil of 
this parifh is various, in general it is light, dry and good, but 
fhallow. Part of it is gravellifh ; much of it moffy, and 
fome of it clay. By far the greateft part of the parifh con- 
■fifts of hills and fheep farms. The hills arc partly green, 
but moftly covered with heath, and the interjacent flats are 
covered with bent, and rather fwampy. On the whole, not 
above a third part of the parilh is arable : In the lower part 
of the parifh, they are introducing the Englifli ploughs, 
drawn with two horfes, and the man who holds, alfo drives 
it. In the more deep ground, they ufe the Scotch plough, 
drawn by 4 horfes, all a-breuft, becaufe they think it anfwers 
better for going up hills. About the middle or end of the 
month of March, theyfow oats andpeafe, then their flax; after 
which they fet potatoes ; and laft of all they fow their barley. 
The earlieft barley is ripe about the middle of Auguft , the 
harveft becomes general in September, and is finifiied about 
the end of that month. 

Climate, Difeajh, and Longevity. — The climate of this pa- 
rifh is good but various. Mild, gentle and dry in the vales, 
while the hills are hid in fog, or covered with fnow, or wafli- 
ed with rains. A very common diforder here, is the chronic 

, rheumatifm.

iheumatifm, feizing the poorer fort of people, efpecially tbofc 
more advanced in life ; and this chiefly is owing to their mi- 
prable made of living, the coldnefs and dampnefs of their 
houfes, and the fcarcity and high price of fuel. Slow fevers 
too attack them about fpring aim 1 autumn, but feldom prove 
mortal. Some, though very few, die of confumption and 
palfey. The fmall pox raged much here formerly, but is 
now much mitigated by the general intrqducYion of innocu- 
lation. The air on the whole being falubrious, there are a 
number of inftances of longevity in the parifh. One man 
died lately aged 100 years; one is ftill alive aged 92, who 
was formerly a day-labourer, and who is ftill able to walk a- 
bout, and fee his friends ; and there is a confiderable num- 
ber of healthy people, aged 70 and 80. 

Rivers and Fiji:. — The Amon, or Almon, is the principal 
river. It runs through the Eaft part of the parifh, and inter- 
fe&amp;s it about 12 miles. The river Skaggie, runs through the 
centre of the parifh, and divides it for about 3 miles. The 
river Keltie runs through the parifh, towards the Weft end, 
jnterfetting it for about 2 miles : And, the fmall river Bar- 
vie feparates this parifh from that of Monivaird, for about 
2 miles. All thefe rivers have their fources in the north- 
ern part of this parifh, and, after a variety of meander- 
ing circuits among the hills, they run directly South. The 
Amon, after approaching near the South fide of this parifh, 
runs eaftward, until it empties itfelf into the Tay above 
Perth. The reft of thefe rivers meet near the Weft end of 
the parifh, whence they run ftill farther weftward, in one 
ftream, which empties itfeif into the river Earn, a little a- 
bove Crieff. Each of thefe rivers, as well as a number of 
burns, which defcend from the hills, and run into them, a- 
hound with gpocl black trouts -, and the Amen has a pecu-

liar fpecies of fine white trouts. Some have been taken, 
which weighed from 31b. to 41b and meafured from 1 to 
I i foot long. Salmon grilfes have alfo been taken, from 
7lb. to lolb. weight ; and at the fpawning time, falmon have 
been got, (though contrary to law) weighing 20 lb. 

Woods. — About 50 years ago, this parifh abounded a great 
deal more in wood than it docs at prefent. The hack part 
of the parilh, called Glenalmon, feems to have been once one 
continued foreft, whereas now there is only one large pine 
tree to be feen in the whole of ic. There is a confiderabls 
quantity of woodland Rill in the fore part of the parifh ; it 
confifts of oaks, elms, beeches, birks, planes, and large faughs. 
There are 5 woods upon the eftate of Monzie, two upon that 
of Calendar, and one upon that of Cultoquhey ; and all of 
them are very thriving. Befides thefe, there are beautiful 
and tall plantations around the manfion-houfes of Monzie 
and Cultoquhey. Thefe woods M ere cut and fold within 
thefe few years, and brought a high price. Upon the banks 
of the rivers and burns, as well as in the dens, there is a coa- 
fiderable quantity of fhrubs, which are both ufeful and orna- 
mental. 

Wild Animals. — The wild quadrupeds are hares, badgers, 
rabbits, roe-bucks, deers, foxes and otters. All the wild 
fowls and birds of prey, which are natives of the North of 
Scotland, frequent the woods : Tbrufhes, linnets, black-bird?, 
finches, ftarlings, patridges,' wild ducks, herons, muir fowl ; 
hawks, ravens, hooded crows, and water crows ; and fome- 
times we are vihted by the eagle. The birds of the migra- 
tory kind are the fwallow, cuckow, plover, feldtfare, and at 
times the king's-fifher. 

State of Property, Services, bV.— During thefe lad 30 
years, there has been no transfer of property in the parifh.

A confiderablc part of it is inclofed, but the greater part of 
it ftill lies open. The tenants are fully convinced of the 
great advantage of inclofmg, and would very willingly give 
the proprietors intereft for fuch fums as might be necefiary 
for that purpofe. However, -as many of them have no leafes 
of their farms, fuch are difcouraged even from that. The 
dread of being removed, where an avaricious neighbour of- 
fers an augmentation, or an unfeeling mafter accepts the 
bribe of iniquity, binds up the hand of induflry, and bars 
the way of improvement. As the arable ground is of very 
different quality, fo we find it let at very different rents. 
As to the pendiclers^ they rent their grounds at ics. to 25s. 
an acre. Thofe who have large farms, rent the arable ground 
at from 8s. to 10s. an acre. The hill part of the parifh, is 
let by the lump to thofe farmers who are neareft to it, and 
they pay a feparate rent for it ; grafs parks have been let in 
this parifh at 2I. 2s. per acre. A great deal of fervices are 
ftill performed by all of them to the proprietors, -which 
increafe the value of the rents. Thefe fervices are chief- 
ly farm work, with carriages of peats and coals. In the 
cefs book, the valued rent of the parifh is 2900L Scotch ; 
the real rent is nearly 1700I. Sterling. As there never was 
any furvey taken of this parifh, the exact number of acres in 
it cannot be afcertained. None of the land is common. 
Every proprietor knows exactly the marches of his own 
efb.te. The moft of the hilly part is pafture,'becaufe of its 
fteepnefs, but the lower parts are cultivated and produce 
very well. There is but a very fmall part of the parifh thir- 
led to their lairds mills, they being exempted from that bon- 
dage, and free to grind their corn where they pleafe, upon 
conditions of their paying to the proprietor a fum among 
them, equal to the rent of the mill, and this in proportion to 
their own rents. 

Produce, 



246 



Statiflical Account 



Produce, Exports, Sec — The principal crops raifed in this 
parifh, are oats, barley, flax, and potatoes. Of late, they 
have fown fome peafe, rye, wheat, grafs feeds, and turnips, 
all of which do very well. As the produce, efpecially of the 
fore part of the parifh, is much greater than is neceffary for 
the confumption of its inhabitants, confiderable quantities of 
butter, cheefe, meal, mutton, beef, pork, oat-meal, barley, 
and potatoes, are difpofed of in the towns and places adja- 
cent. 

Horfes, Black- cattle, Sheep, and Wool. — The cattle are all of 
the fmall kind, but good of their fizes. All the high priced 
cattle belong to the low part of the parifh, and are rear- 
ed in gentlemen's parks. Grazing cattle is now become 
more common than it was formerly. The farmers in gene- 
ral, rear their own cattle, of every fpecies, and thus keep their. 
Stuck (as they term it,) alive. They keep from 2 to 6 work- 
ing horfes, each, and from 3 to 6, and fome even 10 or 12 
milk eows. It is believed, that there are io,coo fheep in 
the parifh. They are of the Scotch beed, and very hardy. 
Their wool is good, and their flefh very fweet. The aver- 
age prices of cattle, wool, &amp;c. are as follows ;

pulation of this, as well as of fome of the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes, has greatly diminifhed, fince the beginning of the pre- 
fent century. The remains of uninhabited houfes, the emi-

grations of young people of both fexes, who, thinking their 
parents cpprefled in their farms, go away to other parts, and. 
other employments ; fewer of thofe who remain joining m 
marriage now than formerly ; and, above all, the monopoly 
of farms, which fo much prevails •, fome individuals rent- 
ing and farming lands, formerly poffened by 6, 8, or 1 o 9 
and fome even poffcffed by 20 tenants ; thefe, and many o- 
ther ciicumftances, account for and prove the great decreafe 
of rhe population. No enumeration of this parifh, however, 
previous to the one drawn up in ] 755, at the requeft of Dr 
Webfter, has been made ; or, if it was, can now be difcover- 
edi Upon comparing that report, however, with the refuk 
of an enumeration made by the prefent incumbent in 1792, 
the decreafe within thefc 40 years does not appear fo great, 
as, from the above caufes, might have been expe£led :

Conditions and Occupations.— Ml the inhabitants of this pa- 
ri Hi are either proprietors, farmers, tradefmen, or day-la- 
bourers. The great part of the farming work, is done 
by the farmers themfelves, their wives, their fons, and their 
daughters. There is a great number of pendiclers and cot- 
tagers in this parifti. The former clafs are thofe who rem 
a houfe and a fmall piece of ground from the proprietor ; 
the latter rent it from the tenant, and are obliged to work to 
him during the harveft, and even at other times, if it be need- 
ful.

Manufactures. — The principal one in the parilh is that of 
weaving. They weave all kinds of plain and tweeled linen, 
and woolen cloth ; and thefe not only for their own ule, but 
alfo for fale ; the chief kinds of cloth made by them are plaid- 
en, linen and fcrims. The plaiden they fell at from lod. 
to i4d. per yard. They make a very large quantity of linen 
cloth, and bleach it excellently themfelves ; it is of various de- 
grees of finenefs, and they fell it at from is. to 4s. per yard. 
Some families, where there are only two looms, have made 
and fold 1000 yards per annum. The fciim is. a narrow 
linen cloth, of different degrees of finenefs, and which they 
fell without bleaching it. It is all exported, perhaps for 
trowfers. The women fpin a great deal of yarn, which they 
, make

make into cloth for fale, and thus by their induflry raife 
part of their rent. 



Prices of Provifions and Labour.— Owing to the wet harvefl 
in 1 792, provifions rofe much in their price. Work here is 
generally done by the piece. The wages of domeftic fer- 
vants are nearly the fame with thofe of farm fervants. The

Catholics in this paiifh. All of thefe come occasionally to the 
church, excepting the Antiburghers. The King is patron, 
but the family of Monzie have always had fufficient intereft 
to fecure the preformation as they wiflied. The living con- 
fifts of 22 bolls of meal, 10 bolls of bear, and 5 3 1 . 6s. 6d. in 
money. The ftipend is paid by 5 heritors, viz. Col. Camp- 
bell of Monzie, Mr Drummond of Logieamond, Mr Graham 
of Balgowan, Col. Robertfon of Lawers, and the Earl of 
Kinnoul. Col. Campbell is the only one who has a manfion 
houfe in the parifh. The manfe and offices were all built with- 
in thefe 3 years. The glebe confifts of two parts ; one near 
the manfe, containing about 5 acres of good arable ground ; 
the other about a mile from the manfe, upon a finall emi- 
nence, containing about 3 acres of very bad ground. The 
church is 60 feet long, and 20 feet wide. It was built in 
1685. It was lately repaired, is well feated, and very com- 
modious. The pulpit, which is made of oak, bears dntc- 
1617. That part of the parifli called Glenalmon is annexed 
quoad facra to the chapel of Ambleric. There is a village 
near the church. 

Schools.— Until of late there were 4 fchools in this parifh. 
One in the North part, another in the Eaft, a third in the 
South part, and the eftablifhed fchool near the centre. In 
all of thefe were taught Englifh, writing,arithmetic, and book- 
keeping. The firft of thefe fchools, owing to the union of 
farms, is given up, the teacher not being able to fupport him- 
felf. The other 3 (till continue. The falary of the one at the 
Eaft end of the parifh is 5I. per a/innm, with a houfe and 
garden. It is paid by the Duke of Athol out of the bilhop's 
rents. His fees, however, for each of the branches taught 
are only is. per quarter. The number of fcholars are from 

40 



of Mojvzie, 



40 to 60. The fchool 011 the South- fide has no fixed falary, 
only a houfe and garden, given to him gratis by Mr Maxton 
of Culltoquhey. The fees are the fame as above, for each 
branch only is. per quarter. The number of fcholars are 
from 30 to 50. As to the eftablifhed fchool, the number of 
fchoJars attending it are from 40 to 70. The matter's fala- 
ry and emoluments from the kirk feffion, and keeping 
the regifters, is about 12I. per annum ; he has a free houfe 
and garden. The fees for Englifh are is. per quarter, for 
writing i s. 6d. per quarter, for arithmetic 2s. per quarter, 
and for a complete fet of book-keeping ics. 6d. All of thefe 
fchools are very convenient for the parifh, and the teachers 
are careful and diligent. Learning is now more generally 
diiFufed than formerly. 

Poor. — The amount of the weekly collections is about 20I. 
a-year. Befides this, there are the -dues arifing from the ufe 
of two mort-cloths, the intereft of 120I. funk money, and pe- 
nalties exacted from delinquents. The regular poor receive 
2s. a-month, and the occafional poor receive 5s. 10s. and 
fometimes even 20s. at a time. All the poor are either 
maintained in their own houfes, or, when neceffary, are board- 
ed. The greateft number of the poor earn about two-thirds 
of their maintainance. None belonging to the pariih are al- 
lowed to beg, although many ftranger vagrants infeft it not 
a little. 

Language and Etymologies. — This parifh being fituated on the 
borders of the Highlands, and having much intercourfe and 
connection with the natives, we need not be furprifed to find 
that the Gaelic is fpoken in the back part of it, and the old 
Scotch dialed in the fore part, pronounced with the Gaelic 
tone and accent. There are, however, very few perfons in 

I i 2 . the 



Statijlical Account 



the whole parifh, who do not either fpcak or underftand 
Oaelic. Mod of the names of places are evidently derived 
from that language, and are exprefiive of their local fitua- 
tion. The following may ferve as a fpecimen ; Lethcntys 
fignifies the broader country. Kuinighragon, the end of the 
rock. Cultoquhey is the Englifh name for its original Gaelic 
name, Comhal-cuhs, i. e. Comhal's battle. 

Bridges, Roads , Ak-houjes, Mil/s, and Markets. — Over the 
river Almon at Buchandy, there is a bridge of one arch, laid 
over another, and bearing date 1639. It was built by the 
Earl of Tullibardin when he had his fummer refidence in 
this place, the remains of which refidence are ftill to be 
feen. His arms are cut on it, and the initials of his own and 
his lady's names. The proper name of the bridge, however, 
is M'Beatfs bridge, becaufe of a chapel originnlly near it, called 
Si M'Bean's chapel \\. On all the public roads there are good 
bridges. Thofe upon the county road built by the county, 
and the others by fubfeription. The roads here were kept up 
formerly by the ftatute labour, which is generally very ill 
performed, and therefore it is now commuted. They pay. 
from 8s. to 10s. each plough, and the pendiclers and cot- 
tagers pay is. 6d. a-year. There are 7 licenfed ale-houfes 
in the parifh. There are 5 oat meal mills, and two flax mills. 

The 

lj. Near the N. E. corner of the parifli, there had been another chapel, 
but no veftige of it is now to be feen. There is ftill a burying ground in 
that place, and its fituation is moft romantic. Tradition fays, that the even- 
ing before the battle of Lunkarty, 60 men took the facrament here, who all 
went to the field, and only 6 of them returned, In digging for marl a little 
to the weft of Monzie, a part of a deer's horn was found, 7 inches in circum- 
ference ; and the barrel of a gun, 5 feet long, 4 inches in circumference at 
the one, and 7 inches in circumference at the other end, z (tones in weight. 
It had evidently been ufed before the invention of the locks, as the match 
I-iole is entire and plain. 



of Monzie. 



The meal mills make very good pot barley, without any ad, 
ditional machinery. There is only one yearly market in the 
parifh, when every houfe, hut, and fhade, is converted into 
a dram-fhop ; it is held in the middle of Auguft 

Romantic Scenery, Cafcades, &amp;c— This parifh is- remark-, 
able for romantic fcenery, and chiefly that part of it called 
Glenahnon. Near the Weft end of the fore part of the pa- 
rifh, the river Barvie runs through a deep den, where it 
forms feveral fmall cafcades. The den is clothed with natu- 
ral wood, and at fome places 100 feet deep. Near a mile 
North from the place of Monzie, upon the river Keltie, there 
is a remarkable den, with various cafcades. The uppermoffc 
cafcade, called Spout-bay, is in breadth at the top 5 feet ; the 
river falls over a fmooth Hoping rock, the height of which is 
90 feet, and the breadth at the bottom 43 feet. The river 
then contracts into its former narrow channel, runs through, 
the thick wooded den, 150 feet deep. Here there are fome 
other water falls, 5 feet wide at top, and 10 feet perpendi- 
cular, with bafons cut by nature out of the folid rock, one 
of which is 1 2 feet diameter, and X) feet deep. At the 
mouth of the den, the river feems to have made a path for it- 
felf in the folid rock, 6 feet in breadth at the top, and 10 feet 
in height ; the bafon itfelf is 1 2 feet diameter. From 
this fall to the front of the rock is 24 feet ; but the opening, 
out of which the river begins again to run, is only about 4 
feet wide, All the way from Monzie marjfion-houfe to Spout- 
Bay, along the banks of the river, there is a foot-path made 
and repaired by the family ; at the top of which, on the fide of 
the den, and in full view of Spout-bay, there is erected a her- 
mitage, for the reception of the admiring vihtors of this caf- 
cade. About a mile above the village of Monzie there is a- 
nother beautiful cafcade, upon the river Shaggie •, the breadth 

of 



254 Statijlical Account 



of the river at the top is 18 feet, the height of the fall 55 
feet, und the breadth at the bottom 4} feet. It falls over 
very rugged rocks- One would think the path had been 
made by the hand of art. Near the bridge of Buchandy, 
there is a cafcade 10 feet broad, and 16 feet high. 

Artificial Mount, Large Trees, &amp;c — Oppofite to the foot 
of the principal entry into the manfion-houfe of Monzie, 
there is an artificial mount, near 70 feet high, in fhape 
a truncated cone, upon which ftands a a Chinefe temple. 
This temple is hexagonal, and almoft entirely open, ex- 
cept the pillars which fupport the roof. It is 14 feet long, 
12 broad, and 14 feet high. The roof terminates in a point, 
upon which there is a balcony with a bell, about 4 feet high. 
In the garden of Monzie there are 4 larch trees, faid to be 
the fineft and largeft in Britain. They are not yet 60 years 
old. One of them is 80 feet high •, its circumference at 
mid-height is 7 feet, and its circumference at the ground 16 
feet-, its branches extend all around 30 feet on each fide. 
The other two are about the fame height, but the circum- 
ference of the one at the ground is 1 5 feet, and that of the 
other is only 9 feet \ the fourth is 90 feet high, and 8 feet 
in circumference at the ground. They are all in perfeft vi- 
gour, fending forth frelb (hoots every year. Befides thefe, 
there are among the planting, and near the houfe, a good 
deal of fpruce, Giver fir, balm-of-Gilead fir, Sec. 60 and 80 
feet high, and not in the leaft decaying. 

Mineral Spring, Echo, Caves, Whirlwind, &amp;c.-There is one 
foxing in the parifh whofe waters were held in great efteem, 
until about 20 years ago, when two trees which grew over it, 
fell, and the virtue of the well fell with them. In a parti- 
cular part of Glcnalmon, among the hills, there is an echo

which repeats diftm£rly every word. There are many caves 
here, but the moil .remarkable one is at the back of Glentur- 
ret, which is fufficient to hold 60 men under arms. It is G- 
tuated in a rock, named Eagle's Rock, inaccemble on all fides, 
except one narrow path. It is faid to be the cave into which 
Gara fled, after burning Fingal's houfe. Near this cave 
there is a high Pine tree *, which is remarkable, becaufe 
there is not another tree at prefent to be found in all that 
part. This hill country is much expofed to tempefb, and 
especially to the whirlwind- It unroofs the houfes, over-' 
turns the ftacks, tears up the heath and broom, and even 
fweeps large (tones before it. A mo ft remarkable thing in 
this wind is, a noife it makes, fo like thunder that Grangers 
cannot but believe it is fo. It makes this noife in a certain 
hollow part of the glen furrounded by rocks on all fides. 

Natural Phawmena.% — There is a great curiofity, called 
The-Kirk-of-the-VScod, not far from the Eagle's Rock. It is 
compofed of large ftones, divided into feveral apartments, * 
with arches and trances, and each ftone refting fo on ano- 
ther, that one would imagine it were the work of art. Near

1 In the year 1756, a water /pout broke in the hills above Monzie ; it 
took itscourfe down the river Shaggie, and raifed it 20 feet perpendicular at 
the bridge ; it fwept entirely away a bank near Monzie, which coll 500I.

bitants carried them home in balkets ; the river fubfiding fo quickly, that 
they were left behind. In the year 1 758, during a heavy rain in the hills, the 
water collected on the top of the brae near Monzie, and carried down fuch ) 
a quantity of the earth into the Shaggie, as left a den aco feet long, above 
100 feet broad, from edge to edge, and 70 feet deep. For feveral years paft, 
fome ftiocks of an Earthquake were felt here, and in the neighbouring parifh; 
their direction was from E, to W.

Antiquities. — As the Romans and ancient Caledonians con- 
tinued their contefts long about the front of the Grampian 
hills, we find a vaft number of camps, forts, &amp;c. and Gmi- 
lar relics of antiquity. About 2 miles eaft from the church, 
at the country called Findoebs, there is a large camp. It is 
fituated oppofite to the only proper paflage through the hills 
found in them, for about 40 miles : It Hands on a high 
ground, defended by waters on two fides, and a mofs with 
fteep ground on the others. The trenches are ftill entire, 
and in fome places 6 feet deep. It is about 180 paces in 
length, and 80 paces in breadth, and was furrounded by a 
ftrong earthen wall, part of which ftill remains, and is near 
12 feet thick. Thofe who are connoiffeurs in fuch matters, 
fay it could contain 12,000 men. Within the camp there is 
a large plain, called Rathmore, i. e. fortification , which, howe- 
ver, feems to be of a later date.' Near this there are many 
ruins, burrows, cairns of Hones, fome of W'hich have 
been opened, and were found to be graves. Near this camp 
Hands a village called, in Gaelic, Fianteach, i. e. Fingal's 
houfej. Within two miles North from this, ftands the 
high hill of Duntnsre. On it there is a ftrong fort, which 
had the complete command of the paflage through the hills. 
This fort inclcfes the furhmit of the hill ; and is inaccefiible 

on 

f Tradition fays, Fingal's houfe flood here until it was burnt by Gard. 
Comparing the names of places, and the names of the princes as mentioned 
in hiftory, it is probable, this camp was occupied about the year 300. Tra- 
dition fays, Fingal dwelt for fome time in this country, and we know both his 
father and his Ion are buried here. When digging lately among the ruins, 
plates of lead, curious beadrftones, dog's collars, &amp;c. were found.

on all fides but one. It is defended by a deep trench with- 
out the walls. It is 30 paces in breadth within the inner 
wall, and 180 paces around the fort. Each wall is 20 feet 
thick, and 20 feet diftant from each other, and from the 
outer wall to the trench is 30 paces. This is faid to have 
been Fingal's habitation, after Gara burned his houfe %i 
The walls are built with ftone but no cement, and fame of 
the {tones would weigh 300 (tones weight. About 2 miles 
Eaft from Fiantiach, there is another fort, called Lene. It 
is twice as large as the one above, exceedingly ftrong, and 
appears to have been built by the fame perfons : It is fur- 
rounded with two walls. The inner wall is 240 paces round, 
the diftance between the walls is 20 feet, and each wall is 
20 feet thick. On the contiguous muir there are many cairns, 
tumuli, and burrows, which are thought to be monuments of 
heroes, but even tradition is filent about them. One, however, 
is called Caim-Comkal |j in memory of Fingal's father. In 
the fame moor there are a!fo 2 cairns, 50 feet in circumfer- 
ence. On the top of a hill, on the other fide of the paffage 
through the hills, and oppofite to Dunmore, is another cairn, 
where the Hones feem to be a fallen arch ; it was probably 
a fmall fort, and is fo near that of Dunmore, that perfons 
could converfe with each other acrofs the glen. There is a 
fmall camp on the South fide of the parifh, near to Culto- 
quhey, called in Gaelic, Comhal cults i. e. Comhal's battle %.

we have every reafon to believe, that fomc great men have 
been buried in this place, and we are certain, that the fa- 
mous Caledonian bard, Ossian, lies here. His tomb is well 
known, and often vifited. It is a coffin of 4 (tones fet on 
edge, about 2 feet long, 2 feet deep, \\ feet broad, and 
over it is laid a great ftone, about 8 feet high, arid 21 feet in 
circumference. General Wade's fervant difcovered it, when 
making the King's high way. 

Character and Manners, &amp;c. — The people of this parim 
may be (aid to anfwer the general character of the Scotch •, 
for they are fober, honeft, humane, induftrious, and refpeft- 
ful to their fuperiors. The have a reafonable meafure of 
the comforts and conveniences of life, are contented with 
their lot, attend moft regularly upon public worfhip, and 
behave with a becoming decency in the houfe of God. Not 
one inftance of fuicide, or of any perfon belonging to this 
parifh being judicially convicted of any crime, has occurred 
thefe 40 years. In general, they drefs better than formerly. 
They meet together at times,, and make merry. Their chief 
amufement at public meetings is dancing ; and, upon thefs 
occafions, there is a pleafing cheerfulnefs and innocence a- 
mong them. They are not however entirely free of fuper- 
Itition. Lucky and unlucky days and feet are (till attended to, 
efpecially about the end and beginning of the year. No per- 
fon will be proclaimed for marriage in the end of one year, 
or even quarter of the year, and be married in the beginning 
of the next. The power of an evtf eye, too, is ftill believed, 

although 

are told, that Con-stan tine the fon of Cullen was killed by Kennetu, 
the fon of Malcolm I. at Rathmore, in the year 992. And it is probable 
he is burried in one of thofe cairns. Hollinsued tells us, that king Culen 
was killed by Eachard at Methvcn caftle, almoft in the middle of his way 
to Scone ; and Methvcn fignifies mid-way in the Gaelic, and it is fituated be- 
twixt Rathmore and Scone.

although the faith of the people in witchcraft is much en- 
feebled. The people have nothing remarkable in their fize, 
ftrength, or features. They are generally of the middle fize, 
and of a dufky complexion. There are fome, however, 6 
feet in height. 

Advantages and Difadvantages.— -The principal difadvan- 
tage this parifh labours under, is its great diftan,ce from fuel. 
The neareft coal to Monzie is 20 miles diftant. The com- 
mon people burn turf, heath, peats, wood, fhrubs, and 
broom. Laft winter, coals were fold here at 3d. a (lone ; and 
even in fummer, they are 2d. the ftone- Another difadvan- 
bge is the want of lime ; for although it can be got at nd 
great diftance, yet the expence of fuel for burning it, renders 
it ufelefs. Marl is near us, but faid rtot to be very good j 
befides it is extremely dear, and the farmers would all give 
the preference to lime, Great advantages, however, are ex- 
peeled from the improvement and extenfion of the roads. 
In particular, from that excellent one how opened between 
Perth and Crieffj and which is intended to be carried for- 
ward to Stirling. There are alfo fome other roads in con- 
templation. Great honour is due to the public fpirit and 
activity of thofe Gentlemen, in this and the neighbouring 
parithes; for the attempts they are at prefent making to dif- 
cover coal in this part of the country. We hope, by perfe- 
verance, thefe attempts will at laft be crowned with fuccefs,

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1984807">D ALGETY</name> 

(Preseytery of Dunfermline, Synod of Fife, County ob 

Fife.) 

By the Rev. Mr Peter Primrose.</head>

<p>

Situation and Extent. 

T 

JL i-i e parifh of Dalgety is fituated in the county of Fife, 
and in the prefbytery of Dunfermline. It is bounded by the 
parifh of Aberdour on the Eaft and North, by Inverkeithing 
on the Weft, and by a fmall part of the parifh of Dunferm- 
line on the North Weft : On the South,, it is bounded by the 
Frith of Forth, along which it extends in a ftraight line about 
three miles ; but as the coaft in this place is interfered by 
many bays, its circuitous extent is confiderably more. It is. 
of an irregular form, but approaches neareft to the triangu- 
lar, being about four miles long from South to North, but its 
breadth gradually diminifhes towards the North, and in fome 
places it fcarcely exceeds half-a-mile. 

Sail, Surface, and Produce. — The foil is various. In fome 
places it confifis of a light loam, and is dry ; but the greater 

part 



of Balgety, 



part of the parifh confifts of a deep ftrong loam, mixed with 
chy, naturally wet and ftiff, but productive in general of fer- 
tile crops. The ground, in moft places, rifes confiderably a- 
bove the level of the coaft ; but there are few hills in the pa- 
rifh, and thefe are neither high, nor much covered with 
rocks. The furface in fome places is covered with heath, 
and a few little hills with furze : there are alio fome fmall 
moffes and fwampy ground ; but the fpace which thefe 
occupy is of fo little extent, that there is not above a 
fixth part of the parifh which is not arable. The principal 
crops raifed in the parifh are wheat, barley, oats, peafe, and 
beans. Potatoes too are cultivated in confiderable quantities, 
and, in fome places, partly ufed for feeding cattle. Turnips 
are alfo raifed for this purpofe, and grow to a confiderable 
fize ; but, on account of the wetnefs of the furface, and the 
injury which the land might fuftain in winter, by being cut 
with horfes and carts when they are carried off, they are not 
generally ufed. Tares are fometimes fown, and produce a- 
bundant crops : Flax is feldom raifed but for private ufe. A 
great part of the parifh confifts of grafs grounds, which have 
been laid down in good order, and, when let to graziers, yield 
confiderable rents. From fome inclofures, a proprietor has 
been known to draw al. 5s. per acre ; but the average rent of 
the land in grafs may be 'from l l. 5s. to il. 10s. annually, 
per acre. A confiderable number of black-cattle, and about 
900 fheep, are ufually grazed in the parifh. 

Prias of Grain and Provificns.— -The price of wheat and 
barley is frequently regulated by the liars of Mid Lothian. 
Some farmers get the higheft fiats for their grain, and others 
in the Northern part of the parifh, where the land is ufually 
of an inferior quality, fell fomewhat lower. Few oats are 
fold in the parifh, and the price of oat meal is generally the 

fame

Siatljlical Account 



fame with tliat of the Edinburgh market. Though the num- 
ber of inhabitants is not large in proportion to the extent of 
the parifh, yet, on account of the great quantity of land in 
grafs, befides what is allotted to the production of other crops, 
the oats raJfed in the parifli are far from being fufficient 
to fupply the confumption of meal. The average price of 
beef, mutton, and veal, is 4d. the pound, Dutch weight. The 
price of a hen is from is. to is. 3d. and chickens are fold 
from 8d. to iod. the pair. Butter is ufually at gd. the pound 
Tron weight. Cheefe varies according to its quality ; but the 
ordinary kind is 3d. the pound. Eggs are fold at 4d. and in 
the feafon of fcarcity, at 6d. the dozen- During thefe two 
]aft winters, herrings have been caught in great plenty upon 
this coafl, and the fifhermen are encouraged to bring very 
confiderable quantities of them to St David's, a harbour in 
the parifh, both for the purpofe of curing, and of fupplying 
the people in the neighbourhood. They prove a very benefi- 
cial article of food to this part of the country, and are fold 
at an eafy rate, being frequently at 6d. the hundred of fix 
fcore. It is thought by many, that flioals of herrings have, 
for a long time paft, come into this Frith in winter, without 
being generally difcovered or looked after ; whether they 
were in fuch great quantities as they have been thefe two 
years, it is impoffible to afcertain : but a fifherman in 
the neighbourhood; has, for many years, caught fome dur- 
ing the fpring feafon, in a net little accommodated for the 
purpofe, from the widenefs of its interftices, and which 
he had fpread out near the coaft, where there were runs of 
frefli water, in order to catch falmon trouts. It is therefore 
much to be wifhed, that fifhermen would be diligent in 
fearching the Frith occalionally every winter, to difcover if 
there are any herrings in it, and upon what part of the coaft 
they principally lie, that they may lofe; no opportunity of be- 
ing

Jug employed in a fifhery at once fo profitable to themfelves, 
and fo beneficial to the community. Perhaps the offer of a 
(landing premium or bounty to the crews of the firft boats, 
who fhall, after a particular feafon every year, carry a cer- 
tain quantity caught in the Frith to the Edinburgh market, 
might prove an ufeful incentive to their diligence in this re- 
fpett. 

Number of Proprietors, Tenants, Amount of Rent, $3* c — There 
are three proprietors who poflefs all the land in the parifh, 
and have houfes in it, where fome of them ufually, and q- 
thers of them occafionally, refide, viz. the Earl of Moray at 
Donibriftle, Sir John Henderfon at Fordel, and Dr Robert 
Moubray at Cockairny. The two firft of thefe retain in their 
own hands a confiderable part of their eftates in the parifh,, 
and they have of late highly improved their grounds, and a- 
dorned them with thriving plantations. The farm Cockair- 
ny is the largeft that is let in the parifh ;' and there are ele- 
ven others of fmaller extent. The are about 190 inhabited 
houfes in the parifh, of which only 1 2 are feus, the reft 
belonging to the proprietors \ and by far the greateft number, 
to Sir John Henderfon, for the accommodation of the peo- 
ple employed in working his coal. As a great part of the 
land in the parifh is not at prefent let, the real rent cannot 
be afcertained ; but its annual value, it is fuppofed, would a- 
mount to 2,oool. Streling, or upwards. The valued rent, as 
ftated in the cefs-roll, amounts, according to the old valuation, 
t° 5394^* Scots. 

Population. — In 1755 the numbers were rated at 76 r. By 
an enumeration lately made, there were 869 perfons in this 
parifh, of whom there were

There are no particular inflinces of longevity in the parifh 
at prefent. A few of the oldeft inhabitants may be about 
80 years of age, and fome have lately died, who were fup- 
pofed to be upwards of 90. In the year 1770, James Spital 
Efq; of Leuchart died in this parifli, reported by fome to have 
arrived at the age of 102 : he had been in the Scotch Parlia- 
ment ; and, for a confiderable time before his death, was 
fuppofed to be the only furviving member. 

Clhr.ate ar.d Diseases. — In the lower part of the parifli, 
which is upon the coaft, it is confiderably warmer and mild- 
er than in the upper, and the difference is very perceptible 
when the wind blows from any northern direction ; but dur- 
ing the Eafterly windsj which particularly prevail in the fpring 
ieafon, it is (harp and cold, almoft over the whole parifli. 
The air however is generally dry, and, during the continu- 
ance of the Eaft wind, is ufually more free from fogs or dairtp 
than the fhore on the oppofite fide. There are no difeafes 
that can be faid to be peculiar to the inhabitants, or that pre- 
vail here more than in the neighbouring pariflies. 1 have 
obferved indeed a few more inftances of rheumatifm, and 0- 
ther complaints arifing from cold, among the colliers, than a- 
mong the other parifhioners, but thefe are to be attributed, 
not fo much to the climate, as to the damp fituations in 
which they have fome times to work. An epidemical dif-

temper, which made its firft appearance in the village of A- 
berdour in fummer 1790, and created no fmall alarm, got in- 
to this parifh in the autumn, and two or three people died 
of it ; but as the weather turned colder, it became lefs fatal 
and infectious, and in the winter it altogether abated. The 
fmall-pox fometimes makes great ravages ; and it is to be la- 
mented, that the prejudices againft inoculation are fo ftrong 
among the generality of people in this part of the country, 
that no perfuafion can remove them ; nor can the evident in- 
ftances of its falutary effects, often exhibited by the medical 
gentlemen in this quarter, reconcile them to the practice, e- 
ven when the difeafe is gathering ground, and proving very- 
fatal in the natural way. 

Language and Etmology $f Names. — The language com- 
monly fpoken in the parifh is the Old Scotch dialeft, and 
there feem to be no peculiar words or phrafes which are not 
in general ufe throughout molt parts of the kingdom. The 
words are pronounced with a broad accent ; and I have often 
heard in this part of the country a found given to the diph- 
thong oi, which is not, I believe, fo ufual in other places : it 
is frequently pronounced as if it confifted of the letters ou, 
as for boul boil, pount for point, vouce for voice, &amp;c. Many 
of the names of places are derived from the Englifli, and are 
expreffive of their particular or relative fituations, as Hilland, 
Seafield, Bankhead, Broomfide, Boghead, Crofsgate, &amp;c. O- 
thers are probably derived from the Gaelic, and denote great- 
er antiquity in regard to their names, as DonibrifUe, Fordel, 
Cockairny, Lethem, &amp;c. 

Charafler of the People.*— -The people are in general fober 
and induflrious ; and, with a few exceptions, regular in at- 
tending, and paying refpect to the public inftitutions of re-

ligion. Though, In regard to the doctrines of Chriftianity, 
many of them, as in other places, are yet perhaps too fond 
pf hearing fpeculative propofitions, and abitract reafoning ; 
they alfo liften with attention to difcourfes which reprefent 
rdigion as a moral fcience, whofc doctrines and precepts are 
all calculated for the improvement of the character. Tt is 
pleafing to obferve that the colliers, who compofe a confider- 
able part of the inhabitants of the parifh, and who, in form- 
er times, were lefs enlightened and civilized, have, for a long 
while, been making progrefs in religious knowledge and mo- 
ral improvement ; and fo attentive are they to give education 
to their children, a duty formerly among this clafs of people 
too much neglected, that for many years they have mantain- 
ed a teacher by fubfeription, as they are at a great diltance 
from the parochial fchool. 

EccUfiafhcal State of the Parifh. — There is no churcli but 
the eftablifhed one in the parifh. The Seceders who refide 
in it are madly Burghers, and attend a meeting- houfe in In- 
veikeithing. The church is an old building, very much out 
of repair, and not well adapted, either in refpect of conftruc- 
tion or fituation, as a place of worfhip for the parifh ; the 
fituation is peculiarly inconvenient, being upon the court, and 
the moft populous part of the parifh almoft at the other ex- 
tremity. The manfe is about a quarter of a mile Weft from 
the church : it is alfo an old houfe, but there is a profpeft 
that another one will foon be built. The following is a lift 
of the minifters of this parifh, as far back as the Seffion re- 
cords give information- Mr Andrew Donald fon was fettled 
in 1644. Upon the jntroduaion of Epifcopacy into this, 
country, he was obliged to retire, and Mr John Corfar was 
fettled in 1669 ; Mr John Lumfdaine in 1680, and Mr George 
Gray ia 1687. After the Revolution, Mr Donaldfon, though 



of Dalgety. 



at an advanced age, was called to refume his paftoral charge* 
and continued to officiate as minifter here till the time of his 
death. It is reported, that during the time he was laid afide, 
which might be about twenty years, he lived in a building oil 
the Weft end of the church, which is now partly ufed as a 
feffion room, fupported by prefents from the parifhioners* 
and undifturbed by the above mentioned Epifcopal clergy- 
men, which does credit to the fteady attachment of the form- 
er, and to the liberality and forbearing fpirit of the latter, iri 
thofe times of intolerance and perfecution. Mr Archibald 
Campbell was fettled in 1 696 ; Mr William Henderfon in 
1717 ; Mr James Bathgate in 1738 ; Mr John Hoyes in 1778 $ 
and, upon his tranflation to another parifh, the prefent incum- 
bent was fettled in 1787. The ftipend, by a decreet grant- 
ed in the year 1650, confided of 67 bolls, 2 firlots, 3 pecks* 
and 1 lippie of grain, and 37I. 6s. $T*-d. Sterling. By an 
augmentation lately obtained, the ftipend is now raifed td 
115 bolls, 2 firlots, 3 pecks, and  lippie of grain, and 42I. 
os. ^j^d. Sterling. The glebe confifts of about 12 acres; 
The Earl of Moray is patron. There are two fchools in the 
parifh, one eftablifhed and .provided with a falary, the other, 
as formerly obferved, maintained by fubfeription. With re- 
fpett to the parochial fchool, the falary, as in moft other 
places, is too fmall, being fomewhat below 7I. There is in- 
deed a profpect of its being a little increafed here, from a vo- 
luntary offer lately made ; but there is much need of a ge- 
neral increafe, not only in humanity, and it may be faid juf- 
ticC to fuch as are engaged in the practice of teaching, but 
for the fake of thofe who are to be benefited by their inftruo 
tions. It muft be admitted, that the defire of acquiring in- 
dependence and fame operates chiefly on the minds of men 
in regard to the choice of their purfuits in life ; and in the 
improved and improving ftate of things in this country,

where fo many paths lie open to thefe by following the va- 
rious arts, it is eafy to forefee, that, while the proviCon al-

general fo fmall, and inadequate to the purpofes of a decent 
maintainance, few perfons of liberal education, and poflefTed 
of that fpirit which a mind enlarged with knowledge has a 
tendency to infpire, will turn their views to a profeflion that 
may reduce them to {traits, and of courfe fink them into con- 
tempt. The difficulty of obtaining proper teachers in count- 
ry fchools begins already to be felt ; and it is much to be fear- 
ed that learning will foon come to decline, if encouragement 
be not given to fit perfons to diftufe and promote its growth. 
Many who at prefent fubmit to this laborious talk, cannot 
earn more than a daily labourer ; and mull not the rifing ge- 
neration and pofterity fuffer in an education conducted by 
thofe, who may hereafter turn their thoughts to fuch an un- 
gainful profeflion ? Ignorance, among the bulk of the people, 
would certainly be attended with the moft pernicious effects, 
and it is to be hoped that all who are interefted in the ho- 
nour and welfare of their country, will have difcernment to 
forefee, and patriotifm to guard againfl, fuch an evil before it 
comes to any alarming height : and what can contribute 
more fuccefsfully to this beneficial purpofe, than to encou- 
rage the diffufion of knowledge by competent rewards ? 

State of the Poor. — There have been ufually, of late, i o or 
1 2 perfons upon the poors roll, who receive aid from the 
weekly collections, and from the interefl of 130I. arifing 
from legacies appropriated for their fupport. In the year 
1783, the heritors and feffion bought 60 bolls of oatmeal, 
part of which was given to families in indigent circumftan- 
•ces, and the reft fold to others that were lefs needy, at re- 
duced 



of Dalgety. 



duced prices, which contributed much to the relief of the 
parifli, during the fcarcity which then prevailed. 

Mifcellanecus Ofcrvations.—'The parifli, as was before ob- 
fcived, extends along the Forth about three miles ; and the 
banks are in many places fo beautifully fkirted with trees, 
and diverfified with fuch a variety of profpecls, both of na- 
ture and art, as prefent many fcenes truly pifturefque and 
fublime. There is alfo a fmall loch at Otterfton, about a 
mile from the coaft, which for its Situation is univerfally ad- 
mired ; on its banks ftand three gentlemen's houfes, two of 
which are ftill inhabited ; and it is fo furrounded with rifing. 
ground and trees, as to furnifh a pleafing miniature fcene. 
There are few antiquities in the parifli, and concerning thole 
which are, fuch as the remains of what is fuppofed to have 
bee:i a camp, a Druidical temple, and one of thofe marks 
commonly called a Standing Stone, there is no confident tra- 
dition, nor certain account. The houfe of Donibriftle. was 
formerly the refidence of the Abbot of St Combe, but it has 
fince been greatly enlarged and improved. Oppofite to the 
eaftern extremity of the parifli, and within a. mile of the fhore, 
is the ifland of St Combe, the defcription of which, and of 
the monaftery upon it, have been given in the Statistical Ac- 
couut of the parifh of Aberdour. The Earl of Dunfermline's 
feat formerly flood at a little diftance from the church of Dal- 
gety, but little of it now remains. The church itfelf is a very 
ancient building. The exaft period of its erection cannot be 
afcertained j but there are documents which fhow that a 
grant of the ground on which it Hands, was made to the 
Abbot of St Combe, as far back as the 14th century. Ad- 
ditions however have been made to it, which bear the marks 
of a later date,

Trade. — There is no particular branch of trade in the pa- 
rifh, except what arifes from the coal and fait works, carried 
on to a confiderahle extent on the property of Sir John Hen - 
derfon. The various branches of thefe works afford main- 
tenance to feveral hundred people of one defcription or o- 
ther. The greateft part of the coal and fait is exported from 
St Davids, a fpacious harbour fituated-at the Weftern ex- 
tremity of the parifh in Inverkeithing bay, where veffels of a- 
ny burthen, not exceeding 500 or 600 tons, can load in fafety. 
The diftance from the pits to the fhore is near 4 miles, a- 
long which the coals are carried in waggons that contain 48 
cwt. It is well afcertained, that this coal has been known 
and wrought for upwards of 200 year8, and a confiderable 
field of it ftill remains. The furrounding diftiitt, lying in 
the parifhes of Dunfermline and Aberdour, contains alfo ma- 
ny feams of coal of an excellent quality, fufficient it is thought, 
to fupply the ufual demand for centuries to come.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2682379">BALDERNOCK</name> 

(Presbytery of Dunbarton, County of Stirling, 
nop of Glasgow and Ayr.) 

By the Rev. Mr, James Cooper, Mimjler.</head>

<p>

Name. 

In the beginning of the reign of Alexander the II. the 
lands of Cartonbenach were conveyed to Maurice Galbraith 
by charter from Malduin Earl of Lennox. Soon after, in 
the year 1238, we find the fame barony granted by a new- 
charter, under the name of Bathernock, to Arthur fon of 
Maurice Galbraith, with power to feize and condemn male- 
factors, on condition that the convicts fhould be hanged on 
the Earl's gallows. From the Galbraiths of Bathernock, 
chiefs of the name, defqended the Galbraiths of Culcruich, 
Greenock, Killearn, and Balgair, which eftates have all, ex- 
cept the laft, pafled, by females, long ago into families of o- 
ther names. The family of Bathernock ended alfo in an 
heirefs, and the eftate, about the beginning of the 14th cen- 
tury, pafled by marriage to David, fon of Lord Hamilton, 

and

and anceftor of the prefent John Hamilton, Eft]; of Bar- 
dowie. From that time, the proprietor of the barony ap- 
pears to have taken the title of Bardowie ; and the title of 
Bathernock (now written Baldernock,) dropped by the fami- 
ly, was probably revived and perpetuated by bellowing it on 
the pari lb, when it came to be erected. But when that 
erection took place, or when the name Bathernock came to 
be written Baldernock, as at prefent, is uncertain. If a con- 
jecture may be hazarded with refpecl to the name, we fhould 
rather fuppofe, that Baldernock was not a new name, but 
the original one revived, of which Bathernock was a corrup- 
tion ; and that Baldernock is alfo a corruption of Baldruin- 
ich, (/. e. Druidllown) it being highly probable, that this was 
a Druidical place of worfhip, as will appear from a remark- 
able monument of Druidifm to be mentioned afterwards. 

Situation and Surface. — It it is fituated within the county 
Stirling, in the presbytery of Dunbarton, and fynod of Glaf- 
and Ayr. The furface is various. On the South, where it 
is bounded by the river Kelvin, there are fix or feven hun- 
dred acres of rich flat land. The inundations of this river 
frequently blafted the hopes of the husbandman, by dam- 
maging, or fvveeping away his luxuriant crops. To prevent 
fueh difafters, the proprietors, about 16 or 18 years ago, united 
in raffing a bank upon the brink of the river : but there are 
feafons ftill, when it breaks over, or burfta through its bar- 
riers, to refume for a little its former defolating fway. From 
South to North there is a gradual afcent, pleafantly divcrfi- 
fied by round fwelling hills. The flat ground, before men- 
tioned, is a rich loam ; the rifing grounds towards the Eaft, 
are a clayey foil over till ; and thofe towards the Weft, a 
a light fharp foil over whin rock. On the North fide there 
U fome moorifh ground, hut the greater pare of the parifh is 

arable.

arable. Towards the South Weft lyes Bardowie Loch, cov- 
ering about 70 acres. In it are plenty of pike and perch, of 
a good fize and quality. The banks are pleafant, upon which 
is fituated the houfe of Bardowie, within a few paces of the 
lake. 

CAlmaie and Difeafcs.— -The air, on the high grounds efpe- 
cially, is extremely falubrious, and the inhabitants healthy. 
There are no difeafcs uncommon, or peculiar to the place, 
nor any, for a long time part, that could be called epidemi- 
cal, unlefs we mould rank flow fevers under this clafs. They 
make their appearance fometimes in the fpring, but more fre- 
quently in the autumn, and fpread through whole families, 
and from family to family. This is obftrved to happen chief- 
ly among thofe whofe houfes are fmall, dirty, and not pro- 
perly ventilated. It is to be regretted that the abfurd, and 
not altogether innocent practice, of expofing themfelves and 
their families, by unneceflary vifits to thofe who have been 
feized with this infectious difeafe, but too much prevails. 
And it is alfo a fubje£i of juft regret, that the prejudice a- 
gainft innoculation of the fmall-pox ftill keeps hold of the 
minds of many in this part of the conntry. The poor child- 
ren are thereby expefed to the danger of that difeafe in what 
they call the natural way •, but the innoculation is equally 
well entitled to be called the natural way. The one way 
differs from the other in this only, that, by the innoculation, 
the infection is, by the tender and prudent care of the pa- 
rents, communicated in that way which, by long experience, 
has been found mod fafe and eafy ; whereas, without the ino- 
culation, the infection is, by carelefs and fupcrftitious parents, 
left to be communicated from their own cloaths after vifiting 
children under the difeafe, or by accidental intercourfe of 
their children with perfons who have the infection about their

ful of fecular employments, the cultivation of the earth. 
There are 45 farmers, including 12 feuars, who cultivate

meaiurc, to be afcribed to their occupation, and to want of 
manufactures, whofe boafted benefits make but a poor com- 
penfation for their baneful influence on the morals of the 
people. 

RenUof the PariJb.-*-Thc valuation of the parifh is T 744I- 
Scots. It is not eafy to afcertain the real rent, becaufe a 
number of the proprietors cultivate their own ground \ but 
It is fuppoled that it will not be over-rated at 3000!. Ster- 
ling. Arable land is rented from 10 s. to 2I. per acre : and 
befldes their rent to the landlord, the tenants are generally 
bound by their tacks to pay all the public burdens upon the 
lands they pofl'efs. Moft of their farms are alio thirled to 
a particular mill, and pay, fome of them fo high as the 16th 
or 17th part of all the grain which they have occafion to 
grind ; a difcouragemenr. to induflry now altogether unne- 
ceflary, and which every landholder, who wifhes to advance 
the value of his property, by encouraging the induflry of his 
tenants, ought if poflible to remove. 

Mode of Cultivation. — The farms are in general fmall, in- 
clofed and fubdivided ; and the prefent race of farmers are 
fuppofcd to furpafs their fathers in Ikill and induflry. Clear- 
ing the ground of Hones, draining, levelling the inequalities 
of the furface, ftraightening the ridges, laying on lime, and 
guarding againft the common mifhke of overcropping, may 
^e'efteemed the chief improvements. The Scotch plough, 
drawn by 3, and fometimes by 4 horfes, is that in moft com- 
mon ufe. Oats and barley are the kinds of grain chiefly cultiva- 
ted. / The plough goes little before the beginning of March : 
and tire farmers feem not anxious to have the fowing of oats fi- 
lmed before the end of April, and the barley before the 20th 
of May. After liming their ground, they generally take two 

M m 2 crops

crops of oat*, and one of barley. With the barley, rye grafs 
and clover are fo'Wri, of which hay is made in the enfuing 
fumrner, and fomctimes for two fummers. They afterwards 
pafture for two or more years, as they judge requifite to 
give the ground a fufficient reft, before the fame relation 
be repeated. In the flat land?, wheat has been tried with fuc- 
cefs, and has been found to fufter lefs damage than other 
crops, by the floods, from which thefe grounds are, norwith- 
ftanding the embankment, not yet effectually fctured. Po- 
tatoes are'raifed fufficient for home confumpt, and fome to 
fpare for the Glafgow market, where they generally draw 
from 8d. to is. per water peck. From the few trials that 
have been made, there is much encouragement for the culti- 
vation of turnip. The black cattle are moftly fmall, and the 
farmers not very attentive to improve the breed of their milk 
cows. 

Roads-' — The multiplicity of roads renders it impoffible, by 
the converfion of the ftatute labour, to put them all in a pro- 
per itate of repair. It deferves therefore the attention of 
both mafters and tenants, how far the improvement of the 
countrv, and their own private intereft, might be promoted, 
bv (hutting up fome of the roads that are of leafl public uti- 
lity, and by making an extraordinary exertion for a year or 
two, to put the reft once in good repair, after which the 
road-money would be fufficient to keep them fo. A good 
turnpike road has lately been made, paffing through the fkirts 
of this parifh, from the thriving and now populous village of 
Balfrone to Glafgow. It is thought that, by directing it 
nearer the centre of this parifh, a faving of a mile and a half 
at lead might have been made in a diftance of nine miles. 

Price of Lafour and Provifi.ns. — A good ploughman re- 
ceives, befides his board, from 5I. to 7I. per half year, and a 

fervant

fervant woman from 35 to 50 flattings'. The common wages 
of a labourer are 14A per day ; and when they work at piece 
work, they generally earn from is. 6d. to as. per day. They 
are better cloathed and lodged, and in every refpea live more 
comfortably than thofe of the fame rank, half a century ago. 
Old people remember that, in their early years, there was 
not a cow killed for beef by any one in the parifh, excepting 
in gentlemen's families, and by one or two more ; but now 
there are few families that cannot attain to half a cow at 
leaf!:. The price of all kinds of provifions is -nearly the fame 
with that of the Glafgow markets. 

Eccleftqfttcal State.— -There are no families belonging to 
the Eftiblifhed church, 1 1 to the Relief, 10 to the Burghers, 
2 to the Antiburghers, 3 to the Cameronians, and 1 to the 
Bereans. 

The prefent incumbent was admitted in 1783. His pre- 
deceffors, fince the Revolution 1688, were Meffrs Wallace, 
Colquhoun, Garrick, and Taylor. The King is patron of 
the parifh. The living confifts of 63 bolls of oat-meal, 33I. 
in money, a manfe, and a glebe of io acres, whereof 7 are

laft enlargement was probably made before the beginning of 
this century, with a view to accomodate the inhabitants of 
the lands annexed by decreet 1649. The manfe was built 
about 50 years ago, and has undergone feveral repairs. 

State of the Poor. — The average number of poor in this parifh 
is about fix. They are fupported, according to their exigencies, 
in their own houfes, from the weekly collections at the church 
door, and from the intereft of a capital of 420I. which has 
: accumulated by the donations of charitable perfons, and from 
the furplus of the weekly collections. None of the poor of

this parifli are difpofcd to beg, either in this or neighbouring 
parifhes ; but much, is given away by the inhabitants in alms 
to beggars which fwarm from other places, especially from 
manufacturing towns and villages. 

Minerals and Fuel. — This parifli abounds in coal and lime- 
ftone. The coal refembles that of Newcaftle, caking toge- 
ther, and making a ftrong fire, when properly put on, and al- 
lowed to reft three or four hours before it be ftirred. It i3 
•generally found in a ftratum of from 3 to 4! feet thick, be- 
tween two ftrata of lime-Hones. The upper ftratum of lime- 
ftone is called the blue lime, and the lower the white I/me, 
which laft has generally been efteemed of an inferior quality 
to the blue. Thefe ufeful minerals, in places where there is 
no great rhicknefs of ftrata above them, are come at by re- 
moving the fuperincumbent foil : but where they lie. deep, 
the coal is wrought firft by miners, and afterwards the up- 
per or blue lime is feparated from the roof by wedges or 
gunpowder. The coals are fold at the pit for 3d. per hutch, 
five of which may be drawn in a cart, by an ordinary horfe, 
and fix by an able bodied horfe. The only coal in the pa- 
rifli wrought for fuel, is the property of Robert Dunmore, 
Efq; of Ballindalloch, whofe exertions for the improvement 
of his own eftate, and of the country in general, cannot be 
mentioned with too much praife. He works the lime alfo to 
a very ccnfiderable extent. Befules his, there are three other 
limeworks going in the parifli, but upon a fmallcr fcale ; and 
there is lime-flone, more or lefs, through almoft all the high 
grounds. In it are found petrified fliells of a variety of kinds, 
ftimulating the conjectures of naturalifts concerning the re- 
volutions of this globe. There is abundance of freeftonc of 
a good quality for building, and a little iron-Rone ; but, at 
the place where it hath been obferved, the ftratum is fo thin 

as,

as not to be worth working. A fmall rivulet in the Eaft end 
of the parifh. makes a very plentiful depofition of ochre, 
which, if proper means were ufed to colled it, might turn to 
fome account. Peats can eafily be procured for fuel, but 
few of them are ufed, the coals being found lefs coftly. 
A confiderable quantity of them was formerly required by 
the farmers for kiln-drying their vi&amp;ual ; but by the introduc- 
tion of kilns with brick heads, they have become lefs neceffa- 
ry, coals anfwering the purpofe equally well. 

Antiatihics. — Upon the high ground, in a commanding 
fituation, at the North Weft corner of the parifh, ftands an 
Old ruinous tower, being all that now remains of the manfion 
houfe of the Galbraiths of Bathernock, which appears to 
have been a large building furrounded with a ditch. Its an- 
tiquity muft be very confiderable, but how great, even tra- 
dition does not venture to determine. Not far from thence, 
to the eaftward, are feveral of thofe large loofe heaps of ftones 
called Cairns, fome of them oblong, and others of a circular 
fhape. One of the circular ones, which has not yet been 
broken up, is about 80 yards in circumference. From two 
that have been broken up, it appears that they are compofed 
of loofe ftones carelefsly thrown together ; but at the bottom 
are . large flags placed on edge, in two parallel rows, at the 
diftance of between 3 or 4 feet, lidded over with flags laid 
acrofs, the cavity thus formed is divided by partitions into 
cells of 6 or 7 feet long. In one of the long cairns lately 
broken up, were found feveral fragments of a large coarfely 
fabricated urn, and fome pieces of human bones. Tradition 
fays, that in this place, called Craigmadden moor, a battle / 
was fought with the Danes, in which one of their prirrces'was 
flain. The farm in which thefe cairns are, is named Bloch- 
airn, 1 which may be a corruption of Balcairn, u e. the town 

of

of the cairns. But the rrioft curious remain of antiquity in 
this parifh, is a ftrudture called the Auld wife's lift. It is fituat- 
cd near a mile North from the church, on very high ground, 
in a little fl.\t of about i oc paces diameter, furrounded by an af- 
cent of a few yards in height, in the form of an amphitheatre. 
It confifts of three ftones only, two of which, of a prifmatic 
{haps, are laid along clofe by each other upon the earth ; 
and the third, which was once probably a regular paralelio- 
piped, and (till, notwithftanding the depredations of time, 
approaches that figure, is laid above the other two. The 
uppermoft (tone is l 8 feet long, 1 1 broad, and 6 deep, plac- 
ed nearly horizontally with a fmall dip to the North. Its 
two fupporters are about the fame fize. It can hardly be 
matter of doubt, that this is one of thefe rude ftru£tures 
erected by the Druids in their facred groves. Its f.tuation, 
in a very fequeftered fpot, on an eminence, furrounded by a 
grove of oaks, ftumpsof which trees are fhill vifible,correfpond$ 
exactly to every defcription we have of thefe places of wor- 
fliip. The figure of the ftones themfelves, and their pofition, 
bear a ftrong refemblance to others which antiquarians have 
not hefitated to pronounce monuments of Druidifm. The 
name "by which they are called feems no fmall confirmation 
of the truth of this opinion. A Druidical ftone in Ireland, 
mentioned by Cambden, is called the lifted ftone ; snd there 
are fome in Poitiers in France, known by the name of Pier- 
res levees. But befides that the ftones under confideration 
have the name of lift, which appears to be the general ap- 
pellation of fuch Druidical ftofies, the fpecificpart of their 
name, viz. Auld wives, is eafiiy accounted for, on the fame 
fuppofition. Upon the authority of Tacitus and Mela, we 
know that female Druids, generally pretty far advanced in 
years, lived together in fifterhoods, in fequeftered fpots, de- 
voting their time to the offices of the Druidical worfhip. 

Thefe 



of ' Balder ?wck. 28 i 

Thefe were by the people held in high efteem, and called Send; 
or venerable ivsmen, words nearly fynonymous to the Scots 
word Auld wives. Hence we are induced to conclude, that this 
is one of thofe lifted ftones, Pierres levees ; and that it is called 
the Auldwive's lift, becaufe it was the lifted ftone where 
the Sense, or fifterhood of venerable female Druids refiding 
here, paid their devotions- 'Upon the fuppofition, alfo, that 
this was a feat of the Druid worlhip, we have fuggefted to 
us a very probable etymology of the name of the parifh. Bal t 
in the Gaelic language fignifies town, and Druinich, of or 
belonging to the Druids. The prefent name, Baldernock, is-' 
not a greater corruption of Baldruinich, i. e. Druidftown, 
than might be expected in the lapfe of eighteen hundred 
years.

Situation and Extent. 

TThE parifh of Longftde is fituated in that diftri£t of A 
berdeen-fhire called Buchan. It is an irregular fquare, of a- 
bont 5 Englifh miles, and is bounded, on the North, by the 
parifhes of Old Deer and Lonmay \ on the Eaft, by thofe of 
St. Fergus and Peterhead ; on the South by Cruden ; and 
on the Weft by Old Deer. It is, like Buchan in general, 
very level j there being no hill of any confequence in the pa- 
rifh. As a proof of this, it may be mentioned, that the 
Ugie, which divides it in the direction of W. and E. fre- 
qnently overflows the adjoining ground to a very confider- 
able extent, from almoft one fide of the parifh to the other ; 
and, in the hands of our neighbours in the Netherlands, 
would be embanked like the Maefe or the Rhine. This has

provement of a very valuable diftri£L It is, in genera], a 
light foil, eafily improved, and lying at the diftance of only 
from 4 to 9 miles from Peterhead, enjoys almoft every ad- 
vantage for the exportation of its produce, and the importa- 
tion of lime, coals, and other necefiary articles.

The prefent ftate of the parifh, as well as its fufceptibility 
of farther improvement, may be inferred from the following

the parifli. The remainder are mafons, taylors, Sec. &amp;c. 
xUmoft all have a few acres of ground, which they cultivate, 
at the fame time that they purfue their other occupations. 
From this circumftance, it may be inferred, that the different 
branches of labour above enumerated are ftiil in an unim- 
proved ftate. Some approaches, however, towards a regular 
divifion and fimplification of labour have been made of late ; 
particularly at Nether Kitimundy ; which will be mentioned 
afterwards. 

From an infpect.ion of the regifler of births, marriages, and 
deaths, for 6 years, from the year i 783, it appears that the 
average of baptifms, during that period, is 29 ; that the male 
births are to the female as 4 to 3 ; that the average of pa- 
xifhioners married in the above period, is only 21 ; that the 
average of burials is 20 ; that the whole nu.nb.-er of inte r- 
ments, including perfons brought from neighbouring pariihes, 
is 208 ; whofe ages amount to 9444 years •, and that of con- 
fequence the average of an age is fomewhat more than 45. 

Agriculture. — When I fay that ico families and upwards 
are employed in farming, or that there are ico farms in the 
parifh, it will readily be inferred that many of thefe farms 
muft be fmall : And when this is the cafe, it is impoflible 
that lands can be improved to any confiderable extent. Many 
pf them are what are called crofts j which do not admit of 
the tenants having a plough. Two, or three, and fometimes 
four, are obliged to join for this purpofe : which is, in other 
words, faying, that the work is ill-performed, and at a great 
expence of time and labour. No fimplification of the differ- 
ent branches of agriculture can be accomplifhed in a very 
fmall fcalei - And yet, when this is not done,— when one

or dexterity can be expeeled on his part, and little profit on 
the part of the employer. The number of acres in the pa- 
rilh amount to about 12,000, (rented for little more than 
aoool. Sterling) of which above 7000 are at prcfent in a 
ftate of cultivation ; 1800 are mofs, (a confiderable part of 
it very deep) only 257 are planted ; and the remainder is 
uncultivated. Though there is but a fmall proportion which 
is not fufceptible of cultivation, yet, owing to the impro- 
per modes of agriculture adopted, perhaps 3000 bolls of oat- 
gneal and bear are ali that are exported annually ; and the 
whole produce not much above 7000 bolls. Suppofing the 
attention of farmers and proprietors confined to the 7000 
acres above-mentioned, and no more than 3500 to be under 
a grain crop ; fiom 15,000 to 20,000 bolls, at leaft, might 
.be realonably expected under a judicious plan of manage- 
ment. A perfon interefted in the welfare of the country 
muft be hurt, when he remarks the ftate of our corn farm- 
ing ; fields ploughed, from which fcarcely twice the feed can 
be expected, and fpecies of grain fometitnes growing, which 
require two bolls to produce one of meal. Nor will he be 
lefs hurt, when he remarks the neceffary confequences of 
this management with regard to hay and pafture ; extenfive 
ranges of country, where thefe ought to be found in great 
abundance, yielding a fcanty fubfiftence to a few fheep. 

The parifh is divided among fix heritors. Nearly the half 
belongs to one of themf. And by granting no leafes for 
many years paft, he has at prefent much in his power, with 
regard to new-modelling his farms, and puting them upon a 
proper footing. With this view, he has paid particular at- 
tention to the different modes of farming, both in England 
and in the South of Scotland. But to introduce fo complete 
a change as either of thefe modes, all at once, (if at all prac- 
ticable)

ticable) is attended with great difficulties : and gradual re- 
formation is perhaps here, as well as in mod other depart- 
ments of human labour, the preferable plan. 

From the obfervations already made, it is evident that we 
ftand much in need of improvement. If the fmall farms 
could be united, and many of the prefent pofTeflurs of them 
converted into day-labourers, under tenants who could afford 
them conftant employment ; and if a few tenants from the 
Southern counties, of fubftance and knowledge, were encou- 
raged to fettle, as patterns to our native tenants \ both claf- 
fes would be benefited, and live infinitely better than thsfe 
do. at prefent. Proprietors ought at lead to have this in 
view, if they wifti to fee their eftates improved, or the ten-, 
ants on them comfortable. It admits of proof, notwithstand- 
ing the complaints which we frequently hear of the difficul- 
ty of finding fervants, and of the unjuft preference which 
is given to manufactures, that there are inhabitants fufficient 
in the country for the purpofes of its improvement, if a cer- 
tain indolence and want of fpring (which is one of the cha- 
racteriftic features in the lower ranks in this part of the 
kingdom) could, by proper motives and encouragements, be 
removed : And this depends on landlords, and on the choice 
which they make of tenants. 

Befides the 3000 bolls of grain already mentioned, about 
300 black cattle are exported annually j and butter, cheefe, 
and eggs, to the amount of about ioool. Sterling. The prices 
of the laft mentioned articles are from 6d. to 8d. for 20 
ounces of butter; from 3s. to 4s. for the ftone of cheefe ; 
and from 2d. to fid. for the dozen of eggs.

the thread-manufaaures in Peterhead, a manufacture of 
Woollen cloth at Nether-Kinmttndy (the property of Francis 
Garden of Troup, Efq;) has, of late, become very confider- 
able for an infant ma'nufaaure. It is conduaed by Meffrs 
Thomas 55 s Robert Kilgour, and deferves to be particularly 
mentioned. 

About 40 families are employed by them conftantly ; to 
whom they give houfes and gardens. But far the greater 
number whom they employ, are fcattered in this and the 
neighbouring parifhes, and work for the company only occa- 
fionally. The articles manufaaured here are narrow cloths, 
from 2s. 3d. to. 5s. per yard j and jemmys from is. id. to is. 
6d. per yard. They are ufed moftly at home. For the 
higher priced fort of narrow cloths, the demand is daily in- 
creafing. Men, thus employed, earn from 4s. to 10s. a-week; 
and women from is. 6d. to 3d. And in this manner about 
2000I. Sterling is difburfed annually. It is with pleafure 
the writer of the present article adds, from his own obferva- 
tion, as well as from the exprefs teftimony of their employ- 
ers, that both men and women are peaceable, fober, and at- 
tentive. As a proof of this, it deferves to be mentioned, 
that during the fpace of 1 5 years, not a fingle perfon has 
been difmuTed. Living in a healthy county, and not crowd- 
ed together, as in towns ; and having, moreover, all gardens 
for the employment of their fpare hours, they, in general, en- 
joy good health, and have numerous families. Of late, the 
labour of carding, teafing, Sec. has been much facilitated by 
the introduaion of machinery moved by water. The raw 
materials are brought from the N. of England, and not un- 
frequently from the London market. 

Religious Seels and Principles. — Public inftitutions, whe- 
ther religious or civil, are fertile fources of moral principles.

Statijlical Account 



In this parifli, neither our civil, nor our ecclefiaftical efta- 
Llifhments have been without their effect. The inhabitants 
are peaceable and good fubjecb ; and the fpirit of our reli- 
gion is, in general, underftood arid felt to be, what it ever 
ought to be, a -fupport to found morality. An oppofition be- 
tween fpeculation and practical religion, is a common error 
among the more unenlightened ranks of every country. Its in- 
fluence is in fome degree felt here. But a more rational fpi- 
rit feems to be gaining ground. With regard to forms, and 
opinions of Jecondary importance, the parifh has been long 
divided ; and where this happens, fome degree of illiberali- 
ty is to be looked for. In the year 1 790, the writer of this 
article found 908 belonging to the Eftablifhed Church ; 723 
belonging to the Epifcopal Church of Scotland, and 85 to 
the Church of England ; 63 were Seceders ; 6 were Roman 
Catholics j and the remainiug 7 were either infane, or be- 
longed to no religious community. But, in general, all 
thefe feels maintain a peaceable and friendly intercourfe with 
one another. It might gratify curiofity, and illuftrate fome 
of the leading principles in human nature, to trace the ope- 
ration of thofe caufes which have concurred to produce fo 
great a number of Epifcopals in this and in fome of the 
neighbouring parifhes. But fuch an equiry would fwell this 
part of the Statiftical Account too much. It may be ob- 
ferved, in general, that, as the lower ranks are incapable of 
forming religious creeds, which can Hand the teft, even of 
their own refleaions, for any length of time, we muft look 
for the caufes of a long eftablifhed attachment to opinions 
and forms, in the influence of authority, mtereft, and habit. 
If oppofition and perfecution unhappily lend their aid to that 
influence, impartiality is generally banifhed, and the effect: be- 
comes much ftronger.

fhe weekly collections, and the intereft of a fmall fum, be- 
gun by charitable donations, and encreafed by an ceconomi- 
tal management, particularly during years when the necef- 
faries of life were eafily acquired ; about 20 1. Sterling is 
diftributed annually among about 30 families, but is, by no 
means, found fufficient to affilt induftry in procuring a com- 
fortable fubfiftence :— With no other view ought money to be 
given ; and with this, a very fmall fum will do more fervice 
than ten times its value, when it is depended on as a fubfti- 
tute for induftry. Of the 20 1. above mentioned, 5 1. Ster- 
ling is given annually by one of the heritors* 5 and the dif- 
tribution of it is confined to the poor on his own eftates - 
— A practice which deferves to be imitated j paniCularly in 
a parifh where, in the prefent cafe, there is not a fingle re- 
fident heritor to attend to the wants of the poor in extraor- 
dinary cafes. N. B. The members of the epifcopal congre- 
gation fupport their own poor. 

Manfe, Stipend, School, Isfc. — The parifh of Longfide was 
erected in the year 1620, from the parifhes of Peterhead 
and Crimond ; with which laft mentioned parifh there 
feems to have been formerly a communication in the N. E. 
corner, where now the parifhes of St Fergus and Lonmay 
meet each other. The original ftipend was 1 20 h Scots, 
zrti 400 merks of vicarage teinds, which are Hill drawn by 
the minifter, but do not produce above 260 merks. In 1668, 
It was augmented with 4 chalders of grain ; and, in 1791, 
with 3 chalders more, and b Scots' for communi6n elements. 
At the time of the laft mentioned augmentation, an appli- 
cation was made to have the vicarage teinds converted on ac- 
count of the deficiency above mentioned, and the difagreeable"

eumftances attending their collection (circumflances fre- 
quently incompatible with' the ufefufnefe of a clergyman,) 
but failed. 

The family of Marifchall, which had formerly very confi- 
derable property in the p.-.rifh, were the original patrons ; pro- 
bably in confluence of the canonical rule ; Patromimfa- 
ciunt, dos, aed'ifuatio, fundus. The Tight of prefenting is now- 
annexed to the Crown. The prefent incumbent has no 
manfej but receives* in lieu of it an annuity from the heritors. 
The original church full remains ; but has been repaired at 
different times. 

Under this head, the fituation of the fchool ought to be 
mentioned as being (the writer of the prefent article would 
gladly hope finguiar. The falary is only nine bolls of meal ; 
which the fchoolmaHer has to collect from the tenants in 
very fmall quantities, and of confequence at a great lofs. The 
emoluments arifing from teaching, owing to the very low 
price of education, (for die fchool mailer is acknowledged to 
be well qualified for his offi e) are, at an average of eight 
years, 4 1. 6s. 7d. a year. Peiquifites arifing from his offices, 
as precenter and clerk to the lemon, do not exceed 4 1. Ster- 
ling Of confequence, his whole living does not amount to 
more than til. Sterling annually, a fum not equal to the 
wages of an ordinary farm-fervant. When it is confidered 
of how much confluence it is to fociety (particularly, at a 
period when the principles of the lower ranks are of infini- 
tely more confequence to its welfare than ever they were be- 
fore,) to have perfons properly qualified for the education of 
youth appointed in the different parifhes, the circumibneeg 
above mentioned feem to demand attention from heritors, 
and others whom the law authorifes to provide fur the pro

Planting. — The want of woods and fhelter in lliis corner of 
Aberdeenlhire, is one of the circumftances which feems tQ 
operate moft powerfully to its dif.idv -image, in the opinion 
of our fouthern neighbours. Such txtenfive tracts of count- 
ry as thofe of Cruden, Longfide, Peterhead s &amp;c. without 
either trees or hedges to diverlify the landfcape, are, to be 
fure, not very gr itifying to the eye. And this famenefs is the 
more to lie regretted, that the fields are far from conveying 
the idea of barrennefs, ;;iid that nature by no means intended 
them to be thus n ked and unprotected. It is very evident 
that Buchan was, fome centuries ago, remarkably well wood- 
ed. Its extenfive moffes contain tiie remains of very rrag- 
nificent trees. No good reafon, therefore, can be afiigned 
for the fame firts of wood not thriving in it again, if judiciouf- 
ly managed. But few attempts • comparatively fpe.'king) 
have been made to renew its woods j. and thofe which have 
been made, have in general been confined to the hilly and 
moft barren parts of the country j where the plants have not 
only had no fhelter, but little foil to bring them forward. It 
deferves attention, that in the mofles, where fo many trunk* 
of large trees arc every year dug up, none of the Scotch firs 
are ever found. Yet this is the tree which has generally 
been planted. It commonly rifes to a fufficient height to af- 
ford flielter to other plants j and this feems to be all that 
ought to be expected. There are feveral inftances in the pa- 
rifh, of the afli, the plane, the birch, laburnum, larch, fpruce, 
and even the oaks thriving well, if we make allowance for 
the difadvantages under which they labour, with regard to 
fhelter. The only plantation of any confequence in the pa- 
jilh, is one of about 250 acres ; to which the above obferva- 
tions are very applicable. When the interftices between the 
Scotch firs fhall be filled up with other trees more fuited to

the .different foils, and Home of the wet places drained, (which 
is the intention of the proprietor,) fome hopes may be en- 
tertained of Ins fuccefs in wiping off the reproach of naked- 
nefs from this part of the parifh. 



Leafes and Rents. — I have already mentioned, that a con- 
siderable part of the parifh is held without leafes. The ten- 
ants, who have any, generally have life-rent ones ; and fcarce- 
ly any have more than 19 years. When this circumftance 
is confidered, and at the fame time the fmallnefs of the farms, 
the backward ftate of improvement will be eafily accounted 
for. The rents are generally paid in meal and money ; be- 
des which, there ftill remain fome reliques of the ancient 
feudal fervitudes, under the name of cuftoms \ fuch as the 
payment of peats, poultry, a certain number of day-labour- 
ers, &amp;c. 

Mofs. — Erom the great extent of mofs, it will readily be 
inferred that fuel is to be had in great abundance. In ge- 
neral it is fo. But when it is confider,ed, how much of the 
beft feafon of the year is fpent in preparing it, how difficult 
it is to be obtained in rainy feafons, and how ill provided, 
particular eftates are with this neceffary article ; the wile po- 
licy of repealing the late high duties on coals will appear 
evident. 

Natural Hijlory. — Under the head of natural hiftory, may 
be mentioned various forts of granite, with which the parifh 
abounds. A very beautiful fpecies of a dark blue colour is 
found in the N. E. corner of it, which appears to great ad- 
vantage in a very elegant houfe building by one of the heri- 
tors 



of Longjide. 



tors * at Cairnefs, in the parifli of Lonmay. Another fpecies 
of a lighter colour, but alfo very beautiful, is found at Cairn- 
gall ; frequent fpecimens of which are to be feen in London 
and other parts of England. Of both fpecies very large 
pieces are frequently cut out, fit for pillars of 12 and 15, and 
fometimes 20 feet high. Their hardnefs, however, renders 
them unfit for any, except the plainer orders of architecture, 

Difeafes. — About 3 years ago, the putrid fore throat cut 
off a good many (principally young perfons) ; in fome in- 
ftances 4 out of a family. Gravelifti complaints are alfo fre- 
quent, which perhaps may, in fome meafure, be attributed 
to the great quantities of beer ufed, and to the little pains 
taken in preparing it. Rheumatifms, too, are common. 
Frequent fogs in the fummer, arifing from the low wet 
grounds and mofles in the parifli, and fu4den changes o£ 
weather, occafioned by our peninfular fituation between the 
German Ocean, on the one hand, and the Murray Frith, on 
the other, feem to point out their caufes. £ut notwithftand- 
ing thefe mementos of frailty, the climate, on the whole, 
may be termed healthy. And though no very extraordina- 
ry inftances of longevity can be mentioned, few parifhes can 
produce a greater number of perfons above the age of four- 
fcore, 

Hiflory.— This article would be almoft entirely confined to, 
toe hiftory of private families, and of the changes which land- 
ed property has undergone in the parifh (circumftances too 
minute and uninterefting, to merit a place in a Statiftical Ac- 
count of a country) did not one part of it give fome indica- 
tions of its having been the fcene of public and natimal contejl.

This is the part of the parifh where it joins Cruden. On the 
declivity of a hill, which feparates the two pnrifhes, there 
arc ftdl vifible a great number of tumuli, or fmall cairns, in 
which are found fqu ire apartments, formed by rough {tones, 
of from i 8 inches to 2 feet, and containing ;:m.'s or red 
earth. At a fmall diftance from thefe, and nearly on the 
higheft part of the hill, is a cairn of a much larger fize, of 
an elliptical form, and meafuring in circumference about 
400 feet at its bafe. It is well known by the name of Cairn 
Catto ; and lbme traditionary legends counecT; its liiltory with 
fimilar cairns in the pariih of Cruden, and in fome of the 
neighbouring parifhes, along the Murray Frith, as well as. 
with the idea of a foreign invafion. At the bottom of the 
hill are fome fprings, known by the name of the Kemp, or 
Camp- wells ; and a little farther to the Weft, on the oppo- 
Cte rifing ground, is a field, which ftiU bears the name, of 
the Battle-jauld. 

Language. — The Burhan diaiecl has been long famous for 
the want of that neatnefs of articulation, and of that elegance 
of found and accent, by which the Southern and more culti- 
vated nations have charatterifed their refpettive languages. 
In proportion as language becomes more refined, the uncouth 
etktural is either entirely excluded, or very much foftened. 
In the Engliih and French, and indeed in all the Southern 
languages, it is not to be found. In German, Dutch, and 
Scotch, and the other northern diale&amp;s of Europe, it is con- 
ftantly recurring, and feems to point out their common ori- 
gin, independent of etymology. But where any attention has 
been paid to the cultivation of thefe dialeds, the guttural 
and harfh founds of the g and ch t have been almoft entirely 
done away, and either foftened into the refemblance of j, ot 
hardened into that of k. Any perfon will be fenfibk of this,

who has heard the pronounciation of Dutch from the mouth 
of a well educated Dutchman ; and ftill more, if he has at- 
tended the theatre at Drefden or Leipfic In this corner vvc 
Retain all the broadnefs of articulation, and, I am forry to 
add, all the vulgarity of idiom, metaphor, and accent, which 
is to be met with in any part of the world. And it is pro- 
bable that we fhall retain thefe peculiarities of language 
longer than mod places equally diftant from the capital ; be- 
caufe, except the refort of ftrangers to Peterhead, during the 
water-feafon, few vifit us 5 and, of confequencc, little of that 
intercourfe is enjoyed, by which language is fo materially af- 
fected. If the degree of mental cultivation ill a country be 
commenfurable by the ftate in which a language is found, 
(which is not a very uncommon rule) then we mull not 
ftate our pretenfions very high. But the phrafe, mental cul- 
tivation, is not very definite ; and many minds might be 
pointed out, to whole improvement their language would be 
a very imperfect index. That feleclion of agreeable meta- 
phors, and that polilh of articulation and accent, which are 
100 often confidered as the moft eflential ingredients in good 
language, are rather the effecT: of a cultivated tafle, than of 
a cultivated underftanding. And though we may be obliged 
to give up the former, it is not neceffary, on that account, to 
give up all pretenfions to the latter. On the contrary, the 
parifh contains a body of men very refpeclable for their know- 
ledge and education, if their circumftances and purfuits in 
life be properly attended to. 

Provincial Charatler. — The character of the inhabitants of 
Buchan, in general, feems to differ confiderably from thnt of 
the inhabitants of the other counties, and even of the other 
tliftrids of the fame county. They have not their livelinefs 
of imagination, nor their warmth of feeling. They feem to 

occupy 



Statijlical Account 



occupy a place in the fcale of national character nearer tne 
phlegm of Dutchmen, than the other inhabitants of Scotland 
in general. The writer of the prefent article was forcibly 
flruck with this obfervation, when he firft fettled in the pa- 
rifh ; and its truth has been confirmed by a few years expe- 
rience. He has frequently attempted to account for it. Al- 
though political inftitutions have a greater influence on 
general character than almoft any other caufe, yet the ap- 
pearance of a country operates with an uniform and unceaf- 
ing, and therefore with a very powerful effect on the minds 
of its inhabitants. And it is to this canfe that the peculiari- 
ty of character above-mentioned may, perhaps, in a great 
meafure, be afcribed. A conftant uniformity in the appear- 
ances of nature around us, gives no fcope for that violent a- 
gitation, which fo frequently takes place in the breads of 
Swifs and Scotchmen, when they contemplate their moun- 
tains, their woods, and their precipices. Our mental con- 
llitution, therefore, naturally fettles into a fpecies of Unifor- 
mity, analogous to the country which we inhabit ; and the 
lefs elevated and romantic emotions, raifed by intereft and 
mutual intercourfe, take the lead in forming the character. 
Such feems to be the cafe with the inhabitants of this corn- 
er of Scotland. The confequences are, fewer characters 
very ftrongly marked, and more difficulty in changing men- 
tal habits. In this refpect, there exifts a Itrong fimilarity be- 
tween the character of the boors in Holland, and that of the 
peafants in this part of Scotland. The latter, however, pof- 
fefs a greater (hare of general knowledge •, the former a far 
more intimate and accurate acquaintance with their own par- 
ticular department. It is between ihefe two dalles that a 
comparifon, with regard to provincial and national charac- 
ter, can be inftituted with the greateft propriety. Bocaufe

knowledge and extenfive intercourfe generally bring the high- 
er ranks nearly to a level in all countries ; except in a few par-

readily perceived that this is a fubjeft perfectly diftinct from 
that of moral and religious character, which is mentioned in 
another part of the prefent article.

Situation and Extent. 

South Ronaldfay is a populous ifland in the mod fouth- 
ern extremity of the county of Orkney, about 6 miles long 
and 3 miles broad, in which there are two parifhes, called 
South parifh and North parifh of South Ronaldfay. It proba- 
bly derives its name from Ronald, a Danifh Count, and South 
is prefixed to diftinguifh it from North Ronaldfay, the moft 
nothern ifland in Orkney. South Ronaldfay is bounded by 
the Pentland Firth on the South and Weft, by the German 
Ocean on the Eaft, and by the Ferry of Water Sound, about a 
mile broad, which divides it from Burray, on the North. 
There is a fmall ifland, about a mile long, and half a mile 
broad, called Swinna, lying near the middle of the Pentland 
Firth, containing 2 1 fouls, which makes a part of the South 
parifh South Ronaldfay. It is feparated from South Ronald- 
fay

fay by a branch of the Pentland Firth, through which (hips of 
any burden may pafs. Swinna is a barren inhofpitable ifland, 
«xpofed on all fides to the utmoft rage of the Pentland Firth. 
What probably induced any perfon at firft to dwell in it, was 
the hope of high wages, from pilotage. Though, at new 
and full moon, the tide runs againft this ifland at the rate 
of nine miles an hour, yet there are few inftances of wrecks 
on it : For the refiftance which the rocks give to the violence 
of the large current, produces a fmall current running along 
its fhore to each end of the ifland : Thus, it gives to many 
a trembling mariner a mod agreeable djfappointment. When 
the ftrong large tide carries him fo near, that he every mo- 
ment expe£ls his bowfprit to ftrike againft the rocks, and his 
veflel to fall to pieces under him, he is delightfully furprifecl 
to feel a current coming from Swinna, which turns him a • 
bout in a moment, and fafely conduces him round its terri- 
fying rocks. 

Burray is an ifland about 4 miles long and one mile broad, 
bounded by Water Sound on the South ; Holm Sound, 3 miles 
broad, which feparates it from the partfli of Holm, on the 
North ; and the German Ocean on the EahV. Thefe pafifhes 
are a part of the presbytery of Kirkwall, and fynod of Ork- 
ney. Befides the three inhabited iflands above mentioned, 
there are, within the bounds of thefe parifhes, three uninha- 
bited green iflands called Glemfholm, Horda, near Burray, 
and Pentland Skerry, about 6 miles South from South Ron- 
aldfay, near the middle of the Eaft end of the Pentland 
Firth, On thefe ifles, each of which is about a mile long, 
and half a mile broad, fheep and cattle are fed. There is a 
light-houfe to be ereded this year on the Pentland Skerry, 
which will unqueftionably be attended with manifold advan- 
tages to the fbipping, coming to the Pentland Firth, through 

Q q * which

which, it is computed, there pafs, at an average, nine vcffcls 
daily. Near this Pentland Skerry, there are two or three 
other fkerries or rocks, on which there is not nour;fhment 
for any tame living creature. 

Soil and Produce. — The arable ground in thefe ides is fituated 
along the fhores. The foil in Swinna is (hallow, compofed of 
fome black earth, gravel, and fand. The foil of Burray may, 
in general, be called a light dry fand, mixed in a few places 
with fome coarfe clay. In the month of July, the bear and 
oats in it promife a rich crop ; but in Augult or September, 
when the ear demands a greater degree of nourifhment, it is 
refufed ; the confluence of which is, that the grain is ill fil- 
led, fmall, and hungry But in no part, perhaps of the king- 
dom, can there be feen a richer or more beautiful crop of 
natural grafs mixed with white and red clover. Potatoes, 
turnips, peafe, onions, carrots, cabbages, grow on it to great 
perfection. It is the fole property of Sir Thomas Dundas, 
and it is let in tacks to his factor, who has very much im- 
proved his breed of cattle, by raifing a great abundance of as 
excellent turnips as can be found in Scotland- Glimfholm, 
and particularly Burray, abounds with rabbits. It is com- 
puted, that they produce annually about 2000 fkins. The 
foil of South Ronaldfay is extremely various in different 
parts of the ifland, and even different in the fame field. It 
confifts of clay, black loams, fand, and mofs. In fome pla- 
ces, the foil is of an excellent quality, but almoft every where 
fhallow. In all the Orkney ifles, the plough generally touches 
a rocky or gravelly bottom. For want of inclofurers, there 
is no fown grafs :-^But large quantities of ground have, from 
time immemorial, been left to produce natural grafs, on 
which the horfes and cattle are tied throughout the fum- 

mcr,

mer, a part being referved for natural hay, which is ufed in 
•winter and fpring. 

Pre/cut State of Agriculture. — In thefe ifles farming is in a 
very rude ftate indeed. The hand of art gives little affift- 
tance to that nature. Almoft every farmer is a fifher, and 
a kelp manufacturer. The fame man may be feen, in a Ju- 
ly morning, carrying earth to his dunghill ; in the forenoon, 
catching filh in the fea ; and, in the afternoon, burning kelp 
on the more. Some of the pooreft people dig their ground 
with a bit of iron about 3 inches broad, fixed on the end of 
a long ftick. Fallowing is not ufed : there is no change of 
feed : there is no proper rotation of crops. Small bear or 
big, and black oats, have been fown alternately on the fame 
field for feveral hundred years. The feed-oats never enter 
into a riddle, but are held up to the wind either in a man's 
hands, or in a creel, called a cofie, made of draw. The 
bear feed is put through a riddle, but the fmall grains are 
not feparated from it with any degree of care. Every far- 
mer has a ridge of potatoes, which he plants with fkill, and 
weeds with great care ; and he is abundantly repaid. One 
half of his farm is fown with oats, which being generally 
full of weeds, gives a very poor return ; the other half with 
bear, which, being manured with plenty of rich farm dung 
or fea-weed, yields a tolerable crop. The plough has two 
ftilts, and is drawn by four horfes yoked in pairs. Many of 
the farmers ufe harrows with wooden teeth, which are drawn 
not diagonally, but with the broad fide foremoft, by a rope 
fixed in the middle of the harrow- The plough, which is 
fo light that a man can lift it in his hand with eafe, turns the 
ground very imperfectly. It requires all the ploughman's 
itrength to keep it in the ground. And the force which he 

applies 



Statijtical Account 



applies for this purpofe, occafions as hard a pull to the horfeg 
as if the plough was of a heavier make. If two or three hor- 
fes or oxen be yoked in the harrows, there is a pcrfon ap- 
pointed to lead each horfe or ox. Sometimes the horfes, 
and fometimcs the women, carry out on their backs, in creels 
made of draw, called cafies, the dung to the fields. Though 
the poll goes weekly South and North through thefe pariflies 
of Ronald fay and Burray, yet there never was a road made, 
in either. Of coufequence few carts are ufed. It is no un- 
common thing to fee fix perfons with fix horfes, carrying to 
the mill three bolls of bear. 

The tenants in general are tenants at will. South Ro- 
naldfay belongs to 33 different proprietors, few of whom re- 
fide in it. In the mixture of their property, there is a kind 
of regular confufion, "which bids defiance to inclofures, and 
ftifles the very idea of improvement. In winter, the horfes 
and cattle wander through, and poach the fields, and many 
hundreds of hogs are digging holes and ditches in them, and 
in the meadow ground, by night and by day, Some farm- 
ers in Burray fowed fomc of their fields about two years a- 
go with oats, without any other ploughing than what they 
received from the nofes of the hogs. And they were of o- 
pinion, that as it was a light fandy foil, they had a better crop, 
and fewer weeds, than if they had turned it up with the 
plough. The feafon for fovving oats is generally in April, 
for bear in May; and they are reaped in September and Oc- 
tober. Amidft all the errors in farming already mentioned, 
there is one practice in harveft prevails in thefe parithes, 
which the writer gladly begs leave to recommend to the at- 
tention of thofe in the Highlands of Scotland, or wherever 
the crop is in danger 01 being rotted by rain ; and it is this : 
every flieaf, after it is cut, is bound, and fet on its end, in a 
kind of triangular pofition, the crop broke gently down ; if

they are tumbled over by a gale of wind, they are fet up as 
before } when tolerably dry, they are put together in one, two, 
or three thraves, more or lefs, according to the drynefs, and 
built on the field in the fame round form, as in the barn- 
yard, but more loofely, for admitting air ; on the top they 
are placed very compact, and fattened to each other, to pre- 
vent their falling. By thefe means, the invention of necef- 
fity, in a damp, rainy climate, an Orkney farmer, though it 
fhould have rained in the forenoon, can carry his grain from 
his field to his barn-yard in the afternoon ; and he often does 
it with fafety. 

Climate. — It admits of no doubt that fmall ifles, in fuch a 
high latitude, are bleffed with a pure air, and a wholefome 
climate. Of confequence, the inhabitants enjoy perhaps a 
better ftate of health, without the phyficians aid, than thofe 
of Mid-Lothian or Middlefex. The climate of Orkney dif- 
fers not much from that of other places on the Eaft and 
North Eaft coaft of Scotland, but owing to fome local caufes, 
it is more uncertain and variable. For three months in fum- 
mer the weather is generally fettled, and the fea ferene. E- 
very creature by land and water is in motion, and appears 
happy. In June, the rays of the fun feem unwilling to de- 
part. They retire not above half an hour. At this feafon, 
when the fun dips into the Atlantic, the appearance of nu- 
merous rocks and ifles fcattered through the ocean, the mo- 
tion of boats and fhips innumerable, thoufands of cattle 
grazing on the iand, and many more thoufands of fifties, 
great and fmall, jumping in the water, prefents a fcene tru- 
ly delightful, and awfully grand. But fometimes, in Auguft 
or September, a ftrong gale of wind fuddenly changes this 
fcene into fadnefs. The fame force of wind, which, in the 
interior parts of Scotland, produces no bad effect, is, among 

narrow

narrow iflands, wafhcd on all fides by the German and At- 
lantic oceans, attended with material injury to boats, fhips, 
and the growing corn. The fea, arifing from its bed, dafhes a- 
gainft the roclc3 : — the winds waft its fpray over the furfacc of 
the ifles : — and thus the crop, Bourn Labores, the hufbandman's 
fupport and hope throughout the year, is blafted in an hour. 
Boats are overfet, fliips are wrecked, and the hardy mariners 
perifh. 

White are the decks with foam, the winds aloud 

Howl o'er the mafts, and fing through every fhroud ; 

Pale, trembling, tirM, the failors freeze with fears, 

And inftant death on every wave appears. 
Lands on a Weft or South Weft expofure are mod liable (© 
damages from this caufe. After a ftorm of this kind, the 
ftalk of oats or bear whitens, confumes, and dies. But if the 
ftorm has not been very violent, and if it be immediately fuc- 
ceeded by rain, many of the (talks recover their colour, and 
part of their former vigour. Even the natural grafs efcapes 
not altogether unhurt. There is lefs froft and fnow, and a 
more equal temperature, as to heat and cold, in Orkney, than 
can be found perhaps in any other county of Scotland. 

Harbours. — Widewall bay lies on the Weft fide of South 
Ronaldfay, and has a good opening to the Pentland Frith 
and to Stromnefs. Ships of 500 or 600 tons burden, parti- 
cularly thofe from the Baltic, Weftward bound, frequently 
ride in it with fafety. On the North end of the fame ifland, 
there is another harbour, called St Margaret's Hope, which* 
for fmall veffels, is one of the fafeft and belt in the kingdom. 
It is much frequented by lobfter fmacks, belonging to Mr 
Selby and Co. London, and to the Nortumberland Fifhing So- 
ciety. For a confiderable time paft, different Englifh Com- 
panies have profecuted this fifhery, and, ftrange to tell ! it is 
* the 



of South Ronaldfay and Burr ay. 305 



the only fifhery that is profecuted in Orkney. This fifhing 
generally begins in March, and continues until June 5 begins 
again in October, and continues until December. Orkney- 
men are employed to catch the lobfters, and the fmacks call 
weekly to receive them. They cannot.be caught in the day 
time. Two men in a fmall boat, in the night, may catch 
from 50 to 100, more or lefs, each night, and they receive 
for each 7 farthings. This fifhery unqueftionably brings rao- 
ny into the country ; but as the fifhers are employed in it a 
part of the year, and learn, during the other part of it, ha- 
bits of idlenefs and extravagance, it is, upon the whole, doubt- 
ful whether it be ufeful or not to the country. 

High Rocks and Curious St.nes. — In South Ronaldfay ther£ 
are three headlands or rocks, prefenting a bold front to the 
ocean, called Barfick Head, on the weft fide ; Halero Head; 
and Stores Head, on the eafl fide, each about 250 feet per- 
pendicular above the level of the fea. There is a fmall (tone 
creeled in Sandwick, another near Stores, and a large one 
near the manfe, about 14 feet high, 2 feet broad, and 8 
inches thick- About thefe flones conje&amp;ure is filent, and e= 
ven tradition tells not a lie. 

Antiquities. — The Roman Catholic Religion had once 3 
firm footing in thefe ifles. In thofe days, South Ronald- 
fay was the deanery of Orkney, and its clergyman provoft o£ 
the cathedral. There are yet to be feen in this ifland the 
ruins of 7 old chapels. It is believed that fome of them 
were erexced by mariners, who, defpairing of life in tempefts 

at fea, vowed to build a church on their arrival at the firft 

I A 

harbour. 

At the chapel near St Margaret's Hope, burnt earth and 
ftones, pieces of deer's horns, and human bones, have been

frequently dug up. There are alfo fomc remains of Pictifh 
nouied, and watch-towers, in different parts of the ifland. 
But, in treating on this fubjeft, the inquifitive mind every 
where meets with darknefs vifible. 

Mill,. — There is plenty of good fpring well water in thefo 
parh'hes, but not fo abundant as to form a lake or river. A- 
bcut 5 or 6 months yearly, the mills are fupplied with water 
by rain from the heavens. There is one water mill in Bur- 
ray ; but that ifland is fo dry that it is feldom able to grind 
much of the.fubtenants grain. For this purpofe, they muft 
crofs over fcas \ and, to comfort them in this labour, they 
muft pay multure at the mill where they grind, and alfo at 
their own, where they cannot grind. There are 4 water 
mills in South Ronaldfay, at which the 12th part of oats 
and the 14th of bear, are paid. The two wind-mills, lately 
erected in it, grind bear only, and are paid with the 1 6th part* 
Kelp is made from the weeds which grow below the flood 
water mark, of which thece are 4 different fpecies, technical- 
ly named, and accurately diftinguifhed, by Linnaeus. As the 
fea ebbs, thefe weeds are cut with hooks, carried above the 
flood water mark on barrows, and, after being fpread and 
dried, they are burnt in a round hole dug in the earth, built 
about with ftones. The fubftance extra&amp;ed by burning 
from thefe weeds, in its liquid ftate, fomcwhat refembles tar, 
or melted lead. When cool, it becomes hard as the folid 
rock. It is ufed in the manufacture of foap, allum, coarfe 
and fine glafs, &amp;c. There are about 125 tons of kelp made 
annually in thefe parifhes. This is a valuable fource of wealth 
to tfiefe ifles ; and could a method be found out, during the 
burning operation, to preferve the kelp in a found ftate, and 
at the fame time free from impure mixtures of earth, fand, 
and ftones, it would very confiderably extend its ufe, and en- 
hance 



of South Ronald/ay and Burr ay. 307 

hance its price. This is a great defideratum, for which Ork- 
ney ought to give a thoufand guineas as a premium. 

EccUfaft'ical State of thefe Parches. — Sir Thomas Dundas of 
Kerfe, Baronet, is natron. There is a new manfe and offices 
building, by the authority, and" under the direction of the 
Court of Seffion. The church of the South parifh was re- 
built about 5 years ago. The church of Burray needs 
fome repair. The North parifh church walls have for feve- 
ral years lto5d without a roof, expofed to all the winds of 
heaven. There never was a parochial fchpol in the charge. 

Lady Charlotte Dundas has, within thefe laft feven years, 
with a liberal humanity, exerted herfelf to promote fome ufe- 
ful plan of education. For this purpofe, {he has repeatedly 
fent quantities of writing paper, and a variety of well chofen 
books to the minifler, to be diftributed among the poor and 
ignorant. William Jamifon, Efqj a native of South parifh 
South Ronaldfay, who went about 34 years ago to Hudfon's 
Bay, where he ftill refides as a factor for the Company, 
wrote laft year to Andrew Graham, Efq; his friend and a- 
gent in Edinburgh, and alfo to the minifler, to appropriate 
q.o 1. Sterling a year, as a falary to a fchoolmafter in the pa- 
rifh where he was born. There are no difTenters or feclaries 
of any kind in thefe parifhes. No mifchief is dreaded herej 
either from the flame of fanaticifm, or the fire of fedition. 
Inftead of feclaries, eager about building new churches, there 
is generally a law fuit, at the inftance of the minifler, for re- 
pairing or rebuilding the old ones. The greatefl part of the 
minifter's ftipend is paid in kind, principally in bear and but- 
ter. The yearly average value of it may be called 85 1. Ster-

nng ; for an ordinary man fervant, from 2 guineas to 50 s ; 
for a boy, from 20 s. to 25 s ; for a female fervant for farm- 
ing, a guinea. In harveft, a man fervant 12 s. to 15s.; a 
female fervant, for harveft, from 5 s. to 7 s. There is little 
or no demand for day-labourers, and when there is, few or 
none can be found. Sometimes they are paid with 4 d. 
fometimes with 6d, and victuals four times each day. 

The fmall horfes, generally brought to thefe parifhes from, 
Caithnefs, and Strathnaver, only one year old, are bought at 
from 2 1. to 5 1. Sterling ; and they are begun to work when 
two years old. After eight years of age, or more, they are 
generally fold again at 'nearly the fame prices to the inhabi- 
tants of the countries from whence they came. The price 
of an ox, when young, that will weigh about 18 ftone, 
is from 3 1. to 4 1. Sterling ; of a young cow that will weigh 
about 15 ftone, from 50 s- to 3 1. Sterling ; a wedder 5 s. 
or 6s; a lamb 2od. or 2 s ; a hog from 6 s- to tos; a

Mifcellaneous Remarks. — There is one floop belonging to 
South Ronaldfay, which each fpring carries fait beef, pork, 
hides, tallow, yarn, butter, geefe, value about 60 1. Sterling, 
to Leith, the produce of thefe parifhes, and brings back mer- 
chant goods. During the fummer {he is freighted with kelp 
to Dundee, Leith, New Caftle, Hull, &amp;c.

and of the latter, hemp and leather. There are in thefe pa- 
rimes 2 indifferent, and 2 tolerably good inns •, the houfes for

alfo one good fquare wright, and 3 or four of inferior hull : 
There are 2 fidlers, and one piper, who profeffes by means 
of his rnufic, to banifh the rats from their habitations. Their

and occafionaly refides in it. Corbies, crows, and often 
eagles, are found in thefc parifhes : They often do con- 
fiderable damage to the corn, lambs, and poultry. Gulls, 
fcarfs, kitty-weaks, rock-pidgeons, plovers, fnipes, folon 
geefe, larks, rails, and ducks of all kinds, abound. There are 
no hares or foxes to be found, and it is faid they cannot live 
in Orkney. There is no inftance remembered of a dog being 
mad : Muir fowl are numerous in many ifles of this coun- 
try, but for want of heath, few or none can be found in thefc 
parifhes: 

Fifies. — Cod, ling, fkate, turbet, haddocks, fillocks, quiths 
Or cuddens, lobfters, cockles, are found around thefe ifles in

and few or none are fold. The price offered by the purcha- 
fer is not a fufficient compenfation for the labour and ex- 
pence of the fifher. On account of the high duties, on fait, 
very few indeed are cured for market. Gonfequently thofe

Character 



of South Ronaldfay and Burray. 31 1 



Chur after and Manners of the People —There are few Or 
no inftances of any perfons being convicted of capital crimes ; 
but petty theft is very frequent. There are no Jufticcs 
of Peace to punifh this vice ; and if there were, it would be 
extremely difficult to (ionvicl the delinquent ; becaufe there 
is a very general belief, that whofoever is concerned in 
bringing the guilty to punifhment, will never thrive. 

Within thefe laft feven years, the minilter has been twice 
interrupted in adminiftering baptifm to a female child, be- 
fore tha male child, who Was baptized immediately af- 
ter. When the fervice was over, he was gravely told, that 
he had done very wrong, for as the female child was firft 
baptized, flie would, on her coming to the years of difcre- 
cretion, mod certainly have a ftrong beard, arfd the boy 
would have none. No couple chufes to marry except with 
a growing moon, and fome even wilh for a flowing tide. 
The exiftence of fairies and witches is ferioufly believed by 
fome, who, in, order to protect them fclves from their attacks, 
draw imaginary circles, and place knives in the walls of 
houfes. The word confequence of this ftuperftitious belief 
is, that when a perfon lofes a horfe or cow, it fometimes hap- 
pens that a poor woman in the neighbourhood is blamed, 
and knocked in fome part of the head, above the breath, un- 
til the blood appears. But in thefe parifhes there are many 
decent, honeft, and fenfible people, who laugh at fuch abfur- 
dities, and treat them with deferved contempt. The paffion 
ef the young men for a fea faring life nothing can exceed, ex- 
cept their averfion to a military one. Four or five young men 
have this winter voluntarily entered on board his Majefty's 
navy. Every year feveral young men go to Greenland or 
Iceland fifhing, to Hudfon's Bay, or on board fome mer- 
chant fbip : All of them prove to be excellent failors. And

it is believed, that they are more indubious abroad than at 
home. In no country are the people more tenacious of their 
old cuftoms than here. There are 3 churches in the mini- 
fter's charge, at which he preaches by turns ; but few of the 
people are difpofed to attend divine worfhip, except once in 
the three weeks at their own parifh church. 

Means by which the Situation of the People could be elmiora- 
fcd. — On this part of the fubject, the writer enters with dif- 
fidence. For he is abundantly fenfible, that it is much eaficr 
to find fault with what is, than to propofe proper practicable 
remedies. Anxious, hov/ever, about the profperity, and ar- 
dently wifhing to promote the induftry of thefe parifhes, he 
begs leave to fubmit to the confederation of the difcerning

he parifh of" Campfie meafures eight Englifh miles in 
length, and feven in breadth, following the two great lines of 
road which interfect the parilh nearly at right angles } 
the mean length is about fix miles, and the mean breadth fix, 
containing 36 fquare miles ; and allowing only 400 acres to 
every fquare mile, the amount will be 14400 acres ; it con- 
tains 101 plough gates of land, and is valued af 6429 pounds 
IScots. §

§ This parifh, previous to ths disjunction in the 1649, made a particular 
diftricl of country by itfelf, not a little marked by peculiar manners and cuf- 
toms. It was bound on the North, by a range of hills running parallel to the 
Strath for near ten milef; on the South, by the river Kelvin, which, in thefe 
days, formed a fwamp impaflible in winter ; on the Eaft, the Gurrel Glen 
became another natural barrier; on the Weft, Craig-Maddie Muir and the 
Bravvzet Burn feparated this diftriift from Srathbhnc and Baldernock.

It is bounded on the North, by the pnrifh of Fintry ; on 
.the Weft, by Srathblane and Baldernock ; on the South by 
Calder and Kirkintilloch ; and on the Eat by Kilfyth ; form- 
in? a diftinft commiflariot along with Hamilton, ftiled the 
commifiariot of Hamilton and Campfie. 

It is prefumed, that the winding appearance of the ftrath 
in general, and particularly of the glens near which the pa- 
rifh church is fituated, has given rife to the name Campfie, 
or Camfi, which, in the Celtic language, is faid to fignify 
crooked Strath or Glen. — Of courfe, the Clachan of Camp- 
fie, is, the place of worlhip of the crooked glens. 

Indeed, if we attend carefully to the appearance which this 
diftrict prefents to thofe who view it from any of the neigh- 
bouring ftations, particularly the bending of the hills in the 
form of an amphitheatre, above the village of Clachan, from 
which five ftreams, pouring down from five winding glens,

Campfie, in its original ftate, was eleven Englifh miles long, from Weft 
to Eaft; its breadth varied on the Weft march, from Calder houl'o to th« 
Earl's feat, it was at leaft nine Englilh miles ; whereas, on the Eaft march, its 
breadth was fearcely fir. 

It contained 150 plough gates of land and was valued at 9670 pounds 
Scots. It may be oberved that Campfie is fituatedin the Lennox, and for- 
merly made the eaftern divifion of that ancient territorial thanefnip. In the 
year 1649, the Lords Commifiioners for Valuation of Ee/nds, disjoined all 
that part which lay betwixt Inch- Wood Burn and the Garrel Glen on the; 
Eaft, annexing it to the paiifh Monniabrugh, now better know by the name 
of Kilfyth, which portion contained 30 plough gates of land, and is rated at 
2000 pounds Scots valution. In like manner they disjoined all that portion 
©n the South Weft, which is fituated betwixt Balgrochan and the Brawzyet 
Burn, annexing it to the parifti of Balaernock, containing zx plough gates of 
land, and valued in the county books at 1241 ponnds Scots. Thefe two dis- 
junct portions will no doubt be defcribed by the miniflers of the refpeltive 
p r.rifli'es to which they bclo.ig.

form the water of Glazert, this etymology of Campfic will 
not appear unnatura.1. 

External App earance and Soil. — It would not be eafy to re- 
duce the fuperficial appearance of this parilh to any regular 
figure ; it can neither be faid that it is a fquare, a parallelo- 
gram, or a triangle ; the irregular bending of the hills prevents 
the eye from comprehending it in one view, and the bound- 
ing lines of the parifh have never been accurately meafurcd : 
in loofe terms, it may be faid to conlift of two hills, with a 
confiderable valley or ftrath between them ; the South hill 
being the continuation of the Kilpatrick Braes, Hoping gent- 
ly down upon the Glazert and Kelvin \ the height is about 
feven hundred feet, arable to the top. — Between this South 
brae and the North hill, (better known by the name of 
Campfie Fells,) there is a confiderable ftrath, narrow indeed 
on the Weft, but as it runs Eaft, it widens into an open 
champaign country. The furface of the ftrath is uneven, ex- 
cepting a few haughs on the Kelvin, and Glazert. — Not that 
the land can be ftyled rugged or broken ; for almoft on every 
fide of the gentle f wells, with which this ftrath abounds, fome 
fmall rivulets collect the waters from the rifing grounds ; fo. 
that, even fuppofing the arable part of the parifti to be in the 
higheft ftate of cultivation, the husbandman would neither 
find it eafy nor expedient to plow the ridges long in one di- 
rection. — One meets with boggy, (tannery, croft, and clay 
ground, almoft in every farm. — The haughs which ly upon 
the Glazert and Kelvin, are compofed of carried earth, 
brought down from the hills in floods ; of courfe, thofe upon 
the Glazert, as being nearer the hills, contain a confiderable 
quantity of gravel, and are better calculated for railing pota- 
toes, and turnip. The Kelvin haughs, on the other hand, 

being

being formed of the fleigh which the river depofits on over- 
flowing its banks, muft be better adapted for the culture of 
beans and wheat ; and as the Kelvin, by the new cut which 
is making, will foon be confined within its proper channel, it 
is to be prefumed, that the farmers will then make the moft of 
the excellent foil which lyes upon that river. At the kirk of 
Campfie, there is a haugh of near three hundred acres, ca- 
pable of producing all forts of green crops, at leaft equal to 
any in the county. * 

Climate. — -The climate of this parifh, like every other part 
jn the Weft of Scotland, confifting of hill and dale, is exceed- 
ingly variable ; at the fame time, there is reafon to believe, 
that more rain falls at the kirk of Campfie than in anyoftho 
neighbouring parifhes to the South and Eaft : Nor is it to be 
wondered that the climate fhould be wet, when the fituation 

of 

* Although the foil of this parifh be fo exceedingly varied, neverthelefs 
^hat part of it which contains coal and lime, uniformly appears to be clay, 
forming two belts of unequal breadth ; the one upon the North of the wa- 
ter of Glazert, is nearly a thoufand yards in breadth, commencing about a 
mile Eafl from the church, and continuing all along the bafe of the hills to 
the eaflern boundary of the parifh. The other belt encircles the South brae?, 
and its breadth is fomewhat greater ; fuch is the appearance of the furface 
in the Strath. As to the Campfie Fells, which make about two fifths of the 
whole parifh, they run parallel to the Strath, from one end of the diftridl to 
»he other. The face of the hill is fomewhat broken with craigs and glens ; 
the fummU and back part is a deep muir ground, interfperfed with mofs 
hags ; the foil on the face of the hills produces a fliort feeding grafs, equal to 
any brae ground in the kingdom ; while the muirs are thought to be well 
calculated for the rearing of young black cattle in the more marfhy parts, 
and for keeping (locks of ewes upon the drier ground. In general, it may be 
faid, that the foil in the Weft, end of the parifh, and particularly North of the 
Glazert, is moft adapted for pafture ; whereas the- land on the South and Eafl 
jij^f j feems finer for grain- 



Statijlical Account 



of the place is confidered • the Campfie Fells being fituated 
betwixt the Friths of Forth and Clyde, the vapours which 
collect from either fea, as they float along, are intercept- 
ed by the high ridge of the mountain ; and being thus com- 
prefled, they defcend in fhowers upon the valley ; nevcrthe- 
lefs, it being a light gravelly bottom, the Strath being well 
ventilated, and the dreams of water, owing to the great de- 
clivity, running off quickly, the parifh is, upon the whole, 
uncommonly healthy. Perhaps the great plenty of coal, which 
enables the meaneft cottager to obtain a hearty fire, along 
with the uncommon purity of the fpring water, may not a 
little contribute to the falubrity of a climate which in other 
refpe&amp;s might be prejudicial to health from its dampnefs. 
Whatever other obfervation one might be difpofed to make 
on the weather in this diftritT:, it mult be allowed, that it is 
remarkable for variety ; we have often feen fnow in a morn- 
ing, rain at mid-day, and froft in the evening, and this alter- 
nately for feveval days. — Of courfe, it would be impoflible to 
fay, as it is faid in fome parts of the ifland, that fuch a month 
is dry* or fuch a month is warm ; the drought of Auguft 
we have often witnefsed in November, and the tempeftuous 
ihowers of February are often experienced in July. 

Water 

f Old people pretend to fay that the feafons are altered, and particularly 
that they have become colder; and in corroberation of their opinion, they 
adduce the very flattering but fallacious teftimony of what they felt in their 
youth, and how the corn ripened fooner pn the braes than now : The tefli- 
mony of an old man, about what he felt in his youth, when his blood was 
warm, and his fpirits high, can by no means be confidered as an unequivo- 
cal proof of the flate of the weather ; nor is the circumllance of the corns on 
the high ground ripening fooner than at prefent, an index of the alteration 
of the feafons. For we all know, that where the foil is thin, and often 
ploughed, the fcanty meagre crop will be difpofed fooner to whiten, even if 



of Campjie. 



Water, Wood, and Mountains.— l^\\\s parifh may be faid to 
be uncommonly well watered : In the greateft drought, the 
number of fprings from the hills afford fuch quantities of 
water, that the machinery at the different print-fields have a 
oonftant fupply. There is properly fpeaking but one river in 
the parilh ; and even this one is on a ( fmall fcale ; it is formed 
by three dreams, uniting below the kirk of Campfie : it then 
receives the name of Glazert, which is faid to fignify in Gae- 
lic, the water^ of the gray, or green promontory, alluding 
perhaps to the greennefs of the hills from whence the ftreams 
flow. The Glazert, allowing for all its windings, runs a- 
bout five Englifh miles, before it joins the Kelvin oppofite to 
Kirkintilloch. It runs with conftderable rapidity ; the fall 
from the kirk of Campfie to the Goyle-bridge being fomewhat 

more 

the climate fhould be wetter and colder, than upon well-refted rich land. As 
far, however, as we can pronounce any thing certain, relative to the climate, 
it may be laid that we have fcarcely any permanent froft, till after Chrift- 
mas : we have fcldom wind from the North and Eaft, except in the time of 
a Harm of froft and fnow, and ufually for a few days about the beginning of 
May, when in general it is accompanied with an Eaftland charr, very deftruc- 
tive to bloflbms of fruit trees. Our rain in general is from the South Weft ; 
and we fcarcely ever fail to have our Lammas floods, and our Equinoctial 
ftorm,the iirft calculated to lodge our corn, before they are ripe, and the laft 
to rot them in the ftuke. Summer 1781 was remarkable for a cold drought, 
which continued feveral weeks withering the grafs, and introducing a black 
fly upon the corns, which prevented the grain from being fo plump as ufual. 
1782 was remarkable for being a backward feafon, fo that fome of our corns 
were buried below the fnow on the 31ft of October. Summer 1783 was re- 
markable for a thick log, whereby the fun was fcarcely vifible for three 
weeks ; we felt that fummer a flight fhock of an earthquake. Our fum- 
mcrs, upon the whole, for thefe fix years bygone, have been rather cold ; our 
winters, on the other hand, have been open and frelh, as it is termed. So 
wet have our fummers been, as almoft to countenance the fanciful opinion or" 
old people, that the climate was altogether changed. Summer 1794 has been 
^oniarkably warm.

more than 100 feet, above 20 feet per mile. Besides the 
Glazert, there are no lefs than 19 fmall burns which fall into 
it. Perhaps to people who have been accuftomed to refide- 
chiefly in a level country, few fcenes will appear more truly 
piclurefque than that of the (breams of water ruffling down 
the fides of the Campfie Fells in a flood, while the top of the 
mountain is perfectly hid in the blue miff. This ftream of 
water, though highly piclurefque, and exceeding ufeful, is (till 
accompanied with fome inconveniences: In the \Jl place, 
when there is a great drought, the fpring water is apt to be 
impregnated too much with mineral water coming from the 
coal-levels, which muft prove highly prejudicial to the bleach- 
er. In the id place, The leafl fhower brings down fucha quan- 
tity of mofs from the hills, as to prove very troublefome in the 
liner operations of preparing the cloth : the manufacturers, 
however, have contrived in a great meafure to remedy both 
defects, by filtrating the water through the fine beds of gra- 
vel, upon which their works are fituated ; there is one acci- 
dent which happens, againft. the bad effects of which there 
is no guarding, but by turning off* the water altogether from 
the works ; and that is, when the ftagnating water in fome 
old coal-wafte breaks out, it will tinge every ftone in the ri- 
ver, for miles, and kill every fifli which comes within its 
poifonous influence. We have feen the trouts, after fuch an 
irruption, floating on the furface, gathered in balkets full, and 
eaten by the country people, yet no bad effecl: following from

fwamps, and of the fcattered copfe-woods in the glens and

the three together contain at leaft one hundred and ten acres 
of ground, and confift of oak, aller, birch, faugh, and afh-j 
though the timber of thefe woods be reckoned good, they are

Dartick mills, upon the Kelvin, is the fole caufc why the fifh come not up In 
rodding time to the Glazert. Perhaps there is fome truth in faying that one 
great reafon of the fearcity of falmon in the Clyde, is the little regard paid to 
the young fry. 

It would at leaft be an objeil to the country at large, and particularly to 
that city, that greater attention mould be paid to this article, fo that the tri- 
butary [beams which formerly fupplied the Clyde with fry, fhould. not be 
rendered totally ufclefs. I have not heard of a ftngle falmon being fcen in 
our river lor IS years; whereas, in former days, they were fo plenty in (pawn- 
ing time, that it was cuftomary, though unlawful, for the country lads to go 
nut with torches made of the dreffings of lint, and with long fpears to kill 
confiderabjc quantities of thefe foul fifli. 

Although fometimcs the water from the coal-waftes deilroys t.he trouts 
in the Glazert, yet as the glen and burns, at the head of the paiifli, are well 
[locked, the river is quickly replcnifhed. 

Our trout feems to be of two tlifliriifl fpecies ; the muir trout, with the 
black back, is a poor, lank, inlipid fifli ; the Kelvin trout is yellow in the 
[kin, and much plumper and richer in the filh. There is only one loch in the 
parifh, containing about 33 acres, where there is a confiderable quantity q| 
perch.

the rcfpe£Hvc proprietors are bound by their leafes to drive 1 
it to market. Although the ftratli of Campfie be remarkable 
for growing barren-timber, there is much lefs planting, either ' 
in belts or in hedge-rows, than might have been expected : 
To fay that the fpirit for planting is only beginning in the end 
of the eighteenth century, in a country fo calculated by foil 
and fhelter to produce fine timber, is not faying much to the 
praife of our induftry. As to fruit trees, it may literally be 
affirmed, that there is not one orchard in the whole parifli ; 
therefore it cannot be faidy from recent experience, whe- 
ther it be a foil adapted for the production of apples or not. 
Confiderable attention of late, however, hath been paid by the 
gentry to their kitchen gardens ; it is to be hoped, that the 
fpirit of gardening, fo long dormant, will exert itfelf in the 
formation of orchards, and the laying out of plantations : In- 
deed, in a country where grazing is fo much praclifed, it is 
rather matter of furprife to the proprietors themfelves, that 
felf-intcreft long ere now fhould not have led them to form, 
fhelter for their cattle in winter *. 

Wild Bcaftsy and Birds. — There are two fpecies of badger 
found among the loofe rocks of Campfie Fells, the one fome 
what refembling a fow, the other a dog ; the firft is more arch- 
ed in the back, and is not fo nimble in turning itfelf ; there 
has occafionally been hams made of it in this place. The 
fox too is a native of this parifii ; the huntfman fays, that the

• As to fmall vegetable productions, they are both exceedingly numerous 
and varied : moa of the Scotch plants common to glens, woods, and rock 
are to be found in this diftricft. Our ingenious friend, Mr David Ure, declare 
that he hath enjoyed confiderable pleafure in fearching for plants in our f- 
queftered vale ; and that his cutioGty was not a little gratified. Particular! 
all the different fpecies of the liuien is found here, 



of Campjie. 



5 2 3 



three different kinds peculiar to Britain are found here : The 
gray-hound-fox, with the long bufhy tail, white on the top, 
Sulks on the Fells, and is particularly deftrucTive to the lambs. 
The other two fpecies lurk in woods and old wafte coal-pits ; 
the one is low and thick made, of a very dark brown ; the 
other very frriall, of a lively red and a black tip on its tail j 
the laft are the moft mifchievous to our poultry. There 
are likewife weafles, otters, polecats, hedgehogs, wild cats ; 
and, of late^ feveral martins have been feen among the rocks. 
As to birds of prey, there are four fpecies of hawks j one 
pair of the gentil falcon breed regularly every year, in the 
Craig of Campfie, a foecies much fought after by fportfrhen ; 
we have likewife the kiftril, that fpecies which we perceive 
fo frequently in the air, fixed in one place, as it were fan- 
ning with its wings, and watching for its fport : The Gofs- 
hawk, which builds its neft upon trees in fequeftered places, 
is likewife a native of this parifh ; it dallies through the 
woods with vaft impetuofiiy after its prey •, and the fparrow- 
hawk is fo common in the upper parts of the ftrath, that 
the children of the villagers amufe themfelves by taming 
them ; both the fluggifh inactive buzzard, and the foaring 
gl tde or kite, are natives of this diftricl: : So common is the 
glade with us, that its various modes of flight are confidered 
as an almanack for the weather, and its note is a fymbol of 
moral conduct ; we obferve, when it foars high in the air, it 
prognofticates good weather ; arid every boy will tell you that 
it is. not for nothing that the glade whiffles • alluding to the 
note of that bird when it glides though the air, watching for 
its prey. The golden eagle ufed formerly to build in our 
rocks, though of late it has difcontinued the practice ; but 
we have a vifit of them annually for fome rri'onths in the fpring 
arid early part of the fummer ; they are commonly known 

T t 2 among 



3 2 4 Statijlical Account 

among the fhepherds, by the name of the earn, a vifit of which 
amongft the flock is dreaded as much as that of the fox. But 
of all the birds of prey amongft us, the hen-harriers, or white 
aboon-glade, as he is called, is the mod deftrucYive to game, 
both partridges and muirfowl. They breed on the ground a- 
mongft rufhes in the muirs, and fly low along the furface of 
the earth in fearch of prey ; the corbie or raven, the hooded 
or carrion crow, rooks, jackdaws, and the red legged crow, are 
natives of this diftricl. There are about fix pairs of ravens, 
which breed annually in the rocks, and are exceeding deftruc- 
tive to young lambs in a bad fpring. I have feen, again and 
again, a raven attack a lamb, beat with its wings about its 
head, till the poor creature fell headlong over a precipice ; 
and before the fhepherd could climb to the fpot, the raven 
had picked out its eyes. The red legged crow is but fcarce 
with us ; we feldom meet with above a pair or two in the 
whole range of the Campfie Falls ; when we do meet with 
them, it is amcngft the jackdaws, of which there are a con- 
fiderable number which haunt our rocks. A very curious fcene 
is frequently exhibited in our hills. If it fhould happen that 
a fox leaves his hole, and balks himfelf in the fun, among the 
rocks, immediately all the birds of prey within a mile of him 
will aflemble, and flutter, and fcream over the fpot where the 
thief is lurking ; eagle and hawk, raven and kite, and jack- 
daw forget their animofities, feemiiigly combining in a mu- 
tual league to difturb the retreat of reynard, fo that the humf- 
man confiders thefe birds as infallible guides to his fport. It 
may be obferved, that beafts of prey are every day becoming 
fcarcer. Till within thefe two years, we had a regular 
bred huntfman, who hunted this diftricT: ; his falary was paid 
by the tenants, at fo much per plough, which huntfman and 
dogs were kept and fed by each tenant in his turn. The father 

and 



v of Camp fie. 3 2^ 

and fon-in-law performed the office of public huntfman, from 
the year 17 J 5, till 1792, a period of fourfcore years : They 
were faid to poffefs fome of the largeft fox hounds in the three 
kingdoms ; they were flow but remarkably (launch. — The 
cry of the hounds, and the animating blart of the buglehorn, 
re-echoed by every rock along the range of Campfie Fells, 
will be long remembered by the natives of this ftrath. 

Now there are fcarcely as many hearts of prey in the whole 
dirtricl, as to afford amufement to the graziers in an idle win- 
ter day ; the only reafon which has been afligned, is, the con- 
verting of fheep pafture into grazing for black cattle, where- 
by there is lefs food for fuch ravenous animals ; of courfe, 
the large fox has migrated to the high lands, where his food 
is more abundant. In proportion as the hearts and birds of 
prey, have left this dirtricl, the finging birds have increafed ; 
feveral fpecies have appeared of late, which were formerly 
unknown, particularly the bulfinch and the wood-lark. It is 
perhaps at the Clachan of Campfie, which is fituated in the 
neighbourhood of copfewoods and retired glens, that a per- 
fon is enabled to comprehend the meaning of a proverbial 
expremon in this county, the fcreich of day light ; — here and 
there, the lark begins the fong, which is foon heard and ac- 
companied by all the little feathered choirifters within reach 
®f its note •, — The air feems to vibrate with the found. — 
As to our migrating birds, the ftatement in the following 
table is founded on the obfervations of ten years :

In former times, particularly during a hard winter, it was 
cuftomary for wild ducks, wild geefe, and even fwans, to vifit 
the fwamps of this parifh ; thefe being now drained, fuch 
fowls are fcarcely to be feen. There are plenty of groufe 
in the Campfie muirs ; at the fame time partridges have of 
late become uncommonly fcarce ; many caufes have been af- 
figned for the rapid decay of this fpecies of game, fuch as 
the wet fummers, and the pretended increafe of the birds of 
prey, which is not fa£t. 

Perhaps it will be found, that this country at prefent is ra- 
ther in an unfavourable ftate for nurfing patrulges ; the 
broom, and furze, and briers, being moftly grubbed out, and 
the land formerly wafte, put under cultivation •, whereas ar- 
tificial fhelter by belts of planting is not yet produced ; while 
the number of idle boys, belonging to the public works^ let 
loofe upon a Sunday, ftrolling about the fields with their tar- 
rier dogs, ferreting out the patridge nefts by the fmell, may be 
an additional caufe of the uncommon fcarcity of this game in 
the parifh.

tion of naturalfts, of two fpecies, primary and secondary ; ir* 
the firft, it is faid that coal and lime are never to be found, 
whereas the fecond abounds with both. 

The higheft ridge of the Campfie Fells, is about 1500 feet 
above the level of the fea, and about 1 200 from its bafe y 
where, properly fpeaking, the mountain commences, the af- 
cent is very rapid ; and from examining the glens, and gul- 
lys formed on its fides, it feems to be compofed of the fol- 
lowing ftrata : At the bafe of the hill, immediately after the 
coal is cut off, you meet with feveral layers of camftone, (as 
it is termed with us,) which is eafy burned into a heavy lime. 
Immediately above the camftone, you find at leaft a dozen 
Strata of ironftone, of different thicknefs, with a foft flate. 
interveening betwixt the layers ; it is faid by thofe who have 
examined the ironftone, that it is of an excellent quality. 
Thefe different feams make up 200 feet of the bafe of the 
mountain. Then 15 ftrata of muirftone rife above each o- 
ther to the fummit of the Fells, where they jut out; in the. 
face of the brae:, they go by the name of daffes or gerrocks. 
Betwixt thefe ftrata of muirftone, you meet with various co- 
loured fluff, fometimes of a copperiih, fometimes of an iron- 
ftone colour ; and it is faid, there are appearances of copper ; 
but the working of it has not as yet been attempted. Lately, 
when forming the new turnpike-road along the fide of the 
hills, feveral veins of fpar and chryftal were found, not un- 
like thofe which accompany lead-mines ; and perfons who 
1 had wrought at the different lead-mines in Scotland, declar- 
ed, that the appearances of that metal were both frequent and 
favourable : no attempt as yet hath been made to follow out 
thefe appearances. In the whole range of the Campfie Fells, 
there is only one place where the rocks affume a bafaltic ap- 
pearance ; and by thofe who admire fuch columnar appear- 
ances,

anccs, they are faid to be very beautiful. Here and there, 
there were dug out, when forming the turnpike-road on the 
hills, feveral ftrata of mod excellent clay marie, both white 
and fpeckled ic has not as yet become an object of atten- 
tion to the country people. Beautiful pebbles have been 
found among the rocks, of which a gentleman lately procur- 
ed as many as, when policed, furnifhed a fet of elegant but- 
tons for a coat. About the middle of the ftrath, you meet 
with excellent quarries of free ftone, calculated for all the 
purpofes of the builder ; but the minerals of which we have 
the greateft reafon to boaft, are the inexhauftable feams of 
lime and coal, which merit a particular defcription. The 
coal and lime in this parifh are generally found in the fame 
field : The coal, throughout the whole parifh, poflefies a cak- 
ing quality ; at the fame time it is very foul and fulphurous, 
leaving, when burned, an uncommon quantity of rufty colour- 
ed afhes, which make excellent manure for certain forts of land. 

The coal on the North of the Glazert, takes on about a 
mile Eaft from the Clachan of Campfie, and continues with- 
out much interruption to the eaftern extremity of the parifh ; 
it runs parallel to the Fells, and feldom exceeds a quarter of 
a mile in breadth : The field on the South fide of the river, 
which forms a belt around the South braes, is confiderably 
broader, and is of much fuperior quality to the other. The coal 
is found of different depths from the furface ; on the North 
fide, from feven to fifteen fathoms ; on the South, from fif- 
teen to twenty two ; the feam throughout the whole parifh, 
is, at an average, from forty two inches to four feet in thick- j 
nef-;, with two fmall bands, of an inch and an inch and half, 1 
running through it'. The ftrata above the coal is found uni-1 
formly in the following manner : After the foil there is found 
a fpecies of till, interfperfed with ftones ; after which comes 4 , 
a blaze, as it is termed, and which continues to a confidera-l

blc depth ; then flate, which, at a medium, is from feven to 
eight feet in thicknefs ; after which, there is uniformly ume- 
ftone, being a feam of four feetS then a flate, and then the 
■coal : Such is the regular ttrata in CampGe in finking for 
coal ; with this difference, however, that the flate in the North 
of Glazcrt, betwixt the lime and coal, is fifteen feet in thick- 
nefs 5 on the South, it is fcarcely four ; below the coal, there 
is eighteen inches of a fluff, which the workmen term dalk ; 
then the white lime, of an inferior quality to the other, and 
as yet but ieldom wrought. 

J o 

The coal in this diltrict is full of irregularities, filled by 
the workmen coups, and bitches-) and dykes j the truth is, the 
coal partakes a good deal of the irregularity of the ground 
above, which is very uneven. If one was to fpeak in gener- 
al terms of the whole coal in the parifh, as one field, it might 
be faid, that the depth was to die South Eaft, and the rife 
to the North Weil •, fuch really being the afcent and declivi- 
ty of the lands in this diftfift  — but as there are a number 
of gentle fwells in the ftrath, it will happen, that according 
as the pit is put down on this fide of the fwell, Si? upon the 
other fide, the dip and rife of the coal will appear favourable, 
or the contary. — i he dip is fometimes fo ludden as to be 
one foot in three, in other places, only one in twenty. Befi- 
des thefe coups and hitches, which are found where the ftra- 
ta above and below the coal fiuldenly approach, or retreat 
from each other, by this means couping the coal out of its 
regular bed, there are complete breaks in the ftrata, termed 
dykes, which cut off the coal entirely in various directions ; 
thefe dykes are fometimes obferved upon the furface of the 
earth, from which they fink down to an unfathomable 
depth j—There are two of thefe dykes in thus diftria, which 
are remarkable, and feem to be uniform throughout : Firf, 
There is a coup-dyke, which runs from Well: fcoEaftj North

of this coup-dyke, the coal dips about fifteen feet, and theri 
they may work about three hundred yards into the Hill, where 
they feem to be cut off entirely by a whinftone dyke ; fo 
there are two great barriers which intercept the ly of the 
coal upon the North of the Glazert ; the coal on the South 
of the coup-dyke, takes on almoil within fix feet of the fur- 
face, and is not above fix inches thick, with fomtthing like 
a clay roof. 

Manner of Working. — There is rcafon to believe that coal 
lias been wrough in this diftricT: for feveral centuries ; but the 
working of it feems to have been carried in a very aukward 
irregular manner, taking advantage of the ly of the ground : 
They ufed to make large excavations upon the furface, 
which they termed creeping heughs ; from thefe excavations, 
they drove a road into the coal heads, and by this means 
brought the coals to the hill, dragging them on their fmall 
fledges up the declivity, which was not very great, as the ex- 
cavation was always made as much to the dip fide of the hill 
as poffible : It is evident, that in this manner they could on- 
ly work the crop of the coal, where the water created little dif- 
quiet ; a method, however, highly prejudicial both to the land- 
lord and the public ; the next ftage of working was by fink 
ing perpendicular pits, ftiled windlafs heughs. On the Norm 
of the river Glazert, thefe pits were in depth from fixty to nine- 
ty feet •, but they fo contrived it, that thefe pits were placed 
near feme gully or burn, where, by running a level from a 
certain part of the bum, all the coal round the pit bottom be- 
came drained ; and in the finking of every new pit, they mull 
always do it with a retrofpect to their former level ; (till, 
however, the coal upon the dip fide might be lying under 
water ; for although the declivity in the ground favoured

greatly rhtfe imperfe£t fhort levels, there were many fields 
of coal which could not thus be drained but at a mult enor- 
mous expencc, in driving fubterraneous mines : In this (tage 
of carrying on the work, there were employed at leaft two 
men at the windlafs, putting up the coals in {kiilles, termed 
hutches ; and it is more than probable that they. had likewile 
to'pully up the wate'r for a confiderable time every morning, 
before the workmen had got the coals raifed ; the coal bufi- 
nefs in this diltrict was carried on in this flovenly manner 
during this century : The country was ill fupplied \ the land- 
lords complained that they never made a {hilling of their 
coal, while every perfon was furprifed, that a diltricl, poffef- 
fing fuch natural advantages, fhould make fo little good ufe 
of them. About two years ago, coal becoming exceeding- 
ly fcarce, and the price rifing fuddenly, there became an ab- 
folute necefilty of working it in a better ft vie ; accordingly, 
Mr Dunmore of Ballindalloch, a gentleman to whofe a£tivi«- 
ty and patriotifm tliis part of Scotland is much indebted, be- 
coming the lefTee of feveral works in the parifh, he imme- 
diately erected gins, driven by horfes, for pulling up the coals ; 
which improvement is anfwering the purpofe, and is either 
already, or will be quickly followed by the -other proprietors ; 
fo that now we have every probability of this necefiary arti- 
cle of life being wrought in a llyle far fuperior and more ex- 
peditious than hitherto experienced. 

All the coaliiers in this pariih now work with the pick and 
wedge : this, however, is only a late improvement \ they pool 
in the middle of the feam, where a fmall band of (tone, about 
an inch of thickncis, lyes, called the pooling band, and then 
(hear down what is above, fiiied the roof coal, and drive up the 
foal coals with wedges ; they carry on their drifts orrooms eight 
feet by fourteen, leaving ftccps eight feet^by twelve ; but. this

varies according as the ecu! is feft or hard ; every coailicr may 
be faid to be his own drawer ; feidorn or ever has he any perfon 
lo affifl him ; they commonly go to their work at four in the 
morning, and continue until two in the afternoon; formerly 
the coals were put out hy the dark, poriftftiog of twenty eight 
hutches, for which dark the coallier received one (hilling and 
eight pence, and the proprietors had for lordfhip one fhiiliiiT 
and ten pence ; an active workman could very eafily put out 
two of thefe darks per day, making three millings and four 
pence ; thefe hutches becoming more and more uncertain as to 
the quantity contained in them, both the landJoul and public 
being impofed upon, it became neceffary to adopt fome new 
regulations relative to the meafure which has been done 
accordingly ; fo that now we compute by loads ; each load 
contains 2184 cubic inches, equal to twenty one Scotch pints 
and a half, water meafure ; fix of thefe loads make an exceed- 
ing good cart, which fhould weigh betwixt twelve and thir- 
teen hundred weight •, the price, at the pit mouth, being eigh- 
teen pence per cart, or threepence per load ; a tolerable work- 
man can put out twenty four loads per day, for which he has 
three {hillings *, and the landlord the other three fhillings. In 
order to afcertain the quantity of coals raifed at the different 
pits, of which there are no lefs than fixty going this month of 
December 1793, we fhall calculate the average out-put of the 
coaliers : There are, in all the different pits, forty fix coalliers; 
allowing three carts and a half per day to each, makes one 
hundred and fixty one carts per day, fuppofing them only to 
work five days in the week ; the out-put per week will be eight 
hundred and five carts ; reckoning the coalliers weeks in the 
year only to be fifty, the out-put in the year will be forty 
thoufand two hundred and fifty carts ; fuppofing that the 
meafure, at a medium, does not exceed eleven hundred weight 

per 



ofCampfie. 333 

per cart, the out-put in the year will be 22135 tons and a-half ; 
the price at the hill is fomewhat better than 2S. 6d. per ton ; 
the total value is 2750I. Sterling, of which the coalliers re- 
ceive 1375I ; the remainder goes for lordfhip, and to fupport 
the hills-men and gin-boys, along with the tear and wear of, 
the work. 

According to the calculation of men [killed in coal-mines, 
thefe 20,coo tons will at lead exhauft three acres of coal an- 
nually, a wafte, which, great as it may appear, we are able 
to fupport for 150 years to come ; but in reality we are raif- 
ing this feafon, at leaft, double of what was raifed former- 
ly, nay, 10 times more -than what was put out about 20 years 
ago ; this great quantity of coal is ufed in the following man- 
ner : The two printfields confume annually 3500 tons ; a- 
bove 2100 tons is ufed in burning lime and the remainder 
in fupplying the parifhes of Campfie, Fintray, Balfrone, Ki- 
lairn, Strathblane, Baldernock, and partly Kirkintilloch and 
Kilfyth. It is doubtful if even yet the coal in this diftricl: 
be wrought to advantage ; in reality, we are as yet but 
working the crop of the coal ; it being abfolutely neceffary 
that they fhould either drive their levels, or erecl: their fleam 
engines upon the dip fide, fo that they might work to the 
rife. Many great fields at this moment ly buried- under wa- 
ter, owing to this defe£t *lf.

\ No map being made of thefe fubterraneous works, and no documents 
being in the poffeffion of the proprietors, to point out when and how fuch a 
field ofcoal was wrought, it is only by fome vague tradition, handed down 
from one generation of coalliers to another, that we pretend to judge whether 
the ground be wafted or not ; io that too often the pit is put down upon a 
trouble, or wafte, to the great detriment of the adventurer ; which miftake 
might be eafily rectified, by each proprietor getting an accurate chart made out

It has been obferved that limeftone is always found in the 
fame field with the coal; it is in general a feam from three 
feet to five in thicknefs, and is wrought in the following man- 
ner : They take off the earth from the furface, called tirring, 
which is from 10 to 30 feet ; feldom or never have they as 
yet wrought the lime-ltone by mining. The probability is, 
however, that they will foon be compelled to it ; the work-

the folly of the landlords, if ever they permit coals to become much dearer; 
it is not the richnefs of the foil which always brings the higheft rent to the 
proprietor ; fome particular local advantage acts in his fjavour ; and perhaps 
there is none to furpafs the advantage of cheap fuel. 

A fmall farmer (fuch as we have in this difttiifl) confiders good oat meaL 
and a good fire as great luxuries ; and while the cenauts poffefc thefe, they will 
make a conliderabic fhift to pay their dear rents. 

It is with pleafure that we take notice of the public fpirited attempts made, 
by feveral gentlemen laff year, to prevent the coals from rifing in this diftricl ; 
and they have fully fucceeded : They have perhaps funk a little money, bi:; 
their tenants and dependants have reaped the benefit, and the public hath Jaid

fchaMer of lime ; the lime is burnt chiefly in {"mail kilns, hold- 
ing from i o to 15 chalders, the {tone being more complete- 
ly burnt, than in thofe of a larger fize ; the layers of {tone 
and coal are made alternately in the following proportions : 
i(t, Six inches of coal, then 20 inches of lime-ftone, broken 
to the fize of a two-penny-loaf. Two firlots (wheat mea-

thefe two years, at 4I. Scots, at the quarry, now, 8s. the rea- 
dy money price ; formerly it was fold with at leaft 6 months 
credit. It is doubtful if the ftate of the country as yet will 
permit this alteration, fmall as it is ; it requires 6 or 7 loads 
of coal to burn the chalder of lime. There were employed 
this fummer (1793) 40 workmen in the different lime quar- 
ries in the parifh, who raifed at leaft 3000 chalders of 
flacked lime ; the Campfie lime is reckoned of an exceeding

entailed, and in all probability there will be more added by 
the prefent proprietors. The fmall proprietors are feuers of

ty in this diftrict. hath changed its mailers as feldom as in 
mod parts of Scotland ; whether this be an advantage to the 
country, or not, is a queftion upon which fpeculative men 
have differed ; but this at leaft is certain, that the following 
families ; viz. Kincaid of Kincaid, Stirling of Craigbarnet, 
Stirling of Glorat, Lennox of Woodhead, and Edmifton of 
Duntrath, were, in the year 1470, proprietors of the fame 
lands which they poflefs at this day ; the eftate of Auchhir 
reoch fell by fucceflion, in the beginning of this century, to 
the Buchanans of Carbeth, an ancient family in the parifh of 
Killern : Macfarlane of Kirton, a cadet of the family of Mac- 
farlane, became proprietor of Kirton in the year 1624 ; the 
eftate of Antermony is the purchafe of Captain John Len- 
nox of Antermony, a younger fon of the ancient family of 
Woodhead. Perhaps this circumftance, which may pleafe 
the pride of family, is one great reafon why the improvement 
of land is fo very backward in this diftricr. ; wherever fami- 
lies refided long upon an eftate in Scotland, the object of our 
Scotch ambition was to poflefs a numerous tenantry, live as 
they may. The laird fought other means of bettering his 
ntuation, than by the flow returns of agriculture ; whereas,

if an eflate often changed its mafter, it became in reality 
an object of commerce, and every new proprietor made it 
fomewhat better for his own intereft. 

It is curious to obferve the progreflive rife of the land rent 
in this parifh, fince the year 1647 ; the rent of the plough- 
gate in thofe days, was about one hundred merks, befides 
feu fervices ; and there is reafon to believe, that the valua- 
tion in Cromwel's time, in this district, was made as high as 
the land could really afford in rent ; during the firft years of 
the Reftoration, land feems to have rifen, (as appears from 
fome old tacks:) From the 1680, till the year 1715, it 
appears that the rife was but trifling ; after this period it 
xofe confiderably ; and, in the year 1748, was about 15C0I. 
Sterling ; the next rife was in the year 1763 ; and, conlider- 
ing the value of the land in the natural pclTcflion of the fmall 
proprietors to keep pace with the tenantry, it rofe to about 
3000 1. Sterling. The land-rent this prefent year, is betwixt 
feven and eight thoufand per annum, upon leafes, or in the 
natural polTeffion of the fmall proprietors.

By this ftatement, it is evident, that land gives fourteen 
times more rent in money than it did 150 years ago ; allow-? 
?ng for the fervices and other preflations payed by the ten- 
ants in thofe days, perhaps we ought not to reckon fo high- 
ly ; whether this rife, however, is to be afcribed to the gra- 
dual improvement of landed property, or the depreciation of 
money, becomes another queftion ; and perhaps the land- 
holders will not have fo much reafon to boaft of their advan- 
ced rents, if the enquiry be fairly made ; in this rental, that 
of cot-houfes is not comprehended, which is at lead five hun-

times the fum of what they were in 1745 •, even fo late as 
1 75oj four pounds Scots was the rent of a. cottage with a fmall 
yard annexed \o it ; fuch houfes rent now at twenty {hillings ; 
but, from the improvement made on cot-houfes, the rent o£ 
a room and kitchen, or what in the language of the place is 
filled a but and a ben, gives at lead two pounds Sterling ; fo 
that the fame dais of people pay for lodging fix times more, 
than they did thirty years v ago ; this increafe arifes chiefly from 
the introduction of manufactures.; now, if the rent of the coal 
and lime, together with that of the cot-houfes, be added to 
the lane, the total rent of the parifh maybe ftated to be eight 
thoufand four hundred pounds Sterling per annum,

actly what number of acres there are arable* and what not* 
as there is no map of the parifh, nor has the whole ever been

acres, it will be found that five thoufand of thefe are arable j 
of the other ten thoufand, confifting of brae, of muir, and paf- 
ture land, three thoufand more may be made arable : — Of 
courfe, it is about fifty acres of arable land to each plough. 

There are ninety-fix heads of families, who live on this 
property, either as tenants or feuers; and whofe employment 
is either grazing or agriculture ; but it is to be obferved, that 
there are eighteen heads of families in this lift, who do not 
make agriculture their chief employment ; pofieffing only a 
few acres of land, and who principally employ themfelves as 
mafons, or carriers, or road makers ; there is another diftinc- 
tion to be made of thefe heads of families, who employ them- 
felves in agriculture ; 28 of them are feuers, who farm their

rents of others run betwixt twenty and feventv pounds, ex- 
cepting upon the forfeited eftate of Bancloich, where fomc 
tenants pay as low as five pounds per annum , they having got 
leafes of three nineteen years in 1748. 

The labour of thefe hundred plough gates of land was per- 
formed in 1793, by feventy ploughs, drawn by 222 horfes, 
yoked in the following manner : 

20 ploughs drawn 4 horfes. each. 
24 ditto drawn by 2 horfes. 
26 ditto drawn by 3 horfes. 

The following table exhibits the manner in which the five 
thoufand acres of arable land was cropped in the year 1793, 
viz. 

20co acres in tillage and fown grafs, of which were, 
2oo acres in barley, 
ico acres in potacoes. 

30 acres in lint. 
200 in fown grafs. 

1500 in oats ; of which, we may deduct 2o for peafe and 
beans ; the remaining 3000 acres in ley pafture for milk cows, 
and young beafts. 

There were not ten acres fallow, in the whole parifh ; nei- 
ther were there above four acres in wheat or turnip. Per- 
haps there is no country in Scotland more calculated for raif- 

ing

tag turnip than Campfie ; at the fame time, I rather think 
they do not (land the winter well in this diftrict I have £aid 
20 acres for peafe and beans, the wet climate rendering thefe 
a very unprofitable crop with us, growing all to the draw, 
without any pods : The produce per acre, at an average, is 
about fix bolls ; — fmall as this may appear, it is at lead one 
third more than it was thirty years ago : If a ftranger was 
to view our crop at Lammas, when growing, or even in the 
fhock, he would be apt to conclude the product to be a great 
deal more 5 the truth is, our moid climate produces much 
ft raw and little corn ; I believe, it may fafely be affirmed,, 
that at an average there is not above fifteen pecks of meal 
out of the boll ; the barley produces better, the foil being- 
adapted for that grain; and .it .is faid to malt remarkably 
well ; but the fault lies more in the ftyle of farming, than in. 
the ground itfelf ; fo late as the year 1763, the farms were; 
pofTefled in run rigg ; — there was fcarcely any inclofing ; the 
moment that the crop was feparated from the ground, the 
cattle of the neighbouring tenants grazed in common, till 
next Whitfunday ; the diftindlion betwixt out-field and in- 
field, was kept up with the mod fci\ipulous exattnefs ; there 
was no rye-grafs and clover fown, for making hay ; and the 
bulk of the farmers ploughed their land with what is {tiled 
the broad plough, the four horfes yoked abreaft : Thefe pe- 
culiarities are now worn out ; at the fame time, farming, 
both as to fcience and practice, is yet but in its infancy in 
this parifh. * 

Tacks 

* It is true, that the climate is not good, but the foil is excellent ; and as 
the crops might be adapted to the climate, there are great hopes entertained, 
that we (hall one day excel in farming : The following defects in our mode 
fcem to be moll flagrant : jjl, The land being full of fprings gufhing out, 
wherever any change of the foil takes place in the farms ;— of courfe, noth- 
ing

with a claufe that the tenant fhall bear the public burdens,

mafter's 

ing but underdraining can clear the foil of fuch a nulfaacc ; and yet unfortu- 
nately it is but little practifed : 2d!y, Our inclofures are little better than ricklc 
dykes, built of ftones, gathered from the land, without any mortar ; — of 
courfe, totally incapable of meliorating the foil by keeping it warm ; which 
would be the cafe, if the inclofures were made with of quick-fet hedges, 
and belts of planting, for which the parifli is fo remarkably calculated ; thefc 
dykes give the parifli a cold and uncomfortable look. 3tfy, A great propor- 
tion of our arable land is laid down in the mod mifcrable manner without 
fown grafs, and impoveriflied by three fucceeding crops of oats; by this 
management, it is in a moft wretched condition, indeed, when broken up to 
dergo anew the fame rotation of crops of oats. 4/Wjy, Our land, from being iri 
general a light foil, and fituated in a moift climate, is much addicted to weeds ; 
it is foul even to ranknefs ; — Of courfe, as the corns grow much to flrar.-, 
the flalk of corn is kept conftantly wet at the root by the weed* ; it foon rots, 
and the lead blaft of wind in Auguft, lodges the corn on the croft-lands be- 
fore they are ripe ; whereas, if fummer fallowing was praotiftd, there can- 
flot be the fmallefl doubt, but our crops would be clean and much earlier; 
yet fummer fallowing is fcarcely ever practifed in this parifli : Along' with 
fhefe defects, I muft mention two other caufes, which have not a little con- 
tributed to retard our progrefs in agriculture : In the firjl place, an over at- 
tachment to grazing; which harh led the farmers to ftudy more the raifing 
of fodder, than the raifing of grain ; by this means, the early-feed oats have 
never received much countenance in this diftricT: ; but, if we confider the 
moiflnefs of the climate, there is no parifli which recpiires them more; and 
from the experiments we have had of fowing early oats, upon land well 
cleaned from weeds by fummer fallowing, there is every encouragement to 
proceed ;— the grain was fully ripe and early houfed. %dty, I am not fure 
but the proprietors themfelvcs have, in fome meafure, contributed to 
the little progrefs which agriculture hath made in this diftrict. From an 
opinion that land was always uppn the increafe, it has not been their 
objedl' to grant fuch long leafes, as to" encourage the farmer to fink money 
in-improving the land : The opinion that has gone abroad amongft land- 
lords, 



of Campfie. 343 

matter's falary the poor man's rent is confidcrably augmen- 
ted by fuch items. — Thefe things I don't mention as griev- 
ances, for the tenant fubferibes to them with open eyes j nor 
can the landlord be called an oppreflbr, becaufe he receives 
them ; they are all preftations of a fair contract ; and of 
courfe, if the proprietor did not exact them, he would be 
entitled to more rent s I fimply ftate them as defects in our 
mode of hufbandry ; and which it would be the intereft 
both of landlord and tenant to have removed. — Let the ten- 
ant know deter minately what he 'is to pay, and let him have 
the complete ufe of his time, and the complete management 
of the product of his farm. As to a regular rotation of crops, 
it is but little known in this diftrievt. The old mode of al- 
lowing the land to ly ley for three years, and then liming it, 
and taking three crops of oats, is, indeed, faft wearing outj 
but no regular fyftem is as yet introduced in its (lead. 

The rent of the arable land per acre, is flared in the fol- 
lowing table : 

For 

lords, that the raifing the rents of their lands forced the tenants to he more 
active, might be productive of fome good effect ; providing that indolence 
was the only impediment to a fl»urifhing ftate of agriculture in this parifli • 
Compulfion is but a bad argument, when the object of that compulfion 
has not ftrength to obey : 1 could wifli that fuch an idea was exploded ; for 
it is no longer the intercft of this country to conflder the tenantry upon an 
eftate, as part of that eilate. 

In England, things feem to be better managed. There are ftill feveral 
fervitudes remaining in this parifh, annexed to the leafes of lands, fuch as 
kain hens, and the driving of the lairds coals ; thefe are indeed but fmall to 
whac took place about 30 years ago ; but, even thefe are fetters upon the in- 
duftry of the tenants ;— of more hurt to them than of benefit to the landlord ; 
and it is to be hoped, from the many inftances of an enlightened mind which 
the prefent proprietors have fhown, that all fuch cafualities will be abolifjied 
oji the firft opportunity.

It may be proper here to take notice, that lime, though in 
fuch great abundance in this parifh, was made but little ufe 
of as a manure till very lately ; the inhabitants pretended e- 
ven to fay that it fpoiled the ground by railing weeds : the 
truth is, the objeflion lay in their injudicious management ; 
there is not the fmallcft doubt, where ground is foul, as is 
the cafe in the foil and moid climate of Campfie, that lime 
puts the weeds in vegetation but if the land had been fal- 
lowed,, or even permitted to lie long in ley, till the ground 
v/as properly fwarded, there is no country in Scotland, where 
liming produces a better effect, than in this diftricl: : As fome 
recent experiments have fhewn, we now lime at the rate of 
from fix to eight chalders per acre. Such being, the ftate of 
zgticulture in this parifh, it may be faid, without difparage- 
nient, that it is, as yet, but in its infancy ; and yet it is but do- 
ing juftice, both to the proprietors and tenants, to obferve, 
that the improvements 'are going on with great fpirit and fuc- 
cefs. 

Grazing. — There is confiderable attention paid-in this 
tliftria to the management of black cattle, both for the pur- 
pofes of the dairy, and likewife for that of the butcher. The 
following table exhibits the number of cattle and fneep kept 
in the parilh in 1793. gjft

Thefe 749 milk-cows are kept by 177 people ; there are ten 
principal dairies, which confift of betwixt 14 to 20 milk 
cows ; the remainder are fplit down in fmall dairies, contain*- 
jag from 4 to 10 cows. It is noteafy to fay what milk at an 
average is given per day by the cows of this diftri£t. ; I fhould 
think from 7 to 1 1 Scotch pints ; below 7 they are not thought 
worth keeping for the dairy : above 1 1 they are confidered 
as remarkable. 

About 60 of thofe perfons who have cows, may be confi- 
dered as tradefmen and manufacturers ; it may be doubt- 
ed, whether it be of any ufe to fuch a perfon to keep a 
cow or not ; fome are apt to imagine that it is calculated 
to inftiil habits of idlenefs into the minds of their children, 
who may be employed in herding them by the dykes-fide : 
no doubt, it will be confidered as an eye- fore by the far- 
mers, to allow the children of tradefmen to feed their cows 
ont he road-fide, to the prejudice of his turnips and peafe ; on 
the other hand, it is of the utmoft importance to the ftate at 
large, that the children of tradefmen and fedentary people 
fhould be healthy : I know of nothing more calculated to 
promote that end than plenty of frefh milk. Our milk cows, 
within thefe 30 years, have increafed confiderably in bulk ; 
at an average, if fattened, they would weigh 20 ftones, Tron 
weight. In general, they are the breed of Highland bulls ; 
hence they have a tendency to take on flefh, more than to

give large quantities of milk ; at the fame time it muft be 
owned, that the milk, is remarkably rich; it being very com- 
mon for a cow, which only gives 8 Scotch pints per day, to 
produce nearly a pound of butter from that milk per day. 
Campfie has been long remarkable for making excellent but- 
ter : Till of late, it was only flcimm'd milk cheefe which they 
made, of courfe it was not very rich : Now. however, there 
are feveral dairies, which make cheefe equal to any from 
Dunlop ; and from the price which they receive for fuch 
cheefe, they confider this plan as more profitable than to 
make butter. 

There are about 1600 muir-ewes kept in the parifh, whofe 
lambs are fold to the Glafgow butcher in the feafon, from 
6s. to 8s per head ; they are commonly taken away by the 
butcher during the month of June, and the firft two weeks 
of July. Perhaps we have the belt ftock of black faced ewes 
that are to be met with in Scotland ; they are completely 
muir ewes, and yet they weigh twelve Tron pounds per quar- 
ter, twenty two ounces and a half to the pound : I'hev are fold 
at a guinea per head when fat ; the flock which I allude to 
belongs to Mr David Dun, grazier, and they are p^ftured'up- 
on the muir-lands of the eftate of Kirkton, belonging to John 
Macfarlane, Efq-, In former times, there were at leaft 4000 
fheep in the parifh ; they were of two forts : the black faced 
fheep, with coarfe wool, bought at the market of Kilbrydc 
and Linton ; and the final 1 country (beep, with white and 
yellow faces, and remarkable fine wooj. From what the 
writer of this account recollects, the country fheep muft iq 
a great meafure have refembled the Shetland breed : — they 
were the common breed of the country ; it being weddcr- 
hogs and Dinmonts alone, which were bought at Kilbryde 
and Linton market. By fome ftrange fatality, this Southland 
breed, hath crept in, though the creature is lefs hardy and

courier in the wool ; at this moment there is not the fmallefl 
veftige of our country breed remaining, all the {lock ewes iii 
the parifli being black faced and coarfe wooled : Two caufes 
have been affigned for the total negledt of the native breed : 
i ft, Since the rife of the flefh-meat took place, it hath been 
the object of the graziers to pay more attention to the bulk 
of the carcafe than to the finenefs of the wool. 2dly, About 
the year 1763, a new mode of grazing was introduced ; the 
face of the hills being appropriated to the feeding of black 
cattle, it was found that our native breed of fheep were not 
fond of the courfe grafs in the muirj conftantly feeking after 
the fhort bite on the Campfie Fells, it became abfolutely ne- 
ccffary, therefore, if we were to follow this fyftem of gra- 
zing, to procure fuch a breed of fheep as were fitted for the 
muir ground. 

At prefent, the wool in this parifli I believe to be as good 
as any wool of the I'weedfmuir breed of (beep ; when fmear- 
ed with tar and butter, it fells betwixt fix and feven (hillings 
per (tone ; — white, as it is termed, fells at ten (hillings per 
(tone ; we expect eight pounds of clean wafhed wool out of 
the (tone of that which was fmeared ; and twelve pounds; 
from the white wool It is chiefly fold to the country peo- 
ple in the neighbourhood. The grazing of black cattle upon 
brae ground, is perhaps as well underitood in this parilh, as 
in molt places of Scotland ; above 900 are fed annually in 
this di Uriel, either for the butcher, or the Falkirk market ; 
perhaps 300 of thefe maybe wintered ; the remainder bought 
in at the Whitfunday markets. 

The winterers graze in the open fields, during the whole 
winter feafon, and are fed once or twice a day with coarfe 
hay, made of fprats and grafs— gathered in autumn amongft 
the cows feet in their pafture ; the graziers commonly begirt

,to fodder, as they term it, about Chriftmafs, (It is confidcr- 
ed as a feverc winter, when they are forced to begin before 
Chriftmas,) and continue till about the beginning of April, 
when' the cattle refufe it. There are few cattle grazed with 
us but Highlanders, and we prefer thofe from Argylefliire, 
and the ifles : North country cattle are rejected, as they are 
confidered by the graziers as four and dillicult to feed : graz- 
ing of Highland cattle upon brae-ground in this dHtrict, owes 
much of the perfedion to which it has been brought, to Mr 
David Dun, a native of this parifii.— He has fpent the better 
of his life in the proftffion of a fhepherd, grazier, and breed- 
er of cattle ; and his countrymen acknowledge, with pleafure, 
the obligations they are under to him for his fkill and atten- 
tion in thefe particulars. — He has, with fome propriety, been 
ftyled the Scotch Eakewell ; for feveral years, he gave 1400 I. 
per annum for grafs-lands, and at that time did not fo much 
as grow a cabbage plant \ at prefenr, he pays about 8ocl./fr 
annum on current leafes ; he has been known, again and a- 
gain, to fell cattle of the Highland breed, of his own rearing, 
at twelve and fourteen pounds Sterling per head, to the but- 
chers ; — he has brought his breed of muir ewes to fuch per- 
fection, as often to fell his tup-hogs at a guinea per head, to 
the Highland fhepherds for brood rams:— He has fold forty 
or fifty at this rate, in a feafon. Befides the uncommon fkUi, 
which, from long experience, he muft have acquired in the 
judging of cattle and fheep •, there are certain uniform prin- 
ciples which he goes upon in grazing, which may be proper 
to mention : In the iji place, never to ftock his land fo hea- 
vily as his neighbours, or even perhaps as the land could bear ; 
by this means, his cattle have always the choice of grafs, and 
he is enabled to gather enough amongft their feet to fod- 
der them in winter. The cattle by this means are fully fed, 
which gives him the option of merchants, idly, By having 

farms 



of Ccimp/ie. 349 



farms of different complexions, he has it iri~his power to fort 
his cattle in fuch a manner, as to fuit each farm-. — He has it 
in his power to vary their food, and to change them from 
farm to farm, as he perceives them healthy, taking on flefh, 
or the contrary. In the manner of buying his cattle 

from the Highland dealers, he is very particular : he mult 
have the worfh and oldeft, draughted again and again from 
the drove, before he will purchafe it ; by this means, he ac- 
quires none but healthy cattle ; perhaps they may colt him a 
few (hillings more per head, but it is foon repaid. — Scarcely 
ever any of his cattle die ; and they are fo evenly, that it is 
hardly in the power of the butcher to challenge a bad bead ; 
by this management, his profits are uniform over the whole 
head ; whereas, when cattle are fhot, as it is termed, the pro- 
fits are grcately diminilhed. § 

We are not to imagine that the profits of graziers in our 
brae lands are very great ; when the cattle are bought in at 
Martinmas, and kept for one year in the pafture, two 
guineas per head is expected. as grafs-mail ; when bought at 
the Whitfunday market and kept till Martinmas, one guinea 
is expected per head ; when thefe profits are deficient, it is 
confidered as a bad year by the grazier ; and when they ex- 
ceed, it is confidered as good times. * 

Roads. 

§ This gentleman hath heen unfortunately killed by accident, finctr writ- 
ing this account. It happened on the 37th of May 1794, as he was attending 
onjfhccp {hearing: — Leading a fheep acrofs a wooden bridge, the rail of the 
bridge gave way; and he was thrown into the river ; falling upon a flone.he 
was killed on the fpot. 

* Notwithflanding the diftrict of Campfie feems to be fo well adapted for 
the grazing of cattle, perhaps there are fome defects attending their plan, 
which it may be proper to mention : xjl, It feems to be the misfortune of the 
Scotch in general, and particularly of the people of this dSflrift, that when

they obferve their neighbours thriving in any profeflion, they immediately 
run into it, without confidering whether they have induftry or talents to fuc- 
cced ; fuch has, of late, been ton much the cafe in the grazing line; fo that 
now, the utmoft induftry and talents can fcarcely enable them to live. The 
country banlc3 afforded abundance of credit to every adventurer ; from fuch 
a competition amongft thefe mould- be- grazier t, . the grafs-farms are too 
high rented ; the cattle are dear bought from their rearers ; and the refult 
has been, that notwithftanding the cry of the goodnefs of the times, very lit- 
tle profit has been" made by the people embarked in this profeflion ; for thefc 
t«n years paft, many bankrupcies have taken place among that clafs of men ; 
It indulges the adventurous fpirit of the people, and therefore will always be 
a favourite profeflion, let the profits be what they will, zdly, The rage for 
Highland cattle is too great, more fo than thefe cattle deferve ; it is true, 
where ground is high and much expofed, fuch cattle is more adapted for the 
paiture, than the cattle which the low country produces ; but perhaps it 
would be the intereft of the grazier, to turn all our brae- ground in lheep paf- 
ture, and the grounds of die valley into grafs farms, for lowland cattle, 
where, if once winter food were produced, and the land cither protected by 
planting, or fhades built where they might be fed with turnip in the Open 
air ; the profpecls of greater profits upon the fattening of beafts would be 
procured, than by the imperfect mode' of buying either winterers at the Down 
markets, or lean cattle at Belting, and felling them at Martinmas. $dly, 
There is another defect, which attends the piefent fyftem of grazing in thii 
country, and which tends to render the beef of Highland cattle too dear to 
the confumer ; there being no lefs than three different claffes of people who 
inuft have their profits within the year : There is the drover, who collects 
thefe cattle in fmall parcels from the rearer, and fells them at fairs, at aD ad- 
vanced price to the graziers ; the grazier, again, very often fells his cattle to 
the ioupcr, who runs them at fairs to the confumer, and fometimes exacts a 
profit almoft equal to that of the grazier : In fhort, there is too much of the 
fpirit of adventure in this profeflion, whereby both the grazier and coi;fuaf-

road at Auchinreach houfe on the Eaft, and the turnpike 
road by Strathblane to Glafgow, on the the Weft ; befides 
thefe two great lines, the turnpike road from Edinburgh to 
Glafgow by Falkirk, paffes through Campfie for two miles 5 
and there are two crofs branches which {bike off to Kirkin- 
tilloch •, fo that there are in all 20 Englifh miles of road in 
this diftri£r, i o of which are kept up by the converted fta- 
tute labour : It will be eafily believed that there are few dis- 
tricts more complicably interfered, and, it may, be added, 
fewer ftill where the reads are better kept in order The 
roads in this diftricl., before the act. for converting the ftatute 
labour took place, were miferable indeed ; for although the 
labour of ioi plough-gates, according to the mode of three 
days of a man and horfe in fpring, and as much in autumn 
for each plough, might appear adequate to the purpofe ; ftill, 
from the awkward and carelefs manner in which they 
■wrought, the roads were hardly paffable in winter j at the 
fame time, I 'am convinced that this was aa much owing to 
the want of (kill in the overfeers as to the want of dexterity 
in the labourers. As to any pofitive advantage gained to the 
public, from the converfion ac~t, 12s. per annum is by no 
means equal to the labour of fix days of a man and a horfe. 
The fum levied in this parifh varied exceedingly of late years, 
owing to the increafe of inhabitants ; every cotter or houfe- 
holder paying 2s. per annum, it hath amounted to 70I. per 
annum, 50 of which is p;iid by the farmers and landholders, 
and the other 20I. by the cottars. Till within thefe 3 years, 
this fum was expended in making and repairing, and keep- 
ing up 18 out of the 20 miles of road the parifh contains : 
Now, by one great line of road being made a turnpike, the 
whole money will be expended in future, in improving and 
keeping up 10 miles, and in making fuch crofs-cuts to the 

great

great brandies, as the farther improvement of the diftria 
ihall fugged ; one of which improvements is evident to the 
mod carelefs obfervtr ; viz. in cutting a line of road from 
Campfie kirk to the Crow road, the diftance is not much 
more than 600 yards, and yet to the people who travel to 
Stirling from this part of the county, it mud fhorten the 
road fully .5 miles. 

Confidering that the roads were made upon no determin- 
ed plan, but fometimes altering and mending the old lines, 
as circumftances occurred, it is wonderful, that in a diftria 
where the ground is fo uneven, and particularly when it is 
confidered that one of the roads crofles part of a mountain 
800 feet high, that there mould be fo few pulls in it ; feldom 
or ever is the rife more fudden than that of one foot in 20 |J.

|| As fometimes it hath been propofed to carry a turnpike road from 
Kilfyth to the military road near Buchanan houfe, the feat of the Duke of 
Montrofe, through the ftraths of Campfie, Strathblane, and Killearn; and if a 
bridge was thrown over the Lcven, at. the boat of Ballach, there cannot be 
the fmallefl doubt, that the great line of travelling from the Weft Highlands 
to Edinburgh, muft be through the valley of Campfie, it being much nearer 
than either by Glafgow or Stirling : (fince writing this account, a bill has 
paffed, qualifying the heritors of Stirlingfhire to carry this Eaft and Weft di-

through the valley on the river Blane. It may not be improper to obferve 
here, that the people who grumble moil in paying money inflead of the ftatute 
labour, are the cottars and tradefmen ; and yet they are the greater! gainers : 
They don't recollect, ihat wherever good roads exift, raw materials are eafily 
imported, and manufactured articles have ready accefs to the market : fuch 
local advantages, along with the circumftance of cheap fuel, have been the 
great rcafons of encouraging manufacturers to fettle amongft us : the truth 
j3, the public, or the truftees for the public, may be faid to have made a 
bad bargain when they agreed (as the act of Parliament eiprcfics) to 
receive two (hillings from a cottar in lieu of four days labour, although

Upon the different lines of roads, there -are no lefs than 
1 9 ftone bridges, 4 of which are. a-crofs the Kelvin. It may 
be obferved, that there are feveral old caufeways in the pa- 
rifti, on the line of road leading to the parifh church, which, 
tradition fays, were made by offenders in ancient times, by 
way of penance ; particularly the caufeways made by the fe- 
ven brothers of the name of M'Donald ; thefe (hew the ftile 
in which roads were formed in thofe early days ; as far as 
can be perceived, they confifted of one large whinftone in 
the middle, with fmaller ones on each fide in rows, the 
breadth of the road being about fix feet. There is one radi- 
cal defect attending the roads of this diftri£t ; the foil being 
gravelly, when a fudden thaw comes after a fevere froft in 
winter, the ground becomes fo fpungy, as to be almoft im- 
palpable, which can only be rectified by making a layer of 
beat whinftone below the water gravel, a practice feldom 
followed. The following table exhibits the ftate of our

Statijlical Account 



Manufactures. — At prefent the leading feature of this pa- 
rift is its manufactures : Two very extcnfivc printfields 
have been -erected within thefe nine years-, the one in the 
1785, at the French mills, ftiled the Kincaid printfield, the 
firm, Hcnderfon, Semple and Company, upon a farm which 
they have rented from the laird of Kincaid, at three pound 
per acre : They have conftructed not only the moll elegant 
machinery for the calico printfield ; but have likewife com- 
pleted a fet of works for the manufacturing all forts of grain ; 
the fall at this printfield is 22 feet ; the grounds are laid 
out with great tafte ; and in order to obtain foft pure water, 
they have dug a refcrvoir of 120 yards in length, and feven- 
ty in breadth, with a fmall ifland in the middle, planted 
with fhrubs. 

The other was erected in the year 1786, containing a farm 
annexed to it of about thirty acres ; likewife at three pound 
per acre, where works uncommonly commodious have been 
erected : The firm of this fecond, is Lindfay, Smith and 
Company ; both fields are upon a leafe of 99 years. 

Both thefe works have been carried on with fpiric, and, it 
is believed, with confiderable fuccefs. Two circumftances 
induced the manufacturers to fettle in this parifh ; viz. plen- 
ty of pit-coal, and the uncommon fupply of water in all fea- 
fons ; perhaps the circumftances of being fituated in the neigh- 
bourhood of Glafgow, and of the Canal, might not a little 
contribute to fix their choice. There are about 306 perfons, 
young and old, employed at each field ; each employs 37 
tables for block printing, and 17 copperplate prefles; they 
in general bleach their own cloth for printing. 

At the Lennox mill print-field, there is another field laid out 
for bleaching lawns, which there is every reafon to believe will 
fucceed periectlv well. The work people at the Wetter 

field, 



of Campjit: 



335 



£eld, are commodioufly lodged at the new village cf Lenox* 
town ; and at the Kincaid, or Eafter Field, feveral of the print- 
ers have feued Headings on the grounds; fo that there is eve* 
ry probability of a neat village being built, for the conve- 
nience of its fervants : At firft, (as was to be expected in 
all new works,) the operative people were a little turbulent ; 
and confidering that they were a collection from all the dif- 
ferent corners of the-country, enjoying high wages, and car- 
ried away by the licentioufnefs of the times, their turbulence 
was not to be wondered at ; but that is now all over ; and 
there are fcarce any works in the country, where the people 
behave more circumfpeclly towards their employers, and are 
more regular in their deportment. 

Thefe public works employ each of them two Excife of- 
ficers; and they pay of revenue to Government about four 
thoufand pounds each per annum. 

It may be proper to notice, that although the wages of ca- 
lico printers feem to be the higheft of any in the country; 
no doubt, when the long apprenticeship is confidered, along 
with the unwholefome nature of the work, the wages per- 
haps fhould be greater than of moft other operative people ; 
at the fame time, when it is confidered, that the higheft wa- 
ges do not always make the wealthieft tradefinan ; perhaps, 
if fome method could be fallen upon to reduce the prices, 
both the tradefman and the public would be gainers. 

The following table exhibits the prefent fituation of one 
field, as far as is known to the public. There being nearly 
the fame workmen at both, the fame table may apply to each.

It may be obferved, that as the greateft number of block 
printers at each field are apprentices, fo, of courfe, their wa- 
ges are fma!l in proportion : Their matters are only bound, 
by their indentures, to allow them 3s. per week, for the firft: 
four years, and 4s. per week, the hid three years •, but, owing 
to the brifknefs of trade for fome years by gone, it was cuf- 
tomary to allow the apprentices to wotk for as much as they 
could make, giving them the half of the journeyman's prices \ 
at prefem, the wages of the calico printers in this diftri£l are 
fome what fallen, owing to the great number of turn-overs (as 
they are termed,) from thofe fields which have flopped pay- 
ment. Whether this deprefiion of their wages fhall continue or 
not, the ebbs and flows of the trade muft determine. Thefe 
two printfields pay annually about nine thoufand pounds Ster- 
ling in wages. This p'arifh may now be faid to poffefs a 
fpirit for carrying on manufactures of different forts ; there 
being no lefs than 105 operative weavers in it ; 9 of which 
are employed by private families ; the remainder weave to the 
manufactures in Glafgow, and, as far as can be well afcer- 

taincd,

- Population. 

f It will not be improper, to take notice of a fpecies of manufacture whieh 
ha» exifted in this parifh for fome ages : We know that it was nianafaclur- 
ed, to a confiderable extent, as early as the reign of James the 6th, whicli 
goes by the name of the Campfie gray ; and was then confidered as the fta- 
ple of the country. It may be proper to defcriba it : It was fpun about the 
grift of nine cuts out of the pound of wool, each cut confining ol fixty threads, 
fix quarters long ; it was dyed a blue colour in the wool, and wove for a pen- 
ny farthing the ell, in a ten porter or two hundred reed ; they feldom made 
it broader than half an ell and a nail of dreflfed cloth ; and they fold the 
double ell from half a crown to three millings ; fo that the weaver had for the 
fingle yard little more than fifteen pence : It was fpun by the women in 
private families during the fummer ; it being cuftomary for each family to 
have two of thcfe webbs, one of which was got drcffed againft Martinma«, 
and fold to pay the matter's rent ; the other againft New-years-day, the pro- 
fits of which went to fupuly the demands of the family. The fairs of Kil- 
fyth were the great markets for the difpofal of thefe gray webs ; the fervant 
.lads ufed to collect from all the neighbouring parifhs, in order tofupply them- 
felves with fuits of Campfie Gray ; which they would eafily do, at the mo- 
derate expence of nine pounds Scots; and perhaps, few countries ever fupply- 
ed a more cheap, decent, and profitable cloathing for working people — It 
was all fpun, as it is termed, upon the mucklt wheel ; and a woman ufed to earn 
three pence per day befides her victuals : It would be improper to pafs over 
the breaking of the gray web, a fcene of joy and gaiety, which will not 
foon be forgot in this part of the country : If a private family Was to have 
their wool prepared for fpinning, a number of country laffcs were invited in 
order to card it ; they generally affembled in the barn; during the day, a 
large piece of cheefe was cut from the kebbock, and wrapt up in a white 
cloth, and hid by one of the damfels ; at the gloming, the young lads ufed to 
affemble, in order to fearch for this cheefe, and peculiarly fortunate was that: 
young man confidered to be, who ^having received a watch word from fome 
of his fair friends,) found out the cheefe, and had the opportunity of dividing 
it amongft the fimpering damfels. Both the manufactures and days of inno- 
cent amufement are gone ; nor has the manners introduced by public works 
repaired the lofs; it muft be owned, however, that fince manufactures were 
introduced, there is an uncommon degree of activity which pervades this dis- 
trict, and which accompanies the people in all their operations ; and perhaps, 
hvdeed, 1 would rather be difpofed to pronounce the character of the people 
in this place inclined to merchandife and adventure.

Statijlical Account 



Population. — This prefent year, 1 793, when the numeration 
was made) there were 25 1 7 fouls. The p pulation of this pa- 
rifh has increafed 900, fince December 1 78 3, the number then 
being 1627.' In Dr Webfter's account it is given up at 1400. 
From feveral fat~ts in the pofiefTion of the writer of this ac- 
count, the population of this parifli feems fomewhat to have 
deeclincd from the Revolution till the year 1763. The chief 
caufe which has been affigned for this circumflance, was the 
throwing feveral fmall tenements together, making one large 
farm, whereby a number of families were thrown out of bread, 
and obliged to emigrate to large towns for their daily fub- 
fiftence- The number of houfeholders or reeks, previous to 
the 1783, I cannot mark pofitively ; in that year there were 
317; population then being fomewhat better than five to a 
family ; in the prefent year, there are 609 houfeholders, or 
people who keep reeks, fo that the number of fouls have not 
increafed in the fame proportion as that of houfeholders : the 
reafon is obvious : feveral young people, printers and pencil- 
led, at the different printfields, keep houfe, either fingly, or 
perhaps, though married, have not as yet more than one 
child ; fo that the population in this parifh, even fuppofing 
the houfeholders not to increafe, is not come to its juft level. 
To fhew the proportions from the Revolution to the year 
1763, I have fubjoined the following table ; each ftatement 
containing the average of baptifms for five years :

Poor.— Every attempt hath been made by the heritors and 
fefllon todifcourage begging; as yet their efforts have proved 
abortive ; and although at this moment there is not a fingle 
perfon in this parifh underftood to be a common beggar, we 
are (till peftered with vagrants. The poor which we coun- 
tenanoe as fuch, generally relide along with their children, 
or fome near relation ; they receive their allowance on the 
firft Monday of each month ; 6s. per month is the'higheft 
fum given ; none receive lefs than three ; at an average there 
are 20 conftantly upon our lift. The funds from which they 
are paid are the collections at the church door, the mort- 
cloth fees and proclamation money, together with the inter- 
eft of 570I. of which 500I. is fecured on heritable property 
at 5 per cent intereft, payable twice in the year : The other 
70I. is lodged in bank, payable on demand in cafe of an e- 
mergency ; from thofe funds we have been able as yet to fup- 
fupply the wants of our poor. The collections at the facra- 
ment, including the preparation and the thankfgiving days, are 
applied to the relief of thofe indigent houfeholders, whofe fi- 
fituation is not fo preffing as to make them objects of the or- 
dinary charity. Although it is believed that the law allows 
kirk feffions to take poffefhon of the effects belonging to the 
paupers, 10 foon as they grant them fupply ; we have anxiouf- 
iy avoided being too ftrict in this particular ; for, callous as 
the relations of the pauper may be, it is ftill an inducement 
for them to affift a little ; whereas, if they had no profpect of 
iucceeding to the trumpery, fmall as it is, the whole care of 
their relation would be thrown upon the parifli ; and it is 
well known that i8d. per week is not adequate to all the ne- 
ceffities of lodging, clothing, and feeding a pauper. The 
Englifti fyflem is to fupport the poor, the Scotch to aflift 
them.

The feflion in this parifh has hitherto taken the complete 
management of fupplying the poor ; the heritors meet once 
in the year, or two years, as it fuits them, to examine and 
pafs their accounts ; and it may be faid here, as in every pa- 
rim in Scotland, that it is the cheapeft and beft managed pu- 
blic fund in Great Britain ; the only expence incurred with 
us is of one guinea per annum allowed to the feffion-clerk, 
for keeping the books. Befides the public parochial charity, 
there are two other charitable inftitutions, which have lately 
been founded in the parifh, the one known by the name of 
the Campfie Benevolent Society, inftituted in the year 1786, 
and whofe capital already amounts to nol. which Society 
allows 3s. to its members per week if bed-rid, and 2s. per 
week if merely incapable of work ; the other inftitution is 
connected with the Lennox-Kil winning ma Ton lodge ; its ca- 
pital is 7©1. j it likewife allows liberally to its indigent mem- 
bers. 

The annual difburfements by the feflion are between 60 
and 70I. Sterling per annum. This parifh, confidering its 
riches and its population, could afford its poor a great deal 
more, providing an affeffment took place ; the mode of pro- 
vifion by collections at the church doors, has been confider- 
ably hurt by a Relief meeting-houfe, which hath lately been 
erected in the parifh ; the collections made at thefe houfes 
being either employed to pay their minifters, or to pay the 
debts incurred in building their- chapels, none is given to fup- 
port the regular poor ; fuch houfes, therefore, upon their pre- 
fent footing, are extremely prejudicial to the Scotch mode of 
providing for the indigent || .

II From the opportunity that the writer of this account has had, as a na- 
tive of this parifh, of attending to the ftate of the poor in this diftricT: he can- 
not help taking notice of a remarkable trait of the degeneracy of the prefect 

age 



Statijlical Account 



Of the Church.— Campfie was a parfonagc ; the parfon of 
Campfie was the Sacriftan of the Cathedral of Glafgow ; of 
courfe, he muft have been one of the refidentary canons ; he 
had a houfe in the Ratten-row of Glafgow, faid to be ftill in 
exiftence ; and was accuftomed to ferve the cure at Campfie 
by a vicar. As this parifh, in Roman Catholic times, contained 
above 150 plough-gates of land, from which the parfon drew 
tithes ; the probability is, that the living was confiderable. 

Attending 

age. About 3J years ago, it would have been confidcred as difgraceful to chiU 
dren to have allowed their parents to be fupported by the feflion, or even the 
more diftant relations of brethren or nephews, to have heard of their fiftcrs or 
uncles caft upon the box, a* they termed it ; it is now aftonifhing with what 
greedinefs people receive public charity ; they fomewhat confidcr it as a pen- 
fion, to which they are entitled. It is not uncommon to perceive children 
enjoying high wages, and indulging in many of the gaieties of life, neglecting 
their aged parents : fuch unnatural conduct was not congenial once with 
Scottifh independence, and that dignified pride, which characterized our fore- 
fathers, in their more virtuous days. When a pauper dies, it is cuftomary 
for the feflion to provide the coffin and winding-fiieet, and mortdoth, gratis. 
And if there (hall be no relation of the deceafed in the parifh, to contribute for 
the little entertainment neceffary at the funeral, which feldom happens, 5s. 
is allowed for fuch expence. As it might tend to throw more light upon the 
political Gtuation of a country, to examine at what age, and what are the clafs 
of people of which the paupers of a parifh are compofed, I have fubjoined the 
following table, comprehending the different periods of admiffion, and the 
fums given.

Attending to that diftinftion of bifhops churches, and menfal 
churches, it was one of the bifhops churches gifted by 
Donald, Earl of Lennox, to the See of Glafgow, in the year 
1270. Thofe who delight in magnifying the riches of the 
church of Rome, take particular pleafure in pointing out the 
yard where the parfon of Campfie's corn-ftacks were arrang- 
ed, and the fite of the mill which was conftantly employed 
in grinding his grain. There is reafon to believe, that he was 
not the lead wealthy heritor of his parifh. Previous to the 
Reformation, we know that Lamberton and Beaton were 
parfons of Campfie, and afterwards both of them bifhops of 
St. Andrews, men who made fome figure in their day *.

• Since the Reformation, the names of the clergy who filled that charge, 
and the dates of their admiffion, have heen preferved in the presbytery re- 
cords of Glafgow ; and they furnifh us with a pretty good fpecimen of the 
fpirit of the times. There is reafon to believe, that the clergyman of this 
parifh continued Roman Catholic, and accafionally performed this facred 
function in the parifh, till the year 1572 ; he is faid to have been a branch of 
the family of Mark : about that time, we find a Mr William Erfkine, a re- 
lation likewife of the Marr family, parfon of Campfie; he was afterwards 
titular Archbifhop of Glafgow ; he is faid never to have been in holy orders ; 
Hfiw long he continued parfon of, Campfie, we know not ; but we find,

that he was fuch a remarkable ftout, well breathed man, that he could walk 
in forty minutes to the top of the Campfie Fells, eating a peafe bannock, to 
a fpot which, to this day, goes by the name of Crichton's Cairn.

dered in returning from the presbytery about Martinmas 1648; the fufpi- 
cion fell upon the laird of Balglafs, a fmall heritor in the parifh, who was ob- 
liged to fly the country to avoid punifhment. 

ttb, Mr Archibald Denniflon was ordained the 3Cth of March 1649 : He 
was depofed by the protefters in 1655, about which deposition Principal Bail- 
lie, in his letters, makes the following remark : He was reftored in the year 
1661, and died 1679; there is a traditionary anecdote mentioned of him, 
which fomewhat marks the character of the man. — In the year 1655 he had 
begun a difcourfe on a text, and half finifhed the firft head. — In the year i66r, 
when reftored, he took up the fecond, prefacing his difcourfe, by faying, that 
the times were altered, but that the dodlrines of the gofpel are always the 
fame. 

Principal Baillie, in his letters, fpeaking of Mr Dennifton fays, " he was 
" depofed by the protefters in 1655 ; for his part, he faw nothing evil of the 
« man. The protefters, fays he, put in his room a Mr John Law, a poor bax- 
f ter callon, who had but lately left his trade, and hardly knew his grammar; 
" but they faid he w as gifted." 

"jtb, Mr John Law was ordained by the protefters in 1656 : He was ejec- 
ted 1661, and was reftored 1688 ; he never officiated again in Campfie. 

8/A, Mr George Miln was inftituted 24th June 1681 : He was turned out 
at the Revolution, and was exceedingly ill ufed ; the worthlefs part of the 
parifh having rifen in. a mob and broke his furniture, and threatened his per- 
fon ; this gentleman, however, by way of retaliation, carried away the re. 
cords of the parifh. 

c/ib, Mr John Govan, who had been imprifoned in the Bafs, in James the 
7th's time, was ordained minifter of Campfie on the jth of December 1688 ; 
he died a batchelor the i;th of September 1729. 

10/i, He was fucceeded by his nephew Mr John Forrefter, a brother of 
Forrefter's of Dinovan ; he died in September I731, at the age of 2J.

Gargunnock ; he was ordained the 3d of April 1732; which gentleman was 
tranflated to Perth, and afterwards to the Canongate of Edinburgh. He' was

year 1649, an augmentation of a chalder of meal, and one 
hundred pounds Scots, was granted ; and in the 1785, a new 
augmention was granted ; fo that the ftipend now is 80 I. 
Sterling in money, two chalders of meal, and one chalder of 
barley ; It would appear, that very foon after the aft paf- 
fed, ordaining glebes to the reformed clergy, that four acres 
and a half of arable land was allocated to the minifter of 
Campfie : In the year 1646, when a disjunction and annexa- 
tion took place, three acres and a half more were allocated 
for pafture ; but, owing to the turbulence of the times which 
followed, the minifier never feems to have been in pofiHIion 
of them ; fo that at prefent the glebe of Campfie is deficient 
in pafture ; the heritors, about 30 years ago, bought an acre o£ 
land, adding it to the four acres and half, without fpecifying 
whether it was in part of pafture or not. Till lately, it was cuf- 
tomary for the minifter to ufe fome overt act to prevent pre- 
scription running againft him, anent the three acres and a 
half which had been allocated for pafture. For fome time afr 
ter the Reformation, it would appear that the clergyman had 
lived in the vicar's houfe. In 1627, a houfe was built alen- 
arly for the purpofe of lodging the minifter ; it was a fmall 
houfe of two ftories, thatched with ftraw : In 1727, a new 
houfe was built on the fame fite ; which houfe, along with the 
ocffies, was repaired in the year 1785, at the very moderate 
expence of one hundred and twenty nine pounds. The church

have therefore officiated in this parifh fince the Reformation, at leaf! fince the 
year 1581 ; which, at an average, is nearly 16 years to each incumbent ; but 
what is very aflonifhing, out of that number no lefs than five were ejected on 
account of the turbulence of the times, and one faid to have been murdered ; 
fads, which fuauld lead us to value the peaceable and happy times in whkh 
we live.

to the ufes required in the Roman Catholic times 5 it was

fmall for the parifh, if a relief meeting-houfe had not been 
erected. The kirk of Campfie, like mod of the churches in 
popifh times, is fituated at the end of the parifh whether 
this was from accident, or from choice of the clergy, to fix it 
in the mod defireable fpot, is not eafy to determine. If, how- 
ever, the population of this didricT: continues to increafe, 
there will be an abfolute neceffity of building a more com- 
modious church in a more centrical fpot, for the better ac- 
commodation of the inhabitantSi I obferved, that in the 
1649 there was a disjunction and an annexation of confi- 
derable portions of this parifh to Kilfyth and Baldernock ; it 
appears, however, by a difpute which lately took place be- 
twixt the minider of Baldernock and the heritors of Camp- 
fie, anent the augmentation of the dipend of Baldernockj 
that the part disjoined was only annexed quoad facra ; and 
the probability is, that the proportion annexed to Kilfyth is 
in the fame predicament. All the lands in the parifh are 
now valued, and the free unpropriated tithe is better thari 
600 1. Sterling annually, as the fund from which the clergy- 
men may have future augmentations. Mr Campbell of Shaw- 
field is titular, in virtue of his being the pUrchafer of the 
edate of Kilfyth, from the creditors of the York-building 
There is an opinion entertained by fome people, that if an 
aft of Parliament does not render all miniders dipendiaries, 
that on account of certain peculiar circumdances, the mini- 
der of Campfie is dill titular of the tithes.

in a decent, cheerful, and refpectable manner. — I have never 
heard either the fober, or the ferious, or the induftrious, com- 
plain ; and confidering the fimplicity of our fervice, in mofh 
other refpects, I have all along been accuftomed to, confider 
thefe public religious meetings as beneficial to the manners 
of the country. The eclefiaftical difcipline of this parifh is 
{till kept up. As for difcipline againft fornicators, two days 
doing public penance in the church, are required, befides a 
line of a crown, for each guilty perfon, to the poor. There 
has been an opinion entertained, that this public penance has 
been productive of very bad effects in fociety ; fo far has an 
idea gone forth of this fort, that, for this reafon, fome writers 
have pretended to fay, that fo long as doing public penance 
was permitted, no perfon fhould be put to death for child 
murder : I am inclined to believe, that it would be much 
more the intereft of the community, in a political light, that 
the laws of difcipline mould be more rigidly adhered to ; for 
if once the vulgar of any country, confidef incontinency as a 
venial fault, they are almoft ready for the commiflion of any 
crime ; and as I can eafily fee, that the fhame of doing penance 
operates to deter others ; in this point of View, it is to be 
confidered as anfwering the ends of edification. Public

Schools.— There are in this parifh two eflablifhed fchools. 
The parifh fchool was ereded in the year 1661, according 
to the form therein required, under the patronage of John, 
Archbifbop of Glafgow ; the legal falary was fixed at 100 
pounds Scots : Ir is remarkable, that in the deed of erection, 
there is an expref, claufe, declaring, that the fchoolmafter, in 
all time coming, fhould teach Latin 5 and that the fchool fhould 
be conftantly held at the Clachan of Campfie. There was 
another fchool erected in 1727, on a mortification of fifty 
pounds left by one Young, a pedlar in Glocefterfhire : It 
is fituated at the diflance of four Englilh miles from the o- 
ther. The heritors of Campfie have, fomehow or other, per- 
mitted the half of the falary belonging to the parifh fchool- 
mafter, to be added to the further emolument of this fchool, 
of the eaftern diftri£b.— It is to be expected, in a little time, 
this miftake will be rectified, and that the parifii fchoolmaf- 
ter will receive his legal falary ; and, at the fame time, the 
other fchoolmafl:er be fufneiently provided. Befides thefe 
two fchools, there was a third erected lately at the new vil- 
lage of Campfie, for the benefit of the inhabitants ; the teach- 
er has no falary : at the fame time, they have always found 
teachers ready to accept the office upon the bare emolument 
of the fchool wages : In the fummer feafon, in the South 
quarter of the parifh, there is commonly a fourth fchool 
taught by fome young man from Glafgow, who finds it con- 
venient to keep fchool during the vacation of the College; fo 
that at, an average, there are fomewhat above 2co childreu 
educated annually in the parifh : There are at leaft one 
fifth part at fchool of thofe who are below twelve years of 
age. The inhabitants of this parifh are, upon the whole,

rather difpofed to give their children a good education ; at the 
time this account was wrote, there were thirteen Latin fcho- 
Jars at the two parifli fchools ; the other children are certain 
of being taught to read Englifh, write and caft accompts i 
the common flyle of education is carried on in the follow- 
ing manner : They learn the founds of the letters, and the u- 
nion of fyllables, in the fmall fpelling book j then they receive 
the large fpelling book ; then they get the New Teftament, 
and the Bible, in which they commonly read fome time ; and 
then the Collection : they get a queftion in the common Gate* 
chifm to repeat every morning: there is a public repetition 
on Saturday, with a pfalm on Monday. There being feve- 
ral public works in the parifh, the night-fchool is confidera- 
ble, being wholly made up of grown perfons, who attend for 
the purpofes of writing and arithmetic, &amp;c. The wages are 
fixed for the parifh fchools by the heritors and feffion, at 1 s. 
6d. per quaiter for children, half-a-crown for writing and a- 
rithmetic, and 3s. for Latin per quarter, befides what they 
voluntarily give as a new-year's-gift. It is evident that the 
encouragemenc is too low 5 perhaps it would be the intereft 
of Government that they lhould have fome little addition of 
falary given to them ; let the wages remain as low as pof- 
fible, to induce the people to fend then- children to fchool ; 
from this circumftance of the want of encouragement, and 
like wife from being in the neighbourhood of an Univerfity, 
from whence ftudents come to be our fchoolmafters, who 
have farther profpecls, there have been no lefs than thirteen 
fchool-mafters in the parifh fchool, fince the year ^59. 
Upon the whole, I would flyle the common education of 
Scotland, partly religious, and partly philofophical ; It would 
not be our intereft to fee it violently broken in upon ; it is 
this mode of education which gives the Scotch nation fuch an 
attachment to [peculation in religion j it is only following 
•ut what they have been taught in the early period of their

Character, Morals, Genius, CsV. — The inhabitants of this 
diftri£t, during the laft, and early part of this century, were 
fomewhat confpicuous for drinking and fighting with their 
neighbours : If any perfon in this parifh, however mean his 
fituation, had received an injury or affront from an inhabi- 
tant of another parifh •, his neighbours confidered themfelves 
bound to fupport him, and to avenge his quarrel : fuch con- 
duct, however, feems to have proceeded more from pride 

and 

* The peculiar cuftoms of this parifh are fad wearing out. It was cuf- 
tomary, till within thefc few years, when any head of a family died, to invite 
the whole parifh : They were fcrved on boards in the barn, where a prayer 
was pronounced before and after the fervice, which duty was moft rcligiouf- 
3y obferved : The entertainment confided of the following parts : Firfl, there 
there was a drink of ale, then a dram, then a piece of fhort bread, then ano- 
ther dram of foine other fpecies of liquor, then a piece of currant-bread, and 
a third dram, cither of fpirits or wine, which was followed by loaves and 
cheefe, pipes and tobacco : This was the old funeral entertainment in the pa- 
rifh of Campfie, and was ftiled their fervice ; and fometiipes this was repeated, 
and was then fliled a double fervice ; and it was fure of being repeated at the 
dredgy. A funeral coft, at lead, a hundred pounds Scots, to any family who 
followed the old courfe. The moft adlivc young man was pointed out to the 
office of ferver ; and in thofe days, while the manners were fimple, and at the 
fame time ferious, it was no fmall honour to be a ferver at a burial. How- 
ever diflant any part of the parifh. was'from the place of interment, it was 
cuftomary for the attendants to carry the corpfe on hand fpokes. The mode 
of invitation to the entertainment, was by fome fpecial meffenger ; which 
was fliled bidding to the burial, the form being nearly in the following 
words : You are defired to come to fuch a one's burial to morrow, againft ten 
hours. No perfon was invited by letter : and though invited againft ten of 
the clock, the corpfe was never interred till the evening ; time not being fo 
much valued in thofe days. It was cuftomary for them to have at Jeaft two 
lyke-wakcs (the corpfe being kept two nights before the interment) where the 
young neighbours watched the corpfe, being merry or forrowful, according to 
the fituation or rank of the deceafe.d.

and ruftic gallantry, than from a fettled malevolence of dif- 
pofition. The more improved manners, and a more general 
interccurfe with fociety, have, in a great meafure, done away 
this turbulent difpofition •, ftill the natives of Campfie may be 
confidered as a keen tempered people, by no means averfe to 
expofe themfelves to bodily danger at any time : the young 
people have no objection to a military life, being fond of no- 
velty and adventure ; during the prefent war, no lefs than 28 
have enlifted in the land fervice, and feven have entered on 
board the navy ; thefe remarks chiefly apply to the lower clafs 
of people. The gentry, for at leaft thefe 4c years, have been 
remarkable for their fobriety, decent behaviour, and cecono- 
mical habits •, of courfe, they are all in profperous circum- 
ftances ; rigid ceconomy was not the virtue of their forefa- 
thers *. 

Eminent 

* About ten years ago, the fudden tranfition from ftrilr. to loofe manners 
was felt very remarkably in this parilh ; a number of wandering people, from 
different parts of the kingdom, having fettled amongft us at the different 
printfields : — people, to fay no worfe of them, not over attentive to regulari- 
ty of conduit ; thefe perfons, however, have now for the moft part, left the 
place. The more fober and induftrious have been retained ; the younger part 
ef the workmen being now natives of the pariih, and more immediately un- 
der the eye of their parents and relations — I confider therefore the morals of 
the manufalturing part of the community, as more regular than they were c- 
ven five years ago. 

The people of Campfic cannot be faid to be of a litigious difpofition : It Is 
true, from their apparent keennefs, you would be apt to imagine that they 
fhould be conftantly engaged in lawfuits.— The reverfe is the cafe : The high, 
er born and better informed cbfs of people, ftudioufly avoid litigation. A. 
mongft the other defcription of the inhabitants, much threatening, and a few 
hafty words, generally terminate the difpute. Neither writer nor meffenger 
at arms refide in the parilh ; at the fame time, confidering the number of the 
transitions which muft inevitably take place in a rich and populous diflrilr, 
(even though no law-fuit intervenes) a great deal of bufinefs is afforded to 
both profeffions. Although I could not take upon me to fay that the inhabi.

Eminent Men. — This parifh has produced no eminent men 
whofe hiftory hath arretted the attention of world, except 
Mr Bell of Antermony, a gentleman well known to the learn- 
ed, on account of his travels to China and Perfia ; this gen- 
tleman pollened an uncommon faculty for fpeaking the mo- 
dern languages of Europe ; nor was he lefs remarkable for an 
amiable fimplicity of manners, in private life, and the moft 
facred regard to truth in all he faid or did. He was a na- 
tive of Campfie, having inherited a confiderable paternal e- 
ftate : he died in the 1780, at the venerable age of 89. 

Prices of Proviftons and Labour — Provifions of every fort 
in this parifh are regulated by the Glafgow prices ; the 
common people have fuch an inveterate cuftom of carrying 
their eggs, poultry, and butter, to town, that we could of-

Appearance of the Inhabitants, and Difeafes. — The inhabi- 
tants of this diftricT: may be confidered as uncommonly 
healthy ; they are a clean limbed, well made people, rather 
lean of flefh, in general from five feet feven to fix feet high ; 
one half of the young men being above five feet ten, fcarcely 
any above fix feet : There are a few who live to a very great 
age ; although, in general, the heads of families live to the age 
of feventy ; which circumftance would induce me to ftyle 
the place more healthy than if we found extraordinary in- 
ilances of longevity : there is one circumftance to be taken 
notice of, which is, the uncommon number of accidental 
deaths, being fomewhat more than two per annum ; during 
the laft ten years there were no fewer than twenty three, f

Antiquities. — There are few in this diftrict which merit 
defcription, except two Caledonian Forts •, and even thefe 
fcarcely arreft the attention, unlefs fo far as they prove that 
the Caledonians chofe to occupy places of ftrength directly 
oppofite to the Roman wall, no doubt with the defign of 
watching the motions of the legionaries. — Thefe mounds 
are perfectly circular, with regular foffes ; the one is ftyled 
the Meiclite Reive, in the language of the country, and is a- 
bout a hundred yards in diameter : The other is ftyled the 
Maiden Caftle, about twenty yards diameter : They are both 
fituated at the foot of the Campfie Fells, to which the na- 
tives could eafily fly, if attacked ; and ly due North, at the 
diftance of two computed miles, from the peel of Kirkintil- 
loch, faid be be one of the chief Roman ftations on the wall. 

There have been feveral urns found in the parifh, contain- 
ing afhes and burnt bones ; the urns were about five inches 
in depth, and fifteen in diameter ; made of courfe clay, ap- 
parently balked in the fun ; a fpecies of freizs work encircles 
the lower edge ; they have been found in cairns, generally 
placed between two flags. 

It may not be improper to mention, that Campfie, (before 
the disjunction and annexation took place,) extended for 
eleven Englifh miles along the Roman wall ; and, of courfe, 
many fldrmifhes muft have taken place in this ftrath, betwixt 
the legionaries and Caledonians : after a particular exami- 
nation of the country, I have not the fmalleft doubt, but that 
the fecurity of this Roman barrier, depended more upon the 
almoft impaffable fwamp formed on the North Gde, than on 
the ftrength of its forts ; even at this day, it would be no dif- 
ficult matter to lay the whole valley under water from Bon- 
ny, to Balmully bridge, where Graham's dyke croflcs the ri- 
ver Kelvin : And the names of the different farms in Camp-

fie, fuch as Tnchwood, Inchtcrf, Inchbreak, and Inchbelly, 
evidently point out, that they were once furrounded by wa- 
ter : Inch, it is faid in the Gaelic language, fignifies an 
illand : thus, the Caledonians would find it impoffible to ap- 
proach the wall on foot ; and it is prefumed, that themorafs was 
not fufficiently covered by water, to permit them to crofs it in 
boats. Many people, unaquainted with the (ituation of the 
country, have exprefled furprife that the Caledonians were fo 
ignorant of the art of war, as to be unable, for fo long a time, 
to penetrate through Antoninus's wall ; the truth is, it could 
not be attacked, but at the extremities. The natives found 
it eafier to pafs over the Friths of Forth and Clyde, than to 
get acrofs the almoft impaffable fwamp oppofite to Graham's 
Dyke •, fo that when any incurfions were made into the Ro- 
man province, it is fcarcely poffible to conceive that thefe in- 
roads could take place from that quarter which is now known 
by the name of the parifh of Campfie •, from the top of the 
Barrhill, where there was a confiderable Roman Fort, any 
perfon at this day, taking a view of the country, will concur 
in the above opinion. 

About five years ago, a confiderable quantity of filver coin, 
chiefly of the coinage of Elizabeth, James and Charles I, mixfr 
with a number of Danifh and Dutch pieces, were found by 
one of the portioncrs of the lands of Birdlton, when digging 
a ditch through a morafs ; they were fuppofed to have been 
hid in the morafs, about the time when the battle of Kilfyth 
was fought betwixt Montrofe and the Covenanters ; the ma- 
. rauding parties of Montrofe's army having ftretched as far 
Weft as Birdfton, the inhabitants, flying from their depreda- 
tions, muft have hid this treafure, and have forgot where it 
\vas depofited, when they came afterwards to fearch for it.

Miscellaneous Observations. — It maybe here proper to men- 
tion a remarkable faft, which marks very much • the turbu- 
lence of the times, and the impotence of the laws, fo late as 
they ear 1 744. The father of the prefent minifter of Camp- 
fie paid "black mail to M'Grigor of Glengyle, in order to 
prevent depredations being made upon his property ; M'Gri- 
gor engaging, upon his part, to fecure him from fuffering 
by anv hardjlnp, as it was termed ; and he faithfully fulfilled 
the contract ; engaging to pay for all fheep which were car- 
ried away, if abone the number leven, which he ftyled lifting ; 
if below feven, he only confidercd it as a piking ; and for the 
honour of this warden of the Highland march, Mr John Lap- 
flie having got fifteen fheep lifted in the commencement of 
the year 1745, Mr M'Grigor actually had taken meafures to 
have their value reftored, when the rebellion broke out, and 
put an end to any further payment of black mail, and like- 
wife to Mr M'Grigor's fclf created wardenfhip of the High- 
land borders. 

The laft inftance in this diftri£t of a Baron of Regality 
exercifing the jurifdiction of pit and gallows over his depen- 
dents, is faid to have been exercifea by the Vifcount of Kil- 
fyth, in the 1 793 ; having condemned one of his own fervants 
to be hanged for dealing filver plate from the houfe of Ban- 
cloich : the fellow was executed upon a hill on the barony 
of Bancloich, ftyled the Gallow-hill ; a part of the gibbet 
was lately found lying in a fwamp, adjoining to this field of 
blood. 

Lunardi, an Italian, the celebrated aeronaut, alighted from 
one of his aerial excurfions in Campfie ; having afcended in 
a balloon from St Andrew's church yard, in the city of Glaf- 
gow, upon the 5th of December 1785. At two o'clock in the 
afternoon, he defcended in this parifh, at twenty minutes

paft two, die diftance being about ten miles ; the fpot where 
the baloon firft touched the ground was upon the property 
of Sir Archibald Edmonfton, Baronet, of Duntreath, on the 
farm of Eailer Muckcroft 

Although this parifh has been always confpicuous for its 
attachment to its fovereign •, whether of the Stewart fami- 
ly, as ia the laft century, or of the Hanoverian family, as in 
the prefent century ; having raifed a militia both in the years 
1715 and 1745, — flill I cannot help taking notice, in this 
Statifdcal Account of a remarkable fact relative to the con- 
duel: of fome of the inhabitants of this diftricT, which one 
would almoft fay contradicts the opinion of their loyalty. 
In the midlt of the moll profound peace, and, I may fay, of 
the molt unparalelled profperity ; all at once, as it were by 
inchantment, the operative part of this community conceiv- 
ed themfeives to be groaning under the moft abject flavery. 
They immediately affociated themfeives under the appella-. 
tion of the Friends of the People : The firft fociety was con- 
ftituted at the Milton of CampGe, I think, upon Thurfday 
the 8th of November 1792 ; the feeond was cqnftituted at 
New Birbiflon of Campfie, the Saturday thereafter : Two o- 
ther focieties were attempted to be formed in other parts of 
the parifh : I believe, however, they did not fucceed : The 
two former met often/ kept books, fubferibed fmall funis of 
xnonev for purchafing political pamphlets, and lent delegates 
to the different Conventions met at Edinburgh. Concerning 
the impropriety of fuch focieties, the laws of our country hath 
already given ample teltimony. It may not be improper, 
however, in the Statiftical Account of this parifh, to give 
fome defcription of the people which compofed thefe focie- 
ties : They were chiefly formed from amongft the journey- 
men and apprentices at the different print- fields, and a few 
operative weavers in the village of New Birbifton, moftly

lads from 17 years of age to 30 : There might be amongf 
them a few half educated people, whofe vanity confided in 
raifing the aftonifhment of their more ignorant companions, 
by a detail of political grievances, which had never entered 
into the hearts of the other to conceive ; various caufes co-o- 
perated to render Campfie a proper hot-bed for fuch folly. 

In the ftrfi place, a confiderable degree of licentioufnefs 
had begun to prevail in this diftrict, owing to high wages ; 
and as the influx of fuch wealth had been rather (udden, due 
Jubordination of rank was almoft totally forgot. In the 
fecotid place, a Relief meeting, about i o years ago, being e- 
recled in this parifh, which had drawn oft" a confiderable num- 
ber of people from the Eftablifhment, and rendered them, in 
fome meafure, hoftile to the the powers that be ; and I am 
doubtful but the fpirit of innovation was encouraged in a 
certain degree, by their public teachers, with a view to in- 
creafe the adherents to their own tabernacle. In the third 
place, Mr Muir, advocate, the unfortunate gentleman w"ho 
was tried for fedition, having fome connexions, and being 
well acquainted in the place, was naturally induced to try the 
power of his eloquence upon the inhabitants ; and he fucceed- 
ed. If to thefe caufes we add the particular circumftance of 
the character of young people at the different printfields \ 
men, who have abundance of time in the evenings to cabal 
together-, men, too, from their profeffion, rather given to wan- 
dering, and fond of novelty, and fomewhat naturally addic- 
ted to form affociations againft their mailer's authority; wc 
will not be furprifed that Campfie fhould be fo often men- 
tioned as friendly to thefe Jacobin focieties. 

Neverthelefs, I am entitled to fay, that the farmers and the 
inhabitants in general, (there being no fewer than 2527 
people in the parifh,) were remarkable for their loyalty, and 
attachment to Government : They very early formed them-

fclves into conftitutional focieties, for the defence of Govern- 
ment, and publilhed refolutions. Notwithstanding all the 
buftle which was occalioned by their folly, the different Ja- 
cobin foceities in this parilh altogether, never contained a- 
bove fixty perfons. 

Relative Situation of the PariJJj. — If we compare the fitua- 
tion of the inhabitants this year with certain periods, either 
in the beginning or middle of this century, it will appear re- 
markably improved. I have fubjoined a table, containing the 
molt remarkable fa£ts, relative to parifh ceconomics, taken 
at four different periods : The two firft I cannot fpeak of 
from my own obfervations ; at the fame time, from the op- 
portunities I have had of being made acquainted with them, 
as a native of this parilh, I can affirm that the fa£ts are fair- 
ly ftated. 

Year 1714. 

1 fly Only three cows faid to have been killed for winter 
beef in the whole parilh, the gentry excepted. 

2d, The wages of a manfervant for half-a-year, 9I. Scots ; 
fome of the beft get 1 2I. Scots ; a woman-fervant, 61. Scots 
for half-a-year. 

3/, No wheaten bread eat in the parifh. 

4th, No inclofure whatever in the parilh, except about gen- 
tlemen's gardens or woods. 

$th, No cart or chaife ; the gentry rode to church on horfe- 
back. 

6th, All broad ploughs, the horfes yoked abreaft. 

7th, The men wore bonnets and plaids, and plaiding waift- 
coats, and plaiding hofe ; no Englilh cloth whatever tfas 
worn by the inhabitants, the gentry excepted.

Year 1744- 

ijl, The better fort of farmers joined and got a cow for a 
winter mart, betwixt two of them ; the price then being 
thirty five or forty (hillings only for a fat cow. 

2d, No chaife was as yet kept in the parifh ; fomefew carts, 
but thefe were only ufed to carry out manure in the fpring ; 
the wheels were not (hod with iron ; and the moment the 
manure was carried out, thefe timber wheels were taken 
down till next fpring. 

3*/, Perhaps about five or fix inclofures were made in the 
parifh : it muft be owned, though few, they were moft fub- 
ftantially built ; they remain entire and firm to this day. 

4th, No wheaten bread, no Englifh cloth ufed by the in- 
habitants. 

$th, A man fervant's wages were from thirty fhillings to 
two pounds per half year ; a woman's, from nine pound Scots 
to one pound Sterling ; fervants in this period uniformly got 
a pair of hofe and Ihoes befides their fee. 

6th, No potatoes, carrots, or turnips, &amp;c. were ufed by the 
inhabitants, only a few kail were planted in their yards, for 
the pot. 

Year 1759. 

\Jl, Carts were become more numerous, there being then 
about twenty in the parifh, their wheels fhod with iron. 

id, The broad plough (till continued in many places, 
though, in general, the horfes were now yoked, two and two ; 
ftill there were no fanners for the milns or barns, the farmers 
being obliged to winnow the corn in the fields. 

2d, A man-fervant came now to receive fifty (hillings and 
three pounds Sterling per half year ; and a woman twenty 
five or thirty (hillings only per half year. 

4th, There were now two wheeled chaifes in the parifh ; 
and Englifh cloth began to be worn occafionally by the bet- 
ter

ter fort of people, along with worfted (lockings, and buckle^ 
in then* fhoes. 

$tb y Potatoes dill were only cultivated in lazy beds. 

6tb, Very decent farmers thought it neceflary to have fome 
part of a fat cow or a few fheep falted up for winter (lore. 

7//', By the leafes granted by the proprietors of land at this 
time, the tenants were taken bound to inclofe fome part of 
the farm ; {till there was no fown grafs in the parifli, and the 
cattle grazed promifcoufly in the winter fenfon. 

%th, There were no clocks in the parifli, except in the houfes 
of the gentry and principal inhabitants. 

Year 1794. 

t/7, There are nearly two hundred carts in the parifli, per- 
fectly equipped for any draught. 

idy There are four poft-chaifes, and three coaches, and one 
two wheeled chaife, kept by the gentry, in the proper ftyle. 

3J, The wages of a man-fervant is betwixt five pounds and 
fix pounds per half year ; and a woman's from two to three 
pounds ditto. 

4//-, Potatoes is now univerfally ufed by all ranks of peo- 
ple, for at leaft fix months in the year.

scription of people ; there being no lefs than two bakers fta- 
tionary in the parifli, befides fome hundred pounds value of 
wheaten bread brought annually from Kirkintilloch and Glaf- 
gow.

annually about the Martinmafs time for winter provifion ;

jth, Every lad now drefles in English cloaths and fancy vcfls, 
with thread or cotton {lockings ; and every girl in cotton (luff, 
black filk cloaks and fancy bonnets. 

$t/:, The quantity of liquor drunk in the feventeen pub- 
lic houfes in this parifh muft be very great indeed ; as, I 
have been told that four and five pounds, at a reckoning, have 
been collected from a company of journeymen and apprenti- 
ces on a pay night. 

o/£, The houfes of every decent inhabitant of this parifh, 
confift at leaft of a kitchen and one room, generally two 
rooms, ceiled above, and often laid with deal floors, with ele- 
'gant glafs windows ; and I believe, few of the tradefmen fit 
down to dinner without fiefh meat on the table, and malt li- 
quor to drink ; Such is the relative fituation of a parifh in 
the year 1794, when fome defigning people ufed every ef- 
fort to convince them, that they were poor, and miferable, 
and enjlaved. 

Advantages and Disadvantages. — The advantages of this 
pa'/ifh have been confidered as of a very fuperior kind : The 
foil is naturally dry ; the ftreams of water for bleaching and 
driving machinery are numerous ; the quantity of coal and 
lime is inexhauftible •, it is completely interfered by excellent 
roads ; and, it is believed, that it is able to fupply itfelf ' with 
all the necefiaries of life j and, confidering the number of 
ftrangers which take up their refidence amongft us, we are led 
to believe, that few places are more, comfortable to the inferior 
clafs of people ; Glafgow affording a ready market for the 
produce both of their farms and their induftry. 

On the other hand, it may be confidered as one of the dear- 
eft places in Scotland for all forts of living, and particularly 
fo for thofe who live upon fixed incomes 5 and I am likewife

inclined to believe, from the turn that the young people have 
taken to manufacture*, that farmers have father found it dif- 
ficult to procure fervants and labourers for the pu^pofes of 
cultivating the land : Perh ips it will be the intereft both of the 
landlords and the farmers, to fall upon fome mode of mana- 
gement which may counteract this growing evil.

Extent and Situation* 

X he I Hand of Stronfay is five computed miles long, and al- 
inaoft as broad from Eaft to Weft, fo indented with bays, that 
there is no part of the ifland above one mile from the fea. 
This, with the fmall ifland of Papa, the extent of which, 
round the fhores, is about three miles ; and with the Holms, 
or pafture iflands, comprehends what is now termed the pa- 
tifh of Stronfay. The ifland of Eday, which is about the 
centre of the North ifles of Orkney, has rapid tides, which 
wafh the Eaft and Weft tides of it ; thefe occafion eddies 
«n the North and South ends, to which circumftance, it pro«

bably owes its name. It is computed to be five miles long, 
and nearly a mile and a half broad f 

Via Coaft, Harbours, fcV.— The ifland of Stronfay has fix 
principal ncffcs ; viz. Huipsnefs, Gricenefs, Odnefs, Lam- 
nefs, Tornefs, and Linksnefs. The refemblance in found 
which two of thefe, Tornefs and Odnefs, have to Thor and 
Woden, the Teutonic Deities, leaves room to conjecture their 
derivation. 

There are two promontories, Borrowhead on the South 
Eaft, and Rothesholm (Ronfum) head on the South Weft; 
this was of old called Rodneip or Rodnumhead. 

The other parts of fea coaft or fhores about this ifland, con- 
fift partly of three fandy bays ; one on the Eaft, the Miln- 
bay ; one on the South, the bay of Holland ; and one on 
Weft, the bay of Erigarth or Weft Wick. The fandy beaches 
of the two firft mentioned, extend each a mile in length ; 
that of the laft not fo much, except at low water of fpring 
tides ; and confift partly of fkerries, (flat rocks, over which 
the fea flows and ebbs ;) which, with the fhores of the nefles, 

and 

f This, with the Ifle of Fairay, which is about one mile long, and lefsthau 
half a mile broad, and with the Holmes, comprehends the parifh of Eday. 
To the parifh of Stronfay, the four holms called Aulkcrry, Mukle Linga or 
Holm of Midgarth, Little Linga and Holm of Huip, do belong ; and to the 
parifh of Eday five; viz, Calf ol Eday, Mukle Green Holm, Little Green 
Holm, Holm of Fairay and Red-holm. So the number of iflands, great; 
aikl fmall, in this diftrict, amounts to no lefs than thirteen. This diftrict ha» 
the ifland of Sanday on the North, the Fair Ifle on the North Eaft ; (at the 
nianfe, fituated on the N. E. fide of Stronfay, this ifle may be dirtindtly feen, 
when the fky is char and wind eafterly, although about thirty fix miles dif- 
tant ;) the German Ocean on the Eaft, the united parilhes of Deernefs and 
St. Andrews on the South ; the parifh of Shapinflcay on the South Weft ; 
the united parifties of Renfay and Eglifhay on the Weft j and the united pa- 
rilhes of Weftray and Fapa Wcftray, cn the North Weft.

ami South Weft promontory above mentioned, produces 
great quantities of tajig, or fea-weed, fit for the kelp manu. 
future. 

On the Eaft fide of the ifland, little kelp can be made, as 
few fkerries ly there to produce tang. The water is deep 
nigh the fhore, and the rocks abrupt, owing perhaps to their 
having no flicker from the German Ocean. 

The ridge or rifing ground, which runs almoft the length 
of the ifland from North to South, hath its furface. covered 
with fliort heath, where it has not been cut up lately for tur£ 
or feuel ; the foil is a dry, friable, blackifh earth ; the bottom 
clay, mixed with fmall ftones, and in many places gravelly 
and fhallow. The expence of cultivating fuch a fubject, 
might perhaps nearly equal its value when improved- It is 
the common pafture or out-freedom of all the farms and 
houfes adjacent to it. The Mill-dam divides this from the 
common pafture of the farms on the Eaft fide of the ifland, 
which common is covered with grafs of a mean quality ; but 
as it has g" eater deepnefs of foil than the other common, and 
a bottom of tough clay, it might probably recompence more 
liberally the labour and expence of the improver t. 

The 

| Of , old, the corn fields, and fuch grafs as was efteemed valuable, on this 
ifland, were feparated from the commons, nowdel'cribed.by hill-dykes, (as they 
are ufually termed,) built of feal or turf, which are kept up through Ork- 
ney in general to this day. A confiderable proportion of the hill-dykes of this 
ifland were fuffered to fall into dil'repair, about thirty years ago, by the ad- 
vice of Thomas Balfour, of Huip, an heritor in this ifland, who died about 
feven years ago. He was of opinion, that the eipence of keeping up theic 
dykes, was greater than the advantage derived from them ; but this opinion 
is not univerfally acquiefced in by the inhabitants. 

All the neffes above mentioned, except Linkfnefs, (of which under the ar- 
ticle ftate of agriculture, &amp;c.) are appropriated for fheep pafture, on the ref- 
peelive ifthnuifles of which nefles, hill-dykes are frill kept in repair, to prevent

The ifland of Eday, conning chiefly of hills of a mode-

ceeding,) i n which, a great proportion of its rent is charged 
in butter and flefh. Three fourths of it, at leaft, confift of 
out-freedom, or common pafture, to this day j this common 
is covered moftly with heather, which, in fome places, though 
not in general, is pretty long, and is divided from the grafs

fheep have no herds ;) but, during the winter, and more than half the fpring, 
they have full freedom to graze at large over the ifland. Borrowhead, and 
Rothesholm are alio flieep walks ; the latter of which, being of great extent, 
comprehends the whole peat mofs in the ifland of Stronfay, from which mofs 
the inhabitants have, for time immemorial, been in ufe to caft peats or turf 
for firing, on paying a fmall acknowledgement in money or fervices, to the 
tenant or pofieffor of the farm of Rothesholm. 

The commons, and fheep pafture above defcribed, are reckoned to be near- 
ly two thirds of the whole ifland. The other third forms the flcirts or bor- 
ders of it ; where Nature's Ample variety hath hitherto been but little en- 
croached on by the regular uniformity of art. Corn fields, of different fhapes 
and fizes, which fields, no man living ever faw in pafture, interfperfed with 
a proportional extent of grafs of different qualities, grafs which bears no 
traces of having ever been in tillage ; thefe exhibit a fccne not unpleafant, 
in the months of fummer and harveft. 

The fields too, of natural grafs, even in winter, retain a degree of lively 
verdure, fuperior to thofe in many of the interior parts of Scotland. It is ob- 
fervable, that the flatter any of thofe iflands are found to be, the better, ufu- 
ally, is the quality of their grafs, and the more lively their verdure.

the South Weft and North fides, hold, from 40 to ten fathoms. The water, 
though not very deep, wafhes the feet of thefe precipices. The remaining 
parts of fea coaft are low rocks or flc. Tries, covered with tang, of which a 
confiderablc quantity of kelp is manufactured annually. Eday lies Weft from 
Stronfay. The found which fcparates thefe iflands is about three miles over 
at the Ferry. 

Fairay lies Weft from Enay, at the diftance of a mile and half, the Weft 
fide of which is expofed to the Atlantic Ocean, which rufhes with great ra« 
pidity through Weftray Firth : This inlet of fea feparates the iflands of Weftv 
ray on the North, and Roufay on the South : From this canfe, the ifland of 
Fairay is much expofed to have its crops of grain damaged by the fpray of 
the fea. This ifland, and two holms appertaining to it, arc well adapted for 
the pafture of cattle or fheep; and tang grows on fome of its fhores, for the 
manufacture of kelp. 

The three holmes which belong to the ifland of Eday ; and the four which 
belong to the ifland of Stronfay, do all produce excellent pafture for fheep, 
for fome fmall horfes and for black cattle, which the tenants tranfport by

State of Property. — The iflands of Orkney anciently belong- 
ed to the King of Denmark and Norway ; but on the mar- 
riage of Margaret, the princefs royal, about the year 1468, to 
the King of Scotland, with whom he was to receive 50,00a 
florins of the Rhine ; the iflands of Orkney and Shetland 
were mortgaged for that fum, and afterwards annexed to the 
Crown of Scotland. It was fcipulated, that the laws and pri- 
vileges of the inhabitants fhould remain inviolable. 

That fome traces of the manners, cuftoms, language, and 
laws of the Norwegians, are ftill to be found in thefe iflands, 
may be naturally expected ; owing to which, improvements 
in farming, and, other arts, have been feverely checked or 
much retarded ; and the ftate of property, of courfe, influen- 
ced in no fmall degree, even to this day. 

Heritable property in Orkney may be confidered as divid- 
ed into Kings lands, kirk lands, and udal lands. The whole 
rents of the firft mentioned, being demefne lands, were an- 
ciently 



of Stron fay and Eda}. 393 



' c'.ently paid to the fovereign : Thefe, in procefs of time, were 
feued by the Crown or its donators, in parcels to the tenants, 
or others who had intereft to procure them ; which feus they 
in general obtained for payment of the old rental. In fomc 
inftances, for a fmall augmentation of the rental ; and in o- 
thers, with a deduftion therefrom : the reafon affigned for 
which laft, is, the lands were dear, and like to ly ley for 

want of tenants. 

The kirk lands were in fimilar circumftances, and were 
feued in like manner of old, by ecclefiaftics or church- men, 
for the old rental or thereby. Some of the udal lands pay 
a fmall proportioif of yearly rent to the King, and to the 
kirk •, and fome of them do not pay any thing to one or to the 
ther. Inftances of all thefe fpecialities are to be found in.

* The truth of thefe obfervations will appear, by examining a complete 
rental book, of the whole lands in Orkney and Shetland, made up in 1598, 
by James Law, bifhop of Orkney, which was entered and rented in Exche- 
quer, on the 1 8th November 1617, and is ftill eictant in the Regifter Office. 
More than ao years after faid rental was made up, namely, in the year i6ar, 
Orkney heritors were denominated, in their public record?, to be " mean 
" men, and farmourers, and payers of the riggs of the rental." They had con- 
tinued, it feems, topoffefs the farms, or parcels of lands, which they and their 

* 

forefathers had feued, or had let them to their principal fervants, or depen- 
dents, with the fteel-bow ; that is, the flocking of the farms, fuch as horfes, 
black cattle, fhsep, labouring inftruments, and even houfehold furniture. For 
which farms and fteel-bow, tenants of this defcription become bound to pay 
the old rental, or feu-duty, and fuch additional rent as the land could bear. 
At this period, and long after, the feuers lived in terms of focial intercourfe 
and familiarity witli their tenants; for maintaining and perpetuating of which, 
annual entertainments, confiding of the beft viands which the farms pro- 
duced, were chearfully given by the tenants to their landlords, during the 
Chriftmas holy days : Thefe entertainments, called bummacks, ftrengthened 
and confirmed the bonds of mutual confidence, attachment, and regard^

The pradicc adopted by many, of giving fhort leaks of 
of farms, by others of giving no lc;ifcs, and by all of giving 
very fcanty encouragement to meliorate the foil, on the part 
of the heritors ; and, on the part of the tenants, a pertinacious 
adherence to old cuitoms, and to the method of farming ufed 
in Orkney, more than a hundred years age, have hitherto 
been found great obftru&amp;ions to improvements in Agricul- 
ture. 

Many Orkney cftates are of fmall extent : Parcels of land, 
belonging to one heritor, ly interiperfed, or run-rig with 
thofe belonging to other heritors, one or more. The udal

Mamifafture 

Which, on the part of the tenants, the following practice was introduced; 
The tenants wives went regularly, about the term of Lammas, to the 
feaars wives, their landladies, with prcfents of butter, cheefe, eggs, &amp;c. 
hence called Lammas prefents. The Chriftmas bummacks are almoft. uni- 
verfally difcontinued ; but, in fome inftances, the heritors have, in lieu of ac- 
cepting fuch entertainments, fubftituted a certain quantity of meal and malt 
to be paid to them annually by the tenants. The practice of giving annual 
prefents at Lammas is not univerfally kept up by the tenants wives ; but 
there arc not wanting inftances where it is flill found to fubfift. 

Heritors and tenants are now become more wealthy than their anceftors. 
The fteel-bow, or ftocking on the farms, hath, in general, been purchafed by 
the tenants, and a recent influx of wealth, chiefly owing to the manufacture 
of kelp, hath occafioned a very great change in this country, on the ftate of 
landed property, mode of living, and manners of the inhabitants.

Manuf aft ure of Kelp— This valuable, and, as it may now 
be confidered, ftaple commodity of Orkney, (was firft of all 
in this county manufactured in the ifland of Stronfay, by 
James Fea, heritable proprietor of Whitehall,) and Wadfet- 
ter of North Strynrie, in the year. 1722, This was a gentle- 
man of an enterprifing fpirit, who brought a man of the name 
of Meldrum, from Frafersburgh, to introduce help burning 
in Orkney ; Meldrum, taking the Orkney inhabitants to be an 
ignorant and fuperflitious race of men, pretended that the kelp 
allies would not acquire fuch a hard and folid confidence as 
was requifite, unlefs a certain powder was thrown into the 
kelp kilne before it was raked, accompanied with certain myf- 
terious words, to the ufe of which powder and myfterious 
words, he claimed an exclufive right in that ifland. 

He, however, foon found, that the inhabitants of Stronfay 
had more penetration and lefs fuperftition, than to be long 
hood-winked in this manner •, for they found, on trial, that the

tie, fwine, &amp;c. in fummer and harveft ; is ftill adhered to more or lefs, in 
moll of the Orkney iflands. The general cuftom of allowing their corn land 
to ly unmolefted, during the winter, and until the weather fets in fair in 
fpring, which it feldom does before March or April ; after which, their whole 
agricultural labour muft be executed, before the kelp feafon begins, in the 
month of May, or be done afterwards in a very fuperficial manner ; from 
which caufes, an extra number of fervants and horfes become neceflary, 
which tends greatly to increafe the expence of labour to the Orkney 
farmer. The confiderable heritors in Orkney, with very few exceptions, 
have either removed with their families, from their manfions in the country! 
to refide in Kirkwall, the only Royal Burgh in Orkney; or have, with.thdr 
familics, left the county altogether ; and therefore, they find few, opportuni- 
ties of attending to the proceedings or rewarding the meritorious exertions 
of their tenants. From thefe circumftances, the prefent unimproved ftate of 
the country in general, may be cafily accounted for. 

Inftcad of improving the foil, the heritors and tenants in Orkney, have 
for many years paft, directed their attention to the manufacture of kelp.

kelp afhes, merely by the iJbour ufually adhibited pofterior 
to this myftical application, became equally folid and good 
in quality, without, as with the aid of the magical words and 
powder. 

This commodity fold for feveral years pofterior to the 
date before mentioned, to a bottle-maker at Newcaftle, for 
3 I. Sterling per ton of 20 cwt.' ; but the- manufacturers, 
or their employers, deiirous to make as much as poflible by 
this new concern, began to adulterate the kelp alhes, by mix- 
ing fmall ftones or fand therewith ; which impofition being 
foon difcovered, the price was reduced to 2I. 10 s., and the 
ton fixed at 21 cwt., which hath ever fince been held the 
the weight of a ton of kelp. The laft mentioned price con- 
tinued for about 20 years, to be the rate for which it fold, 
at an average j during which period, the annual quantity did 
not exceed 400 tons. 

In the year 1744, kelp fell fo low, that Mr Thomas Bal- 
four, then a merchant, and afterwards heritor of the lands 
of Huip and others in Stronfay, boughr a fmall cargo of it, v 
at 20 s. and 20 s. 6d. per ton in Orkney, carried it to New- 
caftle, and fold it there for the current prices ; and, on ba- 
lancing accompts, found, that he had loft 15 per cent by the 
adventure; as the author hath often heard him declare. 
For nineteen years afterwards, the average quantity was a- 
bout 700 tons, price 2 1. 10 s. The heritors of this diftri£t 
had about one tenth of the whole quantity annually made in 
Orkney ; for each ton of which, the heritors drew about 20s. 
the makers and purchafers the remainder. 

In 1763, and for 15 years following, the average quantity 
made annually in Orkney, was 1800 tons. Of which, the 
heritors in this diftricl: have about 1 So.

nual average price at market was 4I. 4 *• Sterling •, the price 
of making was raifecl to about 26 s. and freight 12 s. per 
ton. 

The heritors and kelp proprietors of this diftrict, drew an- 
nually about 350 IS The tenants and makers about 230 1. The 
remainder went for freight and commiffion. 

In 1778, and for fourteen years after, the average quanti- 
ty annually burnt in Orkney, was 3000 tons, at 6 1. per ton. 
The heritors of this diftricl had about 300. The price of 
making was raifed to 1 1. 15 s. per ton, of which rife the 
tenants chiefly reaped the benefit. The heritors and kelp 
proprietors of this diftricl, drew annnally about 1050 1. The 
tenants 527 1. The remainder went for freight and com- 
.miffion. 

In 1792, the extraordinary good feafon for the growth of 
fea weeds, of which kelp is made, and for the manufactur- 
ing of it, produced in this diftricl, to the incumbent's certain 
knowledge or beft information, no lefs a quantity than 400 
tons ; when, at the fame time, the whole Orkney iflands did 
. not produce above 4,000 tons. It is in this ratio, therefore, 
that he has calculated the produce of this diftricl: from the 
year 1 744, during the feveral fubfequent periods above fpe- 
cified, and 60 tons, the average quantity annually produced 
preceding that date ; which, in the earlieft period, is a fome- 
what larger proportion, which Stronfay (where kelp was 
firft manufactured in Orkney,) may reafonably be fuppofed 
to have produced. 

In 1793, the feafon proved rainy and unfavourable for 
kelp. This diftricl: did not produce above 300 tons, price 
in Orkney 4 1. per ton. The heritors and kelp proprietors 
drew 775 1. ; the tenants and kelp makers, 525 1. Sterling, 
clear of all deductions, being in the fame proportions as 
the year preceding.

This feafon, 1794, being remarkably favourable for kelp 
burning, promifes an abundant crop in Orkney, which may 
equal, or perhaps exceed that of 1792. 

The quantities of kelp made, with the average prices at 
the different periods above fpecified, are taken, in a great mea- 
fure, from the information given by the Orkney gentlemen 
in the year 1766 to Mr M'Tavifh, who was directed by the 
Board of Truftees to procure information refpe&amp;ing that 
and many other particulars*. 

Agriculture. 

* By the above ftate it appears, that the heritors and parifhioners of thi3 
difhicl, havt drawn from kelp, fince the manufacture of it was introduced 
by James Fea of Whitehall, in the year I722, no lefs a Ami than 29,197 L 
10 s. during a period of 71 years j being 41 year-- purchafe of the whoie diflrict 
at the prefent grofs rent. Thofe of the other iflands of Orkney have drawn 
nine times as much money; that is, 262,777 1. 10 s., being 36 years purchafe 
of thefe iflands, at the prefent grofs rent; both fums amount to 291,976 1. 
Sterling, which is more than 36 years purchafe of all the iflands of Orkney ; 
the grofs rent of which is only about 8,000 1. Sterling annnually. 

In thefe calculations, the profits and advantages accruing to the traders and 
others in Orkney, by carrying this commodity to market, are not included. 
When,'however, it is confideied, that the fliips belonging to Orkney have been 
almoft the only carriers of ic for many years paft, the profits and other ad- 
vantages derived from this branch of trade ill thefe iflands, muft not only 
have been great to them as individuals, but alfo of 110 fmall importance to 
the nation at large, by extending its commerce, increafing its wealth, and 
producing a nurfery of excellent feamen. 

On this fubjecl, the following remark, to many readers, will, it isprefumcd, 
naturally occur : That James Fea of Whitehall, of the ifland of Stronfay, in 
Orkney, (that is the name and defignation of the man, who introduced fo 
valuable a manufacture into his native country,)' ought not only to be kept in 
remembrance, but that fome permanent teflimony of gratitude, from thofe 
who have reaped and flill do reap fuch important advantages from his fpirit- 
ed exertions, ought to be devifed, in honour to his memory, and for the 
encouragement of afpiring genius in fucceeding ages. Premuims of this na- 
ture, conferred by focietics, by diftri&amp;s, or by the public, honourable as they 
tinqueftionably would be to the memory of thofe on whom they were con- 
ferred, would certainly be no lefs creditable to thofe who beftowed then*.

• Agriculture. — The vicinity of all. the cultivated lands in 
this diftricT: to the fea fhore, induced of old and ftill induces 
the inhabitants to ufe fea-weed as their chief, and almoft on- 
ly manure. The great quantities of it thrown into their nu- 
merous bays, creeks, and about their nefies, enabled them 
to adopt a practice which is ftill continued, of putting one 
half of their laboured land to bear or bigg, 'which half they 
put to oats the year following ; this fhort rotation they have 
continued for time immemorial. They lay their houfe dung 
on the land defigned for bear, ufually before Chriftmas ; the 
field on which this is laid, they keep perpetually at bear, ex- 
cept once in fix or feven years, when it becomes too rich 
and fpungy •, they then having kept back the manure, take 
a fingle crop of oats, and go on as before with bear crops. 
The fide plough, with four horfes abreaft, or in broad band, 
is moft generally ufed. The plough-boy walks with a retro- 
gade motion, having his face towards the horfes faces. The 
extent of field which fuch a plough labours, is about fifteen 
acres Scots meafure. 

The number of returns of oats is from three to four, and 
of bear from five to fix feeds, at an average. Potatoes were 
not generally planted fifteen years ago, when the prefent in- 
cumbent was admitted minifter ; and, where they were planted, 
it was on the green fward, in the lazy bed way. Thefe are cul- 
tivated more generally, and are ufually planted after the 
plough, in land which has been long in tillage. They thrive 
well, when kept clean from weeds. Few farmers have as yet 
been induced to plant them at fo great a diftance as to ad- 
mit of their being horfe hoed or cleaned by the plough ; ?, 
fuccefsful example in this way, neverthelefs, hath more than 
once been exhibited to them. Clover and rye-grafs feeds, 
during the period before mentioned, have been fown as a hay

for want of proper encouragement * . 

The 

• Thomas Balfour, before mentioned, after purchafing the eftate of Huip, 
in the ifland of Stronfay, began about thirty years ago, to make fome improve- 
ments in agriculture, particularly on his lands of Linknefs above defcribed, 
which had previoufly been ufed only as fheep patture. He erected a (leading 
of houfes there, with a view of turning it into a corn farm, induced no doubt 
by the great quantities of ware of fea-weeds for manure thrown upon the 
fhores of it annually. The foil was ihallow and poor, for much of it had, be- 
fore that period, been cut up for fuel or firing for cottars and fub- tenants. As 
it had a clay bottom, tolerable crops, when feafons were good, and manure 
plenty, were produced ; but a feries of bad feafons having fucceeded the year 
1776, the heritor, after managing this new farm by fervants on his own ac- 
count, for ten or twelve years, was pleafed to let it to a tenant, together with 
a much larger farm, of which it originally was a fhecp-paftuie-pendicle : But 
the farmer having found that Linkfnefs, by being kept in tillage, did not give 
returns fufficieht to indemnify him for the expence of labouring it, owing to 
a feries of bad feafons and other unfavourable circumftances, thought proper 
to allow it to revert to its former flate of natural grafs, nbt much mended 
as to quality ; in which ftate it remains to this day. Mr Balfour, with a 
view to improve other parts of his eftate in Stronfay, inclofed with earthen 
fences, to the extent of about 50 acres Scots meafure ; and, adjacent thereto, 
built a Heading of farm houfes : But as thefe acres lay at a much greater dif* 
tance from fca weeds than the farm of Linkfnefs, and moreover had no title 
to fuch weeds for manure, but by favour of the farmers who had immemori- 
ally poffeffed the privilege of carrying them off to lay on their corn fields, a 
different mode of farming from that ufed in the ifland of Stronfay behoved to 
be adopted, and carried on, under the direction of a farmer or overfeer brought 
from a part of the country, where equal difadvantages fubfifted. This was 
done for a confiderable number of years; but this laudable attempt failed of 
fuccel's. 

Mr Balfour had fuch influence in this ifland, that, by his advice and exam- 
ple, he induced fome farmers on other eftates to inclofe parcels of their paf- 
ture grounds in like manner as he had done ; thefe farmers, however, did not 
make any attempts to cultivate or improve the grounds which they had thus 
inclofed, prudently and patiently waiting the iffue of Mr Balfour's experiments 
in this way. 

Robert 



of Stronfay and Eclay. 



The family of Tankernefs, one of the mod ancient among 
the heritor? of this diftriclj began, about 40 years ago, to give 
a Ieafe of their lands in Eday, and pafture iflands, pertinents 
thereof, being the whole heritage they now poffefs in this 
diftrict, to tenants for the fpace of nineteen years •, viz. to a 
tenant named John Murray, and to his fon James, who re- 
newed it for other nineteen years, which laft leafe being 
nearly expired, he hath again renewed it for thirty years ; on 
the condition of paying a fpecies of rent, which in other 
counties would be deemed lingular ; namely, a certain quan- 
tity, (30 or 35 tons) of kelp yearly. His prefent landlord, 
Robert Baikie of Tankerriefs, is a polite, well informed, hof- 
pitable country gentleman, who had the honour to be return- 
ed a member of the Houfe of Commons, to rcprefertt his na- 
tive county, at the laft general election fave one. This ten- 
ant hath built hundreds of fathoms of {lone dykes for inclo- 
fures ; hath repaired the farm houfes at a great expence ; 
Fome part of which, however, hath been defrayed by his land- 
lord ; and he hath made improvements on this farm by rear- 
ing more cattle, and of a better fort than in former years ; by 
introducing the Scotch or two ftilted plough, in ftead of

Robert Laing, another merchant in Kirkwall, did alio purchafe an eftat.e. 
lying partly in Stronfay and partly in Eday, about 24 years ago. 

He gave funic encouragement, to his tenant in North Strynzie, and Stronfay, 
to make improvements ; this he did by engaging to pay part of the expence 
of inclofing certain parcels of that farm with ftone dykes. Thefe material? 
being more valuable than turf, and the grounds thus inclofed of a fuperior 
quality to fuch as were inclofed by Mr Balfour, rendered the benefit thus 
arifing from inclofing grafs fields greater and more permanent. This tenant, 
induced, in fome degree, perhaps, by the example and advice of his neighbour 
the minifter, began lately to inclofe a few acres of laboured land, which he 
intend) to prepare, withouc defciy, for laying down with grafs feeds, for hay 
and pafture.

together afiile ; he hath made experiments by levelling and 
improving uneven grounds, {owing grafs ferds, &amp;c. which 
might perhaps entitle him to be ranked among fkilful and 
fjpirited farmers in any part of Scotland. 

Two other heritors of this diftri£r, merely by extending 
their tenants leafes to twenty four years, without binding 
themfelves to reimburfe to their tenants any expence laid out 
on improvements, and without taking their tenants bound to 
Jay out fuch expence, have the fatisfa£lion to find a fpirit of 
enterprife breaking the fetters o,f inveterate practices, which 
have been long ago exploded from other parts of Scotland ; 
and gradually introducing the more pleafant and profitable 
ones of inclofmg, fowing grafs feeds, making hay, feeding 
cattle, &amp;c. and even of repairing, at the tenant's expence, the 
farm houfes, in a manner at once ufeful and commodious to 
the tenant, eafy and advantageous to the heritor. Gilbert 
Mafon, merchant in Edinburgh, late proprietor of Rothes- 
holm, now of Mordum ; and Andrew Liddle merchant in, 
and one of the baillies of Kirkwall, now deceafed, deferve 
to be mentioned with honour, as heritors who gave thefe 
leafes fome years ago to their tenants, and their tenants have

ago, by Mr John Scollay the proprietor, to Edward Chalmers the tenant, who 
has' erected an earthen fence to indofe eight or nine acres of ground, which 
was partly in tillage and partly in natural grafe. He has not only begun 
to fow grafs feeds, of which his farm ftands much in need for paflure, but he 
has removed the farm houfes to a much more convenient fituation than they 
occupied when he entered upon the poffeflion An allowance was in-

laboured by one plough, rent from 5 1. to 8 1. In fome inftan- 
ces, two or more tenants join to make one plough to labour 
iheir fmall farms \ and there are many fmall pendicles, par- 
ticularly in the ifland of Eday, the poffeffors of which, in- 
ftead of ufing a plough, delve the whole of their fmall farms 
with the fpade ; and even the harrow is frequently dragged 
by thefe tenants or by their wives or their children.

very fpirited manner, during the currency of a fhort leafe, expended a confi- 
derable fum for his own interim accommodation, and for the permanent bene- 
fit of the farm. 

* An enquiry into the caufes which contributed to fruflrate fome of thofe 
which were made, particularly by Mr Balfour, (from patriotic, it is believed, 
more than felfifh motive?,) might be intcrefting and ufeful, if the inquiry 
was made by one duly qualified for the tafk : but as there i3 little probability, 
at prefent, that this will engage the attention offuch an one, unfkillcd and 
unexperienced as the writer may be held, he will pre fume on the liberty to 
mention briefly fuch as appear to him to have opeiated in this way : iy?, The 
fubjedls feledled for improvement Were of a poor quality ; fuch, it is appre- 
hended, require fkilful management, great experience, and no little ex- 
pence to render fuccefsful any attempts to improve them to advantage. Mr 
Balfour was, indeed, an experienced merchant, an intelligent, patriotic, and 
moft hofpitable gentleman ; but, although, he had occafionally paffed through 
many counties in Britain, and had been in other parts of Europe, yet it 
will be admitted, that he could not rank as a practical farmer. Befides, he 
lived in the town of Kirkwall, at about 15 miles diflance by fea from the pla- 
ces in Stronfay where bis improvements were carried on. %dly, The labour-

gers, were averfe to innovations, and defpifed a mode of farming different in 
fome refpects from that to which they and their progenitors had immcmorially 
been inured. The general opinion of the inhabitants, it is natural to conjec- 
ture, had its weight with Mr Balfour's fervants, all of whom, being natives 
ri Stronfay, except the grieves 01 overfeers, foon manifefted an averfion to, 
ufe implements of agriculture different from thofe with which they had been 
acquainted from their infancy. Accordingly, thefe improvements were not 
carried on with fuch a degree of induftry and perfeverance as could reafona- 
bly be fupofed to fecure fuccefs. $dly, The attempts made were merely to 
i aife grain, for which purpofe, the manure was found fcanty. Sea-weeds 
were the only manure ufed on Linksnefs. When the feafons, therefore, were 
unfavourable, or if but littie of this article happened to be caft afhore, the 
crops were not productive. In other places, where little or no fea-weeds 
could be got, horfe durtg, mixed with green fods or turf, was the only fubfti- 
tute. 

The fmall quantity of this manure which could be procured from a new 
farm, behoved greatly to retard the progrefs of improvement of a foil fo poor 
in quality as above difcribed. Another obftruction to its melioration, was an 
ill judged anxiety to come as near as poffible to the general practice in Ork- 
ney, of keeping corn fields under bear and oat crops alternately in equal pro- 
portions for ever.

of the farm they poffeffed, which conftituted four different 
rates. It is propofed, that thefe fums fhall raife and become 
a fund, for defraying the neceff.iry expences of ftated quar- 
terly meetings of the fociety ; and, after ten years accumu- 
lation, (hall be a fund alfo for the relief of fuch widows and 
orphans of the members as may be left in indigent circum- 
ftances ; and that in proportion to the rates contributed by 
their deceafed husbands or fathers refpectively. The fociety 
cftablifhed certain regulations with refpect to herding black 
cattle, fheep, fwine, &amp;c. , They took the ftate of the crop 
of the ifland under confideration, afcertained the prices at 
which they judged the different forts of victual ought to fell, 
during the quarter fubfequent to' each of their- meetings, ac- 
cording to their knowledge and the belt information which 
they .could procure \ and the members agreed to fell what \ 
they could fpare at lower rates in Orkney than they could 
obtain for it from other places in Scotland. The fuccefs of 
fuch experiments in agriculture as had been made by the 
members, was reported to the fociety, Sec. This fociety can- 
not entertain a doubt of their obtaining the approbation of, 
and all fuitable encouragement from the public, and alfo from, 
thofe of this diftrict, whofe patrimonial intereft may be e- 
ventually promoted by the attainment of the objects which 
the fociety have in view. 

A few hints for promoting agricultural improvements in 
this diftri£t, in conjunction with fome attempts lately made 
by the tenants, as above fpecified, fall now to be fubmitted to 
the public eye ; and, it is humbly prefumed, that the comfort 
and emolument of all ranks in this diftri£l would be promo- 
ted, and the intereft of the public moft effectually fecured, 
by adopting the following regulations : 



4oG 



Stat'ijlical Account 



Vk That the heritors be at the expence of putting the farm 
houfes in good repair, and that they give lcafes of their lands 
to their tenants, at reafonable rents, for three times nineteen 
years, or for certain loug periods. 

nt/y, That the tenants receive the farm houfes 6n valua- 
tion, and become bound to deliver them in like manner at 
the expiry of their leafes, on adequate payment made to them 
for melioration, or fimilar payment by them to the heritors 
in cafe of deterioration. 

3^//j, That inclofures, to a certain extent, on a plan an- 
nually agreed to by the heritor and tenant, be built by the 
tenant ; the value of which to be reimburftd by the heritor 
at the conclafion of the firft period of nineteen years, fo that 
the tenant may be enabled to proceed with additional inclo- 
fures, or fitch other improvements as may have been fpecified 
in the leafe. 

4///y, That during the fecond period of nineteen years, a 
certain additional rent, about ten per cent, of the money fo 
advanced by the heritor, be paid annually by the tenant ; and 
that this increafe of rent be doubled during the third period. 

$thly That no allowance be made by the heritor for any 
expence laid out by the tenant, in building inclofures, or other 
improvements, during the two laft periods of the leafe. 

6//;/y, That a fpecific extent of arable and grafs grounds 
fhouid be afcertained by flcillful men, to be competent for 
maintaining a fub-tenant's family, on the fuppofition that the 
fame is managed by him, without the afliftance of the prin- 
cipal tenant ; and fuch extent alloted accordingly to all fa- 
milies of this defcription. 

1thly y That one half, or thereby, of the before mentioned 
extent of arable and grafs ground, fliould be alloted for a 
cottar's or a boll- man's family, each of whom may be con- 
sidered, for more than one half of the year, as a daily fervant 



of Stronfay and Eday.

to the principal tenant, by whofe ploughs thefe fmall farms 
ihould be laboured. 

StNy, That in all refpe&amp;s, except thofe above mentioned, 
the ftipulations be left to be mutually condefcended on by 
the principal tenants, and by their fubtenants and cottars, or 
boll-men, refpectively. 

gthly, That heritors, who incline to encourage manufac- 
tures, and increafe the population of their country, may re- 
ferve in their own pofleflion fome fmall farm or parcel or 
ground on their eftates, bed adapted to the purpofe,. to let in 
very long leafes, or to feu out to be houfes and gardens for 
{hop-keepers, kelp-makers, mechanics, fifhers, day-labourers, 
&amp;c. Such families might thus furnifh a ready market for 
butcher meat or other provifions raifed by the neighbouring 
tenants, or their dependents. 

By adhering to thefe regulations, the heritors, or their heirs, 
at the expiry of 57 years, would find their eftates in a high 
degree of cultivation •, would have an additional rent well 
paid ; a certain proportion thereof, one third or thereby, in- 
clofed, and the belt fecurity afforded againft lofs by bank- 
rupt tenants, which is found to be a great deduction from 
the rental in many diflricts in Scotland, with an increafed 
price for fuch articles of rent as might be ftipulated to be 
paid to the heritors in kind. 

All thefe advantages, without any expence to the heritors, 
would doubtlefs contribute, in a high degree, to the comfort 
of the tenants and of their dependents ; and alfo to advance 
the intereft of the community:};.

partments, would mutually fupport and cherifh each other, to much greater

advantage than they can poflibly do when jumbled together, as they have 
been in this diftridt, for time immemorial ; here it is not uncommon to fee a 
man one day acting the part of a tradefman ; another, that of a fifher; a 
third, that of a kelp maker ; who, having found all thefe employments inef- 
ficient for the fupport of, himielf and family, mufb apply alfo to the tillage of 
the ground, in order to furnifh (after all,) a fcanty fubfiftance for him and 
them. The truth of the proverb, in fuch cafes, is manifeft ; " Jock of all 
trades, good at none !". 

It is moreover fubmitted, with all due deference, that the following in- 
citements to induftry, and to improvements, might with propriety be added : 

jjl, That one or more flcilful farmers fhould be induced to come from well 
cultivated counties in Britain, to fettle in fuch as are badly cultivated. This 
might be effected by means of an annual premium, to be paid 1 by the heritors, 
jointly, of the laft mentioned diftricTs, for a certain number of years, to thefe 
willing to accept fuch terms ; or otherwife, as might be judged proper. 

Under fuch examples, improvements in agriculture might reafonably be 
expected to advance with certainty ; and fuitablc inducements would thus 
be held forth to the other tenants of thefe diftricls, fufficient to influence them 
to adopt fimilar modes of cultivation, and of improvement, in the manage- 
ment of their farms. 

idly That a fpirit of emulation fhould be raifed among the heritors of dif- 
ferent diftriifls, by premiums, or honourable diflindtions conferred by the pub- 
lic, on thofe heritors who are molt active to introduce the before mentioned 
plan, or any other plan better calculated for promoting the public intereft. 

3(#y, That heritors and tenants of each diflrift, in collective bodies, fhould 
refpedtively excite a fpirit of emulation among their dependants by annual 
premiums. And, /tfhly, As this would infallibly increafe greatly the national] 
wealth and importance, that a certain fum, or number of medals, fhould be 
advanced to the heritors or tenants of fuch diftricls as exhibited proofs of 
great exertions in this way, to be by them diflributed to the individuals un-

746 1. 7s. 3d. Sterling, a fmall part of which is paid by fti- 
pulation between fome of the heritors and their tenants, for 
liberty to the latter to burn kelp and to fell it on their own 
account. 

The advance of rent, in thefe united parilhes, during a pe- 
riod of no lefs than 140 years, appears inconfiderable, but 
this is accounted for by a very great proportion of the grofs 
rental in 1653, being paid in kind ; fome part of which hath 
been converted into money by the heritors to the tenants, 
about 40 years ago, and fuch part as is ftill paid in kind, cal- 
culated at the then felling prices of the country, which did 
not much exceed the valuation prices in 1653.

There are, exclufive of Lord Dundas, thirteen heritors, of 
whom fix have a large extent, and feven have a fmall extent 
of property lying in this diftri£t. There are no refiding heri- 
tors except the heirs of Patrick Fea of Kerbufter, whofe pro- 
perty, at his deceafe, fell to be divided equally amongft his 
three daughters. 

State of Population, Parochial Recsrds, &amp;c. — The ancient 
ftate of the parifh of Eday cannot now be afcertained with 
exaclnefs, as records of an old date for that parifh are not to 
be found. Records for the parifh of Stronfay, from the year 
1673 and downwards, with chafms of feveral years at differ- 
ent periods, in a decayed ftate, as may be fuppofed, are yet 
in exiftence. 

From thefe it appears, that during a period of 20 years 
fubfequent to 16.73, the number of baptifms in the parifh of 
Stronfay was 382, of marriages 109. That during 20 years 
fubfequent to 1743, the number of baptifms was 601, viz. of 
males 309, of females 292. 

In the united parifhes of Stronfay and Eday, during a pe- 
riod of 14 years fubfequent to 1779, when the prefent in* 
cumbent was admitted, the numbers of baptifms, marriages, 
and burials, in t;he feparate years Qf that period were as fol- 
low:

Obfervat'wn.— During the period of feven years, preceding 
the prefent year 1794, the number of baptifms, marriages, 
and burials, in thefe united parifhes, appear, by table firft, to 
have been nearly equal to the numbers refpeclively during 
the like period of years A preceding 1787, fo that, had the 
emigrations (which are not few,) from thefe parifhes to other 
iflands in Orkney, or to places more remote, been as few in 
the laft feven years, as during the preceding fevcn years, the 
population would be nearly the fame now, as it was feven 
years ago ; but, from certain regulations or practices, lately 
introduced, unfavourable to the increafe of population, and 
to the improvement of the foil of thefe parifhes, there is 
ground to apprehend, that the population is decreafmg, and 
will continue to decreafe, if fuitable remedies be not fpeedily 
applied, particularly with refpect to fuel or peats ; and the 
partial increafe of fervants wages.

morial ; in which nccefTiry of life they have been greatly re- 
flnded by the proprietors of motes in botli pariflies, as to 
quantity, during the laft period of feyen years. Notwilh- 
ftanding, there remahr. an incxhauftible fund of that article 
in this diftrict ; at leaft, conjecture itfclf is at a lofs to af-- 
certain the number of centuries which the mofics in the U 
(lands of Stronfay and Eday would fupply their inhabitants 
with fuch annual quantities of peats as they were accuftom- 
ed to provide for their families, before fuch reftriaions were 
impofcd §. 

Hcr/a, 

§ The proprietors of peat niofs in the ifland of Eday have been pleafed, 
for fome years laft paft, with a view to fave their moffes, to prevent the 
meaneft of the inhabitants, their own fmall tenants, fub-tenants, cottars, or 
delvers of their little fpots of ground, to boil certain quantities of what they 
call fait, (of a mean quality, it muft be acknowledged,) over the only fire 
burnt in their cottages, which fire is ufed alfo for all culinary purpofes. The 
whole quantities of peats to fupply which fires, are fo inconfiderable as to be 
carried home by the indignent tenants of thefe cottages, on their backs ia 
creels or cafies made with ftraw ; the extra quantity required for the faid pur- 
pofe muft be fmall indeed ! This fait, fuch as it was, ufed to be carried in 
fmall parcels by the makers of it to other neighbouring iflands, where they 
received from the pooreft of the inhabitants, who could not afford topurchafe 
fait of a good quality, equal quantities of meal for the fait which they 
brought. By fuch traffic, the poor people of Eday procured, in a very labo- 
rious way, a fcanty fupply of meal for their families in the winter feafon, 
■Mien the ftormy weather did not permit their going a filhing, on which 
hiifinefs many in this ifland depend chiefly for daily bread. This reftric- 
tion has induced fome, and, if not removed, or fome other remedy provided, 
■will probably induce many more of thefe poor families to migrate to other 
iflands, if not to other countries. 

The whole, moffes in the ifland of Stronfay belong to the proprietor of 
Rothesholm, from which moffes the whole inhabitants of this ifland, for 
time immemorial, have fupplied their families with peats, upon making fmall 
acknowledgement?, in money or other articles, to the tenant of Rothesholm, 
This practice contiuued to the mutual fatisXaction of the inhabitants, and of 

the 



of Strovjay and Eclay.

Horfes, Black Cattle, &amp;c.— The horfes in this diftrift, and 
through Orkney in general, are of a hardy nature and fmall 
fize, the largcit arc feldom .above 14 hands high ; great num- 
bers of them, when only one year old, are brought from the 

neighbouring 

the tenant of faid lands, (without any interference of the proprietor,) until 
the laft general eledion of members of Parliament, when the election for 
the cnui:ty of Orkney happened, (unfortunately for a great number of the 
inhabitants of this ifland,) to be difputed ; for in conference thereof, fuch 
tenants of the fuccefsful candidate, as live in this ifland, and the tenants of 
his political friends, by the exprefa order of the proprietor of Rothesholm to 
his tenanc, were ftriclly prohibited from calling in, and leading peats from, 
his modes on any terms whatever. Thefe tenants, when laid under this in- 
tolerable hardfhip, confeious that they had not done any thing to merit this 
gentleman's difpleafure, thought it exceedingly hard, and even unjult, that they 
fhould be fo feverely puniflied for offences of which they were not guilty ; 

venture, notwithstanding the forefaid order and prohibition, after pre- 
vioufly having made offer to the tenant of Rothesholm of the ufual acknowr 
gements, to perfift in their poffeffion of the faid mofles, by calling, winning, 
and leading peats for the ufe of their families, according to cufiom, and an- 
cient practice. But this conduct of thefe tenants occulioned a law fuit before 
the Court of Seffion, which was lately decided in favours of the proprietor 
of the mofs, at whofe inftance it had been railed. 

This reftriSlion and decifion, will foon be found a great caufe of diminifh- 
ing the inhabitants of this ifland, as the tenants above mentioned, and their 
cottars, cannot live without fuch a ncceflary article as fire ; and their circum- 
flances in general, are not fuch as to enable them to purchafe and carry coals 
from England or from the Frith of Forth, to fupply their families, and the 
families of their fub-tenants and cottars, with firing. 

Moreover, an improper pra&amp;ice hath crept into this diflrict, of not only 
increafing the wages of unmarried men fervants and boys, employed in farm, 
work, to more than three times the amount of what they were fatisfied with 
about thirty years ago ; but certain portions of land have been given to many 
of them by their mailers, from which they have reaped crops of visual, 
which they have fold for feveral years paft, after defraying the expence of 
labour, at fuch fums, as, with other wages and perquifites, received by them 
annually from their mailers, hath arifen to, and in ibme iiiftances exceeded

united exertions of the tenants, or fociety of farmers in Stronfay, with the

of Parliament for Orkney, is landholder.) By order of Mr 
Thomas Balfour deceafed, the late proprietor, and uncle to 
the forefaid John Balfour, fpecimens of ore from this vein 
were dug up, and fent to be examined by people of fkill ; but 
the report feems not to have been of a flattering nature, for 
no attempts have hitherto been made to work it. 

A mineral Spring, (or rather three adjacent fprings of Chaly- 
beate water, all of different degrees of ftrength,) is to be 
found among the jocks, on the Eaft coaft of the ifland of 
Stronfay. The water, clear as chryftal, not unpleafant, is 
full of fixed air, as may be eafily difcovered by any who drink 
fome glafles of it •, for they will foon find themfelves affecled 
in the fame way, as if they had drank fome fine brifk bottled 
fmall bear *.

* This fpring is called the Well of Kildinguie. Tradition fays, that it was 
held in fuch high repute when the Orkney iflands belonged to the Crown of Den- 
mark, (above three hundred yeais ago,) that people of the fit ft rank, came from 
Denmark and Norway to drinkthe waters. Towards the foutli eaft, at about two 
miles diftance, the greateft part of the way confifts of a flat fand along the fea 
fiiore ; there is a place called Guiyidn, on thefocks of which, that fpeciesof fea- 
weed called dulfe, is to be found in abundance ; which weed, is corifidcred by 
many to be a delicious and wholefome morfel. The drinking of thefe waters, the 
moderate exercife of walking over two miles of dry level ground, gathering and 
eating dulfe on the rocks, they being expofed to a wholefome fharp fea 
breeze, from whatever quarter the wind could blow ; this happy combination 
of circumfhnces Was found fuch a fovereign remedy for the numberlefs com- 
plaints of thofe, who in ancient times reforted to this famous watering place, 
that it gave rife to a proverb which is ftill retained in this ifland, viz. " The 
well of Kildinguie, and the dulfe of Guiyidn, can cure all maladies except 
black death."— That is, can cure all maladies which are not abfolutely incu- 
table.

Ecclefiajlicai State, Ancient and Modern.— About the time of 
the Reformation, there were five parifh kirks in this diaricl:. 
Three in the ifland of Stronfay, dedicated to the Virgin Ma- 
ry, to St. Peter and St. Nicholas ; the fourth in the ifland 
of Eday, dedicated alfo to the Virgin Mary ; and the -fifth 
in the ifle of Fairy, to what faint dedicated, tradition gives 
no information. 

There were alfo, in the ifland of Stronfay, at leafi four 
chapels, one of which is called St. Margaret's kirk ; two 
chaples in the fmall ifle of Papa, dedicated to St. Nicholas 
and to St. Bride refpettively. St. Nichola's chapel was al- 
moft entire twelve years ago ; the dimenfions within walls 
15 feet by 12 ; the quire, 7 feet by 9 ; this quire is covered 
with a complete ftone arch, but the chapel hath been lately 
demolifhed by the tenant, in order that he with the (tones 
of it might build a new barn. St. Bride's chapel and Quire, 
now in ruins, are nearly of the fame dimenfions as thofe of 
St. Nicholas. About half way between thefe chapels, there 
is, on a rifing ground, called the Earl's-know, the appearance 
of old ruins and graves ; one of which graves, evidently 
defined by two ftones, one at the head, the other at the feet, 
is eight feet and a half long ; this grave was dug up to the 
deepnefs of about fix feet, in the month of July 1792 ; the 
Hones at the head and feet, which appeared about a foot 

above 

This fpring is at the diftance of about half a mile front the minifter's nianfe, 
in a pleafant healthy fituatiop. There is a large commodious houfe in the 
neighbourhood, built about forty years ago, for the accommodation of a gent- 
leman with a large family, one of the heritors, and at that time minifter of 
this parifh ; but his heirs have removed from this ifland. This houfe, there- 
fore, might be eafily fitted up, and would be found very commodious for fea- 
bathing or water drinking quarters, for thofe whofe conftitutions or inclina- 
tions require the application »f fuch harmkfs, fafe, and ufeful remedies.

above the furface, reached to the bottom of the grave. Many 
human bones of an ordinary fize were found, and, moreover, 
fragments of a human Ikull, and of a lower jaw bone, with 
the cafe of teeth, which were perfectly found, and fragments 
of thigh bones j thefe were all of an enormous fize, and af- 
forded a convincing proof that the body burried there had 
required a grave of the dimenfions above fpecified. There 
is an old chapel in ruins on the illand of Eday, and one in 
each of the pafture ifles, called Linga, Meikle, and Aulkerry ; 
in this laft, there are alfo ruins of what feems to have been 
a fmall houfe, which retains the appellation of the monkcr 
houfe, or monk's houfe ; fuch reclufes might no doubt have 
lived in this ifle, as there is plenty of freftr water in it j the 
diftance, however, at which it lies from the ifland of Stron- 
fay, is no lefs than three miles. Thus we find there have 
been of old five parifli kirks, and at leaft nine chapels in this 
diftria*.

Poors Funds and Schools. — A houfe and fmall parcel of 
land was mortified to the poor of the parifh of Stronfay a- 
bout fifty years ago, into the pofleffion of which one of the 
principal heritors flipt in a clandeftine manner, during the 
vacancy of the parilh, at leaft during the infane ftate of 
mind into which the minifter had fallen, about twenty three 
years ago ; and that after this heritable fubject had been many 
years in the pofleffion of the minifter and kirk feffion of Stron- 
fay, as truftees for the poor. Thefe truftees, feveral years paft, 
have been have been ufing legal means, all others having pro- 
ved unfuccefsful, to recover their pofleffion and property. 

The kirk feffions of Stronfay and Eday have no other funds 
for the relief of indigent objects, except the weekly and fa- 
cramental collections, with fome fmall penalties from delin- 
quents •, in all, not exceeding 8 1. Sterling yearly, out of which* 
the feffion clerks and kirk officers falaries muft be paid ; fo 
that, after paying for coffins for thofe on the poor's roll who 
die annually, the pittance is very fmall, indeed, which remains 
to be diftributed among the moft deftitute objects in thefe 
united pari (he s, whofe number amounts, at an average, to 
twenty five.

* A decreet of the presbytery of North ifles went out in the year 1780^ 
for repairing the manfe, and building offices, But thefe repairs and buildings 
are not yet executed ; they are indeed far from being compleated. 

The minifter gave the heritors no charge on this decreec, till feveh years 
after its date, in hopes that there would be no neceffity for charging 
them ; but thcl'c hopes were fruftrated ; accordingly, he gave them a charge, 
which they inftantly fufpended, and they have litigated the caufe for other 
feven years before the Court of Saffion, and before arbiters, whofc final de- 
creet hath not as yet been given out.

As few or none of the heritors refide within the bound* 
of this clifLri£V, and as not any of the non-refiding heritors 
contribute any fum whatever for the maintenance of the 
poor ; their fupport mud depend on tiie families of the mi- 
nifler and parifhioners. 

The heritors of Stronfay agreed, about fifteen years ago, 
to give a falary of three pounds Sterling to a fchoolmafter. 
But this falary, fmall though it be, hath not been regularly- 
paid ■, and to procure, in terms of law, a falary and fchool- 
Jioufe, would infer greater expence than the minifter can* 
in his prefent circumftances, afford. " The heritors are un- 
willing, and the parifhioners of Stronfay and of Eday are 
vmahle, to accomplifh this defireable end. A fociety-fchool 
hath, for feveral years pad, been a great benefit to the poor 
children in the parifh of Stronfay. Such a fchool is highly 
neeeffary in the ifland of Eday •, but numberkfs applications,- 
at different periods, by the minifter to the fociety for propa- 
gating chriftian knowledge, have been rejected, on account 
of a regulation which that fociety have long adopted ; viz. 
to eftablifh their fchools only in parifhes which have paro- 
chial fchools or falaries paid by fome of the heritors or by 
the parifhioners.

* The following cafe may perhaps appear fingular. A young girl, hi the 
ifland of Stronfay, named Jean Brown, the daughter of a poor labourer, in 
the year 1788, when about eleven years of age, was affected with pains all 
over her body ; thefe at firft continued only a few days, but recurred, each 
fortnight periodically, for a confiderable number of months. Afterwards, the 
pains returned monthly, were of longer continuance and proved more vio- 
lent, and her fpeech became greatly afTedted. In this ftate fhc remained about 
two years. After which period, her intervals of ficknefs and health gradual- 
ly approached to an equality of duration, and fucceeded each o.ther quarter-

moaned perpetually when awake ; fhe could fit in a chair, and could move 
flowly about the fides of the houfes, leaning to fuch things as flie found in 
her way. In the fumrner and winter quarters her pains abated, and fhe re- 
covered her fpeech. In this ftate fhe continued until the month of May 179J, 
which was the periodical feafon of her recovery ; in ftead of which, file epi •

fkill of all the doctors to whom this poor girl's parents had accefs ; at lead, 
every medicine which could be procured, was ineffc&amp;ual to obtain for her any 
eafe or relief from trouble. 

Another extraordinary cafe, is, of a young girl in the fame ifland of Stion- 
fay, whofe name is Ifabel Sinclair : Her father poff_-ffes a fmall farm as fub- 
tenant : His affairs have been embarrafTed, and his family reduced to (traits 
by his daughter's illnefs. In November 1785, at eight years of age, when 
going to a well for water, fhe was inftantancoufly ftiuck with what was fup- 
pofed to be the palfy. She was carried to her father's houfe fpeechlefs, and 
almoft totally deflitute of the ufe of her limbs, and feemed to have little or 
no exercife of her mental faculties ; fhe was afterwards entirely confined to her 
bed. During which' confinement, fhe was fometinies lifted up and carried to an 
elbow chair, where fhe fat for fome hours, and behoved to be carried back 
again to her bed. She could hardly lift up her eyes, and fometimes appeared to 
be in great diftrefs. Her appetite, however, did not forfake her, and fhe ad- 
vanced in growth, no lefs progreffively than if fhe had been in health ; but, 
unfortunately, for the mean flation of her parents, there was little meat or 
drink of the produce of Orkney which fhe could receive into her mouth ; and 
when fhe did receive and fwallow the ufual country fare, it did not rcit on 
her flomach but came up again. Flour, barley, bifcuit, peafe, which are exo- 
tics, with potatoes and milk, of Orkney produce, were the provifionsby which 
fhe was nourifhed. She eat lb freely, that, though deftitute of common ex- 
ercife and frefh open air, the growth of her perfon advanced as quickly as if 
fhe had been in health, 

In this diflreffed and difmal (late fhe remained for nine compleat years, 
fhe was averfe to take medicines of any fort, which, however, were often pro- 
cured for her, in hopes that they would contribute to her recovery ; and w hen 
fhe took them, they had no influence on her flate of health. In the month of 
November 1793, after a violent and painful ftruggle one night, fhe, to the 
great joy of her parents, and to the aftonifhment of all who had feen or heard 
of her lingular malady, recovered her fpeech and the exercife of her mental 
faculties ; upon which fhe foon expreffed defire for clean cloaths, and to be

of life, and to infpire them with a degree of importance, 
to which ftrangers are frequently inclined to diipute the 
juftnefs of their claim. The heritors, in general, have 
not yet exhibited ready difpofitions to encourage and re- 
ward an adive fpirit of induftry and improvement, by 
lengthening the leafes of their tenants, or otherwife ; but, on 
the contrary, have overlooked fuch indications of fpirit, when 
exhibited by their tenants, and have been ready to attribute 
their confequent fuccefs to the lucrative terms on which they 
held their poffeffions, and accordingly made this a pretence 
for exacting more rent ; with which demand, however un- 
reafonable, if the induftrious farmers did not comply, others, 
lefs fkilful, or lefs active, have been preferred, merely by 
mowing a readinefs to agree to terms, which, inflead of being 
able to implement, they have found, on trial, that they were 
unable to pay up even the old rent exclufive of the additional 
rent. 

This conduct tends greatly to difcourage tenants, and hath 
contributed much to prevent any improvement of the foil, 
from a dread thus excited in the minds of the tenants of being 
difpoiTefled, or of being obliged to promiie more rent than 
they could afford to pay. To this caufe, a fufpicious and 
diftruflful fpirit between heritors, tenants, and tub-tenants,' 
may in a great meafure be afcribed. Hence a defire to con- 
ceal their property and their gains, one from another, and 
to take undue advantages, when an opportunity occurs, by 
way of retaliation, for real or imaginary injuries done them.

rally be expected ; fhe gradually recovered, though flowly j fhe now converts

recovery. 

Of thofe who have been affected or cut off by the other maladies above men- 
tioned, it is unncceffary to fpecify inftances, as their cafes appeared to be of 
v. common kind.

The inhabitants are, in general, of an obliging, kind, liof-

of importance, which they polfcfs, by furnifhing entertain-

the highelt compliment which the guefts can confer on their

of the beft things fct before them.§ 

Mifcellaneous 

§ It is to be lamented that the heritors, not only in this diftridt, but through 
Orkney, in general, are not fo ready, as might be expected, to unite with the 
minifters of the gofpel in promoting the caufe of religion and virtue, with re- 
gard to parochial fchools and a provifion for the poor, as above ftatcd ; they, 
moreover, do frequently manifeft a disinclination to build or repair fuitablc 
kirks and manlts, and to make a decent provifion for the fupport of the cler- 
gy, by which the intcrefb of religion arc materially injured, and the efta- 
Llifhed clergymen, with their families, greatly diftreffed. 

The iffue of fome tedious and expenfivc law fuits, it is to be hoped, wiH 
not only open the eyes of the laity to their own intereft, but the prefent ft ate 
of public affairs will, it is prtfumed, effectually convince them, that the inte- 
refts of the clergy, of the laity, and of all ranks in focicty, arc lb blended and 
mutually connected, that it is true wifdom and found policy, to ftrengLhen 
ly combining, rather than to weaken by dividing them ; efpecially as a fui- 
table provifion, and the accomodation of kirks and manfes, are effentially re- 
quifite to the decent and regular difcharge of a clergyman's office, which con- 
Ms chiefly in explaining and in calculating the doctrines and precepts of our 
holy religion ; which will invariably be found the moft effectual means to 
feenre a due fubordination of ranks in fociety ; which fukordinations is cf- 
fential to the happinefs of the community, as well as the beft means to pro- 
mote the fpiritual and temporal intereft cf individuals. 

The common people of this diilriA remain to this day fo credulous, as to 
think that fahies do exift ; that an inferior fpecies of witch-craft is ftill prac-

Mifccllaneous Obfcrvations . — The center of the Orkney i- 
flands lies in latitude 56 0 North. The weather is in general 

moderate, 

they are haunted, at lead noifes are heard, which cannot be accounted for on 
rational principles, even in our days. An inftance of the latter happened on- 
ly three years ago, in the houf'e of John Spence, boat-carpenter, which houfe 
{lands within the difbnee of a quarter of a mile from the manfe of Stronfay. 
In the month of April 1 791, this carpenter had almoft compleated a boat, 
which he had on the ftocks : He, his wife, his fervant, and his children, one 
bight fometime after they were laid in bed, heard a noifc refembling what he 
had been accuftomed to make when driving nails into the boat. It continued 
a long time. He fuppofed it to be boys, who having Come that way at a 
iate hour, were amufing themfelves. At laft he got up, and went on with an 
intention to reprove and difmifs them. The noife ceafed on his going out of 
doors to the boat, which flood hard by his houfe ; but he could neither fee nor 
hear any body. The noife was heard by all the family, not only that night, 
but many nights after ; not nightly, in conftant fucccfiiDn, but at irregular in- 
tervals. Whilft the boat lay on the ftocks, it [was ftill apprehended that the 
noife proceeded from it, although no marks of ftrokes could bde ecerned, even 
after it had been newly covered over with tar, within and without, when the 
leaft touch will make an impreflion. The miftrefs of the houfe and the child- 
ren were alarmed ;,at her earneft requeft, therefore, in order to remove ef- 
fectually the fuppofed caufe of the noife, the boat when finifhed, was fenf 
home, which happened to be to a place on the other fide of the ifland, from 
which place the noife could not reach the carpen'er's houfe. Yet lo ! and 
behold ! the fame noife continned, even when there was no boat on the ftock?j 
and that for no lefs than four months ; and as the time elapfed, the noife 
increafed with ftill louder and quicker ftrokes, until it came to refemble the 
ftrokes of two men hard at tvork on a fmith's anvil. It uttered at laft, not 
hnly the founds of much fatigue, when men are employed in fuch work, but 
rnoan3 of great diftrefs. 

All which feemcd to thi3 family to proceed fometimes from one quarter, 
and at other times from another quarter within their houfe. Some of the 
neighbours were brought to fleep in the houfe, in order to difcover the delu- 
fion or impofition, if any fuch exifted. The fame noife, at the ufual time of 
the night, was heard by thefe neighbours as well as by the family. The maf- 
ter of the houfe himfelf began at laft to be fomewhat alarmed ; but, putting

moderate, and the climate temperate. But gales of wind, irt 
the end of July, or the beginning of Auguft, have fometimes 

greatly 

what it meant or what it wanted : Accordingly, in the month of Auguft 
following, one night after he had lain fometime in bed with his wife and 
children, upon bearing the laft mentioned aggravated noife, accompanied with 
difmal groans, he fat up in his bed, and folcmnly conjured it, in the name of 
the Holy Trinity, to fpeak, if it had any thing to fay to him. Inarticulate 
founds of a faultering tongue unable to fpeak, accompanied with difmal groans, 
were heard. 

The noife foon after ceafed, and did not return any more to difturb this 
family. The preceding account the minifter fiequently heard from the faid 
John Spence, and alfo from his wife, when feparately examined by him on this 
fubject, on which occafions they always appeared grave and ferious. 

In this eminently enlightened age, when atheifm and irreligion have been 
very active in bringing, not only fuperftition and cnthufiafm, but religion it- 
felf to the Guillotine, it is highly probable, that the traits of character row- 
exhibited will be held in derifion, and the drawer therof expofed to infinite 
ridicule on account of the preceding narrative, by thofe who glory in being 
fuperior to vulgar prejudices. If this fhould be the cafe, he will not attempt 
to rerrionftrate, but only humbly propofe the following queries, i/?, Are the 
inconfiderable remains of fuperftition and cnthufiafm, which do affect the 
character only in fmall and unimportant matters; or fcepticifm, which gives 
a new and totally different direction to the understanding and the will, leaft 
dangerous to our happy eftablifhment in church and ftate ? And whereas the 
human mind is a fruitful field, in which wholefome herbs, or noxious weeds, 
will fpring up and flourifh, — 2dly, Is it wifer to pluck up at once the whole 
exifting crop, before we have duly confidered the nature and tendency of the 
feed to be fubftituted in its place ; or to continue to cultivate the feeds of re- 
vealed religion, (which fyftem hath been held in high eftimation by wife men 
in all ages of world,) and at the fame time, gradually to check and eradicate 
pernicious errors and immoral practices ? A candid examination of thei'e 
queries may poffibly furnifh fome apology, why the minifter and people of this 
diftrict are not very hafty to exchange old prejudices for new and ftrange doc- 
trines, which eventually may be, and in a neighbouring nation have been fub- 
■verfivc of the principles of religion natural and revealed.

greatly injured the crop of the whole country. This was 
the cafe in the year 1778* on die 14th of Auguft, when a 
gale of wefterly wind, of not more than four hours continu- 
ance, drove the fray of the fea over the Orkney iflands, which 
damaged the crop to fuch a degree, that it was found necef- 
fary to import about 18,000 bolls of meal and bear, which, 
with large quantities of bifcut, potatoes, peafe, barley and 
malt, coft the confumers no lefs a fum than 15,000 1. Ster- 
ling, that is, nearly twice the grofs rent of the country. Crops 
17S2, 17 8 3 , 1784, 1785, were poor indeed, but not fo bad as 
that of 1778. Tofupply the deficiency of the faid four crops, 
nearly 20,000 bolls of victual were imported into Orkney. The 
crops for feveral years laft part, have been fo much better, 
that confi.ierable quantities of victual have been exported. 

The ferries in this diftrict, and through all Orkney, except 
on the poll road from Caithnefs to Kirkwall, are not under 
proper regulations. There are no ftated ferry-men, the freights 
are accordingly impofed at the pleafure of the boatmen who 
erofs over with pafT.ngers, which renders the ex pence and 
trouble of travelling through thefe iflands very great, and dif- 
flcult to be afcertained. 

There are ale-hcufes in almoft all the iflands, but no inns, 
exct-pt in Kirkwall and Stromnefs, the only towns in Orkney ; 
which circumftance makes it inconvenient for ftrangers to 
pafs through this country; this defect, however, is well fup- 
plied by the molt refpectable people in each of the iflands, 
who receive and accommodate travellers with great hofpitality 
and kindnefs* 

The inhabitants of Orkney are nearly the fame in number 
how, ( 1 794,) according to accounts lately given in by the 
feveral miniflcrs, to the fynod of Orkney, as they were found 
to be by like accounts given in to Murdoch Mackenzie, ma- 
ritime furveyor of thefe iflands, about the year 1750 ; viz* 
from 23 to 24,000.

Statiftical Account 



There are eighteen parifh-minifters in Orkney, (the parifh 
kirks thirty two,) divided into three prefbyteries, in each of 
which there are fix minifters. Of thofe who filled thefe 
offices twenty five years ago, when the author of this article 
was fettled, only three incumbents now remain, one in each 
of the prefbyteries ; viz. one in the parifhes of Hoy and 
Guymfay, one in the parifhs of Ronfay and Eglifhay ; all 
the other parifhes in Orkney, have been vacated by the death 
of their refpe£live pallors, fome of them by the death of 
more than one incumbent. 

This obfervation tends to fhow, that the infeription over 
the door of the minifter firft in order, in the burgh of Kirk- 
wall, in Orkney, might very properly be put over the door 
of every minifler's manfe in the county, to keep the poffef-

Agriculture. — The greateft part of this parifn is adapted 
to pafturage, being part of the Fentland hills ; and it is fuppof- 
ed that the farmers would find their account in directing their 
attention more to this obje£r, in other parts of the parifh. 
The moft profitable crops are oats and grafs, and the moft 
fubflantial improvements arc draining and manuring with 
lime. 

There are in this parifh about 60 fcqre of {beep, about 
150 cows and oxen, and about 10c horfes. The fheep in this 
parifh are generally of the common black faced kind. The 
farmers have hitherto found no other kind fo hardy and Co 
profitable. Smearing is univerfally pra£lifed by the farmers,. 
They think it defends from the cold, the rot, and the fcab. 
They give 31b of butter to 1 pint of tar, and about 6 pints of 
tar and i81b of butter to the fecre. Lambs fell from 40. to

The multure paid by the farmers is 1 peck to 6 firlots of 
{hilling, and about half a peck of meal to every boll of oats. 
The great complaint on this article, is,— that the multure is 
meafured, not weighed, and that the meafures are large ami 
uncertain. 

Manufactures. -An this parifh there is one difiiilery, one 
bleachfield, two corn-mills, one barley-mill, three fmiths, two 
mafons, two wrights, two weavers, one taylor, two butchers, 
and one coallier. 

Fo/fits.-^-The part of the Pentland hills which is in this 
parifh, like all the reft of that range of mountains, confifts 
of different forts of whinftonc, and other lapideous ftrata, 
■which are commonly termed primitive rocks. The lower 
grounds in the parifh, which form part of the valley of Mid 
Lothian, contain foffils of a very different kind, and which 
•are known by the name of fecundary Jlrata. Thefe "zxzfand- 
Jhv.e, time/tone, coat, and its concomitant foffils, which are 
ufually called coal metals. 

Through Scotland, in general, thefe fecundary ftrata occtipy 
the lower parts of the country; but the mountainous tracls 
are entirely compofed of ftrata of the primitive kind. The 
fecundary ftrata ftretch through the valley of Mid Lothian, 
for about 15 miles, from Muflelburgh fands, to the Caerlips 
on the confines of Tweeddale, where they are all cut off. In 
feveral places, they arrive at the fkirts of the Pentland hills, 
but never afcend them. They terminate gradually, as they ap- 
proach the mountains, and feem, at their termination, to over- 
leap, as it were, the primitive ftrata of which the mountains 
confift. 

I3y 



43' Statistical Account 

By the fide of the river of Glencrofs, there is a vein fevc- 
ral feet wide, entirely filled with that mineral fubftance call- 
ed heavy /par. It is a foffil that abounds in many of the 
richeft metallic veins, both in Scotland, and in foreign coun- 
tries ; and affords indeed a probable indication of metals, ef- 
pecially of lead. This vein appears to have been worked a 
little way in former times, but had foon been given up. It 
is not unlikely, that on fome future occafion, it may be 
thought worthy of further examination. Of all foffils, this 
iubftance approaches neareft to the the metals in fpecific 
gravity. It has even been prefumed to be of a metallic na- 
ture. No metal, however, has yet been extracted from it, 
nor has it ever been applied to any ufe more profitable, than 
as a flux, to facilitate the fufion of the ores of metals. 

Trees. — There is a filver fir at Woodhoufelee, which is 
the oldeft tree of its fpecies in Mid Lothian, and has always 
been admired for its fize and beauty. It was planted in a 
dry foil, in a garden, about the firft year of the prefent cen- 
tury. In March 1759, at 4 feet above the ground, it mea- 
fured 7 feet 4-f inches in circumference. In March 1793, 
at the fame height, it meafured li feet i£ inches. During 
thefc 33 years,- it therefore incrcafed in circumference 45 * 
inches. Its greateft growth was in the year 1760, when it 
jncreafed precifely 2 inches. During all the other years, its 
increafe in circumference was from one inch, to 1^ inch an- 
nually. This fine tree, however, is now upon the decay. It 
is afcertained, from other inftances, that the age of the filver 
fir, is limited, in this country, to within a century. It is in 
its greateft perfection, when about 80 years old ; and if plac- 
ed in a proper fituation, it is capable, during all that period, 
of increafing upon an average, above a cubic foot of wood an- 
nually. From fome full grown trees of this kind, lately fel- 
led

led in the South of Scotland, it appeared, that the timber is 
more valuable and ufeful than has generally been fuppofed. 

About the year 1 700, there had alfo been planted at Wood- 
houfelee, and at Greenlaw in this pariflv a confiderable num- 
ber of laburnums. Some of them were cut in the year 1762, 
and afforded a plank from 10 to 14 inches in breadth, of 
very beautiful timber. At both places, thefe trees grew in 
a high part of the country, in a meagre foil, and in an ex- 
pofed fituation. When they came to be worked into furni- 
ture, a remarkable difference appeared, in the quality of their 
wood, compared to that of laburnums of the fame age, which 
grew at Panmure in Forfarfhire, in a rich foil, and in a low 
and flieltered fituation : carved work, in the Panmure labur- 
num, was executed by the cabinet maker with the ordinary 
tools ; but in the Woodhoufelee and Greenlaw laburnum, it 
required the afliflance of fteel files, from the greater clofenefs 
and hardnefs of the wood. 

dnima/s- — The red fquirrel (fciun/s vulgaris rufus of Lin- 
nseus,) has become extremely common of late years. In this 
neighbourhood, the woods abound with them, and they are 
pretty numerous at Woodhoufelee. Though a beautiful ani- 
mal, they are deftru£Hve of the fmall birds, by devouring 
their eggs, and are extremely injurious to young planting, by 
croping and barking the tender moots. The larch tree fuffers 
particularly from this animal. 

In the year 1749, when the coal was worked at Newhall, 
in the neighbouring parifii of Pennycuick, it was remarked 
that the coalliers houfes, and other cottages, in which no- 
thing was burnt but coal, abounded with bugs. In the neigh- 
bourhood of that coal, there was plenty of peat mofs, and 
there, as it happens in other parts of Scotland, many of the 
cottagers chofe rather to ufe peat than coal for their fuel. 

lit 



Statijlical Account 



In thcfe houfes in which peat only was burnt, the bug nevev 
appeared, though they were immediately adjacent to houfeg 
where coal was burnt, and in which the infect prevailed* 

In the year 175'^, when the coal was worked on Glencrols 
nuiir, and in Goukly mofe, in this parifli, the fame tiling wai 
obferved. The houfes of the lower people, who only ufed 
coal, were infefted with bugs ; while thofe in which peat and 
turf ferved as the only fuel, were entirely free. 

Ihe burning of peat in Edinburgh, came to be a fort of re- 
ceipt againft bugs, though it does not appear to have been of 
much avail. If peat fmoak is at all a remedy againft them, 
it appears only to be fo, where no other fuel is ufed but peat ; 
and where the fmoak is at liberty, as is ufually the cafe where 
peat is burnt, to pervade the whole houfc. 

It is indeed remarkable, that the bug prevails only in thofe 
towns and parts of Scotland, where coal is burnt ; and that 
it is unknown in the towns and diftricts, where peat, turf, or 
wood, are the only fuel. Some towns and villages of this 
kind, though they have always had much communication 
with Edinburgh and Glafgow, by means of goods, furniture, 
baggage, and apparel, ftill remain uninfefted with bug?. This 
would infinuaie, that they poffefs fome antidote againft thefc 
vermin. That this antidote is the fmoak of the peat fuel, 
is not improbable ; but that it really is fo, has not been fuf- 
ficiently afcertained. 

House-rf-Muir Market.— There is a market for fheep at 
Houfe-of-Muir, at two feafons of the year, in the end of 
M.-.rch and beginning of April ; and there is a market for 
ewes with lamb. They come from Galloway and the South- 
ern counties, and are bought up by the Mid-Lothian and 
Eaft- Lothian farmers. In the end of October, there is a 
market for fat fheep from the fame counties, which are 

bought 



of Glencrojs. 



441 



bought by the Edinburgh and Dalkeith' butchers, during the 
Whole funimer ; lambs are to be bought about the be ginning 
of the week. The cuftom drawn from this market is paid to 
the family of Glencrofs, and the town of Edinburgh. 

Antiquities. — There are fome veftiges of camps at Caftlc- 
law, from which the place has probably taken its name. At 
Rullion green, was fought the battle of Pentland-hill, in No- 
vember 28th 1666. A ftone is erected in memory of this bat- 
tle, with a rude infcription. Old Woodhoufelee was former- 
ly the property and refidence of Hamilton of Bothwell-haughj 
and it was from this houfe that the Regent Murray turned out 
the Lady of Hamilton to the inclemency, of the feafon ; the

Mi/cellaneeus, — The advantages peculiar to this parifh, are 
its vicinity to Edinburgh, the goodnefs of the roads, and the 
neighbourhood of good coal. There are no difeafes peculiar 
to this parifh. The people, in general, are very healthy. 
There are, however, no inllances of remarkable longevity. 

It is not unworthy of particular remark, that the fcene of 
that beautiful paftoral, The Gentle Shepherd, is generally fuppof- 
ed to have been laid in this parifh. There is certainly a very 
flri£t coincidence between the actual fcenery of this part of 
the country, and the local circumftances mentioned in the 
poem. The general defcription of the fcene, as given at the 
beginning of the paftoral, is " A fhepherd's village and fields, 
" fome few miles from Edinburgh." The Weft-Port, men- 
tioned in the firft fcene as the road from the village to mar- 
ket, fixes the bearing of the country to the vicinity of the 
Pentland hills. The firft fcene is 

" Beneath the foi/th-Jide cf a craigy Held, 

" Where cryf.nl fprings the halefome waters yield 

As the fecond is, 

" Afiowry howrriy between twa verdant braes,

No defcription could more exadly charafterife the fcenery 
in the neighbourhood of Woodhoufelee, and Boghall burns. 
A romantic faltat the head of Glencrofs water is termed, at 
this day, " Habbfs-hcw." The ancient tower of Fulford, or

ance the fuppoGtion of Ramfay's having here fixed the imagi- 
nary refidence of his Sir William Worthy. After all, howe- 
ver, this appropriation muft He allowed to be entirely conjec- 
tural, and to reft more upon fancy, pleafing itfelf in clothing 
its own pictures in the garb of reality, than upon any bafis 
of evidence. This at leaft may certainly be affirmed, that if 
the poet intended at all to appropriate the fcenery of his paf- 
toral, farther than to the general afpect of the country in the 
neighbourhood of the Pentland hilis, there are no actual fcenes 
which fo perfectly correfpond to his defcriptions, as thofe in 
die neighbourhood of Woodhoufelee. 

Eminent Men. — There were two gentlemen, formerly of 
this parifh, whofe names well deferve to be recorded, in a pa- 
rochial account of this kind. 

William Tytler, Efq; of Woodhoufelee, writer to his 
Majefty's Signet, and vice-prefident of the fociety of Scottifh 
Antiquaries. His Enquiry into the Evidence againJI Mary £hiecn 
of Scots, is allowed to be one of the mod maftcrly pieces of 
hiftorical criticifm : and has been the means of producing a 
very general alteration, in the opinion of the world, concern- 
ing the conduct: and character of that unfortunate Princefs. 
Befides hiftorical researches, he was alfo remarkable for his ex- 
tenfive learning and excellent lafte, in other branches of the 
belles lettres. He refcucd from oblivion that valuable fragment 
of antiquity, the King 's Jfytah , a poem written by James I. of 
Scotland, during his captivity in England. This remarkable 
poem, written near 400 years ago, is mentioned by fome old 
writers, but was fuppofed to be loft. Mr Tytler was fo fortu- 
nate as to difcovcr it among the Scldenian M. S.' S. in the Bod- 
leian library, and printed it for the firft time, in the year 1783, 
accompanied with a very learned and judicious commentary. 
There are two fine Scots poems, formerly of uncertain ori-

gin, The Eagle and Robin Red-breajl and The Vifton, which, 
from careful enquiry, he reflored to their genuine author, Al- 
lan Ramfay. From perfonal knowledge, he alfo afcribed to 
that poet, the whole merit of the Gentle Shepherd, of which, 
by detraction or by miftake, he had been in part deprived. 

Mr Tytler was no kfs confpicuous for his lcience and tafte 
in mufic His diflertation on the Scottifh mullc, is the work 
of a mafter in that fine art. He was one of tin firfl: and mod 
zealous promoters of the gentlemen's concert at Edinburgh : 
A public entertainment, which, for liberality and elegance, is 
not perhaps excelled in any other great city. In his younger, 
years, he ufed 'himfelf to be a performer in that aflembly, on 
his favourite inftrument, the German flute. The crouded fu- 
neral concert after his death, which was the higheft exertion 
of the art in this country, fhowed the fmcere and deep regret 
of the public, for the lofs of this excellent man. 

In Mr Tytler, the man of letters, and the man of bufinefs, 
were happily united. — A union, which has generally produ- 
ced fome of the greateft and beft characters in life. To fu- 
perior abilities in the profeffion of the law, he added the moft 
unfpotted integrity. Keen he was, and refentful, againft e- 
very thing that was bafe or difhonourable : But an ardent 
friend to every thing that was good, and efpecially to unbe- 
friended merit. His piety, and his virtues in every relation 
of life, were well known to his numerous private friends, 
who will ever have them in remembrance. 

James Philp, Efq; of Greenlaw, in this parilh, was educa- 
ted as a lawyer under Heineccius, Vitriarius, and other emi- 
nent civilians, in Germany and Holland. Soon after his 
return from abroad, he was appointed judge of the High 
Court of Admiralty. His profound knowledge - in maritime 
law, enabled him to execute this office, for many years, with

inuch advantage to his country, and with much honour to 
himfdf. He was a man noted and beloved, for the mildnefs 
and urbanity of his mind and manners ; but he was a man 
alio of deep difcernment, and of indexible rectitude. 

In the year 1754, the prefent Admiral Sir Hugh Pallifer 
was commander of the Sea Horfe man of war, lying in the 
road of Leith. A man, ^under indentures as an apprentice, 
had been enlifted as a failor,-on board this fhip. On petition 
from his mailer, and on production of the indenture, Judge 
Philp granted a warrant to bring the man afliore to be ex- 
amined. A macer of court went aboard to apprehend him ; 
but was told by Captain Pallifer, that he confidered himfelf 
as fubjeel only to the law of England ; and , that he would 
not fuffer the man to go a Chore. Upon this, the macer, with 
his blazon on his breaft, broke his wand of peace, and re- 
ported this illegal act of deforcement to the Admiralty court. 
The judge then granted warrant to apprehend Captain Pal- 
lifer himfelf, to bring him from aboard his fhip ; and to 
commit him to prifon, which was accordingly done. Next 
day, he was brought into court ; and, on refilling to fubmit to 
its jurisdiction, becaufe he held his commiffiou from the 
Board of Admiralty, he was again remanded to prifon, there. 
fo remain, till liberated in courfe of law. 

"When the cafe was reported by the Earl of Findlater, then 
Lord High Admiral of Scotland, to chancellor Hardwicke, 
that great ornament of the law, and of human nature, the 
chancellor faid, " he was a bold judge who had done this ; 
but he had done what was right." This juft and high toned 
decifion, from a man fo gentle and amiable as Mr Philp, was 
followed with the univerfal approbation and gratitude of his 
cpuntry. It refcmbled in this, the behaviour of die excel-

bench, ordered the fpeaker of the Houfe of Commons, with 
a committee at his back, to take himfelf away, otherwife he 
would commit him to Newgate, though he fhould have the 
whole Houfe of Commons in his belly. It is the peculiar 
glory of this nation, that the laws are, as they ought always 
to be, predominant over every other power, fuperior to the 
executive and to any individual branch of the Lcgiflaturc.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2638187">ALFORD</name> 

(Presbytery of Alford, County and Synod of Aeep. 

DEEN ) 

By the Rev. Mr Thomas Birnie, Minister.</head>

<p>

Name and Situation. 

No accounts, but fuch as are merely conjecture, can be 
given of the origin of the name of this parifh, though it bears 
the fame with the prefbytery, and a confiderable tract of 
circumjacent country. Some fay, that the name has arifen 
from the circumftance of the river Don, (which is the northern 
boundary of the parifh, and which runs through the whole 
length of the county called Alford,) being almoft every where, 
in this part of its courfe, fordable, when in its ordinary fize. 
Others maintain, that the church was built upon a deferred 
part of the bed of the Lochel, a fmall river which paiTes very 
near it, and where there had been anciently a ford ; and, 

from 



44*3 Statijlical Account 

from that circumftance, auldfuirde came to be the name of 
the church and parifh ; both thefe derivations feem to be of 
modern date, and entirely dependent upon the prefent man- 
ner of fpelling •, for the names of almoft all other places in 
this county are of Gaelic original ; and the name of the pa- 
rifh, in records two hundred years old, is written Awfurde, 
an orthography which correfponds with the prefent pronoun- 
ciation. 

The county of Alford is fituated from 20 to 31 miles 
Weft from Aberdeen ; and befides the parifh of that name, 
which is the largeft, and the fubjeel: of this account, com- 
prehends four other pariflies, Forbes, Keig, Gillynefsle, and 
Tough. It is furrounded on every fide by hiKs and moun- 
tains, and there is no entrance to it, but by afcending con- 
fiderable heights to gain the hollow paffes between them. 
On the South, it is bounded by Coueny § ; on the Eaft by 
Menoway or Cainwilliam ; on the North Eaft, and North, by 
Bennachee *, and the hills of Careen and on the Weft by 
Calievar. Thefe boundaries contain a country which, reckon- 
ing from the brows of the oppofite mountains, is about 1 1 
miles in length, and from 4 to 6 in breadth. A confiderable 
portion of this fpace is a level country, efpecially in the low- 
er parts but the flatnefs is every where varied by gentle 
fwells, and eminences, which in the upper parts rife to great- 
er height. The climate of this country can neither be faid 
to be very wet or very dry. Its diftance from the ocean oc- 
cafions more intenfe frofts, and longer lying fnows ; but, on 
the other hand, that, and the fuTrounding mountains, protect 
and cover this country from the North Eaft fogs and winds, 
which are fo unfavourable to vegetation in kfs flickered fitu- 
ations, and places which are upon ths coaft. Bendes feveraf

Inferior ftrearrts, Alforcl is watered by the Don, a river of 
fome fize, which, gufliing through a narrow gullet, betweea. 
the mountains on the Weft, winds its courfe in a direction 
from Weil to Eaft, through the whole length of the coun- 
try, and, after adorning feveral gentlemen's feats on its 
banks, Hows away through a narrow valley, encompaffed 
on the North, by Bennachie, which rifes up into high and 
magnificent Alpine tops. 

The parifh of Alford is ill length, from South- Weft to 
North- Eaft, from 7 to 8 Euglifli miles ; and from 3 to be- 
tween 4 and 5 in breadth. • It contains nearly 8coo Scotch a- 
cres ; of which there may be 3600 arable, 3700 of hill, rnuifj 
mofs, and pafture grounds, and about 700 of woods. Thefe: 
laft confift of planted Scotch firs, intermixed with larixes, 
beeches, oaks, afhes, birks, and other trees of different ages, 
behdes a good deal of grown timber about gentlemen's' feats, 
and the tenant's yards. 

Soil. — The foil on the banks of the Don, is generally a good 
light loam, very fit for corn crops, but better adapted for 
grafs, becaufe of the mildews arifing from the river, which 
are hurtful to grain, efpecially to barley. In the Eaftern 
parts of the parifh, the foil is in fome places a good deep 
loam, in others, a ftrong, but workable clay, and fometimes 
a mixture of both. In this quarter, and the adjoining parifh 
of Tough, there wais formerly a large marfh, now called the 
Strath of Tough, or Kincraigie* which was partially drained 
in the end of the laft Century, when the proprietors are faid 
to have gained immenfely, by the rich crops which this new 
foil produced. I hat part of it which lies within this parifh, 
is moffy 5 and, though there are fome ftrong clay lands in it, 
they have, in general, a confiderable mixture of mofs. All 
thefe foils of lands, which, in this country, are called laighs, 
*r laigh lands, yield precarious corn crops, as their wetnefs

and lownefs fubje&amp;a them, in late fenfons, to froft ; but they I 
would make excellent meadows, if they were properly drained. 

All the modes ly in this quarter of the parifh, and they j 
are very much wore out. The largeft, called, for its extent, ' 
the meikle mofs, was accidentally (ired, about 1730, in the 
fummer feafon, and being unluckily very dry at the time, was 
nearly confumed. The remains of it now afford no better 
fuel than turfs, which are very clayey, and not only give, but 
retain a ftrong heat. The foils in the centre and weftern 
parts of the parifli, are dry and light, fometimes of a deep, 
fometimes of a fhallow fhple, well adapted for Hmc, and 
the turnip hufbandry, and no lefs fir, with proper cultivation 
and manure, for railing heavy crops of corn and grafs. I he 
moft wefterly parts are hill grounds, and, with proper ma- 
nagement, would make pretty good fheep walks. 

Farms. — The fize of farms it is difficult to average, as 
they differ prpdigioufly from one another, not only in the 
whole extent, but alio in the quantity of the different foils 
of land which make up a farm in that country •, and they are 
in general ftiU under the old divifions, with very irregular 
marches, as when antiquated notions of convenience, and no 
idea of inclofing, or regular fields, were in view. The rents 
run from 60I. and 70I. to7l. or 81. for thofe who are accounted 
farmers. Under that rent, the poffeffors of land are cropers, 
who frequently, however, have cattle fiuTicient to work a 
plough. A confiderable part of the rent is paid in victual, 
by the farmers, and fometimes even by the cropers; an I 
they are in general defirous enough to convert the victual 
into money, though they will rarely give it's value. Mul- 
tures have generally been changed into paid rents, and th* 
tenants only pay knavefhips to the miller, befides the ufual 
mill fcrvices. They are bound likewife to deliver poultry, &amp;c.

far which they arc paid at an old "converfion, which is from 
^ r \d. to 6d. for a hen, and fo in proportion. On fome e- 
itates, the tenants are foil] bound to perform fervices, fuch 
as ploughing, catting and carrying peats, carriages, &amp;c. ; but 
as they are rarely, or very few of them, at lead, exacted, the 
tenants are not defirous to convert them into money ; and, 
in general, they would give nothing in lieu of them. On 
one eftate in the parifh, the barony of Alford, the cotters 
and fub-tenants pay for their houfes and firing, to the land- 
lord only, a reek hen, and one day's {bearing in harveft. 
Leafes were formerly granted for long terms, and for lives ; 
but thty do not feem to have given any fpur to the induftry 
of the people : When a leafe dropped laft Whitfunday, which 
had been granted in 1743, the fon of the original tenant re- 
fufed to give the fame rent for the pofleffion, which had been 
fo long paid. Now, when improvements are commencing, 
they might be perhaps more beneficial but, at prefent, no 
leafes longer than 19 years, are granted, and frequently they 
do not exceed n or 13. 

Agriculture. — In this .quarter of the country, all the old- 
fafhioned prejudices of husbandry are (till looked upon as 
fure and infallible rules of good management ; for no differ- 
ences in extent of pofleffion, or in rent, make any difference 
in the plans or exertions of the farmer •, and all poffeflprs of 
land, of whatever deLription, purfue the fame methods, and 
ahnoit entirely in the fame manner. 

As agriculture is, perhaps, in this country, in as low a 
(late as in any other part of Scotland, that has the advantage 
qi a good foil, and not an unfavourable climate, it may not 
be improper to detail the mode cf management pradifed 
here, which, it is believed, has at one time or other prevail- 
ed, even in thofe parts of the kingdom, which, by the pro- 

3 % 2 grefs 



45*

grefs of improvement, are now fo well cultivated and fo pro-' 
duclive. Such a detail, while it prefents the real date of 
this country to the reader, will, at the fame time, hold forth 
a pidurc of the former Rate of Scotland and, hy compari- 
son with what it prcfently is, fhew that agriculture has arifen, 
from themidft of prejudices, Supported by pcpular opinion, 
and fanftioned by long habit, to be an art pradifed upon 
reafonable principles, founded upon fafts and experiments ; 
and that the time may come, when the Strength, and 
wealth, and power of the natio ^, will, by the refources of 
the foil, and attention to the interefts of agriculture, beraifed 
to the higheft pitch of which they are capable. 

Every farm in this county, is compofed of land of differ- 
ent qualities, and managed in diiFerent manners, which are 
diftinguifhed by the names of, — i. Infield, 2. Outfield, 3. 
Laigh-lands, 4. Pafture-grounds. Of thefe different Spe- 
cies of land, there are no fixed proportions for a farm. The 
fmaller poffeffions and crops generally confift altogether of 
in-field •, but all the more considerable farms muft be made 
up of the 1 ft and 2d forts ; and there are many who have 
no land of the 3d or 4th defcription ; and there are fome 
which are compofed of all the 4 different kinds. 

The in-field or in-town lands, are conftantly in white 
crop, unlefs when the farm has very little or very bad p .•- 
ture, and then, perhaps, a ridge or two is left untilled, to 
throw up the weeds which ages have nourifhed in it, to main- 
tain the farmers cattle. One third of it is regularly manured 
yearly, with all the dung of one year's gathering ; and thus, 
in three years, all the in-field on a farm has been once dung- 
ed. The in-field land is generally all ftirred immediately af- 
ter harveft, and the dunged third part is again ploughed in 
ipring, and fown with bear about the beginning cf May, and 
this crop is fucceeded by two crops of oats, fown upon the 

winter 



of Alford. 



453 



winter furrow, as foon as the feafon will permit; when the land 
comes again inccurfe to be manured, and undergoes the fame 
rotation. The in- field land is generally an excellent foil, full 
of manure, but flocked with deflructive weeds, of which 
wiid oats and knot-grafs are among the worft. Without the 
intervention of grafs and green crops, to deftroy the weeds 
and recruit the foil, the produce of the corn crops cannot be, 
fuppofed to be in any proportion to the goodnefs of the land. 
An average, in tolerable feafons, will not exceed from 4 to 5 
bolls per acre. 

The outfield lands are managed in different ways, either 
by folding or croping, without manure, or by water falling. 
This laft method can be praclifed only in particular fitua- 
tions, having the command of water, and where the ground 
hangs confiderably *, to admit of fpreading the water eafily 
over it ; and it is intended to fertilize the foil, for a fucpef- 
fion of three or four crops of oats. Though no great cars 
or attention is befto-wed, in fpreading the water equally; the 
firft and fecond crops are faid frequently to equal thole pro- 
duced on the fame lands by liming ; but the two laft are, as 
it may be fuppofed, equally inferior. After thefe corns crops, 
the land is left lee 2 or 3 or 4 years, to get a fward for a- 
nother watering, and fucceffion of grain crops. As this mode 
of cultivation is limited to particular fpots, out-field lands are 
more generally managed, by folding and croping, without any 
manure ; and their extent, and the ftock of cattle which the 
farmer poflefles on the pafture on his farm, will enable him 
to keep all the circumftances, which lead him to follow either 
of thefe methods. Where the out- field is extenfive, and does 
not produce better than ordinary grafs, it is impofiible in 

general

jiever watered, as in England, for pafture.

general to fold upon the whole, unlefs the pafture grounds 
are of a proportionable extent •, and therefore one part is 
folded upon, and the other is not •, and where the out-field 
is fmall, it cannot be divided into folds, of which eleven f is 
accounted by the far-ners of this country, the mod proper 
number for their rotation. One of thefe folds is every fum- 
mer furrounded with a fed (turf) dyke, and the cattle are 
indofed in it during the night, till after harveft, when the 
dyke is knocked down •, the land is ploughed, and left in that 
ftate all winter. In fpring, oats are fown ; and as foon as the 
crop is off the ground, it is again ploughed for a fecond, and 
fo on till it has borne five \ fuccefiive crops of oats ; and then 
it is left five yeats lee, to throw up whatever poor grafs fuch 
worn out foil will produce. The firft two years the grafs is 
as bad as pofiible ; and though, during the other three it thick- 
ens, yet even at the bed, it gives but a fcanty bite to the cat- 
tle . The fixth year it is again folded upon and dunged ; 
and thus, in eleven year:-, where the number of folds is eleven, 
a fold is 5 years in corn crop, 5 lee, and one in preparing 
for another fimilar fucceffion. The out-fields, which are not 

dunged 

f This number is thought the mod proper, where 5 fuccefiive crops 
arc taken ; but, upon fome farms, the out-fields are in divifions of 9 aud is 
folds. 

\ It is faid that three crops only of oats, upon toathed or dunged out-field, 
were allowed by the ancient cuftomnry law of Scotland ; and that action for 
damages lay at the inftance of the landlord, or of the incoming againft the 
outgoing tenant, if he injured the poffefiion by a more fevere round of crops. 
Some documents of the ufc cf this aflion, are faid to be ftill extant, in the re- 
cords of the Sheriff Court of Perth. It is certain, that where out fields 
were formerly managed by folding, and where they ftill are fo.'thc moft 
general practice is to take three crops only. In fome places, five crops were 
jirobably allowed of old by the landholders ; and the record ef a court of the 
barony of Alford, nth May 17^4, ^ordi very good evidence that this was 
the cafe in this county.

dunged by folding, (or as it is here called, toathed,) are crop- 
ped with oats, upon the fiim e plan as thofe that are, with the 
difference of being one or two years lefs in tillage, and one 
or two more lee. Under this divifion of the lands on a farm 
in this county, faughs or faughlands, (a corrupt pronouncia- 
tion of fallow) are included. They are ploughed once in 
fummer, and left in that ft ate till fpring, when they are fown 
with very inferior oats, of which they bear three or four fuc- 
cefTive crops ; and are then left to the operations of nature 
for fevtral years, to recruit them for another period of tillage. 
The foil of out-field land, in general, is inferior to that of in- 
field, only by the difference in cultivation, and being more 
ftony. The bad ufa'ge of the untoathed out-fields and faughs, 
will eafily account for their want of fertility, in railing grain 
crops ; but more efpecially in producing grafs, the badnefs 
and poornefs of which it is not eafy to defcribe. The oats 
fown upon out- field lands, are in quality according to the 
goodnefs of the foil, and the ftate in which it is. Inthebeft 
dunged folds, the white oats, and in the inferior lands, and 
on faughs, grey oats, called here hairy and barley corn, are 
generally fown. As, after folding, the land is only oner, 
ploughed, and frequently with a deep fur, the dung is 
buried the firft year, and works its effecls on the fecond and 
third crops ; and, therefore, the firft three crops are jiearly 
alike, and will rarely run beyond four bolls per acre, on an 
average •, and for the two laft years, they dwindle down to 
betwixt two and three, and often lefs. The produce of the 
untoathed out-fields, is much inferior in quantity, as well as 
quality •, and indeed the return from faughs in grain, will 
feldom defray the cxpences of labour and feed ; jind the far- 
mers are tempted to plough them, though it is to their own 
Mi, merely for the fake of the (mail quantity of draw' which 

they

they yield ; and becaufe, under their bad management, fuch 
lands will give no grafs. 

Laighlands are in general a Rrong deep heavy foil, and in 
this country are either alternately in oat crop, and lee, or 2 
years in oats, and one or two in lee. In dry early feafons, 
they give good crops of good grain, and always a great quan- 
tity of ftraw ; but in wet and late harvefts the grain is never 
fit for feed, and fometimcs not good enough for meal, as thefe 
lands, owing to their latenefs and wetnefs, (for they are not

before the corn is perfeftly ripe. They however through

The pafture lands con f; ft either of benty muir, marfhy

• The practice of cutting up fward for manure or muck fail, was prohibi- 
ted by an Adt of Parliament, made for the county of Aberdeen, as long ago 
as 1685, under a penalty of 100L Scots bolls, totiei quoties, to the matters of 
the ground ; and in cafe of their negled to execute the Adl, the fheriffs and 
juftices were enjoined to put it in execution. There are full many places in 
this county where this law fhould be enforced. This ASl Ihows that the Le- 
giflature was, even in thofe times, not ignorant of the bad confequences of 
continual grain crops, and the want of proper provender for cattle in winter, 
and that they knew green crops to be the proper remedy ; for it contains an 
enactment, whertby a certain proportion of the in field of every farm (valu- 
able according to its Highland or Lowland fituation) was ordered to be fowo

led fail J of roofing houfes, when the fward is pared thin, 
and for fuel, which they call troves. The hill grounds have 
been likewifc much much injured by burning the heath in 
improper fealbns and places ; and no pains are taken, even 
where the fituarion wUl admit of it, to extirpate heath by wa- 
tering. A confideiablc part of the pafture lands in this pa- 
rifh, might be made good arable foil, by draining, and the o- 
ther means of improvement. The hill grounds might, by 
good management, be greatly bettered ; and there are feveral 
tracts of ground which fall under the divifioii of pafture lands 
in this diftrift, that are only fit for plantations. 

In this county, and indeed pretty generally over this coun- 
try, farmers almoft never change their feed, ufing always the 
produce of their own farms ; but they are at forne pains to 
have it as good and found as the beft of their corn with re- 
peated winnowings will give. The befr oats in this country 
are of an excellent quality ; for in tolerable feafons, the boll f 
will yield 8 or 9 Hones, and even more of meal, which ia 
ground much fmaller and better lifted than in the South of 
Scotland. The gray oats, or barley corn, neither give fo much 
in quantity, nor of fuch quality ; and they are fometimes fo 
bad, as to require two bolls to produce eight Hones of meal. 
In fpring 1783, when there was great reafon to apprehend 
that the crop of 1782 was too fcanty and faulty to afford a 
fufliciency of good feed, a cargo of fine Dutch oats was fent 
to this country by the late Mr Farquharfon of Haughton, for 
his own tenants and the neighbours, and they contributed to 
fecure the next crop. Thefe oats were, however, faid to de- 
generate by bad cultivation, and they were liable to fhake be- 
fore they were perfeftly ripe ; and for thefe reafons they are 
not now fown. The Montgomery or Magbiehill oats have

lynefble ; they pofl'efs the advantage of ripening three weeks 
before the common oat, and therefore the extenfion cf their

The bear grown in this country by common farmers, is- 
all of the Scotch kind ; and though the feed is procured in the 
fame way as that of oats, weighs,, in general, 18 ftones per 
boll f , and will, in particular fituations and feafons, even 
come to 20 and 1 1 ftones. A confiderable quantity of meal 
and bear, probably from 800 to 900 bolls, is annually fent 
from this parifh to Aberdeen, our only or chief market for 
grain. Bear and oatmeal have given good prices of late years, 
though the fmallnefs of our meal is a great difadvantage to it 
in the Weft country market, to which it was ufually fent 
fome years ago. Oats arc never carried to market by our far- 
mers, though there is a demand for them ; a circumftance 
which muft be attributed more to habit than the effects of 
thirlage. Potatoes are not much ufed here, though every per- 
fon who rents land plants a fmall quantity. The common peo- 
ple are not very fond of them, and they think them unwhole- 
ibme ; nor will farm fervants make a meal of them, or even 
cat them without milk or butter, fo readily as in other parts 
of Scotland. To peafc-meal or bear- meal they have rather a 
diflike ; and in general, garden vegetables of all forts are not 
fo much cultivated or ufed as in other parts of the kingdom. 
Very little flax has been hitherto raifed in this country ; and 
as we 'have excellent foil for it, and the country people are 
under the neceflity of buying all the linen, when they might 
get it much cheaper by manufacturing it at home, this want 
of flax muft be attributed to the difficulty in dreffing the-lenf ;

but as that obftacle is now removed by the ere&amp;ion of a lint 
mill in the neighbourhood by Mr Leith of Whitchaugh, the 
culture of this plant is becoming much more general and ex- 
tenfive. 

Field turnips and fown graffes, with ordinary attention, have 
anfwered remarkably well in this country ; and as the farmers 
are convinced, by frhall trials, of the benefits which attend 
that mode of husbandry, they are more delimits than for- 
merly of improving in that way, though it is ft 1 11 no eafy talk 
to perfuade them to abandon their old habits and prejudices. 

The number of black cattle in this parilh (in December 
1793, when the year's fale is over) is 952; Of thefc 346 are- 
oxen for the plough, of which there are 65 in the parilh, ai- 
med all of the old Scotch conftruiliou. Every farmer is am- 
bitious of having many pairs of oxen in his plough 5 fome have 
6, many have 5, and few common farmers, with any extent 
of pofleffion, have lefs than 4 pairs. Smaller tenants yoke 
oxen, horfes, and even bulls, cows, and young cattle, promif- 
euoufly, to make up what they deem a fuflicient ftrength. No 
difference in the nature of the foil is attended to in propor- 
tioning the ftrength and number of the cattle ; for a farmer, 
who yokes 10 or 12 oxen, employs them all, whether he plow 
his in-field land, or the moft rugged ftony out-field' Neither 
does this make any great difference in the quantity of land 
ploughed at a yoking, which is from | to -f of an acre *, and 
which correfponds with the poor feeding of the cattle. Ox- 
en, which fold 40 years ago at 2I. or 3I. fell now from 5I. to 
7I. and thofe of the beft kind and (foe among common far- 
mers, will even rife to 81. and 9I. Every farmer fells one or 
two pairs of oxen yearly, and replaces them by others of his 
own rearing.

Forty years ago, il. 5s. or il. igs. was the price of a cow 
that will now bring from 3I. to 5I •, but as they are poorly fed, 
they are of a fmall fize, and will not give above 4 or 5 Scotch 
pints of milk per day, even in the bell pf the grafs. A far- 
mer's dairy, therefore, is barely fuflicient for family confump- 
tion, and as the milk is ufed fweet, little butter or cheefe is 
made, and that little is rarely fent to market, but laid up for 
winter ufe, when milk cannot be had. The cows calve in 
the beginning of March or end of April, which is an addi- 
tional reafon for their giving little milk ; but, on the other 
hand, early calving is thought, by the country people, to be 
advantageous to the calf, by giving it more time to acquire 
{trength, before the approach of winter. For the fame rea- 
fon, calves are univerfally permitted to go at largejthrough the 
fields, during fummer, and pick up the grafs at the roots of 
the corn. This practice is occafioned by the want of proper 
food and inclofures ; as the calves would be much injured by 
feeding or being confined with the large cattle in the folds, or 
in houfes, during the fummer feafon ; and it is attended with 
much damage to the corns by their lying upon, and treading 
it down ; and the calves get a refllefs habit, fo that ever after 
it is impofTible to confine them but by the ftrongeft and moft 
impenetrable fences. In winter, the calves and all other cattle, 
are houfed, during the night, and fed with ftraw, which, 
when the land is overrun with weeds, is not a great deal in- 
ferior to coarfe hay. After the firft winter, they accompa- 
ny the other cattle, till they are cows or oxen for it is not 
ufual to fell very ) oung cattle in this country. In the fpring 
feafon, all cattle in this country are in very low condition, 
the ftraw being by that time not only fcarce, but dried, faplefs, 
and lefs nourifhing : and by want of fhelter, and on account 
of the poor ftate of the land laid out for grafs, it is very late 
in rifing.

The number of horfes in this parifli is 172. They are 
well bodied and clean limbed, but they want a fufiiciency of 
bone*; and, as they feldom rife above 13, or 13! hands 
high, they are under fized for draught. Their other charac- 
teriilics are, a large ill-fhaped head, with a thick neck and 
ftiff mane-, they are hardy, and eafily fed, and, .upon the 
whole, ferviceable horfes. In this country, horfes are not 
gentnlly employed in ploughing, but they draw the harrows, 
which here are only ufed to cover the feed, and are by much 
. too light and unfit for any of the other purpofes of agricul- 
ture, to which proper harrows are applied. They perform 
all the cart work, which principally .confifts in journeys to 
mill and market •, in carrying home the corns in harveft, and 
preparing and carting out dung.. Their food is the fame as • 
that of horned cattle, with the addition of the light corn; 
and this, with a little more attention to their cleanlinefs and 
bedding, (though they are not. rubbed down or curry-comb- 
ed) keeps them more in flefh, and in better condition, than 
other cattle. By the rife of price, % which, 40 years ago, 
was from al. to 3I. for a horfe, that now cofls from 9I. to 
12]., the breeding of horfes has turned a profitable ufe of 
land ; and farmers endeavour, at Icaft to fupply themfelves, 
by keeping mares. The number of carts in this parifh, has 
increafed greatly within thefe 20 years, and is now 79,

the fize of the native horfes of the country, by eroding them with tall wtU 
bred horfes, from other parts of the kingdom, without giving the progeny 
proper and fufficient feeding to keep them up to the flandard ; for the de- 
fcription does not correfpond with the common unmix-jd breeds of Scotch 
horfes.

Creels am! crook- faddles are entirely in difufe. The igno- 
rance and inattention of the farmers of this country, are 
more confpicuous in the management of their fheep, than in 
any other branch of rural ceconomy. There are in the pa- 
rifh, at prefent, about 1300 ; but, in fummer, there will be 
twice as many. The greateft part of thefe are the fmall 
white faced Scotch fheep, which feem to be natives of this 
country ; but there are a few which are bred between thefe 
and the black faced Tweeddale, or Linton breed, here called 
bruiket fheep ; and there are others, which, by the remote- 
nefs of the original, croffing and intermixing again with the 
fheep of the country, partake, more or lefs, of the two fpe- 
cies. 

This crofs breed has probably been at firft brought into 
the country, with a view to raife the fize of the carcafe ; but, 
although the price of fheep has nearly tripled within thefe 
40 years, neither the carcafe nor the wool have been much 
attended to by our farmers, whofe principal obje£f, and, by 
their own account, chief gain, is in the dung which manures 
their folds. They are looked upon as prejudicial to cattle,, 
becaufe the country people think that they eat up a great 
deal of the grafs ; and, therefore, none but thofe who have. 
extenfi've hill-grazings, keep any fheep. 

The hill grounds are not, however, particularly kept for 
fheep •, but young cattle and young horfes are turned out up- 
on them. The flocks of feveral tenants generally range the 
fame paftures in common ; and as every one is defirous to. 
keep as many as he can, they are very generally over-ftocked. 
When a farmer has not a fufficient ftock of his own, or more 
pafture ground than is proportioned to his winter feeding, 
he takes in .Cheep during the fummer, at the very moderate 
rate of 2d. per head for three months, though, as he looks 
upon the dung of the animal as his profit, they are allowed

lull, to range at their own difcretion, and, at night-fall, a boy 
Is fent to drive them down to the folds, from which they are 
frequently not releafed till the morning is far gone. 

As we have no lhepherds, nor even good fheep dogs, fo there' 
are no divifions of the flocks, according to their fexes, or ages, 
nor any ground hained for winter. In this feafon, they are 
turned out upon the arable lands of the farm, which have 
not been in corn crop ; and feldom fent to the hill, unlefs the 
weather is very mild ; but during ftorms and falls of fnow, 
their fubfiftence muft depend upon heath |j broom, or any 
thing elfe, which can be reached by fcraping. No falve or 
fmearing is ufed in this county ; and if a farmer's ftock is not 
very numerous, the fheep are crammed into fmall houfes, 
built for the purpofe, during the night, and what with the 
alternate heat and cold they thus undergo, and the poor 
fcanty feeding of this feafon, they are in fpring reduced to a 
very lean weakly (late, which it requires a confiderable part 
of the fummer to reftore. The grounds, however, are heal- 
thy, and no very mortal or difficult difeafes prevail among, 
the flocks on account of the pafture. The improper burning 
of heath grounds has been highly detrimental to fheep in 
this country ; for the farmers never confult the proper fitua- 
tion of the place in regard to Ihelter, the nature of the foil, 
and the favourablenefs of the feafon for this purpofe •, nor do 
they herd the burnt ground, to preferve the tender grafs, 
which fprings up, from being plucked out at the roots, by the 

fheep. 

J In deep fnows, the country people uncover the heath with fpade*, t«' 
enable (he fheep to pluck it. Farther up the Don, in the country called 
Strathdon, which is more ftormy, but where they have many more, and 
much better fheep than here, this is a common practice. There, likewife, the

felt, and likely to be put a flop to by the proprietors §. Swine 
are never kept here but by millers, who difpofe of the refufe 
of the grain from thefe mills in feeding them. We have a 
good many markets round the country, at from 4 and 5, to 
12 and 14 miles diftance, where lean cattle are bought up by 
drovers, principally from the South country, and all for the 
fouthern markets. Korfes are likewife bought and fold in 
thefe markets, as well as lean fheep. The Aberdeen butch- 
ers, in the autumn, buy the beft grafs-fed wedders, at from 
10s. 6d. to 12s. ; but few if any cattle are felled here for 
the fbambles, as either by combinations among the butchers* 
or for fome other caufe, the price given by them is very low, 
and full 30 per cent, under that given in Angus. There were 
anciently weekly markets held at Meiklendovie, in this pa- 
rifh, and great yearly fairs at that place, and Kirkton of Al- 
ford. Thofe at Meiklendovie have been difcontinued for 
many years ; but there are ftill three fairs at the Kirkton, for 
the fale of cattle, horfes, fheep, &amp;c. and fmall wares j but 
they are of no great confequence. 

The general manure in this county, is ftable and byre 
dung, which the common farmers mix up with a conlider- 
able quantity of muckfail or clay. The muckfail is very poor 
turf, cut up in the neareft inuir, a practice which was once 
in vogue, in every quarter of Scotland ; and which is ftill 
looked upon in this country as a moft important article in 
hufbandry, and occupies a great deal cf time. Where good 
clay is to be had, it is ufed in preference to the muirifh 
fward; and it is certainly much better, though our in-field

lands, thofe only which are manured in this way, do by no 
means ftand in need of a claying every three years. All our 
Farmers are mod rrtiferably defective in that grand' requifite 
in good farming, the railing of manure ; for the whole dung 
made on a farm in one year, even with the addition of muck- 
Fail or clay, is barely fudicient for manuring one fevcnth, or, 
at mod, one fixth of the land which produced the ftraw. AH 
attempts to difcover marie have hitherto proved unfuccefs- 
Ful ; and the only factitious manure which has been tried in 
this country is lime ; and as trials of it have been made to a 
very confiderable extent, there is no doubt of the practica- 
bility, and value of the improvement. The late Mr Innes 
of Breda, by liming and inclofing, accompanied by proper 
hufbandry, improved a property in this parilh in twenty years, 
which was lately fold at triple the price he paid for it 3 nor 
are there wanting inftances of proprietors, and even of ten- 
ants, though above the ordinary level, who have, with equal 
advantage, carried on fimilar improvements. The expence^ 
however, though the returns with good management, in the" 
long run, do much more than repay it, is very great. The 
cheapjft method of procuring lime, is to bring it from Aber- 
deen, at the diflance of from 25; to 30 miles : At that port 
the price is very high ; for all the lime-fhells imported there, 
are either from the Sunderland lime-works, in the North of 
England, or thofe at Charleftown, in the Frith of Forth, which 
belongs to Lord Elgin. Lime-fhells, from the firft, give 3 re- 
turns ; and of the laft, from 2 to a'| of flaked lime. The 
Aberdeen boll of lime-fhells is four corn firiots, or 128 flan- 
dard Scotch pints ||, for which the merchants receive from 
3s. id. to 3s 3d. for Sunderland, and from 2s. )d. to 2s. gd.

country, of fo bulky and heavy an article, is the chief ob 
ftacle to improvements by means of lime. When Aber- 
deen carters are employed to tranfport lime-fhells to this 
country, they are paid at the rate of us. or »2s. for every 
three bolls, according to the dill an ce •, three bolls weigh a- 
bout 13C0 cwt., and require two horfes, as neither the roads 
nor the horfes are good. Some reckon this the cheapeit 
way, but others hire the carters to deliver the fliells 15 miles 
from Aberdeen, where they take them up with their own 
cattle ; and they pay at the rate of 2od. per boll •, but it is not 
uncommon to fend horfes and fervants to Aberdeen with 
grain, and even without a load, and to bring home lime-fhclls 
in return. As the Sunderland fliells contain a greater quan- 
tity of calcareous matter in the fame bulk, and in lefs weight, 
than thofe of Charleftown, they are generally ufed here, and 
at the rate of from 16 to 20 bolls per Scotch acre, which,, 
when properly applied, have conftantly worked great effects. 
The great expence of liming, efpecially in the carriage, which, 
with their weak ill fed cattle, the country people cannot a- 
Void, has hitherto deterred them from ufing it as a manure to 
any extent ; and,, indeed, without a total alteration of their 
mode of cropping, it would be dangerous and hurtful to their 
farms. Heavy as the expence of procuring lime, in this coun- 
try, is, the advantages of it in meliorating the foil, are fo great, 
that it may be looked upon as an article highly efiential ; and 
neceffary for attempting or carrying on improvements. The 
culy means to diminifh this expence, are either to difcover 
tolerable workable limeftone in the country, or to lower the 
expence of carriage. The attempts to difcover workable 
iime-ftone, have not hitherto been either general, or well 
conducted, and though there are many indications of it in 
the country, no regular quarry has been hitherto found. It 
is probable, that the gentlemen will foon turn their thoughts

from Aberdeen to burn the Hmeftone. If this great fource 
of improvement fail, our only other alternative, is, to cheap- 
en the carriage, by altering and mending the roads, ■ which 
have lately begun to receive very great attention in this coun-

that, upon a proper plan, with proper preparation and atten- 
tion, thorns would thrive well, make good fences, and, con- 
fequently, a moft valuable and lading improvement in this 
country; but they have in very few places had a fair trial* 
The country people are not averfe to inclofures, though they 
will neither build nor pay a per centage for building ftone

ing a thorn hedge. They feldom make a proper ufe of inclo- 
fures where they have them ; for it is not uncommon to fee au 
inclofed field in patches of corn and grafs ; the only real ufe 
of inclofures to them, therefore, is to ferve as a barrier to the 
farm in winter, when, if the weather is open, the cattle of the

The wages of farm fervants have been very greatly raifed 
within thefe few years in this country, owing to the great 
demand and high price of labour in Angus, the Mearns, and 
Southern parts of Scotland, together with that occafioned by 
the number of extenfive manufactories, recently erected in 
Aberdeen. Forty years ago, a man's yearly wages were from 
1 61. Scotch, or il. 6s. 8d. Sterling, to il. 13s. 4d. and a wo- 
man's 16 merks, or 17s. o^d. and they are now from 5I. ics. 
to 61. for a man, and 2I. 10s. for a woman. Though thefe wa- 
ges do not appear high, when compared with thofe given in 
other parts of Scotland, they are very feverely felt by the far- 
mers of this country ; and indeed, when it is confidered that 
fervants in this quarter do not work as in other places ; that 
the extent of ground ploughed, harrowed, reaped, &amp;c. is ve- 
ry great, when compared to the produce ; that for thefe rea- 
fons many fervants are required ; and that the maintenance 
of them is a much higher article than their wages, efpecially 
where there are many mouths ; and when, in addition to 
to thefe pecuniary difadvantages, the difficulty in procuring 
fervants, their wade, indolence, careleflhefs, and infolence, 
are taken into account, it is not to be wondered at, that the 
expence of farm fervants, in this country, cuts very deep up- 
on the produce of the farm, or (as the tenants generally fay) 
that it is a greater burden on them than their rent. Befides 
the ordinary fervants of his farm, a farmer has to provide a 
number of extra hands for his harveft work. This work is 
never done by the piece or day, but an agreed-upon-fum, to- 
gether with the reapers vi&amp;uals, (frequently accompanied by

corns. Thefe harveft fees have been riling for fome years, 
and are now il. 15s. or 2I. for a man, and \\. for a woman, 
befides victuals ; and the rilk of bad weather, to protraft the 
harveft, and lay hands idle, whom the farmer muft main- 
tain, and every thing elfe being taken into view, it will be 
found, that the expence of harveft work runs very greatly out 
of proportion to that of every other fpecies of labour. This 
difproportion is the caufe of many of the grievances we feel, 
with regard to ordinary fervants ; for thefe high harveft fees 
being nearly equivalent to a half years wages, not only deter 
the people, efpecially women %, from engaging to work to a

diflike of getting what they call a bad word, among fervants, 
generally ties up the farmer from applying for that redrefs 
which the law affords. The fame filly idea leads them to 
give way to the grofleft abufes in their domeftic concerns. A 
farmer muft often rife from bed at 3 or 4 o'clock, in a win- 
ter's morning, to admit his fervants, who have been junket- 
ting all night in the neighbourhood ; and he muft perform all 
the morning work of a farm, in tending cattle, &amp;c. long be- 
fore they get up, to aflift him ; nor is it uncommon for a far- 
mer to go with his cart and horfes to Aberdeen himfelf, be- 
caufe he will not only take better care of his cattle, but per- 
form the journey at lefs expence than his fervant. In fhort,

the common meaning of language here is totally reverfcd 
and fcrvants do not fo much ferve, as rule and tyrannize over 
their mailers. The fubtenants and cottars do not work much 
to the principal tenants; ; but they pay them higher rents 
than the principal pays to his landlord, and they cafe him of 
a good many fcrvices ; and though this clafs of poficffbrs of 
land add to the population of a country, they are not, here 
at leaft, always to be reckoned the mod ufeful and induftri- 
ous members of fociety. There are many of them, who, if 
their fmall piece of ground will barely find them fubfiftence, 
will not endeavour to better their condition by labour or in- 
duftry, though there is always work enough for labourers j 
and they lead an eafy, indolent life, except in harveft, which 
is a feafon of general exertion. The wages of artificers here 
are as high as in any part of Scotland, and thofe of day la- 
bourers are 8d. in fummer and 6d. in winter ; high enough, 
considering their work.; yet the high price of meal common- 
ly proves a ftronger inducement to make them work than 
thefe wuges. Working by the piece, except at mafon-work 
and dyking, is not general in this country ; nor will the coun- 
try people undertake it even for common works, fuch as 
trenching, ditching, &amp;c unlefs they have an enormous pro- 
fit^ 

The fuel of this country is peat, wood, turf, heath broom, 
Set. With the firft, there are only two eftates in the parilk 
fupplied ; and though the tenants of thofe properties are on 
a better footing than the others, ftill the labour of procuring 
peats is fo great, that it admits of a doubt, whether coal, un- 
der the difadvantages of high price, and a long carriage, 
would not be cheaper. Except the roots and crops of treea, 
wood is little ufed for fuel, as it is very expenfive ; and broom 
and heath require much labour.

'fcoads. — The roads in *this county have been originally 
formed, either by the ftatute labour, or by the military, under 
the order of Government. Of this laft defcription, there arc 
two roads which crofs each other, in this parifla ; the great 
Northern road, which leads from Fettercairn, over the Cainv- 
of Month to Huntly, and the road which goes from Aber- 
deen to CorgarfK, a military ftation on the fources of Don. 
Both thefe roads, fmce their formation by the foldiery, have 
been kept in repair by the ftatute labour of the. feveral pa- 
ri Ihes through which they pafs, as far as it would go, to 
maintain them jointly with other roads in the parifhes. The 
ftatute labour has not been hitherto converted into money in 
this country ; and, of confequence, as in every other coun- 
try where the ftatute labour is performed in work by the 
ceuntry people, it is found inadequate to the fupport of the 
roads, both public and parochial. The laft mentioned mili- 
tary road, forms the communication between a very exten- 
five country ami the city of Aberdeen, and has, of late, as 
well as on feveral former occafions, become almoft impafiable. 
In aki of the ftatute labour, the gentlemen whofe eftates ly 
in this country, have twice made very liberal fubferiptions 
for it's repair ; but in 1792, when it was again in a very. bad. 
ftate, after mature confideration, its diredion, for a confidera- 
ble way, was found to be highly improper ; and it was a- 
greed, that a new road, for nearly 9 miles in length, with a 
view to obviate the di'fadvantages of the old track, lhould be 
undertaken. L. 600. has been fubferibed for th;'s purpofe, 
and the work is confiderably advanced. When it is finifhed, 
there is good reafon to exped, that the improvement of tins 
country will go on with aditional brifknefs, as it will give us 
an excellent communication with our chief market place, 
and enable the farmer to bring home lime, coal, and the o- 
ther neceflary articles of country confumption, much more

cafily, and therefore more cheaply, than he has been wont 
to do. 

Mauufatlurcs — The only manufacture in this countv 
worth mentioning, '13 that of knitting itockings, which has 
been long eftablifhed in Aberdeenfhire*. The country part 
of the manufacture, is carried on entirely by women, to 
whom the wool is delivered out by the Aberdeen (locking 
merchants, who have fixed Rations over the country, for giv- 
ing out wool, receiving (lockings, and reckoning with thofe 
whom they employ. The wool is almoft all imported from 
England, and none of the growth of the country is manufac- 
tured ; for which reafon, our wool is very inferior, and the 
fleeces of a flock not worth more than 6d. each, on an ave- 
rage. It is fpun and worked into (lockings, at a price pro- 
portioned to their finenefs or coarfenefs ; and the average 
gain of a good worker, will be 2s. per week. This manu- 
facture has contributed to keep hands in the couwtry ; but it 
admits of fome doubt, whether thefe hands might not be 
more profitably employed, and whether the manufacture has 
promoted the interefts of agriculture ; but it certainly con- 
tributes little to health, and conduces lefs to morality. 

Antiquities. — In this parifli, the Marquis of Montrofe, upon 
the 2d day of July 1645, won the battle of Alford, by de- 
feating Baillie, one of the Generals of the Covenanters ; but 
his caufe fuftained an irreparable lofs, in the death of the 
Lord Gordon, the eldeft fon of the Marquis of Huntly, who

• According to the accounts of the Aberdeen merchants, (whoeaCport all 
the flocking, cither to Holland and the northern parts of Germany, from 
Whence they are often fent to America) the fum circulated through the 
country in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, merely for fpmning the wool 
and knitting the ftockings, is from 70,000 1. to 9 o,ccol. per annum. Thefc 
accounts are, however, in all probability, much beyond the truth.

fell by a random {hot, in the purfuit, near a large ftone on 
the field of battle, which is ftill pointed out by the country 
people. About 50 years ago, feme men, in calling peats, dug 
up the body of a man on horfeback and in complete armour, 
who had been drowned either in the purfuit, or flight from 
this engagement 5 and formerly, the country people were in 
ufe, when calling peats, to find ball, and pieces of money *, 
which had, probably, dropped from the flying, and efcapeel 
the fearch of the victors. Upon the top of a little hill, there 
is an immenfe cai$n, from which a fmall property in this pa- 
xifh takes the name of Carneveran, though the import of that 
word is not known. This cairn is 120 yards in circumfer- 
ence, and of a proportionable height. Of this great monu- 
ment, there is no very diftin£t tradition, though fome think 
that it marks the burial place of a brother of one of the 
Kings of Scotland. No more certain accounts can be given 
of a pretty large cairn, which lately flood at a place called 
Cairnballoch \ but, when it was removed fome years ago, 
there was found near the bottom, a fort of cheft, compofed 
of thin flat ftones, containing an earthen veffel filled with 
afhes, which mouldered away upon being expofed to the air. 
In the parifh, there is an eminence called the Gallow Hill, 
which had been anciently a place of execution ; and nails, 
and other pieces of rufty iron, are turned over by the plough, 
near the fummit, where the gallows had been erected, Many

of the parifhioners report, though without much credibility, 
that Gregory the Great was buried in the parifli ; and there 
are feveral predictions current among the country people, at- 
tributed by them to Thomas the Rhymer, which it would be 
unneceflary to recite. There are two old houfes in the p..- 
rifh ; one of them, Afstoune, was built between two and 
three hundred years ago, and feems to have been a place of 
fome flrength. It was a fquare building, with a round tower 
at each of two oppofite angles, of which there is one Rill re- 
remaining, though the greater part of the hcufe was pulled 
down 40 years ago. The firft florey was all vaulted, and 
there was a well in one of the vaults ; but the towers were a 
continuation of one vault above another to the roof. 

About two thirds of the parifh belongs to one proprietor, 
who is an occafional refident, and the remainder is divided a- 
mong five others, two of whom refi.de conftantly. The va- 
lued rent is 3126I. 12s. 8d. and the neat rent may be about 
15CCI. 19s. Sterling. 

Animals. — The Don abounds with trout, and, after .high 
floods, with falmon, which, when the river is low, cannot get 
up on account of the crieve dykes, near its mouth. There are 
no pikes, and few eels in this part of its count-. A bridge over 
the Don in the line of the great northern road, would be 
highly ferviceable to this country. Befides the Don, there 
are feveral inferior {beams, which pafs through the parifli, 
well ftocked with trout, &amp;c. Upon one of them, the Lochel, 
a bridge was built by Mr Melv'me, then clergyman of this 
parifh, in the end of the laft century, and it is (till kept in 
good repair, by a mortification of 100 merks, which he left 
in the charge of the minifter and kirk feffion, for that purpofe. 

In the parifli there are a few Red and Roe Deer, lately at- 
tracted to the country by the extenfive plantations and we 
have foxes, polecats, weafels, the Scotch ermine, and the Muf- 

covy.

'covy rat, who has travelled up the banks of the river from 
Aberdeen. We have likewife a few muir-fowl, and plenty 
of hares, patviclges, fnipes, plovers, and wild ducks ; and, 
at particular feafons, curlews, woodcocks, dottrels* and fcail 
drakes. Of other birds, the country is infefted with hawks 
of almoft all forts j the falcon, fparrow-hawk, martin, and a 
rire fpecies, commonly called blue fleeves, and with kites of 
ciiiFerent fizes and defcriptions. The hooded crows are not, 
fo numerous, but rooks and daws are in prodigious numbers. 
Sometimes the great woodpecker has been found in Our 
woods, and the king's-fi(her on the river, though they are 
exceeding rare. In general, our woods have incireafed the 
iaumber of the birds and beafts of prey, and confequently di- 
miniihed the quantity of game in the country. 

Churchy School and Poor. — The church is old, and bears date 
1603. The manfe was built in 1718, and has been repaired, 
and is convenient. The ftiperid is 60I. 13s. 4d. including com- 
munion elements, and grafs money, 2 chalders of meal, and t 
of bear, befides a glebe of 4 acres, and a garden. The laft E- 
pifcopal clergyman in this parifh was Mr Jeffrey, who Was 
removed about the year 1 7 r 5^ and Mr Gordon, the firfi: Pref- 
byterian Minifter (and a coniiderable leader in the Church 
of Scotland), was fettled in 1717, and removed to Alloa in 
1735. The prefent incumbent is his third fucceflbr. 

The fchool-falary is 13 bolls of meal, and 2I. arifing from a 
mortification, and 40 merks, or 2I. 4s. 5-yd. as the fee of a 
feffion clerk. The emoluments of the fchool will not much 
exceed 3I. The whole amount is too (lender an allowance 
for any perfon properly qualified to difcharge the important 
duties which this clafs of men owe to the public. 

The funds for the maintenance of the poor, are the inte- 
reft of 200I. of mortified money, and the weekly collections 
at church, together with the fines of delinquents. Thefe funds

are applied to the fupport from 12 to 17 paupers, none of 
Vkm are permitted to go about begging, though the country 
is overrun with people of that description. In the bad fcr- 
fons of 1 78 2 and 1 783, the kirk-feffion were obliged to extend 
their charity more generally, and, with the confent of the he- 
ritors, laid out a part of their capital in purchafing grain to 
fupply the poorer inhabitants of the parifh, who were in 
thofe years reduced to great want. 

Population. — The population in 1755 was 99°- 
The number of fouls under 10 years of age 
in the parifh, are, - - 133 

From 10 to 20 - 132

Total, 663 

Of thefe there are 310 males and 353 females. 
The number of marrriages and baptifms for 14 years from 
7 1 80, are as follows :

The regifter of marriages is very exa£t, and there are none 
irregular ; fo that the average may be ftated at 4 ^ per annum. 
The regifter of baptifms is very inaccurate, and probably not 
one half of them entered, fo that no conclufion can be drawn 
from it. There is no rcord whatever of deaths. Of artifi- 
cers there are in the parifh, 2 mafons, 9 joiners, wrights, 
coopers, and turners, two of whom make a variety of muli- 
cal inftruments without any education for that purpofe ; 6 
weavers, 3 black- fmiths, iq taylors, 6 country merchants, 4 

millers.

milicrs, and 2 dyers ; but they all have fmall pofleffion of 
hnd to fupport them as well as their trade. 

The paiifli-regifter goes no farther back than 171 7, and is 
fo -very irregular, that it is impofftble from it to procure any 
data for ascertaining the ancient population of the parifli, not: 
even at the time of the return to Dr Webfter. But that the 
number of inhabitants in the parifh has decreafed very great- 
ly, within a few years, is not to be doubted ; £nd the princi- 
pal caufe feems to be the great encouragement given at A- 
berdeen by the manufactures to labouring people. This pa- 
nih was, however, in all probability, much more populous 
100 years ago, than at the time of Dr Webfter'g report ; and 
the reafon of the decreafe feems to be, that by the wearing 
out of the moffes, fuel has become fcarcer than it was at 
that time ; a reafon which will flill tend to diminifh the 
number of inhabitants, till a more improved ftate of the 
country enable the people to fupport the expence of coal. 

There are no prevalent difeafes in this parifh, excepting 
the hooping cough, meafles, and fmall pox, none of which 
are fatal ; the danger of the laft is much abated by inocula- 
tion, which is becoming very general. There are feveral 
mineral fprings in the parifh, and though their waters are 
not ftrong ; fome of them have been attended with advan- 
tages. 

Character. — In their general character, the people are well 
entitled to commendation, for an obliging hofpitable difpo- 
fition, for their religious conduct, and regular attendance of 
divine worfhip, and for having laid afide that quarrel fome 
temper which once prevailed, without adopting in its ftead 
the fpirit of litigioufnefs that has fucceeded it in many places ; 
but candour muff acknowledge, though they poflefs in gene- 
ral a laudable cecconomy, they have not yet fully acquired 

thofe

thofe habits of labour and induflry, that have bettcfed thfc 
condition of the lower cl.ifles of people, in other parts of 
Scotland ; an acquifuion which mud always and every where 
be gradual in its beginnings, and which it is hoped, a few 
years will haften on in this country. 

That predilection and prejudice in favour of ancient modes 
of hufbandry, which has ftill fome Itrong roots in this corner, 
is not fo blameable, as it has been fo very general, and exert- 
ed itfelf fo vigoroufly in every country, in the commencement 
of improvements ; but when fair means are taken to open 
the eyes of the people, by examples and indifpucable experi- 
ments, perfevering in them is not fo excufeable ; and fome 
degree of this cenfure miift be applied to our farmers, in per- 
filling in their old practices, when they fee 10 or 12 bolls of 
grain raiCed by good hufbandry, where they could only raife 
3 or 4, arid excellent crops of turnips and artificial graffes, 
■where they denied the polTibility of producing them. This 
cenfure, however, is much lefs merited than it was, fome 
years ago; and the operations of a few years more may 
change it into applaufe. 

This account cannot be concluded better, than by a paper, found in the 
charter cheft of Mr Farquharfbn of Haughton, of a court of the ba;ony of 
Alford, during tne TJfurpation of the Convention Parliament of Scotland. — 
The tranfa&amp;ian which it records, fhews, that the means which they or their 
adherents (for the then proprietor of the barony was a moft zealous cove- 
nanter) employed, to fupply their treafury, maintain their forces, and fup- 
port their powei, were not very diffimular to thofe that have been fo recent- 
ly and tyrannically put in practice in a neighbouring Kingdom; for when 
the low ftate of agriculture, the general poverty of the country, and the flen- 
der means of the commonalty, at that time, are contrafted, with the heavi- 
nefs of the taxation impofed, and the feverity of the regulations for enfor- 
cing payment, it is well entitled to be compared to a forced loan. 

It furriiflies a ftrong proof, that in this, as in every other country, arbitrary 
exactions have followed hard, after the fall of equitable government ; and it 
is a ftriking example of the burdens and opprtffions, which, when lawful 
authority is overturned, mult be born, not only by the rich and the great, 

but

time to the number of tenant*, the total decreafe df the number of fouls muft 
be very great. 

It is proper to obferve, that this eftate was formerly much better provided 
with mofs than any other in the parifh, or the country in general, which 
may have occafioned a more than ordinary number of inhabitants.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2146505">KILBARC HAN</name> 

(County of Renfrew, Presbytery of Paisley, Synod 
of Glasgow and Ayr.) 

By the Rev. Patrick Maxwell, Minister.</head>

<p>

Name. 

T 

JL he name Kilbarchan, fecms to have orginated from the 
perfon who firft founded a place of worfliip here. 

Some, however, think the name compounded of three 
Gaelic words ; viz. Kil, fignifying chapel, bar or brae, a hill, 
chan a valley or plain. According to this derivation, Kilbarch- 
an, means the chapel of the hill-bounded vale. 

This laft derivation is exactly defcriptive of the local pofi- 
tion of the village, in which the church isfituated. It is built 
upon a declivity, which terminates in a plain towards the 
South, through which runs a clear rivulet, of the fame name. 
It is furrounded on three fides, with hilly grounds, having 
the Banks Brae to the South- weft, the lands of Law to the 

North 



of Kilbarchan.

North-weft, and the Bar Brae to the Eaft, all mod beautiful- 
ly adorned with thriving plantations of trees. 

Extent, Boundaries, Rivers.— -The parifli of Kilbarchan is 
betwixt 8 and 9 miles in length, from Weft to Eaft. Its 
greateft breadth is 5 miles, two where narrowed ; and its 
average breadth about 3 miles. Its whole furface may a- 
mount to about 24 fquare miles. It is bounded on the South 
and Eaft by the water of Black Cart, which runs from the 
lakes of Kilburnie and Lochwinnock, on the Weft ; 011 the 
North by Cryfe water, which takes its rife in Duchal muir, 
in the adjoining parifli of Kilmacolm ; thefe two ftreams 
form a junction at the North-eaft corner of the parifli f. 

3 CUmate 

f There is alfo a confiderable rivulet, named tocher, which has itsfource 
in Lochwinnock muir, and divides the parifhes of Lockwinnock and Kilma- 
colm, before it enters this parifli. It then runs nearly the whole length o£ 
the parifli, parallel to the two ftreams abova mentioned ; forming! in its pro- 
grefs, feveral beautiful cafcades, of which to convey a proper idea, would 
require the pencil. 

The whole fall of the Black Cart is occupied with cotton mills, four of 
which are fituated in the Abbey parifli of Paifley, on the fouthern bank of 
the river, and one on the Northern bank, to be afterwards defcribed. 

From the Gryfe on the North, this county derived its inoft ancient name 
olStratbgryfe. The tide makes about a mile up both Gryfe and Cart, and they 
are navigable to that extent from their point of junction. But from the cot- 
ton mills erected on Cart, it is afcertained that the elevation of Kilburnie 
loch, above the level of the fea, does not exceed 84 feet. This loch runs in- 
differently, either Eaftward or Weftward, and might eaiily he conveyed Eaft- 
ward by a canal to Paifly and Glafgow, or Weftward to the ocean. 

Gryfe, Cart, and Locher abound with l'almon, pyke, trout, parr. The 
falmon are caught in June and July, weigh from 3 to 8 lb., and bring about 
3d. per lb. The other fifli are feldom fold. 

The whole parifli is abundantly fupplied with fprings and rivulets of very 
pure water, which is of great, advantage to the bleachers fettled here, in 
whitening their cloth. In the low part of the parifh, where the foil is deep

Climate, Surface, Soil. — The climate is very wet, but is not 
efteemed unhealthy. 

The eaftem divilion of the parifh is a flat, level country, 
the weftern is hilly and in part rocky. About one third of 
the Eail and North-eaft, conflfts of a very deep clay. 

Of this eaflern divifion, 500 acres are occupied by a mofs 
from 7 to 9 feet in depth; the common property of Lord 
Semple, Mr Spiers of Elderflie, Mr Cunningham of Craig- 
ends, and Mr Napier of Blackftone. About an acre of this 
mofs is annually taken off in peats, by the neighbouring in- 
habitants. The foil below is a deep white clay, where has 
formerly been a foreft. The oak is perfectly frefh ; the o- 
ther kinds of timber are rotten. The flumps in general are 
ftanding in their original pofition. The trees are all broken 
over at about the height of 3 feet, and are lying from South- 
weft to North-eaft. So wherever you fee a ftump, you are 
fure to find a tree to the North-eaft. How an oak tree could 
break over at that .particular place, I never could underftand. 
But we may be allowed to form a conjecture, that before the 
tree fell, the mofs had advanced along its ftem, and rotted 
it there. Wood, immerfed in a wet body, is found to decay 
firft at the ring between the wet and the dry. 

The theory of moffes is now illuftrated in a fatisfadlory 
manner. They" have all been woods at a former period. 
Thefe being cut, or falling down, hindered the water from 
getting off the ground where they lay. This encouraged the 
mofs plants to grow over them. Thefe plants, while rotting 
below, continue to grow above. Hence a mofs continually 
increafes in depth. The pofition of the trees in moft moffes, 

from 

clay, the fprings are lefs frequent ; and the rivulets become muddy in their 
progrefs. But the inhabitants have adopted the method of purifying their 
water, by filtering fton.es, which renders it as good as any in the world.

from South- weft, to North- eaft, inftead of being an objec- 
tion, confirms this hypothefis ; for all our trees are bent in 
this direction, by the prevailing current of our winds. A 
tree, whether cut down or decaying, naturally falls in the 
direction to which it leaned while growing. The Romans 
produced many moffes by cutting down the woods, to which 
our anceftors Med for flicker. Others have doubtlefs been 
produced from woods allowed to fall through decay. 

From what has been obferved of the quick growth of mofs, 
it fhould feem that this one is not very ancient. What con- 
firms this opinion is, that many places round this, and other 
modes in this country, ftill retain the name of wood. As 
Fulwood, Linwood, Birchenhead, "Woodhead, Wocdfide, 
Oak-Shaw-head, (/haw is wood ) Walkinftiaw, &amp;c. 

Advancing weftward from this fiat and level part of the 
parifh, where the foil is of a deep ftiff clay, the furface be- 
comes diverfified with gentle rifings. The foil here confifts 
of a more friable and loamy clay, intermixed with ftones. 
Two thirds of the parifh weftward is of a light and fhallow 
foil, compofed of the mouldered particles of whin rocks, on 
which it refts. This foil, where of fufEcient depth, is ex- 
tremely fertile. As you advance weftward, the ground be- 
comes more and more rocky, with patches of the fame light 
fhallow foil, interpofed between the rocks. Among the rocks 
are feveral fwamps, which proper draining would reduce to an 
excellent foil. In thefe higher parts, there is very little heath, 
and, with a little lime, thefe fhallow foils produce grafs and 
corn of an excellent quality. 

The rocks here are wholly compofed of whin. Many of 
them have a bafaltic appearance. The north fide of the Bar- 
hill is a bafaltic perpendicular rock ; though not very regular 
in its formation. All the low part of the parifh abounds in

Antiquities. 

* Mr Napier of Blackftone has planted about rj acres of mofs bent, that 
is, the ftuff left after the peat is taken off, with trees of all kinds. They have 
ieen planted about 17 years, and are in a thriving condition, although grow- 
ing upon 4 feet of niofs. 

In the year 1767, James Milliken of Milliken, Efq; planted a number of 
fir, with a mixture of other trees, on the Bar- brae, among tremendous and 
precipitous rocks, which he had endofed for that purpofe. He made a fine 
foot-paffage from his houfe, around the bottom of the rocks, among the brok- 
en fragments of bafalts, formerly impaflable. It is amazing to fee the pro- 
grefs the different kinds of fir have made among thefe rugged rocks. How- 
ever, I find the pines anfwer bed on a rocky foil, as their fibres find crevices 
in which they fecurely fix themfelves, and often form a kind of net-work a- 
round the ftones. Here they are better fecured againft the violence of the 
winds, and fuffer lefs from the fummer's drought, than when they are plant- 
ed in a light gravelly foil. In this laft fituatioh, their horizontal fibres can 
have but little hold of the earth, and their perpendicular roots are fo fmall 
that they are eafily fhaken with the wind. If they be planted where there 
is a clay bottom, the damp of it chills them. Upon this eftate of Milliken, 
there are about 80 acres of thriving planting. 

At Craigends, the property of Mr Cunningham, there are 30 acres of 
planting, in which are found fome very ftately old afh, elm, and plane trees, 
fuperior to any in the parifh. One afh, in particular, deferves attention. It 
meafures 5 feet in diameter at 18 inches above the ground. The trunk ; which 
is perfectly ftraight, rifes 45 feet without a branch, and its top is in propor- 
tion to the whole. 

Dr Colquhoun purchafed in 1787, upon the higher grounds, north weft of 
the parifh, 369 acres, on which there was then no planting. In 1789 and 
1790, he planted about 16 acres with all kinds of trees, in large clumps. He 
thought this fulficient for an experiment ; but as the plantations are thriving 
beyond his moft fanguine expectation, he does not mean to flop. 

This feafon, 1794, Mr M'Dowal of Walkingfhaw is employed planting 
trees of every kind on fome rocky fpots on the north-weft of the parifh.' In- 
deed it Were to be wifhed the feveral proprietors would plant off all the rocky 
fpots in the high and weftern parts of the parifh. The experiments already 
made, fhew that the planting would thrive. The intermediate fpots, which 
admit the plough, fhould be kept as much in pafturc as poffible : for the foil

Antiquities. — About 2 miles weft of the village, on an 
elevated plain, is fituated a huge (tone, called Clocho- 
drick. This name is fuppofed to be a corruption of the 
words Cioch 0 Druids, the (tone of the Druids. It confifts of 
the fame fpecies of whinftone of which the neighbouring 
hills are compofed. This ftone is about 22 feet long, 17 
feet broad, and 12 feet high. It is of a rude oval figure, 
extending Eaft and Weft ; but feveral fragments have been 
broken off, either from defign, or by the injuries of the wea- 
ther. It feems to reft in a narrow bafe below, and perhaps, 
like other druidical ftones, was capable of being moved ; but 
the lower part is now filled up with ftones gathered from 
the land, over which the grafs is growing. From the vveft- 
ern fide, there is a gradual afcent to the eaft, which is the 
higheft part. At lome diftance round, are feen a few large 
grey ftones \ but whether they once made a part of a fa- 
cred inclofure, or are merely accidental, cannot now be af- 
certained, as the land where they ly is in tillage ; and it is 
probable, the molt moveable of them have been carried off". 
A fmall rivulet runs to the weftward of the ftone. There 
are no remains of a facrtd grove, except a folitary tree. 

It appears, that this ftone has been hewn from an elevated 
rock, a little to the Eaft, on which ftands a farm houfe, call- 
ed alfo, Clochodrick ; but, by what mechanifin it was 

brought 

being very light, too much ploughing makes it hove. Were it once well 
fwarded, it were better to lop-drefs the grafs, and keep it in pafturc as long 
as it remains good. 1 

In the fouthern part of the parifh, the property of Mr M'Dowal of Garth- 
land, there are 40 acres of wood without, and 13 acres within this policy. 
But as this gentleman's extenfive plantations are partly in the parifh of Loch- 
winnoch, and partly in this parifh, an account of them was given along with 
the particulars relative to Lochwinnoch, wherein his houfe is fituated. 

There are feveral beautiful and thriving plantations, to the Weft and 
North Weft of the village, belonging to the Meffrs Barbours, and to Mr 
Spiers, which wc had occafion to mention already.

brought to its prefent fituation, exceeds our powers to deter- 
mine. 

All rude nations feem to have made ufe of Come external 
objects, as incentives to their devotion. This practice was 
not peculiar to any fe£t of religion, but to a particular pe- 
riod of civilization and manners. A huge (tone, detached 
from all others, was a confpicuous object, round which the 
people could affemble •, and where they could fee what was 
going on, while the priefts offered facrifice, or performed 
their facred rites. 

They were careful, alfo, to choofe fuch fituatidnsas might 
either deprefs the mind with gloom and melancholy, or ele- 
vate by the. magnificent fcenery of nature. For this laffc 
purpofe, the (lone we fpeak of is well fituated for it com- 
mands a mod magnificent profpedt, eaftward of the vale of 
Clyde, below, and weftward of the lakes of Lochwinnoch 
and Kilburnie ; while the bare rocks behind add to the gran- 
deur of the fcene.* 

Mines, 

• North from Clochodrick, on the other fide of the hills, (lands an old 
Harrow caftle, anciently the refidence of the Knoxes. About 120 yards South 
Eaft of this cattle, on an elevated rock, which overtops the caflle, is a green 
bill, all of forced earth. It is now named Cafle-bill. The afcent from the 
South and Eaft, is gradual; from the North and Weft, it is fteep and diffi- 
cult. This earthen hill is of a quadrangular form ; the fides facing the four 
cardinal points. A trench, dug out of the folid rock, furrounds its fcafc, on 
the Eaft and part of the North and South fides. The Weft fide, fronting the 
old caftle, refts on the edge of the fteep rock. Each fide of this hill or mound, 
is about 30 yards at the bottom, and 19 at the top. It is 1 yards in height. 
The top, though in fume parts defaced, fcems to be a hollow fquare, with a 
parapet all round it. There has been an entrance into it on the Eaftern 
fide. 

From this mount are fecn five other artificial mounds, three in Houfton 
and Killallan, and two in KiLmacolm, called Laws ; owing, it is thought by 
the people here, to their having been places where juftice was adminiflcred. 

But moil of thefe Laws are of a conical figure ; and though, in feudal 

times,

Mines, Coal, LimeJJone — There are feven different coal 
inines in the pariih, all the property of the Milliken family, 
except one, the property o£ Mr Cunningham of Craigends. 
JLime-ftone is found connected with the coal at each of thefe 
mines. Only 4 of them are at prefent wrought, and at 3 of 
them, no coal is fold but the fplint, the reft being confumed 
in burning the lime. But the fourth produces more coal than 
is confumed upon the lime. The overplus is fold ; but is

times, they might have been ufed as places of rendezvous, where chiefs and 
vaflals might fettle their difputes, yet they appear to have been originally 
burrows, or monuments ere5ted over the bodies of warriors. 

I am inclined to think this mound has been a fort, or out-poft of the Ro- 
mans, when ftationed at Paifley, and intended to keep the inhabitants of the 
mountains in check. It commands a full yiew of the Roman camp ac Paifley, 
djftant about 6 miles, and might communicate with it by fignals. 

A little to the Eaft of the caftle, there are the veftiges of an old Romifli 
chapel ; though nothing remains but the foundation, yet the prefent tenant, 
Robert Donaldfon, fays, his father remembered the walls 3 feet high. The 
floor was of clay, which being dug, contained human bones. The farm is 
celled Prieflon ; and the houfe remains the fame as vfhen the prieft lived in 
it. 

On the top of Bar-hill, formerly mentioned, in. a commanding fituation, 
are the remains of an old Danifh encampment, it confifts of a femi-circulajr 
parapet of loole ftones towards the South, and defended, on the North, by tjie 
perpendicular bafaltic rocks, already mentioned. The tradition concerning 
it among the people here, is, that it was an encampment of the celebrated Sir 
William Wallace : and they fhew a pinnacle of rock, where they fay Wal- 
lace fat, while he enticed the Englifh forces' into a bog at the bottom of the 
rock, where they perifhed. But as our hiftorians make no mention of this, 
I am inclined to think the fortification, from its circular form, of Danifh ori- 
gin. 

There are two other ruinous cafties, one to the Weft, anciently the feat 
qf the Crawfords ; but now demolifhed almoft to the foundation. This caftle, 
with the lands annexed to it, were called Achinames, which in Gaelic means 
the field of butter. The other, on the North-weft, on the lands of Penneld, is 
hid to be built by one of the nume of I : Imc \ but he benfe killed in the it*** 
trrim, it was never finifhed.

coal is furnifhed at 6d. each cwt. 

Eccleftajlical State. — The church was built, or rather re- 
built, in 1724, and is very commodious, Ic is fituated in the 
village. There is alfo in the village, a houfe of worfhip for 
pcrfons of the Relief perfuafion, and another on the hills, a- 
bout a mile to the weft, belonging to the Seceders. 

The manfe formerly flood in the village, and the glebe in 
different parcels around. But in 1752, the glebe and manfe 
were excambiated, at the requeft of Mr Milliken'of Milliken, 
the patron, who wi-fhed to acquire the glebe for the purpofe 
of feuing it for building. The manfe now ftands on a beau- 
tiful eminence one-eighth of a mile fouth of the town, in the 
centre of the glebe, which is i6| acres, all enclofed and fub- 
divided. The ftipend is 7 chalders of meal, 200I. Scotch in 
money, with an augmentation obtained in 179 2, of 35I. Ster- 
ling, Computing the meal at is- per peck, the ftipend a- 
mounts to 141I. 4s. c^d. communion elements included. 
The patronage of the church is vefted in the family of Mil- 
liken. The church formerly belonged to the Abbey of Paif- 
ley. 

Remarkable Perfotis. — John Knox, the celebrated Scottifh 
reformer, was defcended from a very ancient family in this 
parifh. His anceftors were originally proprietors of the lands 
of Knock, in the parifh of Renfrew, from whence the family 
derived the firname of the Knocks, or Knox. They after- 
wards obtained the lands of Craigends, and of Ranfurly, both 
in this parifh, and refided long at the old Caftle of Ranfurly 
already defcribed. In proof of what we here afiert, we refer 
to Semple's hiftory of Renfrew-fhire, This family failed in

James tranflated him to the bilhoprick of the Ifles 1606 and 
in 1622, to the Epifcopal fee of Rapho in Ireland. He died

* The Semples of Beltrecs, whofe refidencc was at Thirdpart, now the

parilh, and defcended from the noble family of Semple. From this family, 
feveral remarkable perfons have fprung. As, id, Sir James Semple, who was 
a great favourite of James VI. while King of Scotland, and by him fent am- 
baffador to Queen Elizabeth. There is yet extant, a letter, written by King 
James, dated Sept. 9th, 1599, to Mr James Semple of Belltrees, while am-

Bridges, Reads' — The bridges are in good repair, and 
the roads, though not the very beft, are better than in any 
neighbouring parifh. The roads are moflly made by private 
gentlemen, with the affiftance of the ftatute labour. Any 
repair they get, is from the ftatute labour, which is paid in 
kind, and no commutation allowed, except for the inhabi- 
tants of the village. 

A toil-road is now making from Paifley to Newport, Gl;;f-

4. Robert Semple, grandfon of Francis, we mention, as a remarkable in- 
ftance of longevity. He died 1789, aged 108 years. He was the firft in the 
nomination of Juftices of the Peace for Scotland, in the year 1708, being the 
year after the Union. Towards the clofe of life, his memory gradually failed 
him. Two anecdotes of his early life, remained impreffed upon his memo- 
ry, after every other circumftance was forgotten. The firft was, his being 
prefent, while the witches were burnt at Paifley, the laft deteflable exhibition 
of that kind in Scotland, which happened 1697 *. The fecond was, his hav- 
ing feen Peter the Great, Czar of Ruflia, at Archangel, who, amufing hini- 
felf with fome fea animals in a pond, one of them fnapped at him, and bit 
the cock off his hat. This laft occurrence he continued to repeat to the day 
of his death, after he had forgotten every other. 

Among the remarkable perfons connected with this parifh, we may men- 
tion James Milliken, of Milliken, Efq. He was the firft who introduced ru- 
ral improvements into thfc parifh, on an extenfive fcale. He adorned his ef- 
tate with plantations, arranged with'great tafte. He inclofed, drained, fal- 
lowed, and reduced his lands into an elegant form. He firft excited a tafte 
for good roads in the parifh, many of which he made at his own expence. 
hi his improvements lie fpared no expence, efteeming nothing done, while 
any thing remained undone. He died An. 1776, much lamented by the poor, 
on account of his extenfive charity.

From this table it appears, that the number of fouls in the 
pavifh, when the lift was taken, was, 2501), viz. 1202 males, 
and 1304 females. Of thefe, 602 belong to the eftabliflied 
church ; there are about 30 Cameroniahs ; all the reft are of 
the Burgher, or Relief perfuafion. 

The population in the village, 1740, did not exceed 40 fa- 
milies. Since that time, there is an increafe of 35 1 families, 
which, upon an average, is abuut 7 families yearly.

From this ftatement, it appears, that the population of the 
country part of the parifh, has diminifhed 199, fince the year 
1774; but the population of the village has increafed 400. 
Increafe upon the whole, 201. 

From 1774 to 1782, there was an increafe in the village 
of 180 looms, and 24 new houfes. The villages had not in- 
creafed much fince that time, owing to the cotton mills e- 
refted within a mile of Kilbarchan, on Mr Houfton 1 s eflate, 
in the parifh of Paifley, which have attracted the population 
to that quarter. 

The diminution of" the country population, and increafe 
of the town, may be afcribed to the immenfe demand for 
manufacturing labour, which took place foon after the con- 
clufion of the American war. Yet the country has not fuf- 
fered in its cultivation. A greater proportion has indeed 
been thrown into pafture, which, inftead of being a lofs, is aTi 
advantage. 

One circumftance muft ftrike every perfon, who perufes 
our table of population, that the number of females in the 
country, exceeds the males by 42, and, in the town, they ex- 
ceed the males by 60. This may perhaps be accounted for 
by fuppofing that the farmer's keep more female fervants 
than males, for the management of their dairies, while their 
younger fons are fent to towns, and trained to bufinefs. In 
the village, on the other hand, the bleachfields, and cotton 
manufactories, which have long prevailed, require more fe- 
males than male*.

The village is built oi excellent freeftone, procured from 
a neighbouring quarry of very great depth, on the weftem 
declivity of the Bar-hill, already mentioned. One remarkable 
circumftance attending this quarry, is, that the freeftone has 
coal over it, and whinftone above the coal, next the furface. 
The northern fide of the Bar-hill is perpendicular bafalt, in- 
cumbent upon coal, which was formerly wrought to a con- 
siderable extent. This fa£t, feems to overturn the prevailing 
theories of Natural Hiftory. 

Living, Drefs and Manners. — All claffes of people live 
better now than they did formerly. Oatmeal and potatoes 
make a great part of the food of the lower people. About 
20 years ago, tea and butcher's meat were very feldom tafted 
by any of the lower ranks. Now they are more or lefs ufed 
by people of every defcription. The people are, in general, 
fober and induftrious. If they indulge in any extravagance, 
it is chiefly in the article of drefs ; in this they are much 
more gay and fplendid than formerly. At the fame time, 
they are daily acquiring more politenefs and urbanity of 
manners. 

Emigration. — There have been no emigrations from the 
parifh thefe 14 years ; but this year, 1794, 3 families have 
emigrated to America, and many more are preparing to fol- 
low, from the fatal decay of trade, and want of employment. 

Wars. — In former wars, a number of tradefmen were wont 
to go to fea, particularly to privateers, where they expected 
better wages, and were more certain of prize-money, than in 
the navy. But they feldom remained longer than the war 
lafted. In the prefent war, 55 young men have gone from the 
village to the army, and 15 to the navy ; befides others from 

the

the country, as they fay, from pure tircejity. It is remarkable, 
that thofe who formerly went to the fea fervice, on their re- 
turn, generally turned out drunken and difTipated • thofe a- 
gain, who returned from the army, generally proved fober and 
iuduflrious. 

Charitable Societies. — There are three charitable foeieties in 
Kilbarchan : iy?, The farmers fociety, which has accumulat- 
ed a capital of 850I. Sterling: 2ci, The general fociety, con- 
fifting of heritors, merchants, and tradefmen, has accumu- 
lated a capital of 400I. : 3^, The weavers fociety, has accu- 
mulated little capital, from exceflive burdens ; but has been 
of very great ufe, and relieved much dillrefs. 

Poor. — The poor, in fo far as they are not relieved by thefe 
charitable aflociations, are fupported by a voluntary aflefs- 
ment annually impofed, added to what arifes from the feflions 
fund,-;. Formerly the poor were fupported by church collec-r 
tions, intereft of money accumulated, money arifing from 
moFtcloths, marriages, &amp;c. But, from the increafe of trade 
and population, and, confequendy, of the poor, thefe funds 
proved inadequate. In July 1785, the method of afletTmeut 
was recurred to, and was levied as follows : ( The land paid 
at the rate of 3d. per Scots of valuation, one half being paid 
by the landlord, the other by the tenants. This produced 
78I. 9s. 3 ^d. There was levied upon the houfeholders, in 
the town and country part of the parifh all. 10s. 8^d. The 
feflions funds produced from 10I. to 12I. The amount being 
from nol. to 1 1 2I. then levied for the relief of the poor. 
The affeffment has been gradually increafing, and now a- 
mounts to about 1401. a year. 

This fund is managed by fifteen perfons, annually chorea 
on the 1ft Friday of November ; five of whom are heritors, 

. five

five tenants, and five houfeholders. To thefe the kirk feflion 
are added. The poor are fubdivided into claries, each clafs 
being under the infpeclion of an overfeer. None can be re- 
ceived upon the poor's lift, unlefs they make a difpofition of 
their effects, to be fold after their deceafe, for the benefit of 
the poor : Any two overfeers can draw upon the treafurer, for 
occafional relief, either to thofe upon the lift, when unfor- 
feen diftreffes come upon them, or to thofe who are not upon 
the lift ; but whofe fituation may require a temporary relief.

Deatfts. — The account of deaths has not been accurately 
kept ; only I noticed, that in the year 1790, they were 82 ; 
but I dare fay, more than one third of them came from the 
towns of Johnfton and Quarrelton. 

Agriculture.— In giving an account of the agriculture of 
this parifli, we muft diftinguiib between the high and rocky 
divifion, and the low and level part, as in each of thefe the

Eajlem Divl/ion Fences. — The Eaftem, or low part of the 
parifh, is moftly enclofed, in fome places, with ftone dykes, 
but chiefly with hedge and ditch. The thorns are either 
planted in the face of the eaith, thrown from the ditch, or 
on the top. Another practice prevails here, of building a 
parapet of ftonc, about three or four feet high, on the edge 
of their ditch, and then they either plant the thorns perpen- 
dicular on the top, or fticlc them in the face of their wall, 
drawing the belt of the earth to the roots. The laft method 
anfwers very well, and the hedge requires no pailing, or 
weeding. Thefe fences are either put up by the tenants, 
who have acquired new leafes, or by the landlords, when 
they fet the farms. It were to be wifhed, they were at great- 
er pains to clean the ditches, and take off water from the 
roots of the thorns ; and that fportfmen, and others, who go- 
through the fields, would take the trouble of going round by 
a gate, and not crofs a hedge, as trefpaffes of this kind have 
produced many infufficient fences, after years of care be- 
ftowed upon them. 

Farms. — The medium fize of farms here is from 40 to 
60 acres. There is one farm, occupied by Mr Roger, of 
222 acres, all in excellent order. 

B. e nt. — Some fpots are rented at from 50 to 60 s. ; but 
the medium rent is from 25 to 30 s. per acre It is thought,, 
by perfons of experience, that were the lands out of leafe, 
they could bear an addition of 5 s. at an average. 

About 50 years ago, the ufual rent of good land was a- 
bout 5 s. per acre. 30 years ago, it rofe to about 10 s. 20 
years ago, it rofe to about 20 s. Yet the tenants are more 
wealthy, and live much more comfortably now, than at any 
former period. Thefe fads fhew, that the rife of rent has 

uniformly

499 



uniformly kept pace with the progrefs of manufactures and 
population. Indeed land is of no value, without inhabitant* 
to cultivate, and confume the fruits of it. 

Rotation. — ift, oats ; 2d, oats ; 3d, potatoes, or barley, with 
dung If barley, laid down with grafs feeds. After pota- 
toes, generally oats, with grafs feeds, or 2 crops of hay, paf- 
tured 3 or 4 years. About one-third of the farm in crop, 
two-thirds pa'.lure and hay. 

It was formerly ufual to interpofe a crop of beans between 
the two firft crops of oats, but the feafons have been fo wet 
of late years, that they could not get them fown early enough 
in fpring, or dried in autumn. From this cireumftance, the 
practice has been generally abandoned. Some farmers have 
tried wheat ; but after their ground was prepared, the excef- 
five autumnal rains have either prevented them from fowing 
it, or they were obliged to fow it at a bad time, and it did 
not thrive. 

It were much to be wilhed, that the proprietors of land 
would endeavour to introduce a more commodious fyftem of 
cropping. Where the farmers depend chiefly upon one kind 
of crop, their labour comes upon them all in a hurry, and 
they are obliged to keep more horfes and fervants, than if 
their work were divided by a regular fucceflion of objects. 

I am apt to think, that the great population centered here 
by cotton mills, &amp;c. points out the dairy, and fattening for 
the butcher, as proper objects of cultivation. Were farmers 
to manage fo as to have a proportion of cows to calve before 
winter ; or, in place of them, allot a few cattle for winter 
feeding, they might prepare for them a proportion of cabba- 
ges, carrots, turnips, and winter vetches ; and, for houfe feed- 
ing in fummer, a patch of red clover fown with barley, to be 
cut green, anc j gfcen to the milch cows. Thefe crops would

5o© 



Stati/lical Account 



come in regular fucceflion, and not overburden them with 
labour at any particular period. By feeding much in the 
houfe, great quantities of dung would be produced. Though 
potatoes grow here in perfection, and anfwer well for thefe 
purpofes, they never think of giving them to cattle, as they 
have a ready market at hand for all they can produce. In 
wet feafons they might plough in wheat and beans, with a 
light horfe, yoked in a drill plough, when harrows could not 
be ufed. 

Potatoes. — Qn fome fpots round the mofs formerly de- 
fcribed, they raife excellent potatoes in narrow lazy beds. 
They cover the fets with about eight or ten inches of mofs, 
dug from the trench early in the feafon. When drought 
comes on, they fet fire to the lazy beds, and the afhes fervc 
as manure. In other places, the potatoes are generally plant- 
ed and dreffed by the plough in drills. 

Manures. — Their dung, accumulated in winter, generally 
goes to potatoes, or barley. They lime upon ley, at the rate 
of 3 chalders per acre, valued at ics each chalder, and imme- 
diately plough it in. I fhould think it much better to lime 
upon the hay ftubble, before they turned the ground into 
pafture. This would yield more- than the value of the lime 
in pafture, and a greater crop when the lime was broken up. 
Some make compofts of earth and dung; others make them by 
frequently ploughing a high head-rig in Summer, into which 
they put lime, and afterwards lay it on the field. Adjoin- 
ing to the mofs, they make compofts of mofs, dung and lime, 
which are found to be very beneficial for their ltrong clay foil. 

Horfes and Ploughing. — The horfes here are of an excellent 
breed, both for ftrength and mettle , They are moftly pur- 
chafed 



of Kilbarchan, 



chafed in the Lanarkshire markets, but a few of them arc 
reared in the parifli. They generally plough with three hor- 
fes, fometimes with two, but always ufe a driver. The 
land is moftly formed into ftraight narrow ridges. 

Cows and Dairy. — The cows moft efteemed here, are thofe 
of a fmall mouth, head and neck long and fmall. With 
refpect to colour, thofe fpotted brown and white are prefer- 
red. In the beft feafon, they give from 8 to 10 pints of milk, 
daily, when well fed. Milch cows are fuppofed to produce 
from 5I. to 81. yearly. Sweet milk fells at 2d. per Scots 
pint ; Ikimmed milk at 1 penny ; butter milk at ijd. When 
near a market, they generally make the whole milk into but- 
ter, and fell the butter, with the butter milk, in a frefli ftate. 
When diftant, they make fweet milk cheefe or fkimmed 
cheefe, and fait the butter for winter fale. But, where 
markets are diftant, grazing for the butcher is efteemed more 
profitable than a dairy. 

Weft em Divifion. — In the high and rocky parts of the parifh, 
we fhall only note the practice where it differs from th« 
lower parts. 

Th.y lay dung or lime upon their ley grounds about Mar- 
tinmas, and plough it in fpring. They take three or four 
crops of oats in fuccelhon, and then let the ground run back 
into natural pafture. They fow little or no grafs. Now 
this is the very worft of practices, Pafture is the very beft 
ufe to which they can turn their lands ; yet they take care 
to exhauft them before they throw them into pafture. It 
were better to top-drefs for the pafture, and fow it down 
with grafs. I fuppofe, the reafon why they don't fow grafs, 
is, that the (tones hinder them from cutting the hay. Btlr, 
were they to fow down their fields with grafs in a very rich 

ftate, 



502 



Statiflical Account 



fhte, one gathering of the ftones would ferve for many years. 
Even if it were thought too Liborious to gather all the ftones 
they might admit cattle to pafturc in the dry feafon, as foon 
as the grafs was fufhciently rooted. The ground commonly 
lies 4 or 5 years in pafture. 1 Potatoes are fometimes planted 
in lazy beds, on fpots here and there among the rocks ; fome- 
times with the plough ; after potatoes, fometimes barley, 
fometimes oats. There are many fields well adapted for 
turnips, which have never been tried. The lands are moftly 
inclofed with rickle (tone dykes, gathered from the land. 
The rent cannot be cftimated by acres, as the land lies in 
patches among the rocks. 

Cotes. — The cows in greateft efteem here, are a light, ac- 
tive breed, yield about fix pints of milk daily, in the beft fea- 
fon, and produce from zl. ios. to 3I. per annum. The 
farmers depend chiefly upon rearing of cattle, butter, which 
they fait, and fkimmed cheefe. They alfo rear a few horfes, 
of the Lanarkftvire breed. 

There are -few or no hogs in the parifh, and few fheep, 
except what are kept by gentlemen for their own ufe. Some 
patches of lint are occafionally fown ; but chiefly for the 
private ufe of the farmers. 

Mills and Thirlage. — There is, in the parifh, a lint mill of 
an excellent conftruction, and belt frequented of any in the 
Weft of Scotland. There are alfo four corn mills, each 
of which had thirlages annexed to them. But this barba- 
rous practice is wholly abolifhed at one, and mitigated at a- 
nother. At the mill of Cart, the thirlage was bought up by 
the feveral proprietors bound in thirlage, and the intereft of 
the purchafe money charged upon the tenants, at the rate of 
5d per acre. Yet, what is furprifing, the mill fet for nearly 

the 



of Kilharchan 



the former rent. Johnfton mill, the property of the Milliken 
family, has the eftate bound in thirlage ; but, at renewing 
the leafes, the thirlage was rendered more moderate. At 
the other 2 mills, the thirlage varies from the 12th to the 
30th peck. At all, they muft pay, even if they fhould fell 
their oats unground. All grain but oats is free. It is to 
be hoped that this barbarous Gothic practice, which produces 
on the one hand, conftant complaints of evafion, on the other, 
of flovenly execution, will be wholly extirpated from Scotland. 

Mamifactures, — The MeiTrs Barbours firffc eftablifhed a 
candle manufactory in Kilbarchan, which acquired great ce- 
lebrity : afterwards, a manufactory of linens was attempted 
by them in the year 1739. In the year 1742, Mr Spiers and 
others introduced the manufacture of lawns, cambrics, &amp;c 
for the Dublin market, which branch ftill continues, 
with different variations in the quantity produced. When 
the Paifley filks came into vogue, a confiderable proportion 
was wrought up here. Afterwards, the cotton manufactory 
almoft fuperfeded every other. In the year 1774, Semple, in 
his Hiftory of Renfrew fliire, reckoning every weaver of linen 
to produce 65I. per annum, calculated the manufactures car- 
ried on by perfons refiding in Kilbarchan, at 23,400!. per 
annum. If we reckon the cottons and other {tuffs at the 
fame rate, in the year 1 79 1 , the value manufactured in the 
parifh of Kilbarchan, would be 27,1 05I. This is not all done 
by people refiding here, but a confiderable quantity of muflins 
are fent from Paifley to be weaved. This year, 1794,311 
branches of bufinefs are in a very languid ftate. The only 
branch that ftill does a little, is the lawn, but even this is 
very dull, and the people l feem much difpirited. 

There are in the village, 3 bleachfields, which employ 30 
hands, mofbly women. There are alfo 2 candleworks, and 
a brewery.

Cotton Mills — At the bridge of Weir, on the north weft of 
the panfli, there is a cotton mill, which contains 2120 fpin- 
dles ready for ufe, and might employ 70 hands if fully occu- 
pied. At prefent, from the dullnefs of trade, they only work 
with 1664 fpindles, and employ 49 hands, chiefly women 
and children. 

But the moft fplendid eftablifhment in the cotton fpinning 
bufinefs, perhap6 in Britain, is the Linwood mill, on the 
fouth eaft part of this parifh. The building is already finifh- 
ed, except one wing, which yet remains to be added. The 
length of building already compleated, is 254 feet ; the length 
when linifhed, will be 338 feet 8 inches ; the breadth of the 
body is 37 feet ; ditto, of wings 40 feet. The houfe is fix 
ftoreys with garrets. It already contains 400 glafs windows, 
and, when compleated, will contain 540. The depth of fall 
is 1 7 feet. The tide makes up to the tail of the wheel ; but 
when interrupted by tail water, they have another wheel, 
more elevated, which they can put in motion. 

Mr Dunlop, the manager, has paid a very laudable atten- 
tion to the health of the inhabitants, in the conftruclion of 
this building. For this purpofe, the roofs of the rooms are 
high ; the machinery ig much Amplified in its conftruction, 
can be eafdy cleaned, and occafions little or no wafte, or par- 
ticle of cotton to fly about, and a large fpace is allowed, in 
proportion to the machinery ; of confequence fewer work- 
ers will be crowded into the fame fpace. The whole appa- 
ratus does not take above three half gills of oil daily : hence 
no bad fmell arifes from the oil. Add to all, that the whole 
building is fubdivided by two vail ftair-cafes, which act as 
ventilators. If equal attention is paid to the inftruclion of 
the children, I fhould confider a work of this fort as a fchool, 

where the children of the poor, otherwife a burden upon 

their

$fame and Situation . 




Glenfhee 



of Kirkmkhael. 



Glenihee is about 7 miles long, and lefs than a mile broad. 
At the head of this glen are two fmaller ones, narrow, and a- 
bout 3 miles long. The diftrift bordering on the Black-wa- 
ter, is of a form nearly circular, meafuring fomewhat more 
than 2 miles in diameter. Though this parifh is pretty ex- 
t'enfive, there is no part of it detached. Its figure does not 
vary much from a parallelogram, being 1 7 miles long from 
North to South ; and from 6 to 7 miles broad. 

Etymologies. — According to tradition, Strathardle was an- 
ciently called in Gaelic, Srath na muice brice ; the Jlrath of 
the /potted lOild fow ; which name it is faid to have retained 
fiil the time of the Danifh invasions, when, in a battle fought 
between the Danes and the Caledonians, at the head of the 
country, a chief, named Ard-fhuil, high, or noble blood, was 
killed, whofe grave is fhown at this day. From him the coun- 
try got the name of Srath Ard-fhuil, Strathardle, In tracing 
the origin of the name of Glenfhee, the following conje&amp;ure 
is offered. It appears to have been the praclice among the 
Druids, to hold affizes in the mofl convenient part of the 
country, to decide differences and adminifter juflice*. The 
perfons who exercifed this office were called Sith-dhaoine, or 
S\t\\\:h.zzr\, peace-makers. A round hill, at the head of the 
glen, called Sith-dhun, the hill of peace, may have been one of 
the places for holding thefe courts of juftice ; and hence the 
whole glen may have got its name. Another conjecture is 
that Sith-dhun may have been the place of concluding and 
ratifying a peace, between two contending tribes or clans. 

Hills, Lochs, &amp;c.—A hill at the head of Glenfhee, called 
Beinn-Ghulbhuinn, is diftinguifhed by having been the fcene

* The eminence where Diarmid was buried, is called Tulach Diarmid, 
Diarmid's Hill, whence the late proprietor of the ground was called, FearTu- 
laich Diarmid, laird of Diarmid's Hill. The ftory told of Diarmid's death 
is this : Diarmid and another of the Fingalians, were rivals in love. The 
lady, who was the object of their paffion, gave the preference to Diarmid. 
The rival, who wifhed for fome means of taking Diarmid oiT, propofed to 
the Fingalians to fet a day for hunting a wild boar, which had often annoy- 
ed them, hoping that Diarmid's forwardnefs in the chace would expofe him 
to deftrucTiion. Diarmid was warned by his miftrefs, that fome evil was in- 
tended him ; that the hunting was a pretext, and that he ought to avoid it. 
He gallantly anfwered, that nothing could prevail with him to decline any 
any entcrprizein which his fellows engaged. The hunting took place. The 
boar was killed by Diarmid's fpear, and himfelf efcaped fafe. His rival, ex- 
preffing his aftonifbment at the fize of the boar, propofed to Diarmid to mca- 
fure the length of its back with his foot, expeding that Diarmid would be 
wounded by the venomous bridles on the boar's back. Diarmid meafurcd 
along the back from the head to the tail, and ftill remained unhurt, His ad- 
■vcrfary, difappointed, requcfted him to meafure the boar's back again, pro- 
ceeding in the conrrary direction Diarmid fcorned to decline the talk. The 
confequence was what his rival wilhed. The wounds he received from the 
boar's briftles, proved mortal. 

Dr Smith, author of Gaelic Antiquities, in a note to the Gaelic edition of 
the poem on Diarmid's death, mentions a tradition that Diarmid was vulne- 
rable fonly in the fole of the foot, and fuggefts that this circumftance is pro- 
bably a fidion of late invention, as he has reafon to believe that the oldeft and 
pureft editions of the poem, make no mention of it. If fo, there feems to be 
a ftriking fimilarity between the ftory of Diarmid and that of Achilles. The 
circumftance of Achilles being vulnerable only in the he.'l, is no where hint- 
ed by Homer, and muft, therefore, ag in the ftory of Diarmid, be the inven- 

tron

which divides this parifh from Glenifla. The only lochs of 
note, are Loch SbeJ]jcrnich y and Loch nan eun, fkuated pretty 
high among the hills. Thefe abound in excellent trout. 
There are one or two medicinal fprings, which are believed 
to be of an antifcorbutic quality.

Dr Smith places the fcene of Diarmid's death in a part of the Weft High- 
lands, on the authority of the tradition of the country, and of the names of 
places preferved in a beautiful Gaelic poem, which narrates the ftory of Diar- 
mid's death. The opinion of its having happened in Glenfliee, refts precifely 
on the fame kind of evidence ; befides the tradition of this country, there is a 
Gaelic poem extant, which relates the fate of Diarmid, with the fame cir- 
cumftances as thofe mentioned in the poem publilhed by Dr Smith, and which 
exprefsly affirms the hunting to have been in the hills of Glenfliee. If the 
merit of the poetry were to determine the degree of credit due to the bard, 
as an hiftorian, there is no doubt that the poem in Dr Smith's collection, 
mud be acknowledged the moft authentic. But if this be reckoned an equi- 
vocal teft of authenticity, it does not well appear how the two difcordant nar- 
ratives can be reconciled, nor how the credit Sue to either of them above the 
other, may be afcertained. From fuch a defcrepance between the different 
accounts of the fame events, a fceptical enquirer might be led, perhaps, to 
queftion the authenticity of both, and pronounce the whole a mere fiction. 
Such an inference, however, may well be judged rafli and unfounded. The 
evidence of various traditions, refpecting the fame ftory, is a proof that it was 
once generally believed in many parts of the country. Their agreeing in 
many Unking particulars, is at leaft a ftrong preemption that thefe parricu- 
lars were true ; their difagreeing in other particulars, only fliows that the 
facts were obfeured by the diftance of time at which they happened. Many 
cities claimed the honour of giving birth to Homer, and fupported their re- 
flective claims by various arguments and allegations. Though their claims 
were inconfiftcnt, and their allegations contradictory, nobody ever thought 
of inferring thence, that Homer never lived, or had no birth-place, but only 
that the place of his birth, from the length of time flnce it happened, was b&amp; 
c»me uncertain

Cmvdte t Soil, Crop. — The country being more elevated 
than Atliole, on the one hand, and Marr on the other, and 
heing in general open and unlheltered, the climate is colder 
than in either of thefe diftricls, and more expofed to the fe- 
verity of a cold or ftormy feafon. During nine months of the 
year, froits are frequent, and fometimes fatal to the fruits of 
the earth. In 1 791 and 1792, the crops fuffered extremely 
from fevere frofts, in the beginning of Autumn. The air, 
however, is pure and favourable to health and longevity. It 
ia not uncommon to fee men purfuing their ordinary occi 
pations at 80 or 90 years of age. Within thefe few years, a 
woman died in the parifh upwards of 100 years old. Chro- 
nical diftempers are rare. The fmall pox has been often fa- 
tal. Inoculation, though not unknown, is far from being ge-^ 
rally praclifed. 

The foil on the banks of the Ardle, is thin and dry, having 
a fandy bottom, and yields in general light crops. In the 
higher grounds, it is wet and fpungy, unfriendly to vegeta- 
tion, except in dry warm feafons, when it yields a pretty good 
crop. The fame defcripRan applies to the foil of Glenfheej 
and of the Black-water diftrict. 

The produce of the ground is fcldom fufficient to fupply 
the inhabitants. The culture of potatoes is of the greateft 
utility, as it is commonly the mod productive crop. The 
kinds of grain generally fown are Chefhire bear, the com- 
mon white oats, and a kind called barley oats. Flax, and 
peafe, alfo, are grown, but in no great quantities, as the foil 
or climate is unfavourable to them. Field turnips have been 
lately introduced, and anfwer well, of which the tenants ap- 
pear to be fenfible. Some grafs feeds have been fown ; 'but 
as the feafon for vegetation is fhort, the farmer can feldom 
cut down more than one full grown crop of grafs. Sheep 
being allowed to pafture at large in the fields all the time the 

corns 



of Kirhnichaeh 



corns are off the ground, is a circumftance very unfavourable 
to the culture of fown grafs, which has not as yet been reme- 
died. Oats are fown in April ; potatoes are planted; lint- 
feed and bear, with grafs-feeds, fown in May ; turnips in 
June. Harveft feldom begins fooner than September. It is 
commonly the middle, or about the end of October, and 
fometimes the middle of November, before it is all gathered 
in. The greater part of the parifh is better adapted for paf- 
turage than for tillage ; and fome of the proprietors are accor- 
dingly laying feveral of their farms under fheep. 

Population ^ Rental, &amp;c. — In 1755, the number of fouls 
was rated at 2689. The population of the parifh has decreas- 
ed much within thefe 20 years, and continuing to decreafe, 
on account of confiderable traces of land being converted into 
fheep farms, and the inhabitants forced to migrate to other 
countries. § The number of fouls in the parifh is about 22co. 
The number of males is to that of females, as 44 is to 50.

and the decay of public fpifit ? Is the Jum of bajppinefi in the body of the

The average of yearly births for the laft 8 years, is 50, and 
of marriages 15. No reader has been kept of the burials. 
Many who do not refide in the parifli, have their burial plac- 
es within it ; and many who do, bury clfewhere. The valu- 
ed rent of the pariih is 4102I. 13s. 4d. Scots. The real rent 
may amount nearly to 3000I. Sterling. The rent of lands 
varies according to the quality of the foil and the circumftan- 
ces of the farm. Lands that have the privilege of a good 
hill pafture annexed to them, pay from 20 to 45 millings Ster- 
ling of rent per acre of arable. Lands that want this privi- 
lege, if not inclofed, pay from 12 to 16 (hillings per acre : if 
inclofed, about 20 millings. 

State of Property. — There are 1 2 proprietors who do not 
refide in the pariih ; 24 fmaller proprietors, mod of whom 
refide in it conftantly, and farm a part of their own property ; 
and 6 other fmaller proprietors, called portioners, from their 
pofTefling but fmall portions of land, which they farm entire- 
ly themfelves. The number of farmers in the pariih is 226. 
Of thefe, 19 are heritors. A plough-gate, or, as it is called 
here, a plough of land, contains only from 7 to 8 acres of a- 
rable land, exclufive of hill pafture. There are about 200 
fuch plough-gates in tillage, and above 40 wholly in paftur- 
age. About a plough-gate of cultivated land there are of- 
ten two tenants or families, who pofiefs the hill pafture be- 
longing to the farm in common, but have each their refpec- 
tive (hares of the arable land, and infield pafture, diftincl:. 
The ploughs are generally drawn by four fmall horfes yoked 
a-breaft. Where the ground is level and tradable, and the 
farmer in eafy circumftances, the plough is often drawn by 
three, or fometimesby two horfes. Many of the tenants fub- 
fet fmall portions of their pofieffions, fuch as a garden, or 

perhaps

perhaps a fmall croft to cottagers, or cottars, as they are call- 
ed. Some of thefe are handy-craftfmen, who fubfift by their 
trade ; others are common labourers, who hire themfelves 
out for day's wages in the country. The number of tradef- 
men is as follows : 10 fquare wrights : 4 wheel wrights; 5 
fmiths i 4 fhoemakers •, 14 (hop-keepers; 14 taylors ; 40 
weavers, including apprentices. Some of thefe have other 
occupations bcfides their trade. 

Wages. — The wages are regulated according to the na- 
ture of the work, and the time of the year in which it is per- 
formed. A day-labourer, from the beginning of March till 
harveft, gets Sd. per day, befides victuals ; a hay or corn-cut- 
ter is. ; a taylor 6d. ; a lint-drefler 8d. ; a wright is. "Wo- 
men hired for fpinning, get 2d. or 3d., according to their 
merit. Men fervants, engaged for a year, get about 61. ; 
and women from 2I. 10s. to 3I. Sterling. 

Live Stock. — Moft of the tenants depend on the fale of cat- 
tle, for the payment o'f their rents. The number of fheep 
is about 9000. More than a third of thefe are of the black 
and white faced kind, fomewhat large in the body, and 
rough in the wool. The refl: are of the common Scotch kind, 
fmaller in dze than the former, but very hardy. A few of 
the Cheviot breed have lately been introduced. The black 
cattle are of the fmall Highland kind. They feed remarka- 
bly well, and, when properly fed on grafs, they prove excel- 
lent beef. Few of them, when fed, exceed in weight 20 
ftones of beef. Their number is about 2000. Few horfes 
are kept, except what are barely fufficient for cultivating the 
ground. They are computed at about 800. There are alfo 
ibme parcels of fwine, and a few goats.

Fairs. 



Statijlical Account 



Fairs. — There ate three annual fairs held within the pa- 
ri fh ; one at Kirkmichacl, called the Michaelmas market, 
and two at the fptftal of Gknfliee. The former is of long 
(landing. It probably took its rife from the concotirfe of 
people who aflembled on the day facred to St Michael, at a 
place confecrated to his memory and worfiiip* From com- 
ing together, for the purpofes of devotion, they learned to 
continue together, for the fake of tranfacYing fecular affairs, 
till, by degrees, this lafh objeel became the chief reafon, and 
at length the only reafon of their alVembling. Michaelmas 
came to be a term for fettling accompts, and other money 
tranfactions, over all Scotland. Half a century ago, this 
fair was one of the principal cattle markets in the kingdom, 
and continued 3 or 4 clays, or rather a week together. Of 
late years, it has been much lefs crowded. There is a week- 
ly maiket held at Kirkmichael on Fridays, whither the peo- 
ple of the neighbourhood repair, to fell what yarn they may- 
have fpun during the week, and to buy their weekly fupply 
of tobacco, fnuff, lamp oil, and other groceries. Shoemakers 
from Athole, difnofe of a great many fhoes alfo, at this mar- 
ket. It has been remarked, and perhaps with too much rea- 
fon, that this market gives encouragement to idlenefs, and 
imprudent, not to f.iy immoral indulgences, by furnifh'mg a 
pretence for frequent vifits to the village. Appointments 
for paying trilling dgfets, are commonly made at this market. 
The creditor and debtor meet. They adjourn to the public 
houfe. After each has drunk his pot, the debtor finds he is 
not able to pay his debt. He craves a week's delay. The 
Creditor eafiiy agrees to fo fhort a term. The appointment 
is renewed, and the fame fcene repeated, perhaps many times, 
before the debt is paid. Thus both time and money are need- 
lefsly fpent, and a habit of idlenefs and of tipling contracted.

Sehools.— In the parochial fchool are taught Englifh, Latin, 
writing, and arithmetic. The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 
merks Scots. There is one charity fchool in Glenfhee, en- 
dowed with a yearly falary by the Society in Scotland for pro- 
ing Chriftian Knowledge. At particular times of the year, 
elpecially in winter, fome perfons voluntarily affume the of- 
fice of fchool mafters in the remoter parts of the parifh, and 
teach reading of Englifh and writing.. 

Language. — The prevailing language in the parifh is the 
Gaelic. A dialecT of the ancient Scotch, alfo, is underftood, 
and currently fpoken. Thefe two, by a barbarous intermix- 
ture, mutually corrupt each other. All the names of places 
are Gaelic. 

Antiquities and Curiofities. — In the middle of a pretty exten- 
five and elevated heathy moor, (lands a large heap of ftones, 
or cairn, ,o yards in circumference, and about 25 feet in 
height. The ftones of which it is compofed are of various 
fizes, but none of them, as far as they are vifible, large ; and 
appear to have been thrown together without order. They 
are in a good meafure covered with mofs, and in fome parts 
overgrown with weeds. This circumftance argues the great 
antiquity of the cairn \ for die circumjacent ground being 
covered with heath, and of a firm mould, a long time muft 
have elapfed, before fo much earth or duft could have been 
collected by the wind, and lodged among the ftones, as to 
form foil for the nourifhment of plants Round this cairn 
are fcattered, at different diftances, a great number of fmal- 
ler cairns. They are generally found in groups of eight or 
ten together. They are all covered more or lefs with mofs 
or heath. About a furlong to the weftward of the great 
cairn are the veftiges, quite diftincl, of two concentric circu- 
lar 



of Kirhnichael.

lar fences of ftone, the outer circle being about 50 feet, and 
the inner 32 feet in diameter. There are alfo the veftiges 
of fix, perhaps more, fingle circular inclofures of ftone, from 
32 to 36 feet in diameter, lying at different diftances in the 
neighbourhood of the cairn. Two parallel ftone fences ex- 
tend from the eaft fide of the cairn, nearly in a ftraight line, 
to the fouthward, upwards of 100 yards. Thefe fences are 
bounded at both extremities by fmall cairns, and feem to 
form an avenue or approach to the great cairn of 32 feet, in 
breadth. There can be little doubt that all thefe are re- 
h'ques of Druidifm \ that the great cairn is one of thofe at 
which they celebrated their folemn feftivals in the beginning 
of fummer and the beginning of winter,* when they offer- 
ed facrifices, adminiftered juilice, &amp;c. ; and that the circles 
and lefler cairns, muft have been the fcenes of fome other 
religious rites, of which the memory and knowledge are now 
loft. Similar cairns are to be feen in the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes, and in different parts of the Highlands ; but this pa- 
rifh has to boaft of a more uncommon and remarkable mo- 
nument of Druidical fuperftition. 

About a mile N. E. from the above mentioned great 
cairn, on a flat-topped eminence, furrounded at fome diftance 
with rocky hills of confiderable height, and fteep afcent, 
ftands one of thofe rocking ftones which the Druids are faid 
to have employed as a kind of ordeal for detecting guilt in

ing Highland parifhes. The cuftom, too, of making a fire in the fields, bsjc

doubtful cafes, f This (lone is placed on the plain furface 
of a r©ck level with the ground. Its fhape is quadrangular 
approaching to the figure of a rhombus, of which the great- 
er diagonal is 7 feet, and the leffer 5 feet. Its mean thick- 
nefs is about 2^ feet. Its folid contents will therefore be 
about 5i}C75 cubical feet. As it is of very hard and folid 
whinftone, its weight, reckoning the cubical foot at 8 (tones 
3 ponnds,f may be reckoned to be 418 (lone 5 pounds, cr 
within 30 pounds of 3 tons. It touches the rock on which 
it refts only in one line, which is in the fame plane with the 
leffer diagonal, and its lower furface » convex toward the 
extremities of the greater diagonal. By preffing down ei- 
ther of the extreme corners, and withdrawing the preffure, 
alternately, a rocking motion is produced, which may be en- 

creafed

well cxpreflcd by Mr Mafon.

It is fuppofed, with much appearance of reafon, that this ordeal, thougk 
it appeared in the eyes of the vulgar to be an appeal to the judgment of the 
Supreme Eeing, was in faift fubfervitnt to the defigns of the Druidical priefls

ly formed of the cafe, or to their defigns regarding the culprit.

crcafed fo much, that the diftance between their loweft de- 
breffion and higheft elevation is a full foot. When the pref- 
fure is wholly withdrawn, the ftone will continue to rock, 
till it has made 26 or more vibrations from one fide to the 
other, before it fettles in its natural horizontal pofition. 
Botli the lower fide of the ftone, and the furface of the* rock 
on which it refts, appear to be worn and roughened by mu- 
tual friction. There is every reafon to fuppofe, from the 
form and relative fituation of the furrounding grounds, that 
this ftone muft have been placed in its prefent pofition by the 
labour of men- It will hardly be thought, therefore, an ex- 
travagant degree of credulity, to refer its origin to the fame 
period with thoh other tribunals of a fimilar conftrudlion, 
mentioned by writers who have treated of the cuftoms of the 
ancient Celts. This opinion is however the more confirm- 
ed, from finding, in the neighbourhood of this ftone, a con- 
fiderable number of other Druidical relics. On the north 
fide of the ftone, at the diftance of 60 yards, on a fmall emi- 
nence, are 2 concentric circles, fimilar to that already de- 
fcribed, and a fingle circle adjoining to them on the eaft 
fide. Beyond this, at 37 yards diftance, on another fmall 
eminence, is another pair of concentric circles, with a 
fingle one adjoining to them on the eaft fide. Beyond 
thefe, at 45 yards diftance, is a third pviir of concentric 
circles, with their adjacent circle on the eaft fide. Far- 
ther on to the north eaft, at the diftance of 90 yards, is a 
fingle circle, and befide it on the weft fide, two rectangular 
enclofures of 37 feet by 12 alfo a cairn 23 or 24 yards in 
circumference, and about 12 feet high in the centre. Several 
fmall cairns are fcattered in the neighbourhood : 1 20 yards 
weft from the rocking ftone is a pair of concentric circles, 
with a fmall (ingle circle befide them of 7 feet in diameter. 
All the pairs of concentric circles are of the fame dimenfions, 

the

the inner one being about 32 feet, and the outer about 45 
or 46 feet in diameter ; and all of them have a breach or 
door-way four or five feet wide on the fouth fide. The (in- 
gle circles are, in general, from 32 to 36 feet in diameter, 
and have no breach. The veftiges of all thofe ftructures are 
perfectly diftinc~t, and many of the ftones ft ill retain the e- 
recl: pofture in which all of them had probably been placed 
at firft. Cairns and circles fimilar to thofe defcribed are to 
be feen in other hills of this parifli, particularly between 
Strathardle and Glenderby. The elevated fituation and cold 
expofure in which thefe ruins ly, have preferved them from 
being ever difturbed by the plough, which has effaced, and 
probably deftroyed ruins of the fame kind in other places. 
There are likewife feveral tall erect ftones, called here in 
Gaelic, Crom-leaca, or Clach-fhleuchda, Jlones of ivorjlnp. 
Some of thefe are 5 and fome 6 feet above the ground, and 
may be funk a confiderable way under the furface, from their 
remaining fo long in the fame pofition ; for a fuperftitious 
regard is paid them by the people, none venturing to remove 
them, though fome of them are fituated in the middle of corn 
fields. 

Manners and Cujloms. — The people are humane and hof- 
pitable to ftrangers, of a fpirit fomewhat independent, but a- 
verfe from a military life. The greateft fault in their gene- 
ral character is, that they are too much difpofed to litigation, 
for which they are noted by their neighbours. Three fhe- 
rifT-officers, and a conftable, refiding within the pariGi, find 
abundance of employment. They are rather inclined alfo 
to be jealous of each other, and feem at times mors anxious 
to repel encroachments, than to improve their own poflef- 
fions. The younger part of the people are fhowy in their 
drefs, but frugal in their diet. Shooting matches, and rural 

balls, 



of Kirkmichaeh 



o l is, are frequent at the holy feafon. Foot ball is a com- 
mon amuiement with the fchool boys, who alfo preferve the 
cuftom of cock- fighting on Shrove Tuefday. All the people 
are of the efhblifhed religion, except one or two families of 
pnpifts in Gleni'hee. 

Difadva tit ages. — The parifh is divided from all the neigh- 
bouring diltricls by hills, mod of them feveral miles broad- 
it is feparated from the market towns, and from the Stor- 
moiiih, (whence it is fupphcd with meal and corn and other

afccnton both fides. Tliis proves a great bar in the way of 
carriage. The intercourfe of the people with each other, is 
in fome meafure difficult and dangerous ; as over the rapid 
river which runs through Strathardle, there is no proper 
bridge from the one end of it to the other There was for- 
merly a bridge of three arches at the village of Kirkmichael % 
but two of the arches fell about 40 years ago, and have ne- 
ver fince been re-built : and the only fubftitute for thefe ar- 
ches, is long planks laid acrofs the river, fupported by the 
remaining pillars of the old bridge. 

A kind of bar, called a keith, laid acrofs the river at Blair- 
gowrie, by thofe who are concerned in the falmon fifhery 
there, effectually prevents the falmon from coming up the 
rivers of Ardle and Shee. This is a grievance which the! 
people think themfelves juftly entitled to complain of 

The tenants in different parts of the parifh Mill perform 
fome fervices to their landlords, fuch as day's work in hay- 
time and harveft, or at fuel. 

Few of the tenants enjoy feafes of their farms. Holding 
their fmall poffeffions by a fhort arid uncertain tenure, they 
are kept continually in a (late of abjeft dependance on their

tinguifh the ardour of patriotifm, that attachment to his na- 
tive foil, which glows fpontaneoufly with fuch warmth in

Is it that the landlords are apprehenfive of deriving no bene-

not having money or fkill, or induftry, for making improve-

themfelves for a number of years, to modes of cultivation, 
with which they are little acquainted ? Or is it, that men, 
on whom wealth and power have conferred one kind of fu-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7305876">REDGORTON</name> 

(County of Perth, Presbytery of Perth, Syno» 
of Perth and Stirling.) 

By the Rev. Mr David Moncrieff.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Name. 

T 

J- he name of this parilh is wrote differently Redgore- 
town, contracted Redgorton, Rogertown, and Regorton, 
The firft feems to be the moft ancient ; and, according to 
vulgar tradition, is derived from the battle of Loncarty, at 
which time, many of the wounded were brought to the cu- 
rate's houfe, which from thence was called Redgoretown, o? 
the town of the redrgore, and afterwards gave that name to 
the whole parifli. Rogertown is derived probably from the 
name of a family, Rogers, now entirely extindT: ; the name it- 
felf is now become obfolete. The other name Regorton, is 
Gaelic, and, as I am informed, fignifies in that language 
a field of corn.

Statistical Account 



Extent — If is about 6 miles long, reckoning from Oraig- 
ingall, the Weltmoft point, to Safelanding, the Eaftmoft, 
and at a medium nc ir 2 miles broad. There is a fmall part 
pf the parifh disjoined from the reft, which is about 6 miles 
diftant from the church, running along the foot of the Gram- 
pian Mountains, and interfered by a neighbouring parifh. 
The lower part of the parifh extends itfelf in an irregular fi- 
gure, running along the rivers Tay and Almond. 

It is bounded on the South by the parifh of Tippermuir, 
on the Weft by Methven, on the North by Moneidy and 
Aughtergaven, and on the Eaft by Scone. 

Situation, Soil, and Air — The country here is rather hilly, 
but the high grounds are neither very elevated nor fteep, but 
rife and fall gradually towards the rivers, where the land is 
flat,' and in many places can be watered by the adjacent ri- 
vers. 

The foil is generally light, though in fome places there is 
a mixture of clay and black earth ; and, where it is drained, 
and the large muir-ftones, found here and there, either taken 
pur, or funk below the depth pf the plough, the land is abun- 
dantly fertile. 

The fituation of this parifh being more elevated than fome 
of the neighbouring, the air is pure and healthy. The moft 
prevalent diftemper is the ague, winch, however, is feldom 
mortal, and feems almoft confined to the places neareft the 
rivers, and to thofe who are employed in the public works 
there. 

Rivers. — The river Tay runs along the Eaft fide of the 
parifh, Almond on the South and Weft, and Shochie and 
Ordie on the Weft. All the rivers in this part of the coun- 
ty 



of Redgorton.

try difcharge themfelves into the Tay, which is the largeft 
river in Scotland ; and, when joined by the Earn, below 
Perth, is fuppofed to contain more frefh water than the 
Thames- There is a fmall lake in the disjoined part of this 
parifh, remarkable for it's depth in proportion to it s furface, 
which produces large trout of a blackifh colour, from one to 
two pound weight, and upwards. The river Tay, in this 
neighbourhood, abounds with falmon, from fixteen to twen^ 
ty pound weight, at a medium ; fea, or white trout, from 
one to four pound ; bull trout from one to thirty pounds ; 
a yellow trout from two pounds and downwards, and a few 
pike and eels. There is alfo to be found here a fmall fea 
trout, called the Lammas whiting, from a quarter to half a 
pound weight, of exquifite tafte. It is fo called, from its 
coming up from the fea at this feafon. The falmon and 
bull trouts are caught with nets, though there is excellent 
rod-fifliing, or angling in Tay, as well as in the other three 
rivers, though in thefe there are no falmon but in the 
fpawning feafon. The falmon timings let to tackfmen, a- 
mount to about 150I. annually. The falmon is one of the 
ftaples in this country, and is generally fent to the London 
market, or up the Mediterranean. When fold here, they 
bring in Spring ^d. a pound, and jd" in Summer; though, 
till within thefe 30 years, they were fold at 2d per pound, 
and were fo very plentiful, (the export trade being not then 
known) that in Perth and the neighbourhood, the fervants 
made an article at hiring time, that they fhould not get it 
above twice a-week. 

Antiquities. — It was in this parifh that the famous battle 
of Loncarty was fought, at the end of the 10th century, un- 
der the reign of Kenneth III. betwixt the Scots and the 
Danes ; which was fo decifive, that of the enemy engaged in 

battle,

battle, according to tradition, thofe who efcaped the fword 
were drowned in the river, which was then fwelled by the 
rains, and overflowed its banks.* 

* It was for their gallant behaviour at this memorable battle, that the fa- 
mily of the Hays were enoblcd, under the name of Hay of Errol, and had 
for their arms, argent, three ejeutehcom, gules, with the yoke and bow inferibed. 
The common report is fupported by the teftimony of Heftor Boetius, and 
Buchanan, that, on the firll onfet, our countrymen gave way, and were pur- 
sued by the victorious Danes through the adjacent fields. This being ob- 
ferved by a farmer of the name of Hay, or Haia, and his two fons, who 
were plowing in the adjacent fields, they took the yokes and bows of their 
ploughs, croffed the river Tay, and, thus accoutred, having taken a (land at 
a narrow pafs, flopped their fugitive countrymen, rallied them, renewed 
the battle, drove the Danes into the river, and thofe that were not drowned, 
yvtic cut to pieces. After this great flaughter, the King went with thefe 
three valiant Heroes in triumphant proctflion into the town of Perth; and 
next day holding an affembly of the States, at Scone, it was decreed to give 
the venerable old Champion the choice of the hounds chafe, or the falcons 
flight, as a poffeffion fuitable to the honours conferred on him ; and, carry- 
ing him up to Kinnoul Hills, where the Danifh camp had lately been, that 
he might have a profpect of the fine country lying below, great part of which 
■was to be his inheritance, he made choice of the Falcon's flight. The bird 
took its flight from the top of one of thefc hills, and it alighted on a ftone 
fcy the river of Tay, a mile to the fouth of the houfe of Errol, where it 
ftands at this day, and is flill called the falcon's, or ba-wlts Jlone. All the inter- 
mediate lands were given in property to this family, but have fince been par- 
celled out to different branches, and have been fold to others ; unlefs that 
part of the eftate, which is flill held by Hay of Leys, one of the eldefl ca- 
dets of this noble family. The country people ftill fhow the ridges of where 
the brave Hay and his fon were ploughing when they joined the battle, and 
they were diftinguiflied from the reft of the field by fmall ftripes of grafs, or 
baulks, on each fide, which no farmer ever dared to break up till within thefe 
three years. They flill, alfo, fhow you the narrow pafs, where the Hays 
rallied their flying countrymen, which is now levelled down. I have feen it 
entire, when it much refembled the fmall Roman flations, which are to bo 
feen in many places of Scotland, though not fo regular. They point out the 
turn again hillocks, where the Danes began to retreat, and the hollow way, 
trndcr cover of which the Clans furrounded the Danes. I have feen a great

Modern Hi/lory and Improvements. — The modern hiftory of 
this parifh, will appear to the Statefman, to be much more 
ufeful than a minute account of its antiquities. 

Cromwell 

number of tumuli, or burrows, fcattcred over the field of battle, where the 
dead were buried, not raifed in any regular order, or in one place, but when; 
ever the flain fell in the greateft numbers ; but they are now almoft levelled 
with the reft of the ground. I have feen maDy of them opened, and the 
light allies found there in great quantities, evince the nature of their contents. 
Some of the bones have been dug out quite entire, particularly a large hu- 
man Ikull, the jaw-bone and teeth being entire, in the prefence of the late 
Dr Bofwell.who lodged it in the Edinburgh Mufteum. In thefe, and through 
the whole field, which may contain near three hundred Scotch acres, there 
have been found hilts and blades of l'words, fpears, and bitts of bridles.— 
Some of thefe were in the poffeffion of the neighbouring gentlemen, and 
there is a houfe carpenter, who made of them planes, faws, and tools of huf 
bandry. The field of battle, till of late, was grown over with heath and 
brulhwood, but is now cultivated, and become a rich field of corn, fo that, 
in a literal fenfe, " the fwords have been beat into plough fhares, their fpears 
into pruniug hooks, and the defert land has become a fruitful field." Thefe, 
and many other circumftances, too minute to relate, were told, and pointed 
out to me, with as much enthufiafm, efpecially by an old man of the name 
of Blair, wftofe anceftors had been long proprietors in the neighbourhood, as 
if they had happened in his own time. The only remains of the famous 
battle now to be feen, the laft of the tumuli being levelled two years ago, 
are the graves where the Danilh General and Officers were buried, at the 
head of -which there are large ftones ftill ftanding, and a houfc lately inha- 
bited, called to this day Denmark. To confirm the truth of this ancient 
piece of hiftory, we have the uninterrupted tradition of the country, the tef- 
timony of our moft ancient Hiftorians, the undoubted marks of a battle, the 
armorial bearings of the Errol Family, the Bows and the Yokes, as far back 
as the twelfth century ; and could any pieces of the armour be difcovered, of 
which there is fome probability, ftiowing their origin to be Danilh, it would 
put the matter beyond all doubt. 

Another piece of antiquity not to be omitted, is the continuation of the 
caufeway, leading from the Roman camp at Ardoch, which croffes the Tay 
at its prefent conflux with the Almond. At this place there are the remains 
of a Roman nation, regularly formed into a fquare, furrounded with a deep 

nff

foffc, which has been for fomc years gradually wafhing away by the over- 
flowing of the Almond There have been dug up fcvcral earthen urns, fil- 
led with human allies ; particularly a large one, about half an inch in thick- 
ntfs, made of a very fine clay of a brown colour, plated on the infidc with 
braf«, almoft confumcd, and covered with vcrdigreefe, containing about ten 
Englifh gallons. Another very curious one difcovertd, was fmallcr than the 
former, the contents of which were, a few afhes of oak- wood, and part of z 
lachrymatory, which was a fmall glafs phial, the eighth of an inch in thick- 
nefs, containing about an Englifh quart and a half; at the bottom of another 
of thefe was found a plate of lead, Weighing about two flone weight, with 
Roman characters infcribeJ. 

The foundation of a wooden bridge thrown over the Tay at this place flill 
remains. It confifts of large oak planks, from fit to eight inches in diameter^ 
fattened together by long fkairs, but coarfcly jointed, and furrouuded with 
clafps of iron, frequently twifted. It would feem, that fcrewbolts, and fine, 
made joints, Were then unknown. I caufed one of them to be raifed fonie 
years ago, at the requeft of the late Dr Hopei who affured me that the fa- 
bric of the wood was not in the leaft decayed. At the other end, beyond 
this bridge, to the North Eaft, there are fome remains of the continuation of 
the cauferray, almoft as far as Blairgowrie, beyond which there are no tra- 
ces of this famous military road to be difcovered. This gives great credit 
to the report of the battle betwixt Agricola and Galgacus being fought in 
that neighbourhood. Tacitus informs us, that his father-in law Agricola 
met with a heavy ftroke in the death of his only fon, an infant, which great- 
ly afHi&amp;ed him. Afterwards he led his army to the foot of the Grampians,- 
where this battle was fought, and where Agricola, not without much blood- 
fhed, remained mafter of the field. In this engagement, Aulius Atticus, 
captain of a cohort, was killed. He was efteemed by Agricola, and much la- 
mented by him and the army. It is not improbable, that the large ornament- 
ed urn contained the allies of Agricola's fon, and that the fmaller one with 
the lachrymatory, the afhes of Atticus, who would be interred with military 
honours. The prefent courfe of the Almond, though near the military road 
and ftation, is about half a mile to the northward from its juniftirn with 
the Tay in former times. This river anciently had its courfe by Ruthven 
Gaflle, now Huntingtower, where there is ftill a fmall rivukt, known by 



of Redgorton.

the name of Old Almond. At this place there was a Royal Fort, and a fmall 
village called Bartha, which was carried down the river in the night time by 
a very great inundation King William the firfr, furnamcd the Lion, had 
his youngefl fon, John, with his nurfe, and fourteen of his domeflics, carried 
down the river and drowned. This happened in the year one thoufand, 
two hundred and ten; fo far Buchanan, and his predeceffor Boe- 
tius deferve credit, and their naration is confirmed by other hiftorians, as 
well as by the conflant tradirion But that the King, about two years af- 
terwards, removed the remains to the prefent fite of the town of Perth, 
which he afterwards called Perth, or Perthai, is by no means deferving of 
equal credit. That Perth has been overflowed by the waters of the Tay, i-; 
certain, but, from the digging for the foundation of fome houfes lately 
built, there have been difcovered paved ftreets, from three to ten feet deep, 
lb that it has probably always flood en, or near to its prefent fituation. This 
opinion is flrengthened by this circumftance, that the charter granted by 
King William is only a nova damus, or a renewal of a former charter. 

There are, in various parts, remains of Diuidical places of worfhip, and 
judgment, particularly at Uvcr Beuchil, where there ate twelve large flones 
fet on end, and one larger in the middle. At fome fmall diftance, there are 
other two, the one with nine, and the other with feven, and what is peculiar 
with thefe here and elfewhere, is, that the number is always an odd one. 

There are large heaps of ftones near Pitcairn, called penance cairns, which, 
according to the tradition of the country, were colleded by way of penance 
in the time of popery. They are in the neighbourhood of a popifh chapel, 
which is now in ruins. 

About a quarter of a mile below Stanley.where the. river Tay is of confi- 
Cderablc breadth, there is a natural ridge of rocks that runs acrofs the river » 
almofl forming an arch, whigh, at the top, within thefe thirty years, was only 
eighteen feet wide : but the arches were thrown down of late, in order to 
build a dam dyke for an inlet of the water to Luncarty Bleachfield. Two fi- 
milar arches were formed over the river Almond, where they were but of 
late widened for fimilar purpofes. The fabric of thefe is not inferior in'point 
of fymmetry to the work of the moil ingenious architect, but greatly furpafj 
the arc of human hands in point of ftrength.

acres. The proprietor, about fourteen years ago, offered to 
let the whole fur a rent of thirty pounds flxrling ; now it 
is become the feat of two large manufactures, a cotton mil!, 
and a print-field, and brings to the proprietor of the land an 
hundred a-year ; but, if we take in the improvement of the 
adjoining fields, necefiarily connected with thefe great works, 
its value can fanxely beeftimated. About twelve years ago, 
IMr William M l Alpine, from the neighbourhood of Glafgow, 
a clergyman's fon, who had been bred a callico printer, 
came to view this country, and having beheld with aftq- 
nifhment the great quantity of frefh water, the nu- 
merous falls for working machinery by water, made 
choice of this fpot for erecting a cotton mill am! print-field. 
Enlarging his views as he di (covered more of the advan- 
tages of the fituation of the neighbourhood near Perth, he fet 
down very extenfive works for printing on the other fide of 
the Tay, in the parifh of Scone, now called Stormontfield ; 
and fhowed, in all his operations, an extent of genius, hither- 
to unknown in this part of the country. But, fuch is the fa- 
tality of all human fchemes, not content with his views in 
this country, he unhappily involved himfelf with fome of 
the great houfes in Manchefter, who failed feme years ago, 
by the market being overflocked with cottons, and with them 
he fell. However, the fpirit he raifed in this neighbourhood, 
caught fome of the wealthy people in Perth, who hitherto 
had not obferved their natural and local advantages. Now a 
company of Perth merchants carry on here both the fbin- 
ning cotton and printing calicoes. The printing, in the year 

preceding the fixth of July, feventeen hundred and ninety- 
one, 

tcclor had a fmall advanced camp, to check the inrsads of the Highlanders 
-into Perth, which afterwards gave the name to this field, which it flill re- 
tains. In digging the foundation of a cotton mill, which has lately been g- 
redted there, lquarc iron fliot of thirty-two pounds weight were found, which 
giyes credibility to the common report, which has never been doubted.

nens, and his fince varied, more, or lefs, according to the 
demand. When the cotton mill is finifhed, it will contain 
about four thoufand fpindles, and give employment to near 
nine hundred hands. There are about one hundred and fif- 
ty employed in various branches of the printing bufinefs, be- 
fides their families; 

Pitcairn-Green. — Adjoining to thefe, and 'dependant on 
them, is the village of Pitcairn-green, which is only in its in- 
fancy ; but of which Mrs Cowley, in her elegant poem on 
this rifin'g" village, predicts, that it will one day rival Manches- 
ter. May her prophecy be foon accomplifhed ! 

Battleby. — Proceeding eaftward, the next village is Battle- 
by, near where the battle of Loncarty was fought, but as yet 
there are few houfes built. It is meant for weavers, and 
to accommodate the Loncarty company. 

Loncarty. — About half a mile further on, is Loncarty, 
where ftand the works erected by the late Mr William Sande- 
man. There is a large farm here, and though the foil is rather 
barren, the hand pf induftry has wrought wonders. I have: 
with pleafure frequently beheld this ingenious man pointing 
out to Strangers a fmall field containing about fix acres, 
which he intended for bleaching thread, and to which he ori- 
ginally defigned to confine his attention in that branch" o£ 
bufmefs. But fcarce was it finidied, when his ideas expand- 
ed, and for more than thirty years paft, there have been 
eighty acres or upwards covered with cloth, which ha? been 
whitened and drefied either after the Dutch or Irifh mode, 
in fo perfect a manner, that, as yet it is unrivalled in great 
Britain. Mr Sandeman was very lucky in adopting a fkil-

lul ami attentive partner, Mr Bettor Turnbull, who with- 
great fuccefs conduded the operative part of this work. 
Five hundred thoufand fquare yards, at a medium, are bleach- 
ed annually ; and though both theft gentlemen are now dead, 
their fons and defcendants conduct matters in fuch a mas- 
terly way, that che bufinefs is rather increafing for thefe two 
years paft. Befides linens of various defcriptions, they have 
now begun to bleach mucins. This company fpins cottoir 
by jeanies, conftrudted after the mod approved plan; fhe 
carding and roving are performed by water. They employ 
about a thoufand fpindles. They made their own foap and 
candles till of late. They refine their old lees, and from 
them make afhes. It would fwell this narration too much,, 
to defcribe minutely the various and extenfive machinery, 
the canals, and fprings of water, conducted at very consider- 
able expence to keep the whole in motion. I (hall only add, 
that fo far from being as yet complete, when they either ob- 
tain a new leafe, or a feu, from the proprietor, which is now 
in agitation^ their works will probably be greatly enlarged, 
and other new branches of manufacture introduced, as they 
have feveral water falls yet unoccupied. There are more, 
than three hundred employed here, befides their families. 

All the manufactures I have taken notice of, are erected 
on the eftate of Colonel Graham of Balgowan, who has three 
fourths of the whole parifh. This gentleman, for fome time 
paft, has given confiderable attention to improving his lands, 
has planted with great tafte many thoufands of firs, and all 
manner of foreft wood ; covered with trees the little emi- 
nences in different places ; run flips of planting for miles 
along the different farms, and twixt the different enclofures ; 
built fences with ditches and quicks ; and where ftones 
could be got, has made fnap dykes, which form an imme- 
diate fence. So that from being heath and uncultivated land,

his extenfive eftate has become almoft a garden : and how- 
ever brilliant his fervice to his country has been, in raifing 
for Government two battalions of foldiers, his patriotifm, in 
improving fo much wafte land, is a more eflential fervice, 
and will continue when the brilliancy of his martial exploits 
will be forgotten. 

Stanley — After palling Loncarty and Mr Graham's proper- 
ty, we come next to the eftate of Nairn, belonging to the 
Duke of Athol, where the improvements arc not lefs rapid 
and worthy of notice. The mod remarkable obje£t here is; 
the cotton mill of Stanley, which employs about 2000 fpin- 
dles ; and befides this, there is now erecting a mill for fpin- 
ning flax •, but as the fite of both thefe are in the parim of 
Aughtergavin, I (hall only here take notice, that a fmall rivu- 
let running through the village, divides the two parifties, and 
when the whole plan is completed, there will be more than 
the half of it in this, befides the whole of their prefent farm. 
In that part of the village belonging to Redgorton, there arc 
at prefent about three hundred fouls. 1 

As to the improvements of land, what is remarkable, is this 
circumftance, that about three or four years ago, two thirds 
were heath, and now they are fertile fields of corn, wheat, 
and grafs. The two farms moll; improved, and which more 
immediately catch the eye of the traveller, are thofe poflef- 
fed by Mr James Stobie, land-furveyer, and Mr Charles- 
Stewart, on each of which there are ere&amp;ed houfes and offi- 
ces in a taftey ftile. 

Befides the public works already mentioned, there is one- 
corn mill, one oil ditto, one flour ditto, and one barley ditto, 
belonging to Lord Methven, at the mills of Pitcairn. In o- 
ther places, there are two corn mills, belonging to Colonel 
Graham.

In the whole of this parilh, three fourths of which were 
within thefe few years heath and fwamps, there are little 
more than 300 acres of muir, the reft being under tillage, or 
covered with trees. In the lower part of the pariih there are 
32S9 acres. 

Population. — In the year 1755 by Dr Webfter's computa- 
tion, the numbers were 1074. There mud have been a miftake 
here : for in the year 1 763, when the prefent incumbent was 
fettled, byan accurate furvey, the number of fouls amounted 
to little more than 606. In the year 1772, they amounted 
to 1700 and odds, and now to 2123, of which 507 are uuder 
10 years of age. But as fome of the manufactures are in a 
ftate of infancy, and as there are not yet houfes built within 
the parifh fufRcient to accomodate thofe employed therein, 
who are obliged to lodge in the neighbouring pnrifhes, the 
prefent numbers are but an imperfect fketch of the hands 
employed in the various branches of trade. Houfes are con- 
tinually building •, fo that, in a few years, the numbers of this 
pariih will probably be doubled ; particularly at the cotton 
works in Cromwell Park, where at prefent two floors only 
are filled with machinery ; but before Whitfunday next, the 
whole will be completed, which will bring an increafe of 
400 or 500 inhabitants. 

As the regifter of births and burials is not accurately 
kept i as poor people in many cafes omit entering their 
names in the regifter, to avoid the trifling expence of 
regiitration, and fome bury the dead without the afliftance

There are about 30 weavers, but their number will foon 
increafe ; three fmithies, and two mafter houfe carpenters, be- 
fides thofe belonging to the public works ; there are feven pu- 
blic houfes, but three would be perfectly fufficient for every 
ufeful purpofe. I here are no refiding heritors, neither are 
there here any phyficians, lawyers, or attornies. There are 
14 farms, of which 10 are the property of Colonel Graham. 
Befides thefe, are many fmall poffeflions, having attached to 
them from one to ten acres. There ftems to be a defign 
formed, and already carried into execution for about two 
miles, to connect thefe fmall pendicles and the various villa- 
ges ; fo that within a few years, the whole length of the pa- 
i-ilh, which is about fix miles, will appear as one connected 
village. There are no oxen ufed there, either for plowing or 
the draught ; and as the common plough is generally drawn 
by two horfes, the number of black cattle reared here is but 
fmall, and generally fold at the age of two or three years. 
There is not a man or woman that has either hand or limb 
without employment. 

Productions — The crops raifed here are wheat, rye, barley, 
oats, peafe, turnips, flax, potatoes, and grafs-feeds of various 
kinds ; the one half of the farms being generally in grafs. 
They export feme wheat and rye, large quantities of barley, 
fome young cattle, and confiderable quantities of dates. They 
import fome of the larger kind of horfes, and great quanti- 
ties of oats and oat meal. There are two fmall pits of fhell- 
marle, and the rivers Almond and Shockie are lined with rock 
marie, of a reddifh colour. They generally lay 50 bolls of 
fhell-marle on the acre, but four times that quantity of rock 
marie ; the former lofes it virtue within five yearsy while the 
other continues to operate for fifteen, and feems fully to com- 
p?nfat§ for the extra expence in digging and carriage.

In the lower part of the parifti, there are 2,439 acres ara- 
ble, 250 on natural pafture, 300 planted, and nearly as much 
in heath. There is a meafurement of the whole parifti. 

Mifcellanous Oberfervations , — Advantages. — From the local 
fituation of this parifti, it is both healthy, and capable of 
great improvements, from there being water falls at many 
places yet unoccupied. The fick from Perth, which is al- 
molt fituated as low as the furface of the river, come here 
to breathe a purer air, and to recover health. The difciples 
of the late Mr John Glafs, who was the father and founder 
of the independents in Scotland, can atteft the truth of this. 
They find Loncarty a place both chearful and nourifhing ; 
from which the wearied feldom go without refreshment, or 
the hungry without being fed. The work people, employed 
in the various manufactures, are diftinguilhed from their 
neighbours by the cleanlinefs and neatnefs of their drefs, 
particularly the females, who, upon this account, are gene- 
rally married very young. There is a fprightlinefs and vi- 
vacity in their manners, which is very engaging ; and on all 
convivial occafions, efpecially at their weddings, as they are 
generally taught to dance, they difplay a gaiety and order, 
which is feldom found in other places. The bounds of the 
parilh do not confine this humour, but it has diffufed itfelf 
through the whole country ; and the proprietors of thofe 
works who refide in Perth, have felt its influence. Ia 
place of travelling in carts, and being jaded on hack?, 
many of the manufacturers have their own horfes for 
riding, and give an airing to their wives and children, in 
genteel carriges. The gentlemen and ladies there, are dref- 
fed with the fame elegance that is obferved in other places, 
and their balls and aflemblies are no lefs brilliant. A cir- 
cumftance deferving notice, is this, that about thirty yer-rs 

ago, 



of Redgorton. 537 

ago, there were only three or four chaifes in Perth to be 
let for hire, and now there are fixteen ; and thefe muft be 
befpoke feveral days before they are needed, otherwife the 
intended jaunt muft be poftponed. This increafe cannot 
be altogether imputed to {hangers who pafs through Perth 
as a thorough-fare, but alfo to the great increafe of the 
manufactures, which fupply not only the neceffaries, but 
alfo the elegancies of life. The attention to decorum has 
extended itfelf to the public worfhip of the Deity, where, 
befides the Pfalms of David, the paraphrafes lately recom- 
mended by the General Aflembly, are fung in various parts, 
with fome hymns and anthems •, fo that the mufic in this 
church is not excelled but by few in this kingdom. At the 
celebration of the great Chriftian feftival, the Sacrament o£ 
the Supper, though the church fcarcely contains the com- 
municants, there is no field or tent preaching, as in fome 
other places, fo derogatory from the folemnity of this infti- 
tution. 

Dif advantages. — However, on the whole, it muft be ac- 
knowledged, that the elevated and unequal furface of the 
greater pare of the lands, render it wet and fpungy, and 
the large whin ftones found detached in different places, 
make it difficult to labour with the plough. But the one 
can be removed by drains, which can eafily be filled with 
fmall ftones, found every where in abundance ; and the o- 
ther, either by digging, blowing, or by finking them below 
the level of the plough. If the tenants have no leifure for 
thefe operations, there are undertakers here, who will exe- 
cute the work either by day wages or per acre. It is an im- 
pediment to the building here, that there is no free-ftone in 
the parifh ; but this can be found in the neighbourhood, par- 
ticularly near the confines of the parifh of Methven. When 

Vol. XV.- 3 Z they

they build with whin-done, either in time of rain or in 
thaw after frofl:, the houfes become damp by the ftones 
fweating, or becoming moid j a fault which only can be 
remedied by lathing the walls with wood, which is the cafe 
with the manfe. There are many clay pits from which they 
make excellent bricks. • 

The grofs rental of the whole parifli, amounts nearly to 
one thoufand and feven hundred pounds, including the Tim- 
ings. But this conveys but an imperfect idea of what the 
yearly rental will foon be. For the farm of Loncarty, which 
contains about five hundred acres, rents only at eighty guin- 
eas, and there are other farms in a fimilar fituation. The 
Duke of AthoFs tacks have been lately fet for twenty two 
years, but the mod of Colonel Graham's are nearly expired. 
The di-tiched part of the parifh, which runs along the 
Grampians, is not remarkable for any thing but its blue 
flate quarries, which, though neither fo large nor fo thin as 
the Eafdale flates, are very durable. There are two kinds, 
a light and dark blue ; the laft is generally preferred. 

There is no other church than the eflabhfhed one ; and 
the various fects of feceders, burgers, relief and indepen- 
dents, do not amout to more than a twentieth part of the 
parifh. The manfe and church were built within thefe 
twenty years ; and though both are more elegant than the 
ordinary ones, yet they are both ^ too fmall. The ftipend, 
eftimating the victual at the ufual converfion, is fcarce eighty 
pounds ; it is probable, however, it will foon be augmented. 
There were originally three chapels depending on the Ab- 
bacy of Scone, with a glebe annexed to each, but were 
fometime after the Reformation erected into one parifli, 
which afterwards took its name from the centrical one, 
Redgorton. Two of the glebes are contiguous to the pre- 

fent 



of Redgorton.

fent manfe, and altogether may meafure about twelve acres. 
The Vifcout Stormont, now Earl of Mansfield, is patron. 

The prefent incumbent was fettled in 1763. His imme- 
diate predeceflbr was George Frafer, now minifter at Monei- 
dy, who fucceeded to George Meek, whofe predeceflbr was 
George Blaky, who was the firft minifter fettled afier the 

Revolution, and fucceeded Achterlouny, who carried oft' 

all the public records in his time, as well as thofe that were 
more ancient ; and fince, no account of the ancient poor's 
funds has ever been recovered. 

The heritors of this parifh, are, the Duke of Athol, Lord 
Methven, Colonel Graham of Balgowan, and Mr Drummond 
of Logiealmond, none of whom refide. 

The funds for maintaining the poor are fmall ; they arife 
chiefly from feat rents in the church, the weekly collections, 
and a fmall affefiment of ten or fifceen pounds yearly, the 
one half paid by the heritors, the other by the parifhioners. 
The poor here feldom exceed eight or ten in number; and 
a fum not exceeding thirty pounds is fufficient for their fup- 
port, as well as for defraying all the expences of the felfion 
clerk, &amp;c. The poor get from two to fix fhiliings monthly, 
and, before winter, a few coals and cloaths when neceflary. 
From half of the collections, which the Sefiion is allowed 
to difpofe, of at pleafure ; the money from the mortcloths, 
and the fines, the poor children, who are not on the 
parifh lift, are educated, get books and cloaths. When 
any extraordinary calamity falls out, there is a collection 
made for the purpofe, which is generally liberal. There 
have been no beggars or travelling poor here for thefe thirtv 
years, ever fince the prefent incumbent was fettled. There 
is one parochial fchool ; the falary is no more than one hun- 
dred merks Scots ; the number of fcholars is from fifty to 
one hundred. Befides this, there are two private fchools, 
one at Stanley, the other at Cromwell Park. There are

three public roads which pafs through this parifh, and very 
near the manfe : the great road from Perth to Dunkeld, 
which is a turnpike, that from Dunkeld to Balgowan, Stir- 
ling, &amp;c ; and the third from Perth to the Weft Highlands 
through Glenalmond. About twenty years ago, the an- 
nual wa.;es of a man-fervant, were from four to live pounds, 
now from feven to ten ; and of a woman-fetvant, from 
thirty to forty (hillings, now three or four pounds. A day- 
labourer then thought himfelf well paid with eight pence, 
now he demands one (hilling, and can fcarce be hired at 
any rate. ["he people in this parifh, are very induftrious, 
nnlefs it be ftrangers, on their firft coming from diftant parts, 
who foon acquire the decent manners of this country. Cqii- 
fiderable attention is p lid to the morals of the people at the 
public works, particularly at Loncarty, where the manu- 
factures have been eftablifhcd for forty years. When the 
young folks of either fex, are fufpe£ted of too much inti- 
macy, the young man is called before his mafter ; and if he 
refufes to marry the lafs he profeffes to love, he is imme- 
diately difmiffed from the work ; but if he marries, which 
is generally the cafe, he gets a houfe and garden, and a fmall 
compliment. The (jnly feuel made ufe of here is coal, which 
they either bring from Perth, or from the pits. If the laft 
is the cafe, they fet off with their carriages about midnight, 
and arrive at home the next evening in the twilight. 

General Otfervatiom .—A fhall conclude this hiftory with a 
few general obfervations refpecling the police of the coun- 
try, and the improvement of the livings of the clergy in 
Scotland. 

If the gentry could be induced to attend the worfhip of 
the eftablifhed church ; if the churches were rendered more 
comfortable, and the roads and avenues leading thereunto, 

wen

54* 



were kept decent and dry, public worfhip would be more 
generally attended, the colietfions for the poor would be in- 
crcafed, afleflments rendered unneceffary in moft country pa-* 
rilhes, the gentlemen would thereby become more patriotic, 
and their influence greatly enlarged. However lightly they 
may think of the prefent afleflments for the maintenance of 
the poor, which will every day increafe, if no method fimilar 
to the above is adopted, they will foon become as burden- 
fome as the pooi Vrates in England ; which will confequent- 
Jy lower the value of their lands- . 

If the Legiilature would enlarge the glebes, and in place 
of fix, allocate to the clergy twenty .or thirty acres of land, 
ir would be both advantageous to the incumbent and ufeful 
to the whole country, by fetting to public view a field weil 
cultivated, and that at no greater expence than could be af- 
forded by the ordinary farmer. But till this can be obtain- 
ed, might not the heritors accomodate their minifters with a 
few acres at the fame rate that they would demand from 
others, without charging, as a few do, an extra rent on ac- 
count of the convenience, &amp;c ? 

To obtain favour in thefe refpe&amp;s to the clergy of this 
church, would it not be an inducement, that the prefent in- 
cumbents would pay a little more attention to what land they 
already poffefs, and join with the utile fome degree of ele- 
gance •, as enlarging their gardens, and beftowing fome pains 
on their cultivation, and, where the fituation of the manfe 
permits, have a fmall lawn and fhrubbery around the houfe. 
It would be no great expence to plant an hundred fruit 
trees or more, which in a few years would become profita- 
ble. I fpeak not from theory, but from my own experi- 
ence. I know a neighbour, who, by enlarging his garden, 
has got a plot for onions which yields him from five to ten 

pounds

pounds yearly, and that without any other expence than 
ploughing and harrowing, without the aid of the fpade. An- 
other fells apples to the amount of ten pounds and upwards ; 
a third garden roots and goofeberries to the fame amount. 
Why fhould not the practice be general ?

heath, fern, &amp;c. fo, not only the particular place in which 
the church flood*, but alfo many other places in the parifh, 
are incumbered with thofe fubftances. This parifh, which

from £aft to Weft. Bounded by the parifh of Minnigaff on

the North, Girthon on the Eaft, Anwoth on the South, and 
the rivers Cree and Wigton Bay, on the Weft. 

Surface, Soil, and Produce. — The country in general has 
rather a mountainous appearance, rifing gradually lrom the 
fhore the whole length of the parifh ; yet the interior part is, 
in many places, interfered with rivulets, valleys, and low- 
land, which, by the induftry of the inhabitants, and being in 
the vicinity of fuch inexhauftable treafures of fea-fhells, have 
been rendered very fertile, either -for producing crops of 
grain, or for pafturage. The lands on the banks of the river 
Cree, (which forms Wigton Bay, and is the weftern bounda- 
ry the whole length of the parifh) is of a fuperior quality, 
partly of a clay, and partly of a gravelly foil, and, for either 
tillage or grafting, is equal to any land in the South of Scot- 
land. The country all along the Bay has a mod delightful 
appearance, the great military road running along the coaft 
between Gatehoufe of Fleet, and Newton-Douglafs, i» one 
of the mod pleafant ftages in Scotland, the whole being di- 
verfified with woods, gentlemen's feats, and beautiful inclo- 
fures, hills gently rifing on the one hand, the Bay on the o- 
ther, with a full view of the town, and great part of the ftiire 
of Wigton on the oppofite fide of the -Bay, and the We of 
Man, lying out in St George's Channel ; fo that, for variety 
of objects, fo well fitted to pleafe and amufe the fancy, or to 
elevate and expand the mind, fuch a profpecl is feldom to be 
met with. The mountainous parts are partly green and 
partly covered with heath, or heather, with a mixture of 
grafs and herbage, that feeds both fheep and black cattle to- 
lerably well. Thefe fheep, which are of the black faced kind, 
and of the fmall breed, are generally efteemed excellent mut- 
ton, and when come to age, the wedders generally weigh

from S to iolb. per quarter, their wool generally brings from 
8 to ros. per (lone, 26 lib. linglifh to the ftone. They are 
all bred upon the land, and fold off when they come to age, 
in regular rotation. There are alfo a few of the large breed 
grafs'd upon the low land, worth from 18 to 25s. Ster. The 
black cattle are all of the true Galloway breed, and a great part 
of them not inferior to any in the country*; when they are 
come to age, they generally go to the Englifh markets. The hor- 
fes are moftly all of the draught kind, for the purpofe of farm- 
ing, only a few kept for the faddle There are alfo a few 
goats, but that kind of flock are not numerous, the whole 
ftock of the parifh ftand thus :

Ditto of the large breed, - - 300 

Black cattle, - - 1,600 

Horfes, - 200 

Goats, - - - - 500 

There are alfo hogs and poultry in abundance, for the ufe 
of the inhabitants. This part of the country alfo yields a 
plentiful fource of amufement to the fportfman, being well 
flocked with groufe, black game, partridge, hares, and wood- 
cock in the feafon. The black game, however, have of late 
years been fcarce, and appears to be rather upon the de- 
cline. 

Agriculture, &amp;c —Thirty years ago there was no kind of 
grain exported from this parifh, but, on the contrary, im- 
portations was fome times neceffary for the fupport of the 
inhabitants. Since that period- there is an iucreafe of po- 
pulation of about 400 fouls, and now there is a confiderable 
quantity of oats, bear, barley, and potatoes, exported annual- 
ly. There is generally between 900 and 1000 acres in til-

lage, two thirds of which may he fown with oats, and the 
remainder with hear, barley, potatoes, and a few acres in 
turnip. The principal manure ufrd for improving land is 
fea fnells, of which there is an Jmoft incxhauftable quanti- 
ty, not only within the high water mark on this fide of Wig- 
ton bay, hut alfo in the dry land, feveral hundred yards 
from the fliore, particularly in the holms of CaiTencarie, the 
property of Alexander Muir M'Kenzie Efq; where they are 
in beds from four to ten feet deep of the fineft (hells ima- 
ginable, without al mo ft any mixture of fand. As there can- 
not remain a doubt but that thefe (hells have been thrown 
together and left there by the tide, fo from thefe and other 
foffile marine productions, found both on this and the other 
fide of the bay, it is evident, that the tide has flowed 1 5 or 
16 feet higher on this coaft, at that period, than it doth at 
the prefent. Thefe (hells are generally fold by the agents of 
Mr M'Kenzie at 5d per tun, 25 tuns of which is fuiheient 
for an acre of land, and proves a cheap and excellent ma- 
nure to this part of the country, and is confidered much 
preferable to either lime or marie. But the advantages of 
this valuable treafure of (hells is not confined to this pait of 
the country alone, but extends round 50 or 60 miles of a 
coaft as far as the mull of Galloway, where they are fold as 
high as 3s. od. per tun. Many thoufand tuns of thefe (hells 
are carried od annually, by a number of teflels, from 20 to 
60 tuns burthen, which are conftantly employed when the 
weather will permit, in .carrying them all round the coaft, 
and fome times even to the Ifle of Man. Thefe (hells have 
been ufed with great advantage for the improvement of bar- 
ren heathy land, in fo much, that many hundreds of acres 
in this parifh, originally not worth more than 2S. per acre, 
have been made worth from tos, to 15s. per acre. Yet 
this, like every other advantage that is eafily attained, is not

duly prized or improver), for there are {till upwards of jooo 
acres of land in theparhh, which, from both foil and climate, 
is highly capable of cultivation, at prefent lying in a (late of 
nature, covered with heath, and aimoft good for nothing. 
The fault here refts aimoft wholly with the landlords, who 
in that refpect are in a great meaiure blind to their own inte- 
rest ; ,for where the means of improvement is got at fo cheap 
a rate, and the diftance not great to carry it, a little calcula- 
tion might ferve to demonftrate, that on nothing could they 
lay out their money to fo much advantage ; but where a te- 
nant has only a leafe for nineteen years, and perhaps his en- 
couragement not great otherwife, it cannot be expected that 
he mould lay out much money in the enclofmg and cultiva- 
tion of barren land*. From the above hint, it is not intend- 
ed to throw any imputation of floth or inactivity upon ei- 
ther landlord or tenant, ,(but only to fhow that a great deal 
more might ftill be done ;) for there are feveral farms which 
now pay five times as much rent as they did thirty years a- 
go, and the tenants ftill able to live much better now than 
they did then. There are in the parifli 76 carts, fix of 
which are kept for hire, and the reft for the purpofes of farm- 
ing •, and 63 plows, forne of the Englifh, and fome cf the old

• The writer of the above having a good deal of expeiience in the im- 
provement of barren heathy land, would recommend the following plan 
where fuch land has a moffy furface, and of a very ftiff benty foil. Inflead 
of fallowing, which is the common pradice, and which is attended with a 
great deal of labour and cxpence, plow up the land in winter or fnring ; the 
fummer following give it a flight harrowing, to prevent the manure falling 
down between the furrows, after which fpread the manure upon it, and fo 
let it ly for at leaft one year, or, if the foil is very ftiff, two years, before 
you put a plough in it. You will then find, that the furface is quite rotten, 
and that the land h fit for a crop of oatt, turnips, &amp;c. ; and that by giving 
it time to ly till the furface rot, it does more than even fallowing could do 
to fuch land, and the cxpence nothing.

Population. — In Dr Webfter's lift in 175^, the numbers 
were rated at 858. In the year 1764, the whole population 
amounted to 680 fouls, of which the Ferry-town of Cree 
(now Creetown) then contained 104. As the country part 
of the parifh has altered very little in point of population, 
fince that period, it will be neceflary to fhow the increafe 
that has been in Creetown at all the different periods fince 
that time.

Caufes of Population. — The increafe of population, not on- 
ly in this place, but alfo in many other places in Scotland, 
is principally owing to thefe three following caufes : 

I. To the beneficial efTe&amp;s of inoculation for the fmall- 
pox, by which the lives of numbers of children are preferv- 
ed ; and, general as the practice is become, yet, (till there are 
many of thefe little innocents, that fall victims to the inat- 
tention, ftupidity, and fuperftition of their parents, who are 
fo wedded to their ancient prejudices, that rather than part 
with them, they will conlign over half-a-dozen fine children 
to the ravages of this terrible diforder, or, perhaps, to the 
gloomy manfions of the tomb. 

2. To

pox. 



of Kirkmabreck. 



549 



2. To the improvement of wafte lands, by which num- 
bers are employed and maintained, 

3. To the recently eftablilhed branches of manufactures. 
By the fir ft, life is preferved, and by the two laft, emigra- 
tion is prevented. 

Air and Climate. — The beft proof of purity of the air and 
gbodnefs of the climate, is the good ftate of health general- 
ly enjoyed by the inhabitants; they being feldom fubjecl: to 
agues, fevers, confumptions, or fuch diforders as proceed 
from a corrupted atmofphere. The rheumatifm is the only 
difordcr that feems to gain ground, and moft generally com- 
plained of Though there is a great deal of rain that falls 
here, yet the air is confidered dry and healthy, owing to the 
water being fuddenly carried off by the rapidity of the rivu- 
lets or burns, which immediately convey it again to the fea, 
there being no fwamps or marfhy ground in this part of the 
country. 

Genera/ State of the Parijb. — The ancient valuation of the 
parifh, as it ftands in the cefs books of the county, is 3 199!.

Hatful fituation on the fide of the hay, about a mile and a 
half below Creetown. The church and manfe are both in 
a pretty pood ftate of repair. There are very few rlhTenters 
here, only three feceders a id two cameronians in the whole 
pattfh ; and as a proof of the health and good morals of the 
people, and what probably contributes in fome meafure to 
both, is, that there is neither phyfician, furgeon, lawyer, nor 
attorney in the whole parifh. The poor's funds generally 
amount to about 35 1. per annum, which, when judicioufly 
applied, fo effectually relieves the wants of thofe depending 
upon the public charity, (which feldom exeeed ten in num- 
ber,) that there has not been one inftance of a native of this 
parifh going out of it as a {trolling beggar, for thefe thirty 
years paft. The fchoolmafter's fallary is a hundred pound 
Scots, independent of the fchool wages ; but befides the 
public fchool, there are fevcral private fchools in the parifh. 

Price of Labour. — Wages here are generally high. Mafons 
and joiners have from 1 s. 3d to 2 s. per day, without vic- 
tuals. Taylors and fhoemakers, from 8d. to lod. with 
victuals. An experienced man-fervant, from 8 1. to 9 1. per 
annum. The wages of women fervants, from 3 l.'to 4I. 
and the other kinds of work much the fame in proportion. 

Antiquities. — The moft memorable place of antiquity is 
called Cairn-ho!y or the Holy Cairn, from a tumulus or heap 
of (tones, (as tradition informs us,) raifed over the grave of 
King Galdus. Several years ago, a great many of the ftones 
were carried away for the purpofe of building houfes and 
dykes, when there were difcovered large ftones placed to- 
gether in form of a cheft or coffin but the roof (tone being 
of fuch prodigous magnitude, it has never been removed to 
fee what it contains. This memorable tomb ftands in the

centre, between two different places, at about a hundred 
yards difhnc: from it, where a great, number of human bo- 
dies have been buried, as appears from the number of 
Hones placed upon one end in form of grave (tones. We 
are told by feveral of the Scottifh writers, that Corbredus 
Galdus, the twenty firth king of the Scots, (a valiant and 
,good king,) was the firft of that nation who dared to ad- 
vance his enfigns againft the Romans, who, under Petilius 
Ccrealis, had fubdued the Brigantes*, and foon after 
proceeded to attempt the conqueft of this country, under 
Julius Agricola, who, having landed upon this coaft, de- 
ftroyed all the maritime places, and afterwards reduced the 
Tile of Man •, after which, he returned, and after many a 
bloody battle with the Scots and Pitts, about the year A. D. 
82, he fubdued the whole of the kingdom South of the Tay. 
Hiftory alfo informs us, that one of thefe battles was fought 
at tbe river Cree, (which ftill retains its ancient name,) 
wherein the Scots were overthrown, but no mention made of 
the (laughter of their king ; on the contrary, we are told by 
Buchanan, that this fame King Galdus died a natural death, 
after a glorious reign of thirty five years. We are alfo in- 
formed of another battle fought on the river Cree, about the 
year A. 1). 310, wherein the Pi£ts joined the Romans un- 
der Maximus their general, againft the Scots, under their 
king Eugenius, but wherein the Scots were again over- 
thrown. But in vain do we develope the 'hiftory of thefe 
times ; owing to the ambitious policy of Edward the (It of 
England, a veil is thrown over them which can never be re- 
moved. There is alfo a different account concerning this 
place, which feems to be founded on hilfoi y, and which

dcferves attention. About the year of our Lord i 1 50, it is 
faid there was a battle fought between the Englifli and 
Scots, on Glefnquicken Moor, wherein the Scots were de- 
feated and their General killed, and that the Bifliop of Whi- 
thorn being along with him in the engagement, immediately 
aflumed the command ; but his troops being defeated, imme- 
diately fled towards the fliore to their boats, but being over- 
taken by the enemy at Cairnholy, about half a mile from the 
fhore, the bifliop, with many other gentlemen, was killed, 
and was buried here, and that from this circumftance it was 
called the Holy Cairn, the bifliop being a holy man. Cer- 
tain it is, that on the very place where the battle is faid 
to have been fought, there is a large tumulus which was 
opened about 15 years ago ^the ftones being carried a- 
way for the purpofe of building dykes) when there was dif- 
covered a ftone coffin, or ftones placed together in form of a 
coffin, wherein was a human fkeleton, the fcull and the great 
bones almoft entire, and greatly above the ordinary fize ; alfo 
an urn, containing fome afhes, and an earthen pitcher : the tu- 
mulus is called Cairnywanie.* Atafmall diftance from the 
above, there is a Druidical temple, oraDanifh encampment, 
but, being left to the uncertainty of conjecture, (hull not ha- 
zard an opinion •, there are alfo feveral other tumuli in the 
parifh, that have never been opened. There are alfo four 
fquare towers with battlements, which feem to have been 
intended for defence : they are all placed on the banks of the 
Cree. 

Mineral 

* There is a little rivulet or burn that runs through the phce where the 
battle is faid to have been fought, that ftill retains the name of the Engliih-

which have been beneficial in fome cafes ; one, however, oil 
the lands of Pible, which feems to be of the chalybeate 
kind, feems particularly adapted for remedying weaknefies 
and complaints in the Itomach, and has been applied to by 
fome individuals, with great fuccefs. 

Fuel — The principal article of fuel is peat, of which there 
are plenty of the very belt quality; alfo in many places of 
the parifh, there is whins and brulhwood, which poor 
people gather for fuel ; and as there are no coal but what is 
imported from other places, it is not much ufed here. 

Price of Provifwns. — Beef, mutton, and lamb, generally 
fell for 2^d. or 3d. per lib. ; oat meal from 2od to is. » but- 
ter 6d. per lib. j a fat goofe 2s ; a hen 8d.; eggs 3d. per 
dozen. 

Mifcellaneous.Obfervations. — This parifh is famous for granite 
ftone ; as a proof of which, Kirkdalehoufe, built by the late 
Sir Samuel Hannay, of Mochrum, Bart, is well worthy of the 
attention of travellers. It is ,1 la-ge moderi buihling, the 
out-fide wholly of the moft beautiful granite, and wrought 
off to fuch perfection, as is faid not to be equalled in Britain. 
Admiral tewart alfo got all the principal ftones here for 
GlalTerton houfe, which he carried acrofs the Bay in boats, 
at confiderable expence " And the Bifhop of Derry, on fee- 
ing the houfe of Sir Samuel Hunnay, a few years ago, was fo 
much charmed with the ltone, that he immediately contract- 
ed with the fuperintendent of that work, for building the 
fpires of two churches in his diocefe, which were all to be ex- 
ecuted with this ftone \ accordingly the ftone was all prepar- 
ed here, and afterwards carried over to Ireland, and the work

executed much to his Lord (hip's fatisfaction, though at great 
expence The highrft mountain in this parifli, or perhaps 
in the South of Scotland, viz. Cairnfmoor, is one entire mafs 
of granite, the altitude of which has never been afcertained, 
but which may prob?.bly be between 3000 and 4000 feet a- 
bove the level of the river Cree. This mountain is alfo fa- 
mous as a receptacle for foxes, which often fpread death and 
deflruction far and wide among the furrounding flocks. There 
are alfo appearances of lead mines in feveral places of the pa- 
rifh, but which havd not yet been attempted with fuccefs. 

A Defcription of Creelonvn and Wigton Bay. — Creetown, 
(formerly called Ferry Town of Cree, from the ferry or paf- 
fage boat conffantly kept at that place) has advanced rapidly 
within thefe 30 years, as fhown in the table of population, 
and was lately erected into a burgh of barony, by the intereft 
of the proprietor John M'Culloch, Efq-, of Barholm, is beau- 
tifully fituated on Wigton Bay, and in the vicinity of a plen- 
tiful country ; of late there has been introduced fome branch- 
es of cotton fpinning, by which about thirty people are daily 
employed*, there is alfo a pretty extenfive tann work, and alfo 
a mill for making fhot lead ; but the greateft part of the men 
follow a fea-fating life, feveral of whom, both in the prefent 
and former wars, have ferved in the navy. There arc a con- 
fiderable number of veflels belonging to this port, of from 20 
to 60 tons burthen, feveral of which is employed in carrying 
fheils, and others in the coafting trade ; indeed, its advantages 
as a fea port may one day be the means of making it an opulent 
place. The inhabitants in general, though charitable and 
humane, yet are too much addicted to the vices with which

ahout 15 miles. It is about 3 miles broad, for about 6 miles 
from its entrance, and then gradually diminiflies as it extends 
into the country, and divides the (hire of Wigton from the 
Stewarty of Kirkcudbright. There is good anchorage in 
feveral places of the Bay, but in particular a little below Cree- 
toun (the only town in the parifh) to which a fhip of 500 
tons may come and ride in fafety : it h s a kind of fofr blue 
clay bottom, and makes a very fafe harbour. The fifheries, 
though not very confiderable, are yet worth mentioning ; -in 
the Spring and Summer months,, there are a good many fid- 
mon taken, and iti the Harveft and Winter, there are a con- 
fiderable quantity of whiting, cod, and flownders got, by 
means of what the people call coops, or large creels, fo plac- 
ed in the water that the fifh run into them as the tide ebbs, 
and are taken out at low water j fo that with thefe, and a few 
fhell fifh, which is alfo got in the Bay, this part of the coun- 
try is generally well Tupplied. There is alfo a confiderable 
quantity of fea weed got upon the fhore, (which is for the 
molt part flat andfandy) which by fume is made into kelp, 
and by others ufed for manure. Much more might have been 
faid of the advantages of this as a maritime place, had an 
«bler pen been employed to defcribe them.

Situation) Extent, &amp;c. 

JL he parifh of Bedrule is fituated in the centre of the 
county of Roxbuigh, in the prefbytery of Jedburgh, and fy- 
nod of Merfe and Tiviotdale and is in length from North 
to South, upwards of four miles, and in breadth from Eaft to 
Weft between two and three. It is bounded by the parifh 
of Jedburgh on the Eaft, by Abbotrule (now annexed to Hob- 
kirk and Southdean, but formerly a pendicle of Bedrule) on 
the South, by Hobkirk and Cavers, from which it is, for the 
moft part, divided by the Rule on the Weft ; and by Minto 
and Ancrum on the North-Weft and North, from which it 
is feparated by the l iviot. It is fomewhat of an oval figure, 
and confifts, at prefent, of nearly an equal quantity of arable, 
pafture, and muir-land. The foil is, in general, as good as 
is to be met with in moft grounds of the above defcription :

and, as the foil, fo the furface and climate are unequal, 
which, indeed, is generally the cafe over the county, by the 
fuddcn tranfitions from hill to dab. The lands towards the 
Ruh and the Tivior, are, therefore, more deep, warm, and 
ferule. In thofe towards the hill called the Dunian *, the 
foil becomes more light, thin, and barren ; the air keen and 
penetrating : yet, in regard to the foil, there happens to be 
a remarkable exception, for, on the fame range of hill to 
the weltward, oppofite the village of Bedrule, there is an 
uncommonly fine and deep foil ; and in the above grounds, 
where the foil is in general remarkably deep, there is alfo 
found limeftone, and different ftrata of clay marie. A good 
deal of the land in that part of the parilh is at prefent rather 
fpoitty. But, as it is a gentle declivity from the fummit of 
the hill to the banks of the river, it might be the more ea- 
fily rendered dry by judicious draining.

Proprietors and Tenants. — There are three great, and five 
lefs coniiderable proprietors in the parifh, two of whom u- 
fually refnle There are nearly the fame number of tenants, 
who all manage their farms according to the modern pradice 
of husbandry ; and one of them, Mr Brown, the tenant of 
Newton, a farm the property of Thomas Elliot Ogilvie, 
Efq, of Cheflers, has, in the courfe of a few years, fhewn 
how much may be done by improvement in this parifh, both 
for the advantage of the tenant, and the patrimonial inteieft 
of the proprietor. Mr Bell younger v of Mainflaws, and 
' the tenant of Rewcaftle, both in this parilh, appear to be fol-

acquire, thereby, considerable gain to themfelves, and merit, 
as all fuch molt defervedly do, the grateful thanks of their 
country. 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 297 
fouls. The number of inhabitants at prefent, (17931 is a- 
bout 250 || . Of thefe there are 127 males, and 132 females. 
Under 10 years of age about 60. From 10 to 20 about 50. 
From 20 to 50 about 105. From 50 to 70 about 28. From 
70 to 80 fix. From 80 to 90 one. 

Weavers 6 ; taylors 3 ; wrights.2; gardeners 2 blackfmiths

rule, in that line, but, notwithstanding his local disadvanta- 
ges of diftance from materials, and efpecially from coal, alfo 
employs conftantly a number of hands in the manufactory 
of nails, whereby this part of the country has been, for fome 
time, abundantly and well fupplied with that ufeful article ; 
and the neceflity of importing it, as was formerly the cafe, 
thereby prevented, money kept in the country, and people

horfes, 55 ; black cattle 200 ; of thefe, above a-fcore are 
annually fed for the butcher, befides a number of fheep and 
young (lock, moft of which are brought into the parifli in 
the winter feafon, from the Highlands, where they are graz- 
ed in fummer, it having now become a general practice, for 
the fame tenant to occupy farms in both the high and low 
part of the country, with that particular view; fheep 100

about 350 bolls oats; 50 bolls barley; 15 wheat; 30 
peafe ; 20 potatoes ; and of late a few acres of tares, at New- 
ton, which are mown green, and given to the horfes. There 
have been ufually fown of late years, about 100 acres tur- 
nip ; and nearly the fame quantity in artificial graffes. 
There is alfo ufually about the fame quantity in what is cal- 
led naked fallow. Lime is the manure chiefly ufed here in 
the improvement of land, notwithstanding the diftance from 
which it muft be brought, and confequently the expence at- 
tending it. 

Mills, &amp;c. — There is a corn mill and a bleachfield in the 
jparifh, both upon the Rule, and at a fhort diPcance from the

village of Bedrule. There was alfo formerly a corn mill on 
the Tiviot, near Newton, the fite of which, in confcqucncc 
of alterations occafioned by floods in the courfe of that ri- 
ver,, wirhin thefe 40 years, 'is now fcareely difcermble. Two 
orchards : One dovecot •, but there happens alfo to be three 
very near in the neighbourhood. 

Rooks ■ — The crops fuffer lefs from the beautiful 
and ufefu! bird the pigeon, than from the crow or rook, 
which feems to increafe in number with improvement in 
agriculture, and which, as the pigeon, not only devours vaft 
quantities of grain, but alfo deftroys the potatoe and turnip, 
and the mod hearty and luxuriant roots of the artificial 
grafles ; all which, if not fo injured, feem to thrive well 
in this part of the country. Might it not be proper, there- 
fore, efpecially for the Board of Agriculture, at leajl to re- 
commend the obfervance of an old law, pafled in the reign of 
our James I. refpefting thefe very deftru&amp;ive birds ? For 
though, when kept in due bounds, they are believed to be, 
upon the whole, rather ufeful than hurtful, by alfo devour- 
ing flugs and grubs, &amp;c. more concealed enemies of the 
fruits of the earth j yet, from their prefent altonifhing num- 
bers, and their feeming yearly more a id more to increafe, 
there certainly never were ftronger reafons, than at pruent, 
in this part of the country, for the enforcement of that law, 
at leaft, tiil their numbers be again rendered moderate. In- 
deed, did fuch an act not already exift, the reafons for it 
have here become of late fo ftrong and 1x3 gent, as to give 
good ground for-the enactment of a law to that effect. As 
the act is fhort, and may not be generally known, we deem 
it proper here to infert ir.

Rent. — The valued rent is 34751- 13s. 4d. Scots. Of the 
nul rent, one tenant pays about ^70!. Sterling, another a- 
bove 200I. Sterling, another about 200I. Sterling : Two 
fmall farms, together with certain lands, poffefled by tenants 
whofe farms, in the parifhes of Jedburgh, Ancrum, and 
Cavers, adjoin thereto, may be rated at 130I. Sterling. 
All the other lands in the parifh. are in the natural poffeffiori 
of the proprietors. 

Villages. — There were anciently four villages in the parifh, 
which are now much decayed, and the number of houfes 
greatly diminifhed, viz. Bedrule to the Weft, Newton to 
the North-weft, Rewcaftle to the North-eaft, and Fulton to 
the South- weft, from the_centre of the parifh. 

Bedrule. — The origin of the name of Bedrule, (by the peo- 
ple ufually pronounced Bedde Rule) is uncertain. What fet ms 
moft probable is, that is (ignifies the feat or refling place of Rule, 
or Regulus, probably the tutelar Saint of the parifh. But 
whether the Saint, or the ancient family of Rule ( de Rule ), 
gave name to the river, that village and other places upon 
its banks ; {for befides Bedrule there are in the neighbourhood 
the town O'Rule, Hallrule, and Abbotrule) or whether the

river derived its name from the family of Rule, or from Si 

Rule, is uncertain ; or, perhaps, from the rapidity of the 
itream (for its ftream is very rapid) it fignifies Ron/, (Roll) 
as in forne old papers it is alfo written. Whether any of 
thefe be the true derivation is doubtful. But, it is mod cer- 
tain, that the chief of the family of Tumbully a branch of 
the very ancient family of Rule, had his principal refidence 
at Bedrule Cattle, in ancient times, a itrong hold, pleafantly 
fituated behind the church, on the bank of the river j a Btu- 
ntion equally remarkable for profpecT:, for fafety, and for 
beauty ; from the fite of which (for the callle ittelf was de- 
moliihed fome time ago) though its elevation above the bed 
of the river be not very great, are feen diftinctly, to the 
North-weft, the moft elevated, tops of fome of the hills by 
Ettrick and Yarrow, and the Eildons by Melrofe Abbey ; 
the Reid Swyre to the South-Eafl, the fource of the Reid 
and the Jed taking different directions, the Reid mixing 
with the waters of Tyne, and falling into the fea at New- 
castle ; the Jed, with thofe of the Tiviot and Tweed, which 
reach the fea at Berwick •, and South- weftward, the fame 
frontier tract from whence the Liddel derives its fource, 
which, after uniting with the Ewes and the Efk, falls into 
the Solvvay Firth, a branch of the Irifh Sea. The view is 
more confined towards the E.ift and the Welt, yet the tops 
of the Dunian and Ruberslaw * hills in the neighbourhood, 
were fituations moft fuitable in martial times, by the lighting 
of fires, for giving the alarm to the dependents and friends 
of the family, either for the purpofe of defence or attack, on 
the fudden approach of aft enemy.

Newton — Was anciently the property of a fatuity of the 
uirname of Ker, who appear to have been cadets of Fcrni- 
hirfh. There was alfo a houfe of ftrength there, now like- 
wife dcmolilkcd: but the beautiful avenues of venerable 
trees £1 111 remaining, befpeak to the pafiing traveller fome- 
thing of the conference and tafte of its former inhabi- 
tants. 

Rewcajlle — Situated upon a more elevated ground, than e * 
ther Bedrule or Newton, is confidercd by fome as a place ot 
great antiquity. Indeed, it is faid, however unlikely from 
its prefent appearance, that the Courts of Juflicc were ori- 
ginally held there, and afterwards removed to Jedburgh The 
origin of the name, and whether it has been derived from 
proprietors of the furname of Rewcaftle, or whether it may- 
have given the furname to that family, is uncertain. Bo 
that as it may, both furname and place are certainly of con- 
fiderable antiquity. 

" Fulton — Has now fcarcely any veltiges of its ancient confe- 
quence, except fome remains of its tower, which are ftill 
{landing, and fometimes ufed by the tenant as a bught for 
his fbeep. The well known furname Fulton, correfponds 
to the name of this place ; but we do not adventure to con- 
jecture, whether there , have been any connection between 
the one and the other ; for we have been able, as yet, to 
trace lefs of its hiftory, even by tradition, than any of the 
former. 

Encampments.— -There are plain veftiges of a regular en- 
campment, on an elevated ground, almoft at an equal dif. 
tance between Bedrule and Newton. From its figure, 
which is ftill diftincl, it appears to have been Britifh. There

is another, at the diftance of about half a mile to the eafl- 
ward, which, from its fquare - figure, fecrns to have been 
Roman They are both but of imall fize, and occupy an 
area nearly of the fame extent. The former is furrounded 
by a mound of earth, the latter by a mound and fofle. 

Minerals. — There is great appearance of coal in the lands 
of Bedrule ; and though the proprietor made lately an at- 
tempt to difcover it, and was, for an individual, at confidcr- 
able exnence in the fearch, and though there were certain- 
ly fome thin feams found, yet, in the iflue, he was not fo 
fuccefsful as his laudable perfeverance mod; juftly merited ; 
not owing, as is {till thought, by any means to the uncer- 
tainty of the fymptoms, but to the great deepnefs of the main 
feam 

Indeed, an attempt of that nature, efpecially in a diftricl: 
where coal has not as yet been discovered, certainly ought ra- 
ther to be undertaken upon fuitable conditions, by a fociety, 
than attempted by an individual, however patriotic or liberal 
his fpirit, unlefs his fortune be vaft indeed. Nor, at any rate, 
ought the experiment to be committed to the management 
of obfeure or unflcilful people, or confined to a fhott fpace of 
time, or the limits of one eftate or parifh ; but, after molt 
careful examination, according to the advice of fcientific men, 
of well known ability and charadter, the moft likely fpot in 
a diftritt ought to be pitched upon, and wherever the proba- 
ble trial is made, moft ferioully perfevered in. Such a fcheme 
would be truly patriotic, and probably, in the iflue, become 
no lefs gainful than honourable to the undertakers, and of 
unfpeakable advantage to the proprietor of the lands where 
there happened to. be found fo great a treafurc, and would be 
an univerfal blefiing to this otherwife naturally rich and hap- 
py country.

There is abundance of free-ftone in the parifh, of different 
kinds, red and white, both of excellent quality. Mainflaws 
quarry not only fupplies Jedburgh and the neighbouring 
country, but ftone from thence is alfo tranfported to the 
town of Hawick, at about feven miles diltance, and fome- 
times a confidcrable way beyond it. 

Roads and Bridges. — A branch of the great road from Lon- 
don to Edinburgh paffes through the South part of the pa- 
rifh. The great road between Berwick and Carhfle di- 
rects its courfe through the North part the whole breadth 
of the parifh. This road, the whole way acrofs the iflandj 
is remarkable for variety and beauty, particularly where 
it paffes through this parifh and neighbourhood. Indeed, 
every where, it is prefenting the traveller with fcenes, de- 
lightful, new and interefting. One while he has an exten- 
five profpetf. of a rich and improved country, moll of it in 
as high a ft ate of cultivation as perhaps it is capable of, 
thereby, at the fame time, difplaying the (kill and induftry of 
its profperous inhabitants ; the fecurity, wealth, and freedom

der the protection of law and good government ; and in that 
very country, in thofe very field?, which formerly were 
filled, in conlequence of the jarring interefts, difputes, and 
quarrels of two high-fpirited and warlike nations, with defola- 
tion, carnage, and blood \ by the happy union of which, parti-

by other amufing and intereding objeas, form together, 
fucceflive groups of the moft various and pleafing of rural 
fcenery. Nor will the reader be furprized at this delcription, 
when he is informed, that this delightful road, directing its 
courfe by the pleafant towns of Colddream, Kclfo, Hawick, 
Langholm, and Longtown, conducts the traveller often u- 
pon the banks, almod always in view, of the charming rivers, 
the Tweed, the Tiviot, the Ewes, and the Efk, whofe pado- 
ral ftreams, render fo delightful the moft beautiful part of 
the Arcadia of Scotland. A branch of the fame road, lead- 
ing by Jedburgh, was lately made through this parifh, by 
which a mail paffes three times a week. The ftatute labour 
is here commuted, and the money thereby raifed ufually 
laid out on making and repairing the roads in the pai'ifh. 

There are two bridges in the parilh, both acrofs the Rule, 
one near the village of Spittal, on the great road before men- 
tioned, between Berwick and Carlifle, confiding of two 
arches ; the other confiding of one large arch, on the road 
from Hawick by Bedrule to Jedburgh. 

Hills. — The Dunian merits particular notice, not fo much 
from its own height or magnitude, as from the remarkable 
fi'tuation upon which it dands ; and, though rather fmall of 
itfelf, and diminifhing in its appearance, the nearer one ap- 
proaches it, yet, from its peculiar fituation, it is almod e- 
very where feen from beyond where the waters begin to de- 
fcet:d to the wedern fhores of the ifland, to the utmod boun- 
dary of the eadern coad. As, in ancient times, churches 
and crofles were ufually ere£ted in the mod confpicuous and

the German ocean, and overlooking, in a Angularly com- 
manding profpeft, an immenfe extent of claffical ground, 
equally celebrated in poetry and fong, as it is memorable in 
the page of martial hiltory. For, the profpeft from this re-

caftward below, the fpe&amp;ator views, as it were in a bafon, 
the town of Jedburgh, much diftinguifhed by the venerable 
ruins of its formerly rich and magnificent abbey, anciently 
the peaceful and happy retreat of Monks of the order of St. 
Auguftin. At a greater diftance, and to the north welt, 
and on the oppofite fide of the filver dreamed Tiviot, as in 
an amphitheatre, opening to the fouth, the eye is druck 
with the phiin, yet elegant modern houfe of Minto, which, 
though remarkable for its romantic fituation, is greatly mor.'

Poor. — The indigent here are chiefly fupported by afTefT- 
ment ; a method, however well- intended, and, in the prefent 
ftate of fociety, in many 'parts of the country, perhaps un- 
avoidable, is doubtlefs, at the fame time, often hurtful to 
the deferving poor, to humanity, and the interefl of thofe 
on whom the burden is laid. There are 500 merks which 
were mortified (TurdO to the poor of the barony of Bedrule 
1695, by William Ramfay in Bedrule mill, and Margaret 
Turnbull, his wife ; of which it is faid, (for the writer ne- 
ver faw the deed of mortification itfelf) the family of Ca- 
vers Carre are left truftees. Mrs Mary Ann Stevenfon, re- 
lic!: of the Rev. Mr James Borland, mortified (funk) 100I. 
Scots to the poor of this pariih, of which, in the account 
thereof, in the parifh record, the Sqflion appear to have 
been appointed by her the overfeers. But, with the deed 
of mortification itfelf, if ever any was executed by Mrs 
Borland, the writer is not as yet acquainted. The latter

Parochial Regi/ler.— -The regifter of the names of children 
born in the parifh, feems to have been carefully attended to 
from the commencement of the above mentioned record 
1690, until the enactment of a late aft of Parliament, laying 
a fmall tax thereon ; which, very different from the purpofc 
thereby intended, here operates as a prohibition. For, al- 
though the tax be fmall, and doubtlefs trifling to many, e- 
ven of the common people, in towns, where money is plen- 
ty, and wages high ; yet, not a few of the labouring poor, 
efpecially in remote parts of the country, confider it as hard -, 
and, therefore, whatever can be faid, as it entirely depends 
on their own choice, whether they have their childrens names 
recorded in the parifh regifter or not, do, moft of them, in 
this parifh at leaft, difcontinue a practice fo neceflary in fo- 
ciety, and often fo ufeful and interefting to individuals ; 
and, unfortunately, from the poverty of the people, this 
feems to be moft generally the cafe in the country, where, 
different from populous towns, there is almofl no other 
means to fupply that omiflion ; and, unluckily, thofe are 
the people, who, notwithstanding their mean circumftances, 
ufually rear, on their fcanty earnings, the moft numetous, 
uncorrupted, and hardy offspring ; and, thereby, happily 
counteract the baneful effects of idlenefs, immorality, and 
diffipation in Society. Such, therefore, in every view, are 
well entitled to have their childrens births recorded, thereby, 
not only to difcover the changes, refources, and ftrength of 
the nation, but alfo, fo far as to themfelves or pofterity may 
be interefting or agreeable, to have the place of their birth, 
their age and memory, preferved on record. We therefore

ing them a fmall premium for doing this, rather than to pre- 
vent them, by the impofition of a very trifling, and confe- 
quently unproductive tax ; and, were this the cafe, it would 
certainly feem neither hard nor unreafonable, were the Le- 
giflature to charge with a tax, all thofe who, notwithftand- 
jng fuch indulgence and favour, ncgledt to acquit them- 
felves of a duty fo necefl'ary, both to their children and fo- 
ciety. 

School. — The fchoolmafter has what is called a legal dia- 
ry, which, when fixed by law, as the minimum, was a fum of 
confiderable value, but now, from the aftoniihing change on 
the value of money, is a forry pittance indeed. As they are 
moftly the children of poor people who attend him, the 
wages are alfo low, and he has nothing now allowed him, as 
he formerly had, for teaching poor fcholars. His fchool- 
houfe* is almoft a ruin. 

Manfe. — The manfe is alfo in a bad ftate ; but, as it has 
been twice condemned, once by a jury of tradefmen appoint- 
ed by the presbytery, according to law, 20th June 1 792 ; 
another time, by a fecond jury of tradefmen, by order of the 
Court of Seffion, mutually chofen by the heritors and pref- 
bytery, 26th July 1793 ; it is to be re-built, and in a fitua^ 
tion more dry and lefs expofed than the prefent one, and alfo 
at a fmall diftance from the church.

prevailed, as while Epifcopacy was the eftablifhed religion of 
this country., But, during the civil wars, a confiderable 
change feems to have taken place, by no means favourable to 
the living. Yet, notwithltanding, the minifter, till lately,

the baronies of Bedrule, Rewcaftle, and Knowlbuth, in lieu 
of a fmall additional fum of money, alfo allowed for furnifh- 
ing elements, and an additional quantity of victual, contain- 
ed in a decreet of modification of ftipend, dated 13th Feb- 
ruary 1650, on which faid decreet of locality was founded. 
But by a late modification, the ftipend is confiderably altered,

guage of thofe times, defigned, the Me glebe and kirhlands* 
has been a good deal ameliorated by former incumbents, 
though much ftill remains to be done. The progrefs 
they have made in clearing it of immenfe quantities of 
granite or whin ftones, with which, notwithftanding all 
that has been done, it ftill abounds, is the ,moft cflen- 
tial and durable improvement that has been made. For 
though, in its original ftate, it might be judged equal in 
value to 4 acres Scotch, (5, acres Englifh,) of good ara- 
ble land, yet, from their improvements, and the extent of its 
furface, which, with the bed of the river, that partly inter- 
fe£ts it, and a fteep bank occupied by wood, f all taken to- 
gether 

tuifeld, fufficicnt to pafture four ftums,\n lieu of each acre arable, to which 
he was otherwife entitled, being defigned him. From this, as well as from 
other caufes, particularly on the borders and in the Highlands, it happens 
that fome glebes are of greater extent than others, independent of grafs fuffi- 
cient to pafture one horfe and two cows being affigncd according to act 24th,

their fize and r the nature of their foil, obvioufly proceeds the difference of their 
value. Hence the importance of adopting fomt reafonable plan, ai has been 
often fuggefted, the more effectually to excite all minifters, who are aole, to 
do fo, without prejudice or lofs to thofe who do it, their families or heir?, on 
the event of their removal or death. By this means, though fucceffors were 
bound to make a reafonable allowance for important and durable improve- 
ments, at the fight of arbiters chofen by the parties, the livings would be be- 
nefited, while none concerned Could be any way injured.

properly drained and inclofed. 

The minifter has neither his * foams gmfs^ as fome of his 
predeceflbrs appear to have had, nor any allowance for them, 
that he knows of. 

There was formerly a large common in the parifh, on 
which, by ufe and wont, he had right to paflure, &amp;c. It 

was 

by Lord Drumore, Ordinary on the bills. In confequence of which, the mi- 
nifter is in the practice, as he has always been, of difpofing of the wood on 
his glebe like any other crop, according as he judges proper, without any 
moleftation or interference whatever. 

• In ancient times, when it was neceflary to unite the people as clofe as 
poflible by a common intereft for thtir common defence, and in defence of 
their country, it was cuftomary for the land called infield or arable, to be held 
and occupied by proprietors and tenants, in what was called run rig, each, ai 
his property was fmall or great, having been thereby able to roum and fod- 
der in winter, a number of cattle in proportion to the quantity of his arable 
land. And, for the fame reafon, it feems probable, that the land outfit'.,'., \\-. 
many places, was occupied in common, each proprietor or tenant, in a cer- 
tain diftriit,, parifh, or eftate, having been thereby, entitled to foum or pafture 
on the outfield land in fummer, in proportion to the number and kinds ot 
cattle he was thus able to roam or fodder in winter, by means of his (hare of 

infield-land. 

A foum is faid to have confided of about ten fheep or one cow, a horfe hav- 
ing been confidercd as equal to two foums. 

The minifter of every landward parifii, has, by law, Air, 24. Pari. 1. Chi. 
11. 1663, befides what is ufually called his arable glebe, as above mentioned, 
alfo right to graft or grazing for one horfe and two cows ; or to have a fufil-' 
cient quantity of fuiuble land, near the church, laid oft' for that purpofe ; or to 
have 20 1. Scots paid him annually in lieu thereof, a fum, at that time, fully 
equivalent thereto, or temporal land defigned: For though Act 31 Pari. 16.54,

repealed by Act refciflbry ; yet the above mentioned Act 24. Pari. r. Cha, I Id

was divided 9th September 1696, without any flure being 
laid off to the minifter in lieu thereof. Agiinft thcfe dila- 
pidations, the then incumbent, Mr James Borland, as mi- 
nifter of Bedrule, protefted, in his own name, and in n;ime 
of his fucceffors in office, miniflers there •, and this he did 
on the ground, and at the time, when the heritors were oc- 
cupied with their arbiters in dividing the fame ; and, there- 
upon, took inftruments in the hands of Thomas Cranftoun, 
notar public, in prefence of fundry witneffes, as a copy of 
d inftrument, now before the writer, more fully fhews. 
But Mr Borland, having been then advanced in life, feems 
to have done this merely to exonerate himfelf, and to pre- 
ferve, as well as he could, a right to any of his fucceffors, 
who might think it expedient, fully to profecute it: " For, 
the law has ordained, that the minifter or paribn, quatenus 
par/on , never dies, but he and his fucceffors are viewed in 
a corporate capacity. Hence, all the original rights of the 
parfonage are, in the eye of the law, preferved entire and 
inviolate to the fucceffor. The prefent incumbent and his 
predeceffor, who lived a century or more ago, are, in law, 
one and the fame perfon ; what was the right of the one, is 
ftill the right of the other." There was likewife a frnall 
common near the church called Goarlay Bog, on which the 
minifter of Bedrule was alfo in ufe to pafture, and, like the 
former, was divided, but at a later period, without any part 
thereof being affigned , him, or any indemnification, as yet 
made for the lofs the living thereby fuftained. He has 
right to caft 10 darg % of turf\ annually, viz. 6 on the muirs

great dilhnce ; and the roads, till of late turnpikes were 
made, a great part of the year almoft impaflable ; and no 
teat in the parifh, it feems probable, that turf, which is 
here, in general, remarkably good, was the fuel chiefly ufed 
in former times But now that coals are attainable, though, 
owing to the great diftance they are brought; and to toll- 
bars on the road, very expenfive j even the pooreft people 
in the parifh, ufe a few of them. 

Church. — The antiquity of the church, we are as yet un- 
able to trace ; but, from its figure and conftruclion, it feems 
to have been built in thofe times, when the conftitution of 
men was greatly more ftrong than it is at prefent ; for, ac- 
cording to the cuftom of cur hardy forefathers, it is partly 
below ground, and the windows, or rather flits, are not made 
to open and fhut, by which the air is unavoidably affected, 
and rendered fomewhat like that in a family vault or damp 
cellar. The whole fabric is much decayed, and has been, for 
a confiderable time, in a ruinous ftate. 

Notwithstanding our other improvements, we are extreme- 
ly forry we have to regret the bad ftate of many of our parifh 
churches, and that thereby fo little encouragement is given 
to the people to attend public worfhip there, where it is ob- 
vioufly the intereft, as well as the boumlen duty of the teach- 
er to inftru£l them to fear God, to honour the King, to obey 
the good Laws, to refpecl and revere the happy Conftitu- 
tion of their country, and to pray that thereby liberty and 
peace may not only be enjoyed by them in their days, but al- 
fo conveyed full and entire to their children, and, by the fame 
happy and liberal means, transmitted unimpaired to the lateft 
pofterity. We are the more particular on this head, for the 
information of grangers § , many of whom, we underftand, 

form, 

S It may be proper here alfo to inform ftrangers, that the EflabMhed

form an unfavourable opinion of the religion, people, and 
clergy of this country on that account *, as, with the greateft 
julbce, we are able to aflure them, that the bad, and indeed 
very indecent flate in which they find many of the parifh 

churches 

Clergy of Scotland are fupported by a fmall part of the ancient patrimony of 
the national church, the remainder thereof being moftly in the poffeflion of 
hy titulars or impropriators, whereby, properly fpcaking, the public can be un- 
derftood no more to contribute to the maintenance of the Eftablifhed Clergy, 
than to that ol thef- lay titulirs,ov impropriators of the patrimony of the church. 
Therefore, by our law, when it is judged neceflary, from, the change on the 
value of money, or any other obvious and onerous caufe, for the court of teinds, 
■which was originally a committee of the Parliament of Scotland, to grant 
what is called an augmentation, or, more properly fpeaking, to bring the mi- 
nifter's prefent ftipend fomewhat nearer to its original value, thty can have 
recourfe to thefe funds only ; and no landholders or others are affected either 
■with ftipend, or what is called augmentation of fti'pend, but only fo far as 
they are proven to be poffeffed of them ; and though the fmall remains of the 
patrimony of the church, that are flill rcferved by the Conftitution for thefe 
pnrpofes, were, by law, alfo fecularized, and either applied for the lightening 
n( the taxes, or granted, by royal favour, as the reft have been, to individual 5 , 
5or fervices real or fuppofed, this would not diminifh, but, perhaps, rather in- 
creafe the burden on thofe on whom it prefently lies, who can pretend no 
light thereto, more than they can to the old church lands, or free teinds he- 
ritably poffeffed by others, or the free teinds of their own eftates, which they, 
their anceftors, or authors, have neither obtained by favour from the Crotvn, 
nor as yet purchafed, according to law, from their lay titulars, or impro-

churches in this country, neither proceeds from the genius 
of Prefbytery (the Eftablifhed Religion) the temper of the 
people of Scotland, nor the tafle of the Eftablifhed Clergy, 
who all feel, and often exprefs the hardttiip of their fituatiori 
Vol. XV. 4 E in 

of the eftablifhmenc of parochial churches and fchools. And that this is the 
cafe, is evident from this, that none do more heartily accord with the com- 
mon, and perhaps, in too many inftances, well founded outcry againft the late 
frequent annexations and fuppreffions in different parts of the country. And, 
therefore, the only difference on that head is, as is natural and fuppofeable, that 
each would wifh the clergy and fchoolmafters, fettled in the parifh churches 
and fchools, eftablifhed by law, of their own feci: or profeffion. But all muft 
fee, that in this, as in a few fpeculative opinions, in which fe5ts differ from 
each other, they are not only oppofed to all who at prefenc adhere to the E- 
ftablifhed Church, by far the major part of the community, but are alfo there- 
by equally in oppofition to the inclinations and wifhes of one another. Nay 4 
farther, when the matter is duly confidered, the annihilation of an Eftablifh- 
ed Clergy, as it is againft the inclination, fo, obvioufly, it would be contrary to 
the fecular intereft of the people. For there is not, perhaps, a popular com- 
plaint better founded, and, in the juftice of which all defcriptions of men are 
more agreed, than that againft the modern cuftom of the the money faifed in 
the country by the non-refidence of many of the landholders, different from 
the practice of their fathers, being fpent fo much at a diflance from it. Now, 
by our excellent Conftitution, the clergy of Scotland are all without excep- 
tion bound to refide. By this mean3 all that they receive in ftipend, out p£ 
the lands of their refpe&amp;ive parifhes, Sec. is, thereby, not only kept in the 
country, but, moft of it, fpent in the feveral parifhes and near eft market towns 
to thefe parifhes, in which, both by the laws of the church and the ftate, they, 
the clergy, arc bound to refide. Whatever, therefore, be the wifh of thofe 
(we truft they are but few) who are equally inimical to order, to law, and to 
good government, as they are to religion, we are fati.sfied, that few, if any, 
of any defcription, even of Diffenters, at lcaft in this part of the country, have 
fo far degenerated from the well known principles of their pious and virtuous 
anceftors, as to wifh national religion altogether abolifhed, but only, that it 
were of that fed or party of which they are members. But fuppofing it o- 
therwife, we would afk fuch, What they would think of a Government or 
State, fuppofe Great Britain, that would feize upon all that has been difponed

in this Tefpect, and their hearty difapprobation thereof; and

to give it as the reafon for their remaining at home in bad 
weather, and others, of deferring the Eltablilhed Church al- 
together, 

is no matter, if it has been tolerated by law, of what fed or defmption \ 
Would this not cut down, at one flroke, the pious funds of all the Diflenters, 
together with the remaining part of the patrimony of the church, ft ill refer- 
ved by the Legiflature to be applied according to its original intention, for 
the fupport of natiorfcl religion, /'. t. public luorjbip and i»fru£lion ? The Efla- 
blifhed Clergy of Scotland, as was faid, being, by law, moft fiddly bound to 
refide, none of them, therefore, are capable of holding pluralities, or any li- 
ving, in tommcniam, by which mean?, independent of the fuitablenefs of this 
falutary regulation, the money they receive in ftipend, &amp;c. as was alfo men- 
tioned, is neceiTarily circulated in the parifhes and neareft market towns to 
where it is raifed, by which means the people have not only immediately the 
benefit of their inftruclion, advice, and friendfhip, but alfo, mediately, of the 
fkipends they receive, by their being expended amongft them. By the law of 
Scotland, alfo, the poor of every defcription or feci Whatever, without excep- 
tion, in each landward parifli, have a legal title to call upon the eftablifhed 
minifter, and he is bound, if the heritors and tenants do not duly affefs them- 
felves in what is reafonable for their maintenance, upon proper information, 
to report to the Judge Ordinary, what appears fo to him, and aid the mty 
be otherwlfe altogether helplefs, and thereby prevent what might, in fome 
cafes, perhaps, prove a fatal delay. For the niiniller is ufually unable, how- 
ever difpofed, himfelf to fupply them, or to find any other certain means 
whereby to fupply them, according to their often great and urgent neceflities. 
And, therefore, this benevolent and wife regulation, in our law, though fcl- 
dom exercifed, is a moft neceffary and proper fecurity to the poor, efpecially 
in thefe times, different from thofe in which landholders generally refided in 
the country, and regularly attended the church ; by which means, they not 
ordy had an opportunity to hear and know weekly, the flate of die poor ia 
the parifh, but, befides contributing thcmfelves, of fetting an example to their 
tenants and dependants, alfo, to contribute to their relief; whereas, it is now 
too generally cuftomary for them, not only to refide the greateft part of the 
year, if not altogether, in the Capital, or fome great town, but, when in the, 
country, rarely, if at all, to attend public worfhip. As this modern practice

whofe houfes of worfhip, though built by contribution, are 
decent, convenient, and comfortable; and choofe rathei to 
do this, though accompanied with expence, than attend the 
Eftablifhed Clergy in thofe churches where their health is in 
danger. Strangers will naturally wifh to be informed from 
whence the neglect proceeds. Candour, however painful, 
obliges us plainly to ftate the anfwer. By the law and prac- 
tice of Scotland, different from what obtains in fome other 
countries, the burden of building and repairing the churches 
eftabli flied by law, particularly in landward or country pa- 
t i flies, is not raifed by affeflment on all pofleflbrs of lands and 
houfes, whether tenant or proprietor, indifcriminately, nor 
raifed by briefs, but is raifed from lands only ; and, there- 
fore, by the fame right, according to the Conflitution and 
prefent exifting law of Scotland, by which our heritors or 
landholders in the act called pari/hioners* poffefs their eftates,

their connection with the wealthy, and, in moft cafes, even preventing them 
being known to them ; by which means, the modeft and fhamelefs, the induf- 
trious and flothful, the defervmg and worthkfs, are unavoidably placed oh 
the fame footing, and claffed indifcriminately on the fame common roll, which, 
though in an affeffment of that nature, can fcarcely be avoided, is obvioufly 
the occafion of many and great evils, befides increafing the poor-rates. 

* Parijhioners, i. e. heritors. This expreffion is equally agreeable to the 
law and practice of Scotland : " For, (in the words of a great lawyer f on 
that head) all who have lands in a parifh, are confidered as parijhioners, with- 
out refpect to their refidence, at to M parochial burdens, which arc propor- 
tioned to the valuation of every heritor's lands in the parifh, and not to his

where their lands are fituated, in a reafonable and decent 
manner. Hence, as is obvious, fuch landholders, and they 
only, who neglect to do fo, give ground for that reflection ; 
and the bad ftate of many of the parifh churches of this 
country, thereby become fo juft a caufe of complaint to the 
people, to the very people, who by their adherence to the e- 
flablifhed religion of the country, certainly do fhew them- 
felves not the leaft friendly to our happy Conftitution, in 
church and in ftate ; thereby, alfo, as is obvious, the laws are 
infringed, and the moft peaceable and religious of his Majef- 
ty's fubjetts, much aggrieved. For, the law of this coun- 
try is fo well and fo wifely framed, as to lay the burden of 
building and repairing the church and fchool-houfe, &amp;c. up- 
on the rich, to relieve the poor, not upon perfons, but upon 
property, therefore, no individual's rights or property are or 
can be, invaded or affected thereby ; nor can any perfons or 
clafles of men, of whatever defcription, be any way interfer- 
ed with, but as proprietors of lands, for their lands only ■ on

therefore, by neglecting to acquit themfelves of thefe legal

di'frefpecl to the worlhip of God, and a great difregard for 
the Conftitution and Laws of their country, by which they 
are fecured and protected in the enjoyment of their rights and 
property. 

It may be aflced, Is there no compulfttor provided by law in 
hard cafes ? There is. But, not to mention how averfe 
the people re Tiding in a parifh, naturally mull be to enter 
into a procefs at law with the very perfons of whom they 
farm their lands ; the trouble and expence of fuch a procefs, 
with men fo weighty and powerful, is an objection to them 
for the moft part infurmountable. And it is the more 
hard, as there is no reafon to doubt, but that the people in 
the communion of the Eftablilhed Church would be equally 
forward, according to their abilities, to rc-build and repair 
their churches, as the Diflenters are their houfes of worihip, 
were it not, that the law has fo wifely ordered it otharwife, 
by laying the burden of fupporting the eftablilhed religion of 
the country, on lands purchafed and held on that exprefs 
condition, whereby all perfons of whatever defcription, except 
proprietors of lands for their lands oniy are, juftly fpeaking, 
exempted ; and thofe alone, who are inclined to adhere to 
the eftablilhed church, are affected by their neglect ; and 
thus, thereby, either made to fuffer, or involve themfelves in 
a procefs of law, which, for reafons above mentioned, they 
rarely adventure upon; or abfent themfelves from divine fer- 
vice ; a cuflom, alas ! become too common ; or take refuge 
among the Diflenters, whofe houfes of worlhip are duly at- 
tended to, and where the people fit, in the fevereft weather, 
dry and comfortable : and, it is proper to add, what certain- 
ly ought to have much weight, that however inclined thofe 
adhering to the Eftablilhed Church, in moft country parifhes, 
may be to accommodate themfelves, if the law had not or-

a right, by law, to enjoy the advantages of religious induc-

of thefe eftablifhments, fo particularly neceffary in the coun-

thereof, be more eafiiy fupplied ; whereas, if the poor and 
fcattercd inhabitants in molt landward parifhes, be deprived 
of the benefit of their eftablifhed churches and parochial

It is for reafons fuch as thefe, and not from a want of de- 
lire on the part of the people and minifter of Bedrule, to have 
every thing put on a legal footing, that the church-yard wall 
is in great difrepair, that the gate is fo broken down and ne- 
glected, as not to prevent the intrufion of fwine, and there- 
by to alarm the people in the neighbourhood for the graves 
of their deceafed relations ; that the church bell, which has 
been long rent, is now altogether ufelefs by the want of a 
tongue ; that the beadle is without a falary ; that the manfe 
has, till of late, been inhabited by the minifter, notwithftand- 
ing its long very bad ftate ; that the church and fchoolhoufe ftill 
remain in their ruinous condition. And, we are forry to

we believe, unjuftly, they are apt to afcribe their hardfhips and difficulties. 
But, in order to judge how much this is the cafe, we need only remind our 
reader of the anfwer given by Charles IF., though reprefented, at the fame 
time, by the hiftorian who relates the fa6t, as of a humane and feeling difpo- 
Ction, when informed of the hardfhips the people fuffeied, under the admi- 
niftration of a certain great fervant of his : " I perceive, faid he, that Lau- 
derdale has been guilty of many bad things againft the people of Scotland,

therefore, notwithftandirig, his confeffed humanity, he neither called him to

that the belt fupport of any nation, the ftrongeft pi-lars of any government,

fame oath on all perfons of every defcription, as well as the pernicious confe- 
quence of multiplying oaths, and rendering an appeal to God, that laft and 
mod facred pledge of fecurity to fociety, too frequent and familiar to the peo- 
ple. Mr Macgill was minifter of Cavers, and, as appears from the fame re-

1645, for (he vifitation of his kirk, at the advanced age of 101. Faftcaftle,

I However, at the fame time, in jujlice to ihe memory of the Covenanters, we 
readily admit, that the baneful fpirit of intolerance canmt with truth be more jujlly 
efcribed to them than to moft of the other feds in Europe at that time. For all who 
are acquainted with the hi/lory of that period, well know, that ihe fpirit of intolerance, 
from bad policy and mijlaken zc I, was unhippily the mat Led charaileriftic of moft of 
of the great contending parties of thofe times, according as they became pojfeffed of 
power : than which, as nothing is obvioufly mi re inimical to the peace of foeiety ana!

fet a better example, abfent themfelvcs from public worfhip 
altogether, the difrefpe£t that is thus (hewn to law and reli- 
gion, as well as clifregard to the inclination, convenience, and

them as it is illegal and profane- For, we may expect, and 
we pray God it be not in fome degree the cafe already, that 
the contempt that has been of late fo generally thrown on re- 
ligion and its peacefui adherents, may, in time, excite the 
multitude, who are but too apt to imitate the vices of their 
Superiors, rather than their virtues, to fliake off their honeft, 
as well as pious principles, and at 1 ift to become, if not as 
profane, at jeaft as corrupt as too many of thofe who efteeni 
themfelves their betters. When this event takes place, which, 
if not wifely prevented, may be nearer than many of us ima- 
gine, thofe who have done the mifchief muft feverely feel the 
effects of it, and will thereby, though, perhaps, too late, find 
the neceffity, from the want of a better principle, of fetting the 
example of a proper regard to the laws of God and their coun- 
try, for their own interefl and in their own defence. For, what- 
ever falfe and vain philosophers may pretend, a nation or peo-

to add, that by far the greater part of the heritors or land- 
holders of Scotland are of a very different defcription. And, 
therefore, from a real regard to the worfhip of God, the com- 
fort,. good will, and convenience of the people, and concern 
for the credit of their native country, as well as from their 
high refpedl for its constitution and laws, they have the pa- 
rifh churches, where their lands are Situated, not only decent 
and comfortable, but feme of them elegant.

Mr Jofeph Tenncnt, who frcms to have been 
one of the fir ft of the Reformed clergy h. this part of the 
country, is mentioned in an old record of pnfbytrry, as mi- 
nifter of Bedrule, as far back as the 1006, and lived till about 
the 1631 •, who alfo held, for a confiderable time the li- 
ving of Abbotrule, the cure of which he likewife ferved, e- 
even down to about the year 1621, when it was disjoined 
from Bedrule ; and Mr James Ker, laird of the Grange* an 
eftate in that parifh, whofe wife was charged with nvitchcruft, 
but, as appears from the above record, mojl utijujtly, was or- 
dained there ; he being the firit Proteftant miniftcr of 
Abbotrule after its disjunction from Bedrule. Mr Tennent 
was fucceeded by Mr David Fowlis, who was admitted 30th 
October '633, by the Bifhop of C lithnefs § and prefbytery of 
Jedburgh. Mr Fowlis was foon after tranflated to Oxnam, 
which, in thofe times, feems to have been confidered as one 
of the moft valuable livings in the South of Scotland •, and 
Mr Henry Pe'p-fon fucceeded him in the benefice of Bedrule. 
But the Covenanters t, foon after gaining the afcendency,

1 Here it may not be unworthy of remark, that the Scottifn Church, in 
the rank of her Clergy, before her connexion with the See of Rome, was 
nearly the fame as fhe became immediately on her Reformation from Pope- 
ry : And, that the Liturgy, or Boot of Common Order, received and ufed by the 
Reformed Kirk of Scotland, and commonly called Knox's Liturgy  foU piety, 
fimplicity, natural eafc and energy of expreffion, is equalled by few, and fur- 
paffed by none. 

§ This was Dr John Abernethy, then ajfo miniftcr of Jedburgh, and 
author of a theological work, entitled, « A Chriftian and Heavenly Treatife, 
containing Phyfic for the Soul." His name is mentioned in the printed ads 
of that period, as a Member of feveral Committees o! thu Scotch Parliament. 

f The following extract, from the record of Prefbytery, will enable the 
reader to form fome idea, how indifcriminately the Covenant was adminifter- 
fd, or rather impofed, upon many of the people, at that time, when the cen- 

fares 



of Bedrule. 



Advantages.— This parifh is fituated in the centre of a 
profperous though not very populous county, interfered by 
the great road between Berwick and Carlille, touched on by 
a branch of the London road to Edinburgh, not more than 
two miles diftant from Jedburgh, about 7 miles from Hawick, 
both excellent market towns. The land is in general of a dry 
foil, yet watered by a confiderable number of fprings, rivu- 
lets and brooks, in mod places of eafy accefs and at con- 
venient diftances from each other. Befides, upon the Weft 
and North it is for the moft part bounded by the before men- 
tioned pure and copious ftreams of the Rule and the Tiviot. 

Difadvantages. — The great diftance from coal, the bad- 
nefs of the road from Spittal bridge to the fouthern extre- 
mity of the parifh, by which the people in this part of the 
country, ufually pafs or make a great circuit, to Reid, in 
Northumberland, for coal, and Windburgh, a confiderable 
mountain on the borders of Liddyidaie, for lime ; and the 
badnefs of that from Bedrule to Jedburgh, the ne.ireft mar- 
ket town, are difadvantages not only to this parifh, but alfo to 
the neighbourhood, and which, with no great difficulty, may, 
and, we hope, foon will be removed, as both thefe roads, 
run, in general, on a gentle declivity and favourable bot- 
tom, and are near excellent materials. 

Conchifion. — It will be obferved, that the writer of the fore- 
going Statistical Account has avoided repeating the fame 
things, fo properly taken notice of in the accounts of the va- 
rious pnrifhes in this part of the country, already publifhed ; 
and, therefore, whenfoever that is felt as a defeft by the 
reader, it will be only neceffary for him to fuppofe, that the 
inhabitants of the parifh of Bedrule have nearly the fame re- 
ligious and political fentiments; predilections and prejudi- 
ces^,

ces*, are nearly of the fame fize, ftrength, and vigour of bo- 
dy and mind, and, from fimilar caufes, are liable to the fame 
difeafes, as mentioned in one or other of thcfe accounts : 
lhat the fame animals, fowls, and migratory birds, roam in 
the field, and fly in the air, indifferently over this and the 
neighbouring parifhes ; That the rivers abound with nearly

fame quality, flavour, and fhape, and in general alfo nearly 

of 

* It may be proper here only to remark, in general, that the people in 
this country fecm not now fo ftrongly attached to their lairds or matters as 
formerly ; and that the predilection of many to their native foil, and a cer- 
tain unfortunate family, is gitatly diminifhed ; the former being much weak* 
eued, the latter almoft every where worn out. Indeed, they feem now, in 
general, more anxious how they live, than where ; how they are governed, 
than by whom ; what the laws are, than who are their maker;; and how 
)uft and equal foever they he, are apt to confider thcmfelves protected there- 
by, only lo far as they have it in their power to render them efficient. Thefe 
changes, we believe, may be eafily accounted for. In this country, former- 
ly, the grcatcft rei'pect was generally paid to family ; for then almoft every 
perfon conGdered himfelf of forne family, and was thereby led to think 
he had an intereft therein. And his intereft, in this real or fuppofed 
connection, was, for the moll part, not merely ideal. For, then, it was the 
pride of the laird or mailer, to have his tenants, rt tair.ers, and even domeilits, 
of his own fuiname, many of them his near relations, and he commonly 
treated them as fuch. By this means, his will was ufually as law to them ; 
his honour their honour ; his intereft their intereft. And, we are affured, 
where this is ftill the cafe, the fame is ftill the effect. But where the canfe* 
are changed, it will not feem ftrange.that the confequences are alfo different. 
And however this change, in the minds of the people, may affect individual*, 
it is certainly, at prefent, not eafy to fay, what, in the long run, its effeel* 
may be on fociety ; but, it is evidently much altering the ftate of men* 
minds, as well as that of the country ; and we earneftly pray, it may, in the 
ifiue, be equally beneficial and improving to both. With regard to their re- 
ligious fentiments. though the people be not lef- divided, we are happy to cb- 
fervt, they feem, in general, lefs prejudiced againfl one another than former- 
ly • which proceeds, we believe, much, if not entirely, from the liberty of 
opinion, our excellent Coaftitution fo happily affords to every well inten- 
tio'ned and reafo;;able maa.

To thofe, but a little acquainted with the hiftory of that 
period, it is known, that in 1649, patronage was repealed, 
by aa of Parliament, and, that, foon after, certain of the 
clergy wore diftinguiffied by the name of Prottjlers, from 
their protefting againft admitting thofe called Malignant* 
(Cavaliers,) into offices of truft, or even into the Royal ar- 
my, in oppofition to another more numerous, but, in gener- 
al, lefs popular party of the clergy, called Refolutioners, hon\ 
their refolving their admiffion on certain conditions : And, 
that, in confequence of the jarring of thofe parties, as well 
as the repeal of the law of patronage, the fettlement of many 
churches was rendered difficult at that time. Whether from 
thefe, or from other caufes, with which the writer is as 
vet unacquainted, the church of Bedrule, was kept vacant

for no fhorter a period than the fpace of five years. |j At lafi, 
Mr Hugh Scot was fettled here, 1 7th March 1658. He did 
not continue long minifter ; for, on the re-eftabliftimeut of 
Epifcopacy, he was removed from his church for non-con- 
formity. Mr James Adamfon, minifter of Carriden, was pre- 
ferred to the living of Bedrule 7th September 1664, and con- 
tinued minifter here during the reigns of Charles and James, 
and feems to have died about the time of the Revolution. 
He was fuccetded by Mr James Borland, in 1690, who was 
the firft minifter fettled here after presbytery became again 
the rft ibliihcd religion. Mr Borland was fucceeded by. Mr 
John Gilchrift in 1714, who, in 1748, was fucceeded by Mr 
George Dickfon, to whom the prefent minifter fucceeded in 
1788 And, it is remarkable, of thefe above, mentioned 
nine incumbents, fince the Reformation, except Mr David 
Fowlis, who was tranflated to Oxnam, that they all died 
minifters of Bedrule, or were removed from their charge, 
not for any fault or irregularity of conduct, but for their 
faithful adherence to the religion they profefTed ; and, how- 
ever obvioufly of different fentiments, fidelity and fteadinefs 
in the caufe they thought be ft, were equally remarkable in 
jhe character of all. 

Advantages. — 

|| Indeed, from a remarkable coincidence of circumftances, the record* 
and hiftory of this country, in general, during that period, happen to be 
very imperfect. For, not to mention, the records and other, interefting pa- 
pers, which were carried to London by order of the Protector, having beem 
loft by the wreck of the veflel in which they were returning, by order of 
Government, after the Reftoration, on the Lothian coaft, near Royfton, 
(Caroline park,) General AflVmblies were interdicted during the Ufurpation : 
a Provincial Synod was, therefore, then the higheft EccMiaftical Court in thu 
country ; and the whole records of the provincial fynod of Merfe and Tiviot- 
dale, preceding 1708, and, probably, containing an account of the caufe of 
that very long vacancy, were unfortunately deftroyed by accidental fire i» 
the manfe of MorebatUe.

of the fame fize : And that, allowing for the difference of cli- 
mate in the uplands, the midlands, and the lowlands, feed time 
and harveft, the modes of cropping, and the management of 
black cattle and fheep, are nearly the fame ; and where there 
happens to be a diftin£tion, that it more commonly proceeds 
from the Ikill and induftry of individuals, than the general 
fyftem of conducting that kind of bufinefs in the different; 
parifhes- And, it is worthy of remark, that, with little ex- 
ception, the fame obfervation applies to the greater part of 
this dtftri£r. This, the writer trufts, will be ahfo his apolo- 
gy for having been particular in his account of other things, 
which though in themfelves, ^perhaps, not more interefting, 
yet, from their fpeciality, or having been overlooked, or but 
flightly noticed by others, he judged entitled to his atten- 
tion.

Name, Situation, Extent, &amp;c. 

r _f_^His parifh may take its name from the eflate of Foulis, 
one of the principal baronies of which it is compofed. The 
parifh and eftate receive frequently the additional title of 
Wejler, to diftinguifti them from the parifli and eftate of Fou- 
lis Eafter, alfo in Perthshire, but on the co. fines of the coun- 
ty of Angus. Both thefe eftates are now the property of 
Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre. The latter, however, 
was not long fince a part of the eftate of Gray, and the for- 
mer was more antiently part of the Earldom of Strathearn ; 
but fix or feven centuries ago, both of them were, in all pro- 
bability, the property of fome perfon of the name of Foulis, 
who gave his family name to his lands. The firft of that

name in Scotland is faid to have come from France, in the 
reign of Malcolm Canmore ; and branches of that family be- 
came proprietors of extenfive baronies in different counties 
of Scotland, which from them [till retain the name of Foulis. 
The word fcems to be derived from the French feuilles, that 
is, leaves ; to which the three bay leaves, worn by perfons of 
the name of Foulis, on their arms, apparently allude. The 
names of moft places in this part of the country being evi- 
dently of Gaelic derivation, fome have imagined Foulis to 
be derived from the tw o Gaelic words fou lios, that is, below 
the orchard. There is not, however, the fmalleft veftige of 
an orchard near the village, much lefs in the grounds above 
it ; and had the name been formed from the words now 
mentioned, it would probably have been accented on the laft 
fyllable, whereas the letter i is no more heard in the com- 
mon pronunciation, than the final e in the word feuilles. 

This parifli lies in the north fide of Strathearn, having that 
of Crieff on the W. ; Monzie N. W. ; Little Dunkeld N. ; 
Moneidie N. E. ; Methven E. ; and on the S. Maderty, 
from which it is feparated by the Pow, excepting about 40 
acres of Maderty, which are on the north fide of that river. 
Foulis is eight miles long, and fix broad. The great road 
from Perth to Crieff, an extent of 1 8 miles, enters it on the 
eaft fide, ten miles from the former of tfhefe towns, and 
leaves its weftern extremity within two miles of the latter. 

Face of the Country — The foil in general is a red clay or 
till, which on fome of the beft cultivated farms, becomes 
blackifli and loamy, by plenty of good manure. The foil is 
confiderably deeper in the fouth than in the north fide of the 
parifh. An high ridge running from Eaft to Weft along the 
top of what is called the braes of Foulis, divides it nearly in- 
to two equal parts. The lands on the fouth fide of that

ridge a«re by far the roofl valuable, and generally the beft cul- 
tivated. The church ftands in the centre of this diftritf, 
and contiguous to it is the village, containing 44 families, 
Who are aTl lodged in poor, loUr, thatched cottages, excepting 
the parochial fchoolmafter and principal inn-keeper, who 
liave each a houfe, two ftories. high, covered with blue 
flate. The village can hardly be expected to emerge from 
its obfeurfty, fihce the great road which lately palled 
through it, is now removed to the lower grounds, half a mile 
fouthward. On the declivity of the high rifing lands, 400 yards 
weft from the church, (lands the manfe, which prefents a 
very extenfive profpeft to the South, Eaft, and Weft, and, 
furroiinded with wide, uninclofed Hoping fields of moderate 
fertility, looks down on the richer plains below, as well 
as on an agreeable variety of grown trees, young plan- 
tations, and gentlemens feats, which, fo far as they re- 
fpe£r, this parifii, fhall be noticed afterwards. There 
•is 'not a fixth p;irt of the parifii inclofed. The chief 
•inclofures are in the South and South Eaft quarters; mod 
•of them are riot fufficiently fenced for confining cattle ; but 
the fev that are fully inclofed, can be let for pafture at 2 1. 
an acre yearly. The northern divifion beyond the high ridge 
above mentioned, is interfered by the river Almond, which 
ieaches the pnrifh at the bridge of Buchanty, wafhes its 
North border for half a mile, arid then runs through it a 
courfe of two miles towards the Tay, This river abounds 
with a fmall kind of trout, and 200 yards above the bridge now 
mentioned, forois a curious cafcade y which naturally attracts 
the travellers attention. From the top of the rock on the 
North fide 6f the river to the furface of the water, where it 
begins to fall,- is fix feet, the fall itfelf is feven, and the pool 
-into which it falls is ten feet deep. The bed of the river be- 
comes deeper and morfc contr&amp;cled as it advances to the

bridge, which confifts of a fingle atch 15 feet wide, and, 
though on a level with the road, is 32 feet high above foe 
fur face of the water, which there becomes 14 feet deep; 
that is, while the river is in its ordinary ftate and not fwc!- 
led by the rains While in this low ftate, alfo, the water at 
the cafcade is, by the projection of a rock in the middle of 
the ft'ream, divided into two parts^ betwixt which it was tx- 
fual, fome time ago, to hang a creel 'ov bafke't, by mea' A 
an iron chain, in fuch a manner as to catch multitudes of 3 
kind of white trout, as 'they were called, or young falfnou 
Weighing about three pounds each. The fifties attempted 
to oven-leap the cafcade, and hundreds that fucceeded, have 
by rods and nets been taken above it in a fummer ; but, 
it is believed, the far greater!: part, to the amount of fome- 
times 60 in a day, failing in the attempt, dropt into the baf- 
ket for the benefit of the principal heritor. This advantage 
however, has been entirely loft for ten yeaTS paft by the 
building of a mill-dam at Cromwell Park, in the parifh of 
Methven, Gnce which, none of that fpecies bias been found 
in this part of the river. Excepting a few trees about fame 
•farm hotvfes, and a Scotch fir plantation of three acres, noth- 
ing appears to have been planted on the North fide of the 
river \ but the South bank on the eftates of Abercarney and 
Goithie, was, at leaft 30 years ago, planted frith ftripes of 
coppice wood, in which afti, and efpecially oak and birch 
are prevalent. Thefe, with the additions more lately made, 
may extend to 16 acres. The largeft plantations formed 
within thefe 12 years, are on the heights of the ridge for- 
merly defcribed, where fome hundred acres have hecn plan- 
fed with Scotch fir, interfperfed with fome oak, birch and 
larix.

tenants in the South part of the parifli, ufe few peats ex- 
cept in drying their corns for the mill, choofing rather to 
carry coals from Blainigone, which is twenty miles diftant. 
The ufual cart load is 30 (tones, Tron weight ; this they 
purchafe at 1 s. |d. The fame quantity of Englifh or other 
imported coal at Perth, would coft 3 s., othcrwife the eafy

Heritors. — The number of heritors, with the names and 
comparative worth of their eftates within the parifli, will 
appear from a view of their valued rents here fubjoined.

The real rent will amount to 400c 1. and is paid with the 
price of near 6000 bolls of oat meal and barley, annual- 
ly exported to Perth, Crieff, and the Highlands. 

The firft of thefe heritors is patron of the parilh, and has 
his principal feat in it. The houfe of Abercarney having 
received various additions in different ages, as f.tney fuggeft- 
cd, or conveniency required, is lefs remarkable for the ele- 
gance of its architecture, than for the very extenfive and 
complete accommodation, which it affords : But the numer- 
ous fenced fields, gardens, and plantations around it, excite 

equally

equally the ideas of richnefs and beauty. The imagination 
is exceedingly delighted with the approach devifed by the 
prefent proprietor, while, after patting for 500 yards through 
a large plantation, along the fide of a deep den, in which a 
confiderable ftream occafionally appears, through- the over- 
fhadowing trees and fhrubs, with which its fteep banks are 
plentifully ftored, and then retiring obliquely 300 yards far- 
ther under a fhady grove, it prefents in fucceffion to the 
view, the wide Hoping lawns, the venerable o,;ks, the pleafing 
cafcades, and fanciful lakes, which adorn and diverfify the 
fcene. 

Near two miles to the North-Weft of this ancient manfion, 
is the houfe of Cultoquhey, the feat of the only other refid- 
ing heritor, which, with the delightful adjoining wood, (truck 
the eye of every traveller with peculiar pleafure, while the 
public road lay about 800 yards diftant to the South. But 
fince the high way has been conducted bv the North fide of 
the houfe, thefe beautiful objects appear with lefs advantage. 

Befides thefe two, the houfe of Gorthy is the only one in 
the parifh, in which an heritor has at leaft occafionally refid- 
«d ; that, however, is now defolate, the eftate having lately 
gone by purchafe into another family. 

Antiquities. — About a mile Eaft of the church, on the farm 
«f Caftleton, part of the eftate of Foulis, and on the Eaft fide 
of a den or ravine, which divides that from the eftate of A- 
bercarney, appear the remains of a fort or caftle, the feat of 
the ancient Earl of Strathearn. The ruins now form a graf- 
fy mount, conftantly employed as a pafture field. Here re- 
fided Mallus, Malifius, or Malife, the firft Earl of Strathearn, 
who lived in the reign of Alexander I. His grandfon Gil- 
bert, in the year 1200, founded the monaftery of Inchaffray, 
whofe ruins ly contiguous to the South border of this parifh.

Statijlical Account 



Befides the firft Earl above nientioned, there were three o- 
tlier Earls of Strathearn, who fucceeded each other, of the 
name of Malife ; butj none of that family feem to have af- 
fumed any furname. The feventh Earl, alfo named Malife, 
died without iffue, after marrying Joanna, daughter of Sin- 
clair, Earl of Orkney, who, in 1320, was concerned in a plot 
a_gainft Robert J. for which, according to fome accounts, 
fhe was condemned to perpetual imprifonment, and the Earl- 
dom forfeited. But Mary, aunt of the lafl mentioned Earl, 
had married Sir John Moray of Drumfargard, who got with 
her the lands of Abcrcarney and others. Her fon, Sir Mau- 
rice Moray, is faid to have been the laft Earl of Strathearn, 
and was, with David II. and many Scotch noblemen, taken 
prifoner at the battle of Durham, in 1346* Hence the pre- 
fent heritor of Abercarney, defcendent of the faid Sir Mau- 
rice Moray, is regarded as the lineal heir and reprefentative 
of the ancient Earls of Strathearn.

do not exceed two pounds weight each, and fell from 8 s. 
to 13 s. a ftone. A ewe and lamb may bring 7 s. 6d, and 
a fheep at Michaelmas, 6s. 6d. 

Thofe in the preceding article ftiled fmall farmers, are fuch 
as cannot yoke a plough without the aid of their neighbours* 
and generally pay under 8 I. each for their poffeffions, which 
rarely exceed 3 or 10 acres. They are commonly either 
tradefmen) or work with a horfe, in buying and carrying 
meal, yarn and other commodities. Mod of the other ten- 
ants or farmers .pay from 15 1-. to gol. ; eleven from 50I. to 
! 75 !., and one 300 It of yearly rent. Thofe who pay ' the 
. large ft rents, give almoft univerfally more for an acre than 
thofe who pay fmaller fums. The rents per acre vary from 
1 1. 5 s. and upwards, to 15 s. 13 s. 10 s. and 7 s. Yet 
the mere circumftance of enlarging the farms is far from 
being the fole caufe of their paying more rent by the acre;

r.emlly the be ft natural foil; whereas, all the farms that pay 1 
a low rent per acre, have dill a confiderable quantity of 
ground either wafte or very little cultivated. The richeft 
Kinds are in the South Eaft quarter of the parifh, efpecially 
fuch as are liable to be overflowed by the water of the Ponu, 
or had been formerly covered with it before the drain was 
formed. Of thefe, there may be fome hundred acres, fo en- 
riched with mud and flime, as conftant'y to yield plentiful 
crops without any manure, provided the feafon be modera- 
tely dry. Tradition fays, 36 bolls, of oats have been pro- 
duced on an acre of that richeft land ; this, however, is much 
doubted, as the grearefr quantity produced of late years is 
16 bolls, and that too very rarely, and only when the fea- 
fon is peculiarly favourable ; for the average produce of the 
beft land cannot be reckoned more than 8^ or 9 boll r 3 E- 
ven this very rich land requires a boll of feed to an acre ; 
for though a few pecks will fill the ground with ftraw, yet 
thin fowing never ripens equally, and if very thin, the great- 
eft part will not ripen at all. 

On an acre of ordinary good dry land, 5 firlots, or rather 
1 8 pecks of oats are fown ; of bear or barley, fometimes 10, 
but more frequently 12 pecks. The produce of the oats is 
5, and of the barley 6 bolls, at an average. A crop of clo- 
ver and rve-grafs yields from 100 to 250 (tones of hay, which 
in Auguft may fell at 4d. in the following April, May, or 
June, fome times at iod. a ftone ; but the average price for 
a courfe of years, is 57J- The moft common mode of rota- 
tion of crops obferved by the beft farmers on the richeft lands 
is, 1. oats 2. green crop of turnip or potatoes ; 3. barley and 
grafs feeds; 4. hay; 5. pafture. On lands of inferior qua- 
lity the modes are exceedingly various, but the moft com- 
mon, is, i. oats ; 2. barley ; 3. green crop with dung ; 4. bar- 
ley with grafs feeds ;, 5. hay : 6. and 7. pafture. The chief

but three times more lime is ufed than marie. Formerly 
thefe manures wae moft commonly laid on while a fit Id was 
In grafs ; but of late years much more generally on fummer 
fallow ; and the liming or marling is repeated after ten, or 
at moft twelve years. The foil being generally heavy, an 
acre requires from 60 to go bolls of marie : 70 may be the a- 
verage, but the greateft quantity has been found moft prov- 
able. The marie a few years ago was got within a mile or 
{too, at 6d. a boll, and then 2000 bolls have in one year been 
tarried to a farm of lefs than 150 acres, and 1500 with 150 
of lime to another. That fund, however, is now exhaufted, 
and marie at rod. a-boll, muft be got at 6 miles diftance- 
At Perth may be bought Englifh lime at 2S ; Burntilland at 3s„ 
2d ; or Lord Elgin's at is. od. all wheat meafure, of which 
fingle horfe cart carries 3 bolls. From 24 to 40 bolls of fheite, 
that is, unpacked lime, are laid on an acre, and 1500 boils are 
faid to have been carried in a year to one of the largeft farrrs 
of near 300 acres. Perhaps the beft managed farms are fuch 
as extend from 120 to 200 acres. On one of 150 may be 
kept eight work horfes, three or four young ones, and be- 
tween 40 and 50 black cattle, old and young. The value of 
a draught horfe is from to 25I. Four were generally 
yoked in a plough, 20 years ago ; but two horfe ploughs 
now almoft univerfally prevail, and fingle horfe carts are pre- 
ferred to double ones. Few of the cattle were fed for daugh- 
ter, moft of them are fold under 3 or 4 years old ; and 8 or 
10, value 4I. or 5I. each, are kept as milk cows : And as the, 
calves are all reared, and others purchafed inftead of fuch as 
happen to die, the butter and cheefe fold from one cow, can- 
not exceed il. yearly. A farm of this fize requires four men, 
two boys, and two female fervants. The year's fee of a prin- 
cipal man fervant is iol. ; that of an inferior man, 7L or 81.

to boy's, from il. to 3!. ; a female fervant's, al. 105 or 3 K 
with the produce of a lippi- of lintfeed fown. A confide^-, 
b!e number of additional fervants is necefiary in harvell ; a 
inan (hearer in that feafon gains il. ros. or 2J. ; and a wo- 
man, i8s. or il. Many fanners have what are called collar t\ 
to when they give a cottag" and fmall garden, wilh fome- 
times an acre of land, and a cow's grafs, for which the cottar 
pays 3 1 or 4I. if he has two acres; and ios- more, if hi? land is 
ploughed by the tenant. But no cottar gets any land except 
on condition of w orking with the farmer for reafoiuble wages, 
whenever required, efpecially in .harveft. Such a farmer's fa- 
mily as that now defcribed, feed chiefly on oat meal, barley 
meal, potatoes, milk and cheefe. What animal food they 
ufe is from Michaelmafs to Whitfunday, and confifts of one 
bullock falted for winter beef, one hog in fpving, and between 
20 and 24 quarters of mutton purchafed occafionally through 
the year. Though the tenants are all decently clothed, and 
their circumflances, upon the whole, tolerably eafy and more 
plentiful than formerly ; yet they are far from being affluent, 
or in a fituation that raifes them above the neceffity of ma- 
nual labour. It is fomewhat furprizing that there is not in 
the parifh a tenant, though paying 100I. or even 300!. of 
yearly rent, that acts merely as a director and over-feer of 
his fervants ; but all of them, lb far as b-ealth and ftrength, 
allow, work proportionably with their own hands The la- 
bour, the rents, and all the expences of the tenants, are dou- 
ble what they were 25 years ago. Then a principal man fer- 
vant had only 4I. 10s. or at mod 5I. an inferior man 2l. ios. 
or 3 1. and a female fervant il. or il. 5s. Since, however, 
fuperior fkill and induflry now raii'e a crop of double value, 
they, as well as the public, are real gainers by the improve- 
ments lately attained. They have a!fo the unfpeakable ad- 
vantage cf being more fecure and independent by the leafes.

which all of them now hold, and are commonly granted for 
19 ye.irs 5 and likewife by their releafe from various burdens 
formerly impofed. Qn feveral of the greateft eftates, the te- 
nants were then, or a few years earlier, bound to carry out the 
dtongi to plow and harrow all the lands pofieffed by the he- 
ritor (whom they all called, and (till through habit call their 
matter, but more frequently the laird) to cut, dry, and carry 
home his peats, and all the coals ufed by his family ; to cut, 
win, and [lack his hay ; to cut down, carry home, and flack 
corns 5 to carry bark and farm meal to any unlimited diflance 
where the factor fold thefe articles, but rarely above 12 or 20 
miles ; to go each in their turn with a horfe or care to Perth, 
or Crief, or longer journies when required, and all at their 
own charge, without any allowance of food for man or beaft. 

Thefe fervices were emphatically filled bondage, particular- 
ly the manual labour at peats, hay, and harveft ; working 
with a horfe was called carriage ; and thefe two fpecies of 
labour, were, in the old tack, diftinguiihed by the names of 
barrage and carrage. One heritor has fome of his tenants 
{till bound to part of thefe fervices, fuch as winning and 
flacking hay, (hearing in harveft, and carrying coals and 
lime to a certain extent ; but the other hei-itors require no 
fervices, except the carriage of coals and bark. Moft of the 
tenants are now Hkewife releafed from the fervitude of thir- 
iage, by which they were obliged to grind at a particular 
miln, and to pay very high duties. There are five corn 
milns in the parifh, belonging to different heritors, and each 
heritor has relieved his own tenants from the high duties, 
on dividing among them the old miln rent. To thefe the 
miln duties amount to about the 30th peck ; a few tenants 
that are ftill bound to a miln on another eftate, pay at leaft 
a, twelfth part of what they grind at it. 

As

As the foil is generally too cold and moift, and the grain 
therefore ripens flowly, the tenants are liable to fuffer im- 
menfe lofs by a'rainy feafon. Thus, in 1 702, the whole crop 
could only pay that fmaller portion of the rent that is ufual- 
ly paid in meal : and though fome fold a few bolls out of 
the parifh that year, twice as much was purchafed by other 
tenants for domeftic confumpt. 

Quarries. — The houfes of the tenants arc generally one 
ftory high, thatched with draw. Two farm houfes of one 
ftory, and four of two flories high, are covered with blue 
flate ; and two of one ftory, with grey flate. It might be 
expected that many more would have flared roofs, fmce both 
kinds of flate now mentioned are found in the parifh. On 
the eftate of Logiealmond, is a valuable blue flate quarry, let 
at 50 guineas yearly •, from which 500,000 flates are fuppofr 
ed to be fold annually, at 13s. 4d. the thoufand. On the 
lands of Abercarney and Foulis, are quarries of grey flate, 
that is, a kind of light brown freeftone, which rifes in broad 
lhelves, of an inch thick, is eafily cut with the flater's knife, 
and makes a pretty good, though heavy roof. As thefe 
quarries were never wrought to any great extent, no rent is 
paid for them, but a thoufand flates may be quarried for il. 
I os. which will cover as much of a roof as 61. value of the 
blue flate above mentioned. That roof, however, will be 
greatly inferior in elegance and duration. Near the entry 
to the houfe of Abercarney, is an inexhauftible quarry, of a 
beautiful and excellent (tone for building ; snd, on the Cul- 
toquhey eftate, is a quarry of the beft ftone for pavement in 
all the country, which being foft while in its natural moift 
date, fhapes eafily, and 20 years ago, might be quarried, cut, 
and laid at 2d. a foot ; but the price is now nearly doubled. 

Highway. 



OfFoulis Wester. i 6c7 



Highway. — The greateft improvement lately made in the 
parifh, is the conftruaion of the new line of road leading 
through it from Perth to Crieff, which is everywhere at leaft 
35 feet broad, and has in no part a greater rife than of one 
foot in 50. Whereas, the old line, which led clofe by the 
church, and over the brae of Foulis, frequently rofe at the 
rate of more than one in ten feet. The making of this new- 
road, from Methven to Gowan hill, in this parifh, coft 260I. 
each mile, and from that point weftward, 239I. ; befides 
bridges, the largeft of which is not yet founded ; and the 
fmaller ones have been executed at il. each foot in width : 
befides alfo the filling up of dens or ravines, the largeft of 
which alone coft 130I. Where the bottom is belt, or mate- 
rials neareft, it may be kept in repair at 2I. a mile ; but the 
greateft part of it is to be upheld three years, at 4I. a mile 
annually. The expence of making has been fo great, and 
the refort of travellers hitherto fo fmall, that the duties col- 
lected at the toll-bar, firft erected in 1 793, though fome- 
what higher than in other counties of Scotland, are not fuf- 
ficient to pay the interefts of the fums expended. 

Poor, Religion, Charafter. — The poor, who ate under the 
neceffity of begging, are not very numerous ; but no ftated 
contribution, nor any afleflment being made by the heritors' 
for their fupport, they cannot be fufficiently fupplied, or 
begging prevented, by the fmall funds allotted to their ufe. 
Thofe confift of the collections at the church door, amount- 
ing to 3s. weekly ; 2s. from every bride in the parifh j and 
the annual rent of 70I. By far the greateft number of beg- 
gars come from other parifhes. There are commonly two 
fchools, befides that of the parochial fchoolmafter. He has 
from the heritors 200 merks Scots of falary, with a free 
houfe and garden. His wages from the fcholars may

"be at an average is. 6d. a quarter; and his emoluments 
as fefhon clerk do not exceed 4I. annually. The mi- 
inftcr, befides a manfe and a glebe of feven acres, has be- 
tween 70I. and Sol. of ftiped 5 the ptdfent incumbent, how- 
ever, being pofleiTed of heritable property in a neighbouring 
parilh, and having the comfort of his parilhioners much at 
heart, charges himfelf with the maintenance of an afhftant 
for their fatisfacYiOn ; while at the fame time he has never 
Ihcwn the lead reluclance to the perfonal difcharge of every 
part of the minifterial office!. The people, therefore, are u- 
niverfally attached to the Eflablifhed Church, except nine fa- 
milies, whofe heads and children are Antiburghers, except 
alfo the two rcfiding heritors, who arc of the Epifcopal com- 
munion. Were thefe heritors of the fame religious profcO- 
fion as the vulgar, it would probably be the occafion of remo- 
ving a grievance of which the people have long with too much 
reafon complained— that no care is taken to render the paro- 
chial church decent or commodious. The walls and roof, in- 
deed, are kept in tolerably good lepair ; but it is badly light- 
ed, and the feats and galleries have, for many years, been in 
a very ruinous condition. The people are in general devout 
as well as fober and induftrious, lovers of peace, and well af- 
fecled to government. If, in any indance, they have mani* 
fefted rather lefs seal than fome others for the fupport of law 
and good order, fuch apparent coolnefs is by no means to be 
attributed to any difcontentment with our happy Conftitu- 
tion ; but merely to an averfion at any avocation which they 
apprehend might interfere with that clofe application to their 
own proper employments, which through their habits and cir- 
cumftances they find both agieeable and neceffary.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011342">AVOCH</name> 
(\Presbytery of Chanonry, Synod and County of Ross.) 
By the Rev. Mr James Smith.</head>

<p>

Name, Situation, Extent, &amp;c. 

In old records, the name is written Avach or Auach. It is 
commonly pronounced Auch. The mod probable derivation 
is from a Gaelic word, fignifying a ford or Jhallonv water. For 
the bay, oppofite to the parifli church, being more {hallow, 
the tide flows and recedes farther than in any other part of 
this fide of the Moray Frith, between the bays of Cromarty 
and Munlochy. This parifli is fituated in the prefbytery of 
Chanonry, in the fynod and county of Rofs. It is one of the 
eight pariflies comprehended within the ancient diftric"t of 
Ardmeanach, or the Black ljle ; fo called, becaufe the whole 
make a peninfula., of which the greater part continues (till 
black uncultivated moor, though a good deal has been plant- 
ed and improved of late. 

Avach 



of Avoch. 6 n 

Avoch extends about i\ Englifli miles from Eaft to Weft, 
ind 4 from South to North, and is nearly of a rhoimboidal 
form. It is bounded by the parifh of Rofemarky towards 
the Eaft ; by the Moray Frith and that branch of fame Frith 
called Munlochy bay, on the South-Eaft, South, and South- 
Weft ; by the united parifhes of Kilmuir Welter and Suddie, 
on the Weft ; by Urquhart or Ferrintofh on the North Weft, 
and by the united parifhes of Cullicudden and Kirkmichael 
on the North. It marches with thefe laft on the large hill 
called Mulbuy, which extends nearly the whole length of the 
Black Ifle, from Cromarty to Betfuley. 

Surface and So:/. — This parifh confifts chiefly of two ridges 
of hills, of a moderate altitude, and pretty broad on the top, 
running nearly parallel to each other, in a direction from Eait 
to Weft, with a gently Hoping vale on the North fide of each, 
and part of the Mullbuy, formerly mentioned, rifing behind 
all thefe towards the North. So that it prefents, in a manner, 
three banks or faces to the beneficial influence of the fouth- 
ern fun, and enjoys all the varities and advantages of hill and 
dale : The fouthern expofures being in general beft adapted 
for corn-farms ; the northern, for wood, and the valleys, for 
pafture. 

Almoft every variety of foil is to be met with here. To- 
wards the (bore it is light and fandy, as ufual, particularly 
in fome of the lower grounds near the bay and fea town of 
Avoch j where, on digging two or three feet deep, a ftra- 
tum of fea fhells has been found in different places. This 
would feem to indicate that the Frith had once over- flowed 
thofe grounds to a farther extent that it ever does now. To 
the Weftward of this, on both fides of the Southern vale, the 
foil is generally a light loam, or loam mixed with clay, fer- 

4 I 2 tile 



6l3 



Statijlical Account 



tile enough. Farther Weft, there is a deep rich clay, parti- 
cularly on that fine extenfive bank of the Mulbuy, called 
Auchterflow. In the Northern vale, there is a good deal of 
mofs, on a t illy or clay bottom, of a bad quality and general- 
ly wet, which can fcarcely be cultivated to advantage. The 
hill tops confift chiefly of a black fandy foil, covered with 
poor fhort heath, and a few moor ftoncs intermixed, much 
better adapted for plantations of the Scots fir, than for paf- 
turage. 

Climate. — The air is generally dry and healthy, though, 
comparatively fpeaking, few of the inhabitants attain to old 
age. But this feems more owing to their habits of life, than 
to the climate. No difeafe can be faid to be particular)' pre- 
valent. Fevers and the fmall-pox have, indeed, at times, 
made confiderable ravages. This, however, can be eafily ac- 
counted for, from the people's want of cleanlinefs, and their 
exceflive ufe of fpiritual liquors. 

Sea Coajly — its Advantages and Productions. — The Northern 
part of Scotland derives many advantages from thofe beauti- 
ful arms of the fea, with which it is interfered. Of thefe 
the parifh of Avoch is not without its {hare. The frith 
warning it nearly on two fides, makes the air much more 
falubrious ; without thofe fogs and that piercing coldnefs, 
which the inhabitants of the Eaft coaft cf Scotland complain 
of, from the neighbourhood of the German Ocean. It alio 
makes the fnows fooner melt in winter ; and prevents immo- 
derate heat in fummer, by that agreeable and refrefhing cool- 
nefs, which every flowing of the tide fends forth. It affords 
likewife employment for many of the inhabitants, and adds 
to the provifion of the whole, f

Strings — There is great abundance of excellent 
fprings throughout all this parim. Some of them have a 
mineral tint ; but have not become remarkable for the cure 
of any difeafes. A well, called Craiguck, ifluing from a 

rock 

vides this parifh from Fortrofe and Kofemarky) to the eaft end of the Seatown 
of Avoch, the coaft is high and roky. But few of thofe rocks extend into 
the fea, fo as to be dangerous for boats : And there is for the moft part a fine 
foft beach at the foot of them. From thence to Caftletown Point, the fhore 
is flat and fandy. There is good anchorage for fhipping ; and veffels of from 
40 to ico tons may lie to fafely on the Seatown beach, to deliver and receive 
cargoes, unlefs there be a ftrong gale from South or South-Eaft. Fiom Caf- 
tletown Point Weflward to the mouth of Munlochy bay, the coaft is bold 
and rocky, and there is more depth of water. Along the faid bay to the 
wcftcin boundary of this parifh, it is generally high, and confifts of fand and 
gravel, with fome large rocks interfperfed. 

Even thofe rocks have turned out advantageous. For in Munlochy bay- 
there is an excellent quarry of hard reddifh freeftone, acceffible to boats on 
the water-edge. Out of this quarry almoft the whole of the extenfivc works 
of Fort George were built. The late Mr Mathefon of Bennetsfield, proprie- 
tor of the grounds, let the quarry to Government, or to the undertaker em 
ployed by Government, at the fmall fum of 10I. a-year, while that fortifica- 
tion was going on. A cheap contract, indeed, if we confider the immenfe 
quantity of material furnifhed ? For 20 or 30 boats, beiides fevcral Hoops, 
were conftantly employed in conveying it. 

The quarry is now wrought cbufiy for builders at Iuvernefs, who, 
though there be 5 or 0 miles of water-carriage, find this their eafieft fupply. 
And two boats of 10 or 11 tons burden each, are almoft daily engaged in the 
bufinefs; which, with the quarrying work, yields a pretty good fubfiflence 
to eight or ten families in this parifh, befides a rent, or profit of about 30I. 
Sterling yearly, to the proprietor. A boat's cargo of the ftor.e fetches at !n- 
vernefs, 16s. or r;s. 

The Moray Frith at Avoch, is about four miles broad. And a finer ba- 
fon is fcarccly to be feen in the North. To an obferver on this fhore it has 
all the appearance of a beautiful lake. For Chanoriry point from the North, 
and that of Ardcrficr from the South-Eaft, appear like projected arms to 
clafp each other, and to break off its connection with the fea, while the point 
of Invernefs, and the hills in that neighbourhood, fcem to bound it in like 
planner in an oppofite direction. The town of Invernefs, at the one end, and

rock near the fhore of Bennetsfield is refortcd to in the month 
of May, by whimfical or fuperftitious perfons, who, after 
drinking, commonly leave fome threads or rags tied to a bum 
in the neighbourhood. But if they derive benefit from this, 
it would feem to be more owing to their own credulity, than 
to any efted* of the water, which differs nothing in tafte or 
appearance from common. 

In the fouthern vale, there is a fine rivulet, called the bum 
of Avoch ; perhaps the largeft ftream in Ardmeanach ; which 
rifes moRly in this parifh, drives three corn-mills, and emp- 
ties itfelf into the fea near the church . It produces the com- 
mon trout and eel. Its mouth makes a fafe harbour or re- 
treat for the fifhing boats in time of ftorm : And here a 

good 

Fortrofe and Fort George at the other, add much to the landfcape. From a 
boat in the middle of the Frith, oppofite to Culloden-houfe and the bay of 
Avoch, the view is ftill grander and more embellifhed. 

Since the important seta of 1746, the trade of Invernefs.and of the other 
towns on this Frith, has been gradually increafing and flourifhing. It em. 
ploys now more than fix times the former number of veffels : fome of which 
may be feen here palling and repaffing almoft every day. 

But the chief benefit of the Frith to this parifh, is that of the Fifheries. 
Here arc caught herrings during their feafon ; whitings, flounders, fprats, a 
few oyflers and crabbs, with abundance of mufsles, quilks, and fmall fry for 
bait. There might be a ftell fifhing for falmon, near Caftletown point : But 
as the fhore is not altogether convenient for drawing the net, it has not been 
much tried. Some fmall whales, purpoifes, and fnipe fifh, come up now and 
then. About 50 years ago, haddocks were frequently caught within a mile 
of Avoch. But they have fince quite dii'appeared. They feem to have re- 
treated Eafiward to the wider parts of the Frith, towards Tarbat point and 
the coafts of Moray and Caithnefs. Nor have they been got there for feve- 
ral years paft in fuch plenty as before, until this fummer, (1793) when the 
fifhermen have had good fuccefs, and found them again about the mouth of

birch and Alder. But this houfe, and that of BennetsfidJ, 
near the South- Weft corner of the parifh, belonging to Colin 
Mathefon, Efq; have both been allowed to fall into difrepair, 
as the proprietors of them refide in other parts of the coun- 
ty- 
One of the fineft woods here is that called the Craio-- 

O 

wood, * near Fortrofe, belonging to Mr Rofs of Cromarty. 
It contains mod kinds of foveft-trees, beautifully intermixed, 
on a rocky bank, by the fea. It was all cut down about 30 
years ago, for making palifadoes and fafcines to Fort George, 
when they apprehended a vifit from Monf. Thurot's fqua- 
dron. It has fince grown up finely from the roots anew. 

* This wood makes part of the old eftate of Rofehaugh, which belonged 
to the late celebrated Sir George Mackenzie, King's Advocate. The pro- 
perty is faid to have been fo named from a fmall haugh contiguous to the 
bank, where a great many fwectbriars and wild rofes ufed to grow. The 
ground having been moftly brought into tillage, they are not now fo nume- 
rous. On this haugh, along the bottom of the wood, lies the road from For- 
trofe to Avoch : And there can fcarcely be imagined a more delightful fum- 
mer evening's walk than this, — when, on one hand, the Weftern fun glitters 
through the trees, — the birches fend forth their fragrance, — and the finging 
birds ferenade you ; — and, on the other hand, you behold the beautiful bafon 
before mentioned, with veffels and boats plying upon it with cheerful induf- 
try. It is faid that Sir George Mackenzie was fo fond of this walk, and of 
that on Ghanonry point, which ftretches out a mile and a half into the fea, 
covered with fhort clofe grafs, as fmooth and foft as a carpet, that he ufed 
to call it rudenefs and want of tafte in any of his friends or acquaintances to 
ride on horfeback along them. The Right Hon. James Stewart Mackenzie, 
Lord Privy Seal, who fucceeded to Sir George's eftate in this county, fold the 
lands of Rofehaugh to the late George Rofs, Efq; of Cromarty, one of the 
moft fpirited improvers hitherto known in Ardmeanach. Mr Rofs gave good 
employment many years to a multitude of labouring people from all the 
neighbouring diftricts. But, unfortunately for this parifh, he died before he 
could get his plans of improvement extended fo far. 

A few years ago, Captain Kenneth Mackenzie of Newtown, another he- 
ritor, attempted to enlarge the beautiful fcene of the Craigwood, by planting 
bis part of the fame bank to the weftward. But as the rocks and ftecpnels 
prevented him fr«m getting proper fences made, hii young trees have been 

moftiy 



of Avoch. 



Agriculture, &amp;c. — Though fome parts of the parifh have 
been mcafured, there is no regular furvey or map of the 
whole. It is believed, however, to contain about 6coo a- 
ctcs. Of thefe, from 1500 to 2000 may be under cultiva- 
tion. But the whole produce will feldom exceed 5000 bolls ; 
for among the tenants here, farming is only in a ftate of in- 
fancy. It ha6 emerged but little from the rude practice of 
their forefathers, a hundred years ago. Their horfes, in ge- 
neral, are miferable poneys or garrons, bought at from jl. 
to 5I. Sterling, each. Their cattle are a little better in pro- 
portion ; but few of their fheep are worth above 5s. per 
head. So bleak and bare, indeed, are the hill tops and 
muirs, that this parifh is very little calculated for fheep paf- 
ture. Their implements of husbandry are equally poor, ex- 
cept with a few more careful and induftrious men, who, ha- 
ving got better garrons, begin of late to ufe the light chain 
plough, with curved mold board ; and perhaps a coup-cart 
or two, or a fmall wain for oxen on their farm. Their 0-

moflly deftroyed by the neighbour's cattle and fheep. Difcouraged by this, 
he turned his attention next to the improvement of his farm ; and has, with 
great expence and labour, made out above twelve acres new land, where ne- 
ver a blade of corn grew before. Induftry of this kind is beneficial to one's 
country, and deferves to be recorded. 

The rent of land in the country part of the parifh, including various cuf- 
toirn and fervices, amounts to from 12s. to 13s. per acre, according to the 
quality and expofure : But, in the neighbourhood of the villages of Seatown 
and Kirktown, ic pays in general from 25s. to jcs. And here fome fmall fpots 
of garden ground are let at the rata of from 5I. to 81. Sterling per acre. 
Thefe laft, however, are generally pofTclTed by feamen, fhoemakers, and o- 
thers, who keep no cattle, and muft have a little ground for raifing potatoes 
and greens to their families. Such high rents could not be paid by mere 
hufbandmen. 

The total grofs rent of the parifh is fome what more than 7 30. bolls vic- 
tual, and 900I. Sterling. The valued rent is 2jj il. 6s, 46. Scots.

ther utcnfils are coarfc, being commonly made by the tenants 
own hand, with the help of fcarcely any other inftrument 
but the ax and adze, which fome of them can ufe very dex- 
tro.ufly. 

There is no wheat raifed in this parifh. The prevailing 
crops are oats and peafe, fown in April ; and bear, or bear 
and barley intermixed, which they commonly fow in May. 
Since the year 1782, when the crop of oats in this parilh 
failed fo much, that fcarcely any of them were fit for fow- 
ing again, early oats of the Blainfley kind have been fown for 
the moft part on the late farms, particularly by the tenants 
of Auchternow ; where they anfwer fo well, that farmers in 
fimilar fituations, over all this country, purchafe from them 
for feed. The harveft begins in general about the 20th Au- 
guft, and ends in October, fooner or later, according to the 
drought or wetnefs of the fummer, and the expofure of the 
farms. But on fome grounds near the fhore, the feafons 
are perhaps as early as in any corner of Scotland. For here 
a few tenants fow barley the fxrft or fecond week of April, 
and reap it frequently in the end of July, or beginning of 
Auguft. On thefe light grounds, a very fimple rotation is 
pra&amp;ifed, of barley and a green crop alternately. The green 
crop is peafe or potatoes ; for turnips, though a better pre- 
parative for barley, have not yet been introduced by the te- 
nantry here. 

In the higher and deeper grounds, no regular rotation of 
crops is followed, except on the heritor's own farms, where 
a good many of the modern improvements are pra&amp;ifed 
with fuccefs. 

The great aim of the country tenants, is to raife as much 
bear and barley as poffible, which, finding a ready market 
with the highland diitillers in Ferrintofli and Redcaftle, 
turns out to be the moft profitable crop. Moft of thofe te- 
nants 



of Ji-och. 



ftifrts raife alfo a little flax. But, as they feldom have ground 
in proper heart for it, it anfwers poorly ; nor is there a mill 
in Ardmeanach for dreffing it. About 50 years ago, the 
culture of hemp was pra&amp;ifed, to the extent of from 30 to 
40 acres in this puriih. But imce the importation of that 
article has become more frequent, they do not now fow a 
third part of the former quantity. More than 100 acres are 
now planted yearly with potatoes ; which, befides preparing 
the land for barley, are exceedingly ufeful in their families. 
Clay is much ufed over all this country as a manure. They 
mix it with the dunghills in fummer, and fpread it out cn 
their light grounds intended for barley in the fpring. They 
imagine it has a good efiecT: in keeping out the fummer heat 
and drought from hurting the roots of the corn. It may 
thus in fome meafure correct; the foil, but the kind of clay 
ufed by many of them, can add very little to the vegetable 

ood of plants. But the chief error of thefe tenants is, that 
they reft little of their grounds, and thefe only when quite 
worn out; nor do they fow any grafs feeds. This obliges 
them to fend off moft of their cattle to remote highland glens 
for the fummer, where they lofe many of them, and their 
growth is much retarded. What a lofs muft it alfo be to 
their farms, to be deprived of the dung of thofe cattle for a- 
bout five months of the year ? 

Such extreme backwardnefs in the Hate of farming here, is 
occafioned partly by the tenants own obftinacy, that they will 
not follow good example fet before them by the gentlemen 
farmers partly by their poverty, as few of them can afford 
to purchafe good utenfds or grafs feeds ; but chiefly by the 
highnefs of their rents, the fcarcity of fervants, and the fhort- 
,nefs of their leafes : which in few cafes exceed 7, 8, or 15 
years. - Another baT to improvement is the neglect of winter 

crding. For from the end of hafveft to the middle of A*

pril, the tenants cattle pafture in common. And a man 
whofe farm lies in a warm fixation, and being in proper 
heart produces good foggage, cannot have the benefit thereof 
to himfelf, without either perpetual watching or inclofures, 
which he is not able to afford ; but gets almoft the fubftance 
eaten out of his grounds, by the neighbours cattle. Un- 
til thefe obftacles, or at lead fome of them, be removed, 
there can be little hops of feeing agriculture profper in this 
diftrid.- 

The number of horfes in the parifh, including garrons, 
may be about 250, of cattle 480, and fheep nearly 600. 

ManufaElures.—Hht principal branch confifts of coarfe 
linen and ofnabrugs, made entirely of flax raifed by the ten- 
ants themfelves, fpun in their houfes, and woven within the 
paaifli. This may bring in yearly, from 300I. to 5 ool. Ster- 
ling 5 and no foreign material is required, except a few 
calks of Dutch lintfeed. There is alfo as much hemp raifed 
and manufactured by the farmers, as fuffices for fails to the 
fifhing boats. And the wool of the few fheep, is all made into 
cloth and (lockings at home for the peoples own wear. Among 
the villagers of Seatown, there is a good manufacture carried 
on of herring and falmon nets, moftly from foreign hemp. 
Befides fupplying the fifhery herej they fell yearly from 150'. 
to 200I. value of thefe to Caithnefs, Lochbroom, and other 
fifhing ftations in the North. There was formerly a flourifh- 
ing manufacture of (hoes, from hides moftly dreffed at home, 
which employed about thirty hands in the fmaller villages of 
Kirktown, Millhil!, and Miltown. But the late laws, im- 
pofing a heavy licenfe duty on tanners, have operated nearly 
as a prohibition to this article. Some of the fhoemakers 
have left the place, others have become day labourers. And 
five or fix, who remain at work, have now no apprentices, nor

can tliey make bread by it themfelves, owing to the high 
price of leather. 

The imports into this parifh, confift of fait, iron, hemp, 
coarfe cloths, whiflcy, a few grocery goods, and coals. The 
repeal of the duty on coals, will be an immenfe benefit in 
future years, as there are few peats to be got, and wood fells 
too high for feuel. 

The exports confifl of grain, cattle, herrings, and the manu- 
factures formerly mentioned. Befides fupplying its own in- 
habitants, this, parifh difpofes of yearly to the neighbouring 
diftillers, and the burghs of Fortrofe and Invernefs, from 800 
to 1000 bolls bear, and from 200 to 400 bolls of oats, peafe, 
and meal, including what is fent forth of the victual rents. 
Though the laft crops (1792) was deficient in counties far- 
ther South, it was fo plentiful in general throughout the 
Eaftern half of Rofs-fhire and Cromarty, that, after ferving 
the people and the numerous (tills, thofe diftricts have ex- 
ported fix or feven thoufand bolls.

Population. — If we may judge from concurring traditions, 
where no authentic record has been preferved ; and from a 
well known fact, that there are a third more dwelling houfes 
now in the parifh of Avoch, than in the beginning of this 
century, the population muft haVe increafed confiderably 
within that period Yet, by Dr Webfter's lift in 1755, the 
population is ftated at 1457 ; and by an accurate furvey made 
partly in 1792, and concluded fpring 1793, the number of 
living fouls was found to be 1380. 

The church, which was built in 1670, and was probably 
made fufficient to accomodate the parifhioners, or at leait 
fuch a number of them as might be expected to attend pub- 
lic worfhip regularly about that time, could not, in the way 
it was then fitted up, contain properly above 400 perforts.

From the beginning of October to the middle of March, 
they commonly fiih for herrings in thefe upper parts of the 
Frith. Towards the end of March and in April, they go 
down along the coafts of Moray and Caithnefs, for cod,

to Caithnefs, and Lochbroom, for fix or eight weeks, wheri 
the herring fifhery at thbfe ftations is commonly moft fa- 
vourable ; and in good years they have been known to bring 
home from thence, 81. or iol. Sterling each man of nett 
gain. 

They generally return in September, to prepare for the 
feafon at home, which, owing to the fmall depth, and clear- 
nefs of this frith, begins only about the autumnal equinox, 
or a fortnight thereafter . The fame caufes oblige the fiiher- 
inen, for the moft part, to delay their work here till evening or 
night, as the herrings are then caught in much greater num- 
bers, than during the day. In good feafons, it is not un- 
common for each boat to bring in the quantity of from 18 
to 25 barrels in one night. When the fhoal comes up in 
the end of June or beginning of July, the herrings prove ge- 
nerally beft, and moft plentiful.

val (loops alio weredifpatched with full cargoes of unpacked 
herrings for Dunbar, and other towns on the caft coaft— 
Since that period, the fuccefs in general has been poor at 
this ftation, little more than what ferved to fupply the neigh- 
bouring country ; except in fpring 1792, when about 1100 
barrels were exported. Laft winter, the herrings were un- 
commonly fcarce. And the prefent feafon, 1793-4, though 
it promifed well in autumn, has turned out but indifferently. 
There are not now (in February) 200 barrels packed. 

The herrings found here are feldom fo large as thofe caught 
at Caithnefs, and Lochbroom, which make's it neceifary for 
the men to provide a different fet of nets of a fmaller mefh 
and depth, than what they ufe at the former ftations. Nor 
have any buildings as yet been erected at Avoch, for curing 
them in the red manner. The quantity of herrings fufficient 
to pack a barrel when cured, is fold here frefb, at from 3s. 
to 5s. 6d. according to the quality and the demand. And 
the middle-fized, when fat, are reckoned much nicer, and 
more delicate eating, than larger ones, though they do not 
fetch fo good a price at the London and other markets, being 
not accounted fo fit for exportation to hot climates. But, 
if our belt hands, at all the different ftations in the north and 
weft of Scotland, were provided with large and commodious 
buffes, fo that they could go out and continue fifhing in deep 
water, and cure their herrings on board, in the fame expedi- 
tious and careful manner that the Dutch do, this bufinefs 
might foon become much more advantageous to Great Bri- 
tain than at prefent, and our fifh become as faleable abroad 
as theirs ! And the weaker and more indifferent hands would, 
at fame time, find the better employment in continuing to

* The Meflrs Falls of Dunbar, were, for many years, the principal adventu- 
rers in the herring fifhery here : And from them, the Avoch men met with 
very good encouragement. Since the unfortunate failure of that old and re- 
fpectable houfe, the Northumberland or Beadnel Fifhing Company have 
taken up part of this bufinefs, in which an eftablifhed company, with a good 
capital, have a far better chance of fuccefs than fmall adventurers, who can- 
not afford to lay in a proper flock of fait and barrels, much lefs to keep them 
unufed in unfavourable feafons. At this ftacion, indeed, the herring fifhinjr, 
on the prefent plan, has been found, for fome years paft, to be but a preca- 
rious concern. One fuccefsful winter tempted many of the neighbouring 
fhopkeepers to embark in it : And thofe who did fo with borrowed money, 
have moftly become bankrupts fmce. To fecure the important national bene- 
fits of this trade, every reafonable encouragement fhould be given to both the 
fifhermen and curers. 

The filbing boats ufed here are of a fmall fize ; their keel being only 46 cr 
27 feet in length ; the mouth from 30 to 3a feet long, and 10 feet wide.— 
The depth isfo pioportioned to thefe dimenfions,a3 that they may fail well, and 
may carry, befide3 the crew and their fifhing tackle, 3 or 4 tons fafely. Six 
of thefe boats, wrought by feven men each, for the white fifhing, and two ©r 
three fmaller ones or yawls, occupied by old men and boys, belong to the 
place During the herring feafon, they fit out a good many more, as four 
men, with a boy to fleer, ferve this purpofe, and they then hire fome addi- 
tional hands from the country. When the feafon here proves fuccefsful, the 
fifhing boats of Nairn, Delnies, Campbeltown, and Petty, join them ; and 
fome likewife from Eafter Rofs, Cromarty, Rofemarky, Fortrofe, and Kef- 
fock ; fo that, even in this upper part of the Frith, 60 or 80 herring boats, 
containing above 300 men, may be feen at times, plying together on the fame 
flream. But fuch crowds are thought to be rather prejudicial to the bufinefe, 
in clear fhallow water like this, as the herrings often fuddenly difappear from 
them, and it is flrongly fufpeded, that a multitude of boats and nets tends 
to frighten them away. 

The quantity of canvas carried by the Avoch men, and fome others in this 
■neighbourhood, is very much difproportioned to the fmall fize and burden of

fquarc feet of cloth. And they carry aforcfailbtfidts.on a pole at the boat Item, 
of the fame obiong form, but only a tenth part of the fize of the other. 
Their fkill and alcrtnefs in fetting and reefing thofe fails, according to the 
wind and weather, and the courfe they mean to purfue, are wonderful. Se- 
veral gentlemen of the navy have cxprefied their furprize at this, and de- 
clared, that they have feldom feen common fifhermen carry fo great a propor- 
tion of fail, or manage it more dextroufly on any other part of the Britifh 
coafts. Yet there have been only four Avoch men drowned by their boats 
overfetting, fince the fifhery firft began here. But, as they continue gradually 
to enlarge thofe fails, without increafing the boars in proportion, it is to be 
feared that fuch accidents may become more frequent among them. For there 
is undoubtedly, a ne plus ultra in this, as in all other human attempts. 

In juftice to the active enterprifing fpirit of thofe honed men, we may add, 
that three of the Seatown crews having engaged in fpring 1791, to fifh for fe- 
veral months on the coafl of Northumberland, coafled it in their little open 
boats the whole way from Avoch to Beadncl, without either chart or com- 
pafs, and returned home in like manner, with no other accident, except fplit- 
ting one of their fails. A long voyage this for fo f:nall craft to undertake, 
if we confider the different windings of the coaft, which they muft neeeffa- 
rily follow ! What a pity, that fuch men have not been regularly taught na- 
vigation, nor got larger veffels to manage, for there is not a (ingle floop be 
longing to the place. 

The former inconvenience may now be obviated by the academy lately eiU- 
blifhcd at Fortrofe, which affords them an eafy and near opportunity of get- 
ting their children better inftrudted than heretofore. And if, along with this 
advantage, Providence be pleafed to favour them with three or four good 
fifhing years in fucceffion, it is more than probable that fome of the mere 
careful and fpiriteel young men may be pcrfuaded to unite and improve their 
gains, in fitting out two or three fmall buffes, or proper freighting flcops for 
this craft, of 50 or 60 tons each; which could occafionally be navigated by 
fewer hands than any of their prefent boats. Such floops might be employ, 
ed to good advantage every herring fcafon on the bounty ; and during the 
other months they would find abundant encouragement in carrying out car-

tended to raife the price of moft kinds of provifions here. Confidcring however 
the high rents now paid by the farmers, and the progreflive advance on every 
thing elfe, thofc prtfent rates, on the whole, cannot be reafonably complain* 
cd of, except by fuch pcrfons as have had narrow limited incomes, with no 
opportunity of imprewng them. One rteceffary article, fait, for home con- 
sumption, has, indeed, been uncommonly fcarce and high priced lor (one 
months, over all the north of Scotland ; but for this, it is boped, that the 
wifdom of Parliament will foon provide a remedy. And the late repeal of 
the duty on coals carried coaftways, though the advance on freight of fuch 
a bulky article, prevents the benefit being fo fenfihly felt at prefent, muft, 
when the war is over, be acknowledged a great relief, to a diftridt fo poorly

country. To promote and encourage fuch a fchtme, would unqueftionably 
be the intereft of both gentlemen and traders on both fides of this Frith ; as 
good feamen, having their home, or refidence of their families here, could 
(tettrit paribus) afford to ferve the neighbourhood on eafier terms than flran- 
gcrs : Befides that, a great part of the money, which thefe diftricli muft nc- 
■ceffarily pay for fuch freights, would thus remain and circulate at home. 
There is likevvife another impottant confideration, that cargoes would be cx- 
pofed to lefs hazard of lofs or damage, under the care of feamen fo well ac- 
quainted with moft of the different harbours, rocks and fend banks, in this 
long and tedious Frith. 

No lefs remarkable are the inhabitants of this thriving village in general, 
for their induftry and diligence. They manufa&amp;ure, of the bed materials 
they can procure, not only all their own fifhing apparatus, but alfo a grest 
quantity of herring and falmon nets yearly, for the ufe of other ftations in 
the North and Weft Highlands. From Monday morning to Saturday after- 
noon, the men feldom loiter at home 24 hours at a time, when the weather is 
at all favourable for going to fea. And the women and children, befides the 
care of their houfes, and the common operations of gathering and affixing 
bait, and of vending the fifh over all the neighbouring country, do a great deal 
of thofe manufactures. Some of their families alfo cultivate from a rood to 
half an acre of potatoes yearly for their own fupply ; and others, whofe 
children are more advanced, laifc and drefs, for the herring nets, a goodquan-

been as well attended to, and kept in as good repair, as in 
any pirt of Scotland, where turnpikes are not eftablifhed. 
At mod places, where highways meet or interfeft each o- 
ther, direction-polls have been fixed and kept up. In a 
country, where many of the inhabitants cannot fpeak to a 
itranger in Englifh, the importance of thefe is obvious. Part 
of one road here, 'twixt the Seatown of Avoch and Fortrofe, 
being liable to frequent incroachments of the fea, proves ex- 
ceedingly troublefome and expenfive. A lubftantial repair 
to that, and a few final 1 bridges, are the principal things of 
this nature now wanted in the diftriti. The county of Rofs, 
laft year, eftablilhed a commutation of the ftatute labour 
within their bounds, with a view, no doubt, to improve thofe: 
matters of police Pall farther, by hiring able hands with the mo- 
ney and keeping fteady furveyors. over them. The rates 
charged are is. 6d. yearly from each man, liable to the ftatute 
work ; and 2s. 6d. more from the tenants, for the ftrength 
of each plough. Thefe rates may be thought hard by fome 
poor people, who have little ready money tq command, and 
would rather give their work in the moderate way it ufed to 
be exacted. But every judicious farmer, or well employed 
mechanic, who confiders the importance of a long dimmer 
day for carrying on his own work or improvements at home,

can at making and baiting hooks, and mending nets, fo that, except for a 
few days about Chriftmas, or on the occalion of a fifticr's wedding, there arc 
none but little children idle in the whole Seatown. And this their induftry 
turns out to good account ; for they bring up and provide for their families 
decently in their fphere. They pay honeflly all the debes they contra&amp; ia 
the country, and, confulering the number of widows, and fatherlefs, and of 
Infirm and aged perfons among them, very few of this village, except In

will think it much more expedient to pay them. Whether 
this fchemc, however, on the whole, mail more efledually 
promote the public good than the former, the county will 
be better enabled to judge, after fome years experience. 

Language. — Although mod names of places, and many 
firnames of perfons here are evidently derived from the Gae- 
lic, the inhabitants, in general, of this arid the two neigh- 
bouring parifhes, of Rofemarky and Cromarty, underftand 
and ufe the Englifli language. They fpeak it alfo more 
purely, and with lefs of a provincial accent or drawl, than 
thofe of many fouthern counties in Scotland. Hence fome 
have fuppofed them to be the defcendents of a colony brought 
from fome diftant part of the kingdom, efpecially as the com- 
mon people in all the contiguous parifhes atound, fpeak molt- 
ly in Gaelic ; and two-thirds of them underftand no other 
tongue. Whereas, in this parifh, there are only fix or eight 
families unacquainted with the Englifli language, and three- 
fourths of the parifhioners ufe it in common. Nor has any 
Gaelic been preached in the church of Avoch fince the be- 
ginning of this century, although one or two of the minifters 
underftood it perfectly, and could deliver their fentiments in 
that language with fluency. The prevalence, however, of 
the Englifli language in this corner, may be more eafily ac- 
counted for, from the more frequent intercourfe of its inha- 
bitants by both fea and land, with thofe of the fouthern pro- 
vinces. 

The patronage of this parifh belongs to Mifs Brodie of 
Lethen. The ftipend, including an augmentation lately de- 
creed, confifts of fix chalders, part barley, part meal ; 46I.

The parochial fchool of Avoch is attended by about 50 
fcholars. The mafter's falary, payable by the heritors, is 
61. 13s. 4d. Sterling. His wages and emoluments, as feflion 
cleik and prefenter, may, communibus armis, amount to 3I. 
more. He teaches Englifli, Latin, Writing, Arithmetic, 
Book-keeping, and Church mufic. But the fees from his 
fcholars, as the tenantry in general are not able to afford 
much, will feldom exceed iol. Sterling. So that this office- 
is fcarcely worth 20I. a year. 

There is a fewing fchool for girls in the Kirktown, and

State of the Poor, &amp;c. — There are about 40 indigent per- 
fons now on the roll. The funds for their relief are the in- 
tereft of 33I. 6s. 8d. Sterling, bequeathed by the late Sir 
Kenneth M'Kenzie of Scatwell in the hands of his own fa- 
mily ; — the intereft of about 50I. more under the feffion's 
management ; and the public voluntary contributions in 
church : which laft, at an average of three years bygone, a- 
mounts to 81. lis. 4d, Sterling yearly. All thefe funds, how- 
ever, can afford but a fcanty help to each. 

A crew of the fifhermen having hecn accidentally drown- 
ed in 1 792, left feven widows and a good many dependents, 
fome of them in moft pitiable circumftances. One young 
girl, in particular, who, at 19 years of age, had been married 
only feven months before, was, by this unforfeen accident, 
bereaved at once of her hufhand ! her father ! her brother ! 
and was left big with child, and in debt ! On this melan- 
choly occafion, it was found necelfary to aflc fome charitable 
afliftance from other places. And a liberal fupply was ob- 
tained, adequate to their more immediate needs. For, be- 
iides what was collected within the bounds of this prefbytery, 
the following contributions from different quarters, moftly 
unfolicited, were remitted to the kirk feffion for relief of 
thofe unfortunate people, and have all been diftributed among 
them, viz.

The diftrefs of the widows having thus been mitigated, 
particularly until fuch of them as had been left pregnant were 
delivered, and nurfed their infants, they have almoft all now 
returned to proper habits of induftry, fufficient to fupport 
themfelves and their families. Such examples, it is hoped, 
will not be thought mifplaced in this record, becaufe they 
not only, in their meafure, do honour to human nature, but 
may tend to encourage others to " do likeivife" in ftmilar

The deficiency of crop 1 782 was feverely felt in this parifh,

Marriages, in this place, are generally conducted in the ftile of penny 
weddings. Little other fare is provided, except bread, alts, and whifby. The 
relatives, who affemble in the morning, are entertained with a dram and a 
drink gratis. But, after the ceremony is performed, every man pays for his 
drink. The. neighbours then convene in great numbers. A fiddler or two, 
with perhaps a boy to fcrape on an old violincello, are engaged. A barn ia 
alloted for the dancing; and the houfe for drinking. And thus, they make 
merry for two or three days, till Saturday night. On Sabbath, after return-

the Hon. Board of Truftces for fifheries, manufactures, and

weight of wet fifh a good many miles up the country. As the bay is flat, and 
no pier ha3 yet been built, fo that the boats mud often take ground a good 
way off from the fhore, thefe poiffardes have a peculiar cuftom of carrying 
out and in their hufbands on their backs, " to keep their men's feet dry," as 
they fay. They bring out, in like manner, all the fifh. and fifhing tackled,

Antiquhits. — The foundations ftill remain of a large old 
caftle or Fortalice, on the top a little hill near Caftletown- 
point, about 200 feet above the level of the fea. This mount 
is called by fome, Onnondy hill : And tradition gives the 
name of Douglas Cajlle to the ruin. It covers an oblong

\ As to the country part of the parilh, though the farms are, in general, 
too highly rented, confidering the prefent mode of hufbandry here ; yet, if 
the heritors would be perfuaded to give their more active and bed (locked 
tenants, leafes for 38 years, or for 19 years and a life, at the prefent rents, 
with fome encouragement to inclofe their grounds and build better (readings ; 
and taking the the tenants bound to have always a third part of each farm, 
under grafs; and to keep their cattle at home during fummer, and to winter 
herd ; the face of the country would be improved, the example followed by 
others, the condition of the tenantry amended, and the prefent fecurity and 
future interefl of the landlords promoted. The more effectually to bring a* 
bout thofe fo dtfireable objects, thirlage (hould be abolifhed, by parcelling 
•ut the prefent rent of each miln proportionably upon the different Lrnis 
bound to it : and the ufe of lime and marie, under proper reftrictions, fliould 
be introduced and encouraged among the farmers. 

As the linen manufacture feems to be the mod agreeable, and bed adapt- 
ed to this parifh, a good lint mill, on the burn of Avoch, would both fave a 
great deal of valuable time which the inhabitants now fpend in dreffmg their 
flax by the ftock and hand method, and would tend much to promote the far- 
ther cultivation of it. Michinery for (hiking pot barley, could be included 
onder the fame roof at a fmall expence, and would probably be well employ- 
ed by both the country and the neighbouring towns. To thefe hints, we 
Ihall only add, that to fupprefs i" future the fwarm of unlicenfed tippling- 
hauies, and to have only four or five proper perfons, duly licenfed, for retail* 
ing whi(ky and beer, within this partfh, would be found productive of moft

3 good many apartments, which had been ftrongly built of 
coarfe red quarry ftone and lime, with a foffe on one fide, 
and the appearance of baftions towards another. From its 
peculiar fituation, and apparent ftrength of the works, it may 
have been eafily defended before the invention of artillery. 
There are feveral traces of old encampments on different 
moors in the parifh. A trench or row of large human bones 
was lately difcovered, a good way beyond the boundary of 
the prefent burying ground- And there are feveral long 
(tones in the church-yard, of a hard clofe texture, with an- 
tique figures of fpears, arrows, and flars, carved upon them 
in alto relievo. All thefe may be veftiges of the conflicts of 
the Northern Clans, or of defences againft the Danes, and 
other foreign invaders from this Frith. But no authentic hif- 
tory or tradition, worth mentioning, is now extant concern- 
ing them.
