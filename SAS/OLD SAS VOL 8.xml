{^County of Sutherland — Pre/bytery of Dornoeb — Synod of 
Sutherland and Caitbnefs.') 

By the Rev. Mr. JoHH B£TBtTN£.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Naffu. 

THE town and pariih of Dornoeb derive th^ir name from 
the Gaelic words Dom-Eicb^ which fignifies a borfe\ 
Jbtt or bo^s concerning which the current tradition is as fol« 
lows: About the year iaj9i t^e Danes and Norwegians^ hav- 
ing made a defcent on this coaft» were attacked by William, 
Thane or Earl of Sfutherland, a quarter of a mile to the eaft* 
ward of this town. Here the Daniih general was flain, and 
his army beaten, and forced to retire to their ikipsi which 
were not far diflant. The Thane of Sutherland greatly figna« 
lized himfelf upon this occaiion ; and appears, by his perfonal 
valour and exertion, to have contributed very much to deter« 
mine the fate of the day. While he fingled out the Daniih 
general, and gallantly fought his way onward, the Thane 
beiog, by fome accident, difarmed, felzed the leg of a horfe, 
which lay on the ground, and with that difpatchcd his ad«

verfary.' In honour rf this exploit, and of the weapon with 
which it was atchieved, this phce received the name oi Dom^ 
eicbf or Dornoch, as it is now called *• 

Situation^ Extent^ Surface^ Scfil^ CUf7ia^e^&amp;ic. — Dornoch is the 
prefbjtery feat ; and, alternately with Thurfo in Caithnefs, 
that of the fynod. The burgh of Tain, in Rofsfliire, flands 
on the fouth fide of the frith, dire6^1y oppofite to Dornoch ; 
and three computed miles to the weft ward of both, where the 
frith becomes pretty narrow, is the Meikle Ferry^ fo called in- 
con tradiftin ft ion to another arm of th6 fea, called the Little 
Ferry ^ On each fide of the former, there is a large boat for 
tranfporiing carriages, horfcs, and other cattle ; as alfo a yawl 
for the accommodation of foot paflengers ; but at the Little 
Ferry thefe arc found o© the caft fide only. At this ferry, 
four hands fexve \ and the fame number at each fide of the 
Meikle Ferry. Frequent complaints are heard of both ; an evil 
Hot peculiar to thefe ferries, nor likely to be remedied, until 
-tliopropv-rty and difpofal of fcch be vefted in the public, in- 
flead of private proprietors, whofe ehief ann,' naturally, is to 
•have as high a rent as poffible. This parifh extends 9 miles 
•fi-om E. to W. along the coaft of the frith of Dornoch | and 
»from S. to N. or N. W. about 15 meafured miles. It has a 
'confiderable extent of fea caaft, not only upon- the frith of 
'Dornoch, but alfo on that of the Little Ferry, which runs 
-about 4 juiles up the country on the eaft fide of* the parilhi, 
The Diores produce fhellfifh, particularly cockles andmufcles; 

but 

♦ TfiSs traaition is countenanced by the Urfe-Jb^^ which is ftill retained in the 
fiTTtts. of thchurgh. In mqjnory of the. fame event, a ftonc pillar was ereiftcd 
on the fpot, fuppQrting at the top a crofs, cncompafled by a' circle, which went 
lindc'r the name of the Ead^s Cr»fs. Standing on a fandy hillock, it was 
gradoalfy undermined by the winds : fcvcral years ago it tumbled down, and 
was.broko to pieces; at prcfcnt, only fcattered fragments of it remain.

bot yield little other benefit to the inhabitants. The fea- 
' ware is of little value. There is only one boat's crew of 
lifhermeny who are neither Ikilful nor adventurous : they are 
therefore wretchedly poor, and of little or no advantage to 
the place; while others from Murray and BanfF-fbire, catch 
fifli on this coad, and make money, by carrying away the 
oody haddocks, fcate, flounders, &amp;c. At the Little Ferry, 
•there is an excellent harbour, where ihips lie in perfed fecu« 
-rity, after having got over a bar, which runs acrofs the en- 
trance. At high water, veiTels of 509 tons burthen may 
enter here. At the ihore of Dornoch, too, fmall veflels lie 
in fafety, with tolerable weather, as well as near the Meikle 
Ferry ; but a formidable bar flretches from the eaftern point 
:of the coaft of }3ornoch, almoft quite over to the fouth fide 
of the frith, called (from their incefiant noife) the Gizzing 
Briggi* The banks forming this bar, are not, however, fo 
;lofely conncded, but ^hat velTels of confiderable burthen 
^perhaps 300 tons) may enter, under the dire£tion of a pilot. 
The fhores are flat and fandy, and the lands contiguous to 
•thena generally level ; but gradually elevated as they approach 
the hilly diftri£l$ to the north. The foil is fandy \ the pre- 
valence of that quality decreafing in proportion to the diflance 
from the ibore. The higher grounds in culture, partake of 
mofs ; of the clay kind, there is little in the parifh* The air 
here, is pure and falubrious, if we except the immediate 
vicinity of a large tnorafs, extending from the town of Dor* 
noch upwards of two miles to the weflward, and lying along 
the county road. This has been a common. Some years ago, 
a fcbeme of divifion was formed, under the authority of the 
Court of Seffion : It was accordingly divided among the pr6« 
prietors of the adjacent lands, and march ftones fet up ; but 
llillit lies undrained, and a nuifance, as before. Soine feeble

attempts have been made towards culture at the weftem €&amp;« 
tremity of it. 

River^ Laiesp Animals^ Minerals^ &amp;c. — Befides the coin^ 
mon domeftic animals, foxes, badgers, pole-cats, hares, otters, 
and rabbits, are found in this pari/h ; alfo eagles, hawks, 
jnuirfowl, woodcocks, partridges, plovers and fnipes. The % 
river of Evelicks, which falls into the fea near the Meikle 
Ferry, affords a few falmon and trouts. The hilly part of 
the parifli contains 3 or 4 fmall lakes, in which a variety of 
trouts are found. The largeil of thefe lakes may be about a 
mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad. One of them 
produces a fine red trout, which weighs from 4 pound to i^ 
pound. The pariih is not deilitute of common (lone quarries* 
At Embo there is one of free.ftone. There is no natural 
wood of any value. A great quantity of Mofs Fir is found 
under ground: It ferves for light to the poorer fort ; and logs 
are fometimes dug up, which are ufed even in building. This 
fort of timber is remarkably durable. At both the SUbos 
there are thriving plantations of jfr, though of no great extent. 
At Evelicks, fome -appearances of coa/ have been obferved ; 
and about a mile ^to the N. W. of Dornoch is found a very 
rich clay. It is extremely hard to dig ; the pick muft go be« 
fore the fpade : It remains hard after expofare to the air ; 
yet a very ihort carriage makes it run to the codiftency of 
fitcb. When ufed in building, it takes an equal quantity of 
fand. 

jigAculture and Produce. — The crops raifed here, are 
oats, bear, peafe, potatoes, and fome beans and rye. About the 
year 1758, potatoes became a principal article of provifion 
here. Now, they ferve as the chief fubfiftence of the people 
^tiring a third part of the y^r ; with many for one half^ and 

with

with fomc even fot two thirds of the year *. There arc no 
field turnips cohivated here ; and fcarce any fowo grafs raifed^ 
^xc^ept in two or three places, the feats of men of property ; 
ivhich are alfo the only inclofures in the parifh. Henccp 
the arable ground is» for the greater part, in conilapt tillage. 
It is therefore po won4ery that it yields poor crops, in return 
for jnupH labour and expence* lime is little known here, as a 
manure* The bene^t of it is not underflgod : nor could it 
indeed be procured but at a heavy ejcpence ; for though ther^ 
are (hells, the tenants cannot afford to burn them. Towards 
the Ihore, the prevailing crops are hear and peafe\ in the 
more inland farms, oati ; and of the laft, different kinds of 
white, and of fmall black oats are ufed, according to the va- 
rious qualities and circumfiances of the foiU The people find 
that great qats quickly degenerate in poor land ; and while 
they admit that this is the more fruitful grain, ftill they con- 
tend, that the other is, on the whole, more produftive, as be« 
' ing more numerous^ ^and yielding more firaw. The average 
returns of bear, may be from 5 to 6 ; of oats and peafe, 
from 3 to 4. The two laft are fown in April, and reaped, 
the peq/if in the end of Auguft, and the qatt in September. 
The bear is fown In May, and ripe in Auguft. After a good 
crop of potatoes, barley, without any additional manure, is 
expected, on the coaft ; but no oats, or very bad, after the 
biarley, which is fucceeded by peafe ; and the following feafon, 
the land is manured and fown with bear again. In the inland 
parts, oats are fown after potatoes. Some farms yield three 
pr more crops of oats in fucceffion ; but the fandy foil along

* Many poor families, who rent no land, are accommodated by others with 
a fpot for this nfeful root, for the fake of the dung, foot, or aihes which 
they lay upon it; and this, while it contributes eflentially to the fubfifteoce of 
ihc poorer fort, is alfo the moft prevalent mode pra^ifcd here for improTin^ 
jgid meliorating the foil.

ihe coaft, produces not, in general, any' tolerable crop of 
that grain. FaiJowing is not praftifed here, except on the 
few inclofed farms already alluded to. Scarce any land is 
plowed in autumn, and but little in winter ; the prevailing 
opinion being, that early plowing or fowing, anfwers not 
with the light and open nature of the foil. Some fmall 
tenants, on the coaft, fow no bear till 'about the 20th 
of May ; and they are fatisfied if but three weeks intervene 
betwixt the firft and fecond plowings. In light foil, fiea/e 
arc fown before tilling, and then turned down by the plough j 
which feems to anfwer beil, as by that mode, the fcorching 
impreflions of the fun and wind are moft effeftually refifted, 
and a greater degree of moifture preferved around the feed, 
fiven bear is fometimes fown here in the fame manner. This 
is the moft extenfively cultivated parifli in the country, yet 
there is not an eight part of it in culture. It raifes not, in 
ordinary feafons, much more corn than is fufEcient for its in- 
habitants, including thofe of the burgh. More black cattle ^ 
liowever, are reared here, than the parilh requires for tli£ 
pnrpofes of meat and labour 3 but not fo many horfes as tlic 
]»eople employ. A few hogs are reared. In the lower parts 
!of the pariih there is little fheep pafture : in the hilly diftrifts, 
flocks of th^fe, and here and there, of goats, are kept ; but 
jftither confiderable. The ardour for fheep farming has hardly 
yet commenced here. The precife proportions of land, in cul- 
ture, pafture, &amp;c. is not afcertained. The quantity of pafture 
grounds has been coniiderably reduced or dellroyed: the 
former, by the gradual culture of fmall fcttlers ; and the 
latter, by the general practice of cutting feal and divot^ or 

turf*-

Heritors and jR^«/l^— The bcft arable ground is let at ao u 
per acre : This is chiefly inclofed, or in the vicinity of the 
burgh. Inferior ground lets at from 8 s. to las. andthe 
worft at 4 s. or even lower. The real rent may amount in all 
to about 1300 1, or 1400 1. Sterling. The Countefs of Suther* 
land is the principal proprietor \ befides whom there are four 
beritars, exclufive c^f the proprietors of fmall crofts contigu* 
ous to die burgh ; of the laft there are fix. None of the firft 
clafs refides conftantly, and but one has hitherto refided ooca* 
fionally in the parifli ; another has lately built, and 14 ecped6(( 
to fpend fome portion of his time here. 

Po/»&amp;rfo«.— Although the rcgifters have not been regular- 
ly kept here, it is univerfally believed, that the pcpalation' 
bas increafed within the laft 36 years very confiderably, to 
the extent, it is fuppofed, of at leaft j'oo. This increafe is 
not to be afcribed to any addition from trade or manufadures \ 
for except two whiUcy diftilleries, and fome Jlax fpun by the 
women, no branch of trade whatever is cultivated here. The 
increafed population can therefore only be accounted for from 
thefe caufes -, that the women j^re prolific, and that by the

fpoC, while evex7 cottage was built of feal, and that:hed with di^ot, he. ikrcaT* 
tically remarlved, that " though Sutherland was not dcllitute oi fiwa Qt grafts 
** the people chole to build their houfcs of the latter, and leave their cattle t^ 
** feed on the former !" This was fetting our management in a light abundantly 
Liughable ; yet, the poor people are not fo much to blame, as it was natural 
for this faccticiis ftranger to conceive. They arc, in general, very poor, and 
have but iinall holdings. They never eipcrienced the advantage of fubftantxal^ 
or the comfort of commodious dwellings; and did they fet a due value oi^rucli, 
they poflels not the means of conftniding them, and indeed h^ve little en*' 
conragement* for the undertaking. Small tenants have no leafes here ; little ioi* 
provement, tfaercfore^of any kind, can be expeded. In juflice to the proprietors*.

of providing for winter firing here, is peculiarlj injuriotM^ 
to health. During the feafon, in ^rhich the poor people 
are employed in carrying it out of the^ hills, they go to the 
xnofs, or fo far in their way to^yards it in the evening ; Ke 
out in the open air all night, and load their horfes in the 
morning. The great diflance, badnefs of the roads, weak* 
nefs of their' horfes, and fcantin^fs of pafture, impofe thia cm* 
el neceiDty. There is no cart road to the mofs, peat and turf 
being carried by means of an aukward apparatus, on the backs 
of fmall, half-flarved horfes. In one or two diftrifis of the 
parifli, the people begin to fee the abfurdity of this pradice, 
^nd have a&amp;ually made fome attempts towards a better 
within the laft two years \ but nothing like a competent road 
h^s yet been executed. 

Roads and Bridges. — ^Nature has In&amp;de the public roads here 
paffable : they owe little to induftry or police ; the ftatute 
labour has occafionally been exa£ted, but it has not been 
applied with that conftancy and vigour, which would ren- 
der It efficient. A commutation of it appears to be now in 
contemplation, among the proprietors of this and fome other 
fiorthcm counties. This parifli is deftitute of bridges; the 
want of one is particularly felt at the river of Evelicks, 
tvhich is often not paffable in winter. A piece of ground, 
in the vicinity of Dornoch, is f^id to have been deftined by a 
former public fpirited proprietor, for the purpofe of uphold- 
ing a bridge on this river, and to have been left by him, uii^. 
der the adminiftration of the proprietor of a neighbouring eftate.

Ecclejiajical State. — ^There arc no feiElaries here, at lead 
CIO avowed feceders from the eftabliihed church ; one man 
only, who is not a native of the pariih, declines joining in the 
public religious fervices. The ftipend is 80 bolls of bear, 
and 700 merks Scotch, including communion elements. The 
glebe is confiderably under the legal ftandard. The manfe 
was built about 16 years ago, but was never fubftantially ex- 
ecuted, or properly finilhed, and therefore (lands in need of 
repairs. Three aifles of the ancient cathedral, form the pre-* 
fent church ; the fourth has been long in ruins. The church 
has undergone different repairs, and at a confiderable expence.

leen eredted over it to the memory of the lad Earl and Countefs of Suther-

within ten days of each other, at Bath, and were buried in one grave in the 
church at Holyrood-houfe, annx) 1766. His Lordihip had only attained the age 
of 31, and her Ladyfhip that of 26 years. T^is amiable pair were not iefs en- 
nobled by their fliining virtues, ^than by their high rank. Their humane dif- 
pofitionsand condefcending manners had greatly endeared them to all orders of 
ibciety. No wonder, then, that their untimely death was deeply felt, and uni- 
^erfally deplored. The monument bears the following infcription, borrowed 
^m David's affcdlippate lamentation over Saul and Jonatban :

Language. — The popular language Is the Gaelics from 
which alfo almoft all the names of the places are manifeftly 
derived. In that language, haille fignifies a town. Hence^ 
T^or-haille^ Kerr-laille^ Eun^baitte^ Skia^haille^* compounded 
of that word and others, fignifying, mounts rod, fowl^ wing ; 
anfwering to the figure, fituation, or other eircumftances of 
thefe places refpe&amp;ively. Some places in the vicinity of 
the cathedral, are denominated from the offices of thofe who 
formerly held them; as, Croit '« ^Ejptg, Auchintreafuricb^ 
jiuchintaunter ; u e, the biJbop\ treafurer^s and chanter's 
fields. One place, now modernized into Cyderball, was an* 
ciently, and ftill is, in the Gaelic, called Shierra* This, ac- 
cording to a Daniih gentleman, who lately vifited this place, 
fignifies in the language of his country, goat whey quarterfi. 

Chara^et.'-^ttx.y frauds and ofience9 againft fociety are 
prevalent here as well as elfewhere: little difingenuities^ 
pilferings, and wilful encroachments, are alfo committed ; but 
the more daring ahd atrocious crimes are rarely heard of in 
this parifh. The people here, cannot be called induflrious j 
but they are tenacious and frngalof what they get. If they 
can but live without much exerti6n, they are content to live 
fparingly ; and if they relax of their ufual parflmony at fairs 
and other occafional meetings,, they know how to make a- 
tnends by habitual economy and abflemioufneis. Upon the 
whole, they are a quiet, tradable fort of people, and nnder

ed with the fea-faring life, nor do the j difcover any great ar«

Propofed Improvfrnents, ^^Thek may be comprehended un« 
der a few heads, viz.«— the abolition of the partial, oppreilive^ 
and abfurd tax on coals i — the granting of proper leafes and o* 
ther liberal conditions from land*holders ; — the introduction of 
manufa&amp;ures,— and the eftablilhment of judicious arrangements 
for the employment and fupport of the poor. Peats and turf 
are carried from fo great a diftance, as to occupy the time of 
thofe who have horfes for the purpofe, during a confiderable 
portion of the fummer and autumn. This proves a ruinous 
burthen to the tenants, who are obliged, on that account, to 
keep many more horfes than the purpofes of agriculture re- 
quire ; and although the making of roada and the ufe of carts^ 
might in a good degree alleviate the evil, the remedy would 
be but partial, efpecially with regard to thofe who are lituat-* 
ed fartheft off from the hills* Of thefe, fuch as have £tvt 
horfes, or none, buy their firing at an extravagant rate iron! 
the others, and fometimes cannot procure it on any terms* A'

Viy manufaAurers fettled here, would (land, in this refped, in 
the like predicament. The poor, who cannot afford to buy, 
are in a miferable fitnation. They have to go a great waj 
tocoIle£k burdens of wbins^ broom^ \ic. ; nor does the drj dang 
that lies fcattered on the fields efcape them. To meliorate 
the condition at once of the land and of the tenants, it is tv\»- 
denty that fuch very ftnall poiTeffions as many of them have, 
ihoold not be permitted to exift. In the prefient ftate of the 
country, they would not furnifli a comfortable fabfiftence, if 
they had them for nothing. There are, indeed, fix large 
farms in the pariOi, from 30 1. to 90 1. Sterling, rent. There 
are alfo fome others, of competent fize, under the firft men- 
lioned fum : Bac m,any fmall tenants are crowded into one 
•poiTeiEon, and others fettled on fmall detached portions, a}« 
together inadequate to their fupport. Each of thefe has hia 
plough, however poorly provided of cattle ; it is but little 
fervice tbey are fit to perform, and that little they cannot do 
from the fmallnefs of their holdings. The granting of long leafes^ 
to poor people, in thefe circumftances, appears not advifable, 
becaufe they are not in a fituation to avail themfelves of them. 
Previous to leafes, it would, perhaps, be expedient to pro- 
vide otherwifc for the fnpernumerary tenants, that the reft 
might be fuitably accommodated : the aged (hould not be dif- 
turbed, but the younger fupernumeraries (manufadures being 
firft introduced) might, fome of them, be employed in thefe, 
and others in the fervice of the tenants* Many of the pre^ 
fent tenants would make a good exchange by this ; they 
would, as the hired fervaots of others, be better fed and 
clothed than they now are, and would at the fame time be 
.relieved from their prefent folicitude, and refponfibillty to the 
landlord. In fad, this is' very much the cafe now among the 
fmall tenants : the fervant lodges and fares in tvcrj refpeft as 
well as his employer ; the former receives his wages, while

the latter is, perhaps, unable to paj his reoti or to furmft 
cattle for his joke* Hereby, alfo, another difficultj under 
ivhich the country labours, would probably be removed, viz* 
the difficulty of procuring fervants ; This is, in a great mea- 
fure, owing to the endlels diriiion and fubdivifion of farms 
into trifling poi&amp;ilions, making almoft every man a mailer. 
An intelligent, adivt, wealthy farmer, from an improved 
country, fet down here and there, would exhibit an example, 
at pn«e inftrudive and aaimating. Such a maa^ entering a 
competent farm, with a long leafe and other fuitaUe eneou* 
xagements^ would ihew the people how to live, and how to 
acquire the means of Uving : Meanwhile, they having tlieir 
|K^efllons enlarged, aad acquiring the ikill, and adopting the 
praftice of fuch a man, would, as their circumftances» improv- 
cd, build, inclofe, &amp;c. and being firft taaght and enabled^ 
would, by and by, a&amp;rd the proprietor a fuitable rent. 
With regard to maaufa&amp;ures, .the country contains a fufficieaC 
number of inhabitants, and might forniih proper materials for 
them. The prices of labour and provifions are, comparatively 
fpeaking, moderate, though both have advanced confiderably of

mre extremely precarioas, and the whole procefs is fo tedious 
and lahoriotts, as now conduced, that little benefit is derived ' 
from it* To give maniifa&amp;ures, of any kiad, a fair chance 
of fuccefs here, a company, compofed of the proprietors of 
bnd, and profeffional men,(hould be formed : The latter ealj 
are fit to condufil: fnch bufinefe ; and without the proteftion^

have many ^ebvious and ferious difficulties Co contend with. 
No where can the poor be on a worfe footing than here. The 
principal heritors do not refide in the pariih, and therefore 
contribute nothing towards their fupport : Wandering from 
one pariih, and from one county to another, the moft needy 
ate often overlooked from ignorance of their real circumftan- 
ces, while on the other hand, impoftors and fturdy beggars 
abufe the generofity and credulity of the public. It is to be 
wiihed that ihc poor were univerfally confined to their owt&amp; 
parifhes ; that by aiTeflments upon heritors, tenants, and o* 
thers, in proportion to their feveral interefts, holdings, and 
circumftances, a certain provifion were made for their 
fubfifience; and that employment were furniflied them, 
fuitable to the meafures of ftren^th and ability, which they 
may be found ^o poQefs. This laft fug;ge(ls an additional ar- 
gument in favour of noamufaplures, «.as thereby the poor« 
at lead many of them, would be made to contribute fome- 
what to their own fupport, and the public burthens proper* 
tionaljy alleviated. UpQu fome fuch plan, the condition of 
the poor would be greatly improved, the public relieved from 
jnceilant teazing and frequent impoiition, and the burden fair*

THE ancient name of this parifh, as appears from a p^fT 
fage in Sir Richard Baker's Chronicle, was Ackfotth *, 
or Aiieforibe. In all modern writings it is ftyled Eckfoord 
and Eckford, the original derivation being from the Gaelic or 

Celtic, 

* * In the 13th yetr of King Henry the VIIY. and of Jamci V. of Scotland, 
■* Anno Domini X5aa, when the Duke of Albany was eftablifhed goTcmor of 
** Scotland, he approached the feathem borders with a^n army of 8000 men, 
" probably to obferve the motion of the Bngliih upon the confines of Scotland, 
" but made no invafion into England; while the Marquis of Dorfet, warden of 
■ the caft and middle marches, entered TMotdaU with a number of Englifh 
* forces, burnt all the towns and villages on every iide as he marched north- 
** ward, and amongft others Ackforth^ Grimflay, Sefsfoitbe manor, &amp;c.; and 
* upon Good Friday following withdrew back into England with his plunder^ 
*» amongft which were 4000 head of cattle.** 

Baker* s CbromcUfpage 259. Rk^atb*t Border Hi/ory^ page 515 in the note. 

Lord Dacres was next year appointed warden general of the borders of Eng- 
land oppoiite to Scotland. From the above quotation it would appear, that 
Ackforth, now ftyled Eckford, was at that period a place of lomc confequence \ 
but no other account can be found of its original date.

Celtic, the ancient language of the whole ifland* The origi« 
pal names of manj places in Scotland are ftill retained* with 
occafional alterations, probably introduced by the Dano^Salon 
dialed. It is {aid to figaify in the Gaelic the Horfe Ford. A 
-ford is commonly known to be a (hallow part of a river pro* 
per for paflage ; accordingly, at no great diftance from tha 
manfe, there is a very (afe ford acrofs the river Tiviot from 
S. to N. 

The extent of the parilh from N. to S. is fix miles and 3$- 
furlongs in length, and from £• to W. 4i miles in. breadth. 
It lies in the latitude of 53^ 32^ and longitude of 10^ 6' weft 
pf London, according to Mr. Stobie's map of the county^ 
publiihed in 1770 ; (69^ fiatute miles to a degree). The form 
is triangular, or nearly approaching to it* It is feparated bj 
Tiviot, oppofite to the church, from the barony of Ormiftcm* 
The water Kail runs through it from S. to N. and is emptied 
into Tiviot, a little to the eaft of the church. It is nearly at 
fn equal di&amp;ance of 4 j- miles from Jedburgh and Kelfo. 

Soilj Surface^ Climate and Difeafes. — ^Upon the banks of 
the river Tiviot (which runs from weft to eaft through the 
county, and empties itfelf into the Tweed at Keifo), the foil 
is generally light loam, rifing in gentle eminences fouthward. 
It has been originally covered with heath, but by proper cul- 
tivation, is now rendered green and fit for pafture. There 
are no remarkable hills in this diftrift, nQr any waftc lands, 
except Cavertoun Edge, which has been of late chiefly devoted 
to the annual horfe races ; although even fome part of that fpot 
is in cultivation. Part of Woodend Hill has been lately 
planted with firs, and within a few years will afford a beau- 
tiful landfcape. The air here is dry and falubrious. Seldom 
any epidemics^l difeafcs prevail, excepting the ague, which 

yi&amp;tai 



22 Statiftical Jlcctmnt 

vifits this neighbourhood in the fpriag, occafioned bj the moift 
exhalations from the fens, and the eafterly winds from the 
Cheviot Hills, at the diftance of a few miles fouthward. The 
people are in general health j ; but no inftances of remarkable 
longevity have occurred during the ineumbencj of the pre* 
fent minifter* 

Cultivation and Produce. — A confiderable change in the 
mode of agriculture has been introduced within thefe few 
years. The Englifli plough univerfally prevails, and % horfes 
inftead of 4 oxea and a horfies are now adopted. Raifing 
tamips, with the preparation for that crop, fuperfedes fummer 
fallowing entirely. They fucceed remarkably well in a dry 
and light foil through the whole country. Oats and bafley 
are the grains moft commonly fown. Wheat, however, is 
now more frequent than formerly, after fallow, turnips and 
potatoes ; which laft is much and juftly encouraged for family 
ufe, as well as for horfes, cattle and fwine. Peafe, by many 
judicious farmers, is not confidered as a profitable crop, fince 
broad clover and rye-gra£s have been introduced \ but they 
are continued to be fown in fmaUer quantities, to mix with 
barley, for the bread of labouring people and cottagers of all 
delcriptioDS. The raifing of hemp is dropt here ; but ^hat of 
lint is continued, although not in fuch quantities as formerly, 
both for family ufe and the public market. It is fold on an 
average at ix s. or izs.fer fiooe *• An early kind of oats

* That which grew at the Wefier Mofs was 1x1 the hlgheft repuution, for the 
bluifli caft which it acquired, from the quality of that ftagnated water in which 
it wai fteepcd. It fold at about Zj u or z6 s. the ibone. Bat fince that mo&amp; 
wai drained (for the purpofe of digging a feam of marie found there), it has loft 
that peculiar colonr which enhanced its value. Steeping lint in running water 
i$ found prejudicial to flax, defhnidive to fi(h in rivers, and otherwife a great 
nnliince„ and accordingly it under very fevere prohibitions bj the juiUces of 
pescc.

WaSy in 1776, introdaced bj Mr. James Church, tenant in 
Mofs-tower, on part of the Duke of Buccleugh's eftate in 
this pariih. He raifed them from 60 grains of Poliih oat9» 
vrbich he obtained from % friend, and planted in a corner of 
one of bis fields about the 14th of June that jear. Thetr 
produce turned out very confidexable. Thej have been fown 
on bis farm every year fince without degenerating. The foil 
inclines to gravel or light loam ; and bj experience thev are 
found to anfwer beft on dry land in good heart. Th^ ripen 
by a month earlier than common oats, although fown at the 
fame time aod upon the fame ground. They muft be cut 
down fooner, and not allowed to continue growing until per*. 
fedly ripe, as they are more eaiily fhaken than any other 
grain* They commonly yield between xi and la ^one of 
meal to the boll of oats, which in this country is 5 fulh or 
firlots for oats and barley, and 4 firlots for wheat, rye, and 
peafe ; fe that upon weighing a boll of thefe oats (including 
the weight of the fack), the whole amounted to 2&amp; ftone by 
the Kelfo ftandard. The reputation of thefe oats has increafed 
fo rapidly, that they are now generally ibwn in this country, 
as well as through moft other parts of Scotland, feveral partg 
of England, and they have even found their way acrods the 
Atlantic to America. The grain of every fort commonly 
fown here, is fufRcieot for the confumption of the inhabitants* 
Quantities are fold by fample in the weekly markets of Kelfo 
and Jedburgh, at the prices then current. * Horfes have of

late years advanced in price, cfpecially fUch as are fit for buf- 
bandrj and carting. Black cattle are generally of a good 
fize, being bred from large Englilh bulls. Althougb there are 
not any llock. farms, properly fo denominated, in the paiiih, 
■particular attention has been paid to the breed of (beep within 
thefe few years. Their wool is much finer, and conftquently 
is rifing in price, which is from 15 s. to 168. at an average 
per ftone. There are 16 lb. of 24 oz. to the pound in the 
ilone. Thefale has been very quick, and the demand dill con- 
tinues. The inclofing of land with hedge and ditch is now 
prevalent, and meets the inclination of the farmer, who finds 
his profit and convenience thereby. They allow their land- 
lords 

at 30 s. the boll nfed in tliis country ; barley from 15 s. to iSs. ; oats, rjs* j 
pcafe and rye at i6s. The demand from other pbces frequently makes a con- 
fiderable Mteration in (he market. Oatmeal is always fold by the flone weight, 
'tbe f;tme as butcher meat, the medium price about I s. 6d. 16 ftones to » boil ;

and upwards^ according to their zefpeiSlive abilities. Since the cultivation of

lords intereft for fach fums of money as may be neceiTary for 
inclofing. Every farm has feveral upon it, generally in a 
thriving condition. The rent is from 10 s. to 20 s, per acre. 
The numbers of tenants has of late years diminilhed by the 
union of feveral fmall polTeflions into one. But to carry oa 
the bilfinefs in thefe large farms, a greater number of fervants 
is required j fo that this has not had fo much influence in de« 
populating the parifli as might have been expef^ed. Accord- 
ing to the report of the molt judicious farmers, one half of 
their land is laid out in tillage, one four h in turnips, and the 
reft in paflure. buch fields as ar« fown with red or broad 
clover, and rye-grafs, for hay, continue in that date for one 
year, and then are plowed for other crops. 

Manure. — ^Two feams of marl, deeply impregnated with 
flicUs, were opened, about the year 1777, *^ Eckford Wetter 
Mofs, upon the Duke of Buccleugh's eftate, the upper one 
of about 8 feet thick, covered with 9 feet of mofs ; the feam 
bdow it 7 feet at an average, feparated from the other with a 
flratum of clay of 4 feet, without any other intermixture. 
The marl is found to fait a light foil, when well fpread 
on the furfice, in proportion of 60 or 70 bolls to the 
Englifh acre: a ftrong loam requires a larger quantity. 
All green crops, fuch as peafe, grafs, clover, &amp;c. receive be- 
nefit from it ; and when fpread on pafture ground, in the be- 
ginning of winter, and allowed to mellow by frofl, it proves 
of very great advantage to the enfuing crop. 1 he meafure 
for the boll is a cube, containing 8 cubic feet : it is fold to 
the Duke's tenants for 3 d., and to others for 4 d. ; at the dif* 
tance of 3 miles for a J d. ; at 5 miles, and all above that, for a d. 
the boll. Its excellent quality increafes the demand ; for it 
fully gratifies the moft fanguine expc&amp;nions of the farmer 
end imprever of land. Lime is alfo much ufed, and with 
great advantage, although tranfported from Northumberland,

at the diftance of upwards of 20 miles. A qnarry of lime^ 
ftone has lately been wrought at about half that diftance« 
The experiment has not as yet been fo extenfive as fully tq 
afcertain its excellence for the purpofe of hufbandry. The 
proprietor (by its demand) has been encouraged to ereft a 
draw kiln ; and as it feems to increafe, another kiln is pro* 
pofed to be built next feafon. 

Proprietors and Rent. — Property has not undergqne any 
confiderable change of late in this diftrid, excepting Marle^ 
field, purchafcd by the Marquis of Tuecddale from William 
Nilbet of Dirleton, Efq. along with the eftate of Grubbet. 
There are 8 heritors in all : Ouly one refides conilantly, and 
another occafionally during part of the fummer feafon. The 
valued rent of the diftri^ by the commiffioners of .fupply, 
anno 11^2^ is 11130 1. 13 s. 4d. Scotch. The prefent real 
rent is 3699 1. 4 s. x d. Sterlmg. 

Church — The prefent church was built about the year 
1663. It \tas completely repaired and new feated in 1774 
and i775f and is now rendered exceedingly convenient. The 
manfe was rebuilt in 1775* and is equally commodious. The 
o/Eces have been lately repaired. The glebe is ratlier ivoflX\^ 
even including the pafture gro\ind. Water for the family 
ufe is tranfported from the river Tiviot in a water carriage, 
there being no fpring in the immediate neighbourhood of the 
houfe. Of late, pump wells have been dug in the villages of 
Eckford, Wefter Mofs, and Mofs Tower, and fome other 
places, which fupply the inhabitants plentifully with that nc- 
ceflary article. The living confifls of 35 bolls 3 firlots z

every year, not having be^n commuted ; with a piece of 
muirland for the exclufive right of turf, which the minifter 
generally occupies yearly, at the diftance of above a mile* 
By the late additional expence of livings the prefent incum-' 
bent found it neceffaiy. to commence a procefs of augmenta- 
tion of ftipend before the Lords Commi (Boners for plantation 
of kirks and valuation of temds. Having met with no oppo- 
iition therein from his heritors, a decrett of modification was 
pronounced ; but as the procefs is not quite finifhed, the a-* 
mount of the augmentation cannot as yet be afcertained. 
The King is patron. Eckford, from ancient records, feems to 
have been a vicarage dependent upon the Abbey of Jedwortb, 
commonly called Jedburgh. 

Poor. — ^There are no parochial funds, or mortified money 
for the poor. Their maintenance arifes from afieffments every 
half year^ at what is called a pariih meeting for that purpofe ; ' 
the one half upon the heritors according to their valued rent, 
and the other half upon their tenants according to their prefent 
rents, refpeftively. The fum affelTed is levied by a colle&amp;or 
appointed for that purpofe, who is allowed, fome gratuity for 
making the caft, and levying the money. It is put into the 
hands of overfeers for the poor, who diitribute it to thofe per- 
fons admitted upon the roll of penfioners, according to the 
weekly allowance paid, which varies in proportion to the rifo 
and fall of grain* Ferfons claiming this charity, muft have 
refided in the pariih for 3 years, without interruption, before 
the application is made ; and they are required to fubfcribe a 
bond or deed of conveyance, bequeathing their effects to the 
heritors at their deceafe, as a check to prevent concealed pro^ 
perty, or alienating this charity, and to hinder the interfer- 
ence of relations in that event. Thefe effeds are feldom es« 
afted, and therefore turn out of fmall account to the pariih.

The funerals of fuch perfons are commonty ordered ta be dd^ 
frajed by the meeting. When difeafe or misfortune attacks 
any perfon, as during the high price of oatmeal in 178a, and 
proper application is made to the meeting for charity, what is 
called an interim fupply is granted. There ^re no begging 
poor in this diftrifl. The weekly coUeftions in the church, 
which are but fmall, are alfo applied to alleviate the wants of 
the mod needy as they occur* The number of paupers at 
laft inrolment was 24. 

5^ioo/.— There is a public fchool, and dwelling houfe for 
accommodating the fchoolmafter, kept in repair by the heri- 
tors ; the falary was lately augmented, and is at prefent 
81. 6 s.. 8 d. yearly. He has a fmall piece of grbund inclofed 
for a garden, contiguous to the houfe : his other emoluments 
are, 30 s. for coUe&amp;ing poor's rates yearly, fchool-fees 
for Engliih, i s. ; i s. 6 d. for writing, 2 s. 6 d ; for arithmetic, 
^^f' quarter each 5 for regiilration of each baptifm, 4 d. ; proi- 
clamation of a marriage, 1 s. ; eztra£t of a teftimonial for a 
fingle perfen, 4 d. ; for a family, 6 d. ; as clerk to the kirk 
feilion, I OS. yearly ; befides fome cafual articles. The num- 
ber of feholars is from 40 to jcf at an average ; but as the 
fchool is not centrical, being towards the weftern limits of the 
parifh, fcmie infirm perfons are generally employed to teach 
young childien at adiftance (in Caverton and Cefsford) the 
Xlngliih language, and the elementary principles of religion 
from the catechifm. They are furnifhed with a houfe gratis 
from the farmers, and fatisfied for their pains with what 
the parents can afford. 

Ji/tf/— The fuel commonly nfed in families is coals, whicli 
are brought from a diftance of about 20 miles, and feme from 
Northumberland. Although in fome parts of the county there 
is the appearance of fmall feamsi none of the trials hitherto 
nadebave fucceededi nor is it probable they willy without con^

fideraUe ezpence and perfeverance. The common people 
make ufe of turf, broom and furze  but thefe two laR have 
becsme fcarce, through cultivation of the land that formerly 
produced them. Feats are not plentiful, there being no mofTea 
but in places where the marl is got ; and this being nearly 
exhaufled, the poorer inhabitants muft fufier confiderablj very 
foon by the want of this article : and indeed the diftance from 
coal is one great reafon that maoufadures have not been 
eftablifiied in this country, though wool is in great abundance, 
and the neceflaries of life may be obtained for the mod part 
at moderate rates* 



Pofulation*''^The population in 1756 was about 890 fouk 
above the age of 8. It has often varied according to circum- 
fiances. An atcurate (late of baptifms cannot be obtained, 
as diifenters from the eftablifliment feldom order the names 
of their children to be engrofTed ; and the regifter of births, 
marriages and burials is not regularly kept, as the pariih 
clerk has no allowance for that purpofe. The dues to govern- 
ment for thefe are paid on the firft of O&amp;ober yearly ; of thefe 
he preferves a memorandum, and afterwards enters them on 
the records, according to which the annexed abftrafi* will 

fumilh fome idea of the population for ten years paft.

The gentlemen of the county have it in agitfitipn to form a

to crofs the Tiviot. A fubfcription for defraying the expence 
of a furvcy, to be taken by Mr, Whitworth, was lately fet on

and eaftward, in the neighbourhood of this place. The com- 
mittee appointed for condufting the canal, having abridged 
jhe former plan, appointed Mr. Whitworth tp furvey and 
give in an eftimate of their hft plan, which was reported to 
the meeting of the Michaelmas Head Court on the 14th of

sabeth and James VI. of Scotland, amif 15-0, the laird of Cefsford was made 
warden of the Scottifh middle marches * ; it became afterwards one of the titles 
of the noble family of Jio$ehirgh, which it fliU continues to be. Such was the (U

confequence of its lord, or fituation of his caftle. Thofe efpecially^ at a diftance 
from the feat of government, and therefore not under the awe of the law, when 
the predatory fyftem prevailed, found it neceflary for their habitations, and plar 
ces of reiidence, to be better defended againil the incurfions of the neighbouring 
plunderers. Cefsford cafile, therefore, being only at the diftance of 4 or 5 miles 
from the Englilh confines, was necefiarily rendered a place of fecurity ; and ac- 
cording tu tradition, there was afubterraneous vault for conce*aling both perfons 
and goods within its walls, to which acce(s was only got by one aperture, which 
was opened or ihut as feemed neceflary by a large (lone with an iron ring in it«

Mi/ceOanioes OifirvattoHs.^^At the diftance of a few yards 
from Cefsford Caftle, and to the N« W. of the veftige of the 
Moat, there ftands a venerable aih tree, called the Crow ?rr/, 
expanding its branches, and covering a eonfiderable furface 
with its ihade,! which, though very old, feems as yet in a 
healthy ftate. It meafures at the bafe 27 feet 8 inches round 
the girth ; at 6 feet upwards, 15 feet ; and at the clift where 
the branches (which are thick and ftrong) diverge and fpread, 
14 feet 6 inches ; fo that its dianieter, at an average, to the 
clift, is 5 leet, and is fuppofed to contain 300 feet of wood. 
This tree is of great antiquity, and has been often vifited and 
admired by the cUrious-— There are 3 com mills in the dif- 
trid, two of them on the Kail, the other on the Tiviot ; one 
of Khefe was lately rebuilt, and the machinery properly adapted 
for grinding oats, barley and wheat, and for making pot barley. 
—-There is a faw mill at Marlefield, on the Kail Water, where 
the planution of firs, fit for dales, paling and other purpofes, 
are prepscred, and meet with ready fale. There is alfo a fulling 
mill on the fame river. — In June laft, a neft of thofe camivor* 
ous birds, ufually called hooded crows^ was difcovered by a 
ihepherd on the banks of Kail. There were two young ones 
in it ; one of which was entirely wbite. By fome inattention 
it died j and its remains (lately in the incumbent's polTeilion), 
were tranfmitted to a certain virtuofo in Edinburgh, for pre« 
fervation in his mufaeum, where it may be feen. There are two 
quarries of good free done, one of them at prefent not occu- 
pied ; and a fort of grey (late taken from the bed of Kail, 
now difufed, being apt to dice, and at any Yate found too 
heavy for roofing.

<p>Origin of the Names. 

IN an account of sm expedition of Haco King of Nor- 
waj into Scotland, it is mentiooed« that on his waj 
to Rintjre, he touched at Gubej (now Gigha), where one 
of the priefts, in his train, died, and was buried with 
great pomp ; and that fome friars of a certain order at- 
tended the funeral with a pall. Gudey^ or Gud-ay^ is inter- 
preted *' the Ifland of God." In the Gaelic language thefe 
words, * the Ifland of Gigba^^^ are written EUean Gbia^ and 
pronounced Eilean Tia. God's Ifland is written, in Gaelic^ 
Eilean Dbia, and pronounced, as above, Eilean Tia, Now 
as both dbf and gb^ in this language, found like the con- 
fonant y in Engliih, people, without attending to the mean- 
ing, might take the inflefted cafe, Dbia^ as if it were Gbia^ 
of which the nominative is Gia^ as Dia is the nominative of 
the other word. This change might alfo have proceeded from 
religious coniiderations. Though men named, or pointed out, 
certain places as belonging to the Deitj, they never called fuch 
X^aces direftlj by his name. Thus Eilean Dbia^ or Goi's 
Ifland^ might with propriety be applied to a particular iiland 
confecrated to the Supreme Being \ but it would be reckoned 

both

both abfurd and impious to call it Dia^ u i. God. Therefore 
fuch people, while thej endeavour to keep the analogy of 
found, avoided, bj the change of a fingle letter» the charge 
of abfurdity and profanation. As to the letters gb^ now 
thrown into the middle of the word {Gigha)^ it is onlj done 
in imitationi of a particular provincial found, by which fome 
pronounce it Giga. The origin of Cara is unknown. 

Situation and Extent. — ^This parifii, confiding of two iflands, 
Gigha and Cara, forms a part of the iouthern diftriS of Ar-f 
gjlUhire, called Kin tyre, from which it is divided by a chan- 
nel 3i miles broad. It lies along the weft coail of that dif- 
tria, extending nearly from N. E. to S. W. The ifiand of 
Oighais about 7 Englifh miles in length, and 2; in breadth. 
Proprietors, Mr. M'Neill of Gigha, Mr. McNeill of Galhu 
choillie, and Mr. Stevenfon of Airdglamie. South of Gigha, 
at the diftance of li mile, lies the ifland of Cara, which ia 
near i mile long, and i mile broad. Both iflanda are low, 
having few hills, and thofe hardly fo high as the araUe land 
on the oppofite coaft of Kintyre. In both^ the foil is fertile, 
vegetation quick, and the air falubrious. 

' GlOHA. 

Appearance^ Soil^ and Coaft. — The eaft fide and both ends 
of Gigha, are for the moft part arable. The weft fide and 
middle, hilly, but mixed with arable land. The foil in ge«» 
neral is a rich loam, with a mixture, in fome places, of fand, 
mo(s or clay. The ihore, on the weft fide, is high, rocky 
and bold, except near both ends, where there are breakers at 
fome diftance from the land. On the eaft fide there are feve« 
ral points jutting into the fea, with a few funk rocks, which 
render the navigation in fome degree dangerous to ftran- 
gers, efpecially at night: In day-light the breakers over 

the 



of Gigba and Car a. 39 

the funk rocks are vifible. Between thefe points, arc feveral 
bays and creeks, where fmall veflels can be fafely moored. In 
the bay of Airdme'anifii, at the head of which is the church, 
there is good holding ground in 5 and 7 fathom water. Be- 
tween Gigha and Cara lies Gignlum, a fmall uninhabited 
ifland, with a range of breakers and large rocks running S. W, 
In the found between this ifland and Gigha, there is a good 
anchoring place for large vefTels, which may be conveniently 
moored on the Gigulum fide, by means of iron rings fixed in 
the rock. The entrance from the weft is between the above 
mentioned range of rocks and the ifland of Gigha, and from 
^e eaft between Gigolum and Gigha* 

Tides, Sea Ware^ Kelpy gtc— The tide runs north ; but 
there is no remarkable current near the coaft : nor is it eafy to 
afcertain at what rate of knots it runs, being a kind of eddy» 
that ftrikes o£F from the rapid current, which runs between 
the Mull of Kintyre and the Sound of Hay. It feldom rifes 
above 5f or 6 feel ; and that only with a north wind, or in 
calm water. With a fouth wind, there is hardly a foot of dif- 
ference between high and low water. Tliis is attended with 
difadvantages in repairing, loading and unloading large veflels* 
It alfo prevents the manufa&amp;uring of kelp to any great ex- 
tent; 7 tones, at an average, being the greateft quantity 
inade in a ieafon •. There is, however, fuch abundance of 
fea ware thrown afhore in ftormy weather, as fufliciently 
ferves the inhabitants for the purpofe of manuring their 
ground. Though fliell fand abounds in feveral parts of the 
ifland, it is never ufed as a manure, being attended with 

more 

* Sea ware has not hitherto heen cut annually, but at the end of every 5 
years. By gcttiog fo much time to grow, the ^aatity of kdp may be abovt

znore trouble than fea ware, and having failed the only time 
it was tried, owing to a millake in the quantity laid on, and 
the nature of the foil on which it was put. To people who 
are tenacious of old cuftoms, and averfe to deviate from the 
pra£lice of their ancefiors, the want of fucceds in fuch a cafe, 
is a more powerful argument againft it, than any thing that 
can be advanced in its favour : Therefore it is in vain to 
maintain, that this valuable kind of manure is preferable to 
wrack, or more permanent in its effeds. There are inexhauftible 
banks of another kind of fand, which is ufed in making win- 
dow glafs. It is white, very fine, and, when clofely exa- 
mined, the particles have a pellucid appearance. Specimens 
of the glafs were fent to the proprietor, from the glafs work at 
Pumbarton, where, in the courfe of three years, they got 
above 600 tons of this fand* The colour of the glals is 
greenifh.. 

Fijb and Fijbing Banim — Shell fi(h are found in great a* 
][)undance. They are of a large fize* and excellent quality, 
confiding of lobfters, crabs, cockles, and razor fifh (common* 
Jy called Jpout Jljb. About two leagues north of Gigha, 
there is a hfhing bank lying, N. E. and S. W., near 4 leagues 
in length. From the beginning of February to the end of 
March, the N. E. end of this bank is frequented by fine 
grey cod, weighing, when caught, from 6 to 16 lb. each ; 
befides fome ling, large haddocks, and a great number of 
fcate and dog fifh. From March till May the S. W. end is 
frequented by excellent red cod. This bank had been negleSed 
for 20 years, till Mr. M'Neill of Gigha, in 1788, fitted out 
I boat by way of trial. In 1789, 2 boats were employed, 
and every year fince, from 5 to 8. But their fuccefs has, by 
no mepns, been fuch as to encourage the people to perfevere ; 
owmg partly to the want of large &amp;iling boats, which woul^

fiih at 4 d. each cod ; but,haTing ufed debenture fait the flril )Eear, was obl'ged 
tP export the fiih to Ireland, where, after trying different markets, he was at

The bait ufed is the fifli of a large white wilk, called Busluei «r Dtg^wUt^ which

there is an excellenc tine of carriage road* finiflied balf«way 
to the north end of the tfland, which will foon be completed the 
whole length, to the great convenience of the inhabitants, who

inthettand. The ftatnte labour for making roads is converted 
into uKMiej at the rate of i s. 6d., or as. for each perfoa 
annaallj. Befides this fund, there is a QiiXling in the pound, va« 
lued rent, payable over the whole county, by an aft of Parlia- 
ment pafled in 1774 ; but the money thus raifed, goes to the 
great lines of road (particularly fpecified in that aft) on the 
main land ; and aa thefe are ftill incomplete, nothing of the 
money exigible by the aft of Parliament, can be applied to o^ 
dier places ; confequendy the road in Gigba has been carried 
on at the ezpence of the principal proprietor* Between 
Gigha and the oppofite coaft of Kintyre, there is a regular 
ferry and two boats* one in the ifland, and one on the main 
land. The diCsdvantage attending this ferxy, is, the want of 
m quay on the Kintyre fide, which is fo much expofed to 
the ftonu, that in winter it is not eafy to fave a boat^ 
etherwife than by drawing her up. To diis may be addecl 
atiother inconvenience, the want of a proper houfe to accom-

Black Cattle and Hor/es ^The ifland of Gigha was for- 
merly divided into 30 merks land, to eachof which 14 cows 
and 4 horfes were allowed : The fame proportion to the ifland 
of Cara, confiding of x merk land. According to this me* 
thod of calculation, the number is eafily afcertained.

Cara, - 1X14= 14, Cara, - 1X4= 4 

Cows in the parifliy - 434 Horfes in the parifli, - 1 14 

The prefent number, however, of black cattle and horfes far 
exceeds this calculation* The black cattle may be reckoned 
at leail ^ more. Some fat cows are commonly fent to market 
in the beginning of winter, and di*aw from 3I. 15 s. to 5 
guineas each. The number of black cattle, fmall and large* 
fold annually, will be about 120. Milk cows fell at 4 1. and 
^ 1. ; lean cows, in May, draw from 2 1. 10 s. to 3 1. ; heifers 
from 1 1. IDS. to al. las. 6d.; ftirks, or year-olds, from 
x6 s. to 1 1. I s. Horfes are bought at 3 1. 10 s. and 9 1., ac- 
cording to their age and fisLC. The number of horfes annual- 
ly bought muft be very fmall. As fome are yearly fold out 
of the ifland, it is probable that the number reared is fuffi« 
cient for the place.

found, that when thej are not kept by themfelves, they dege* 
nerate, and. prevent the improvement of black cattle ; a thing 
too much negleded formerly in this place. But bj this plan, 
it is not intended to banifli this ufefal animal from the ifland 
altogether. As there are ibme points of land, forming fo 
many peninfuke, which can be eafily inclofed, it is meant to 
keep a ceruin number of a good kind for the convenience of 
mutton, and the improvement of the finer kind of wool. At 
prefent the fmall highland kind of mutton fells at 7 s. 8 d., 
lamb at a s. 6 d. or 3 s. — A good many fwine are reared ; but 
the damage they^do among the pafture ground is greater than 
any advantage they bring. Till fuch time, therefore, as a 
proper method of confining and feeding them can be adopted, 
it were better to baftifii them altogether, which the proprietor 
means to do, uolefs they are kept in a hog fence. They arc 
fold at from 16 s. to 1 1. 4 s. A pig cods from z s. 6 d. to

This cave is open at the fide, which admits a good deal of 
light, and fronx the top dreams of clear water fall down. The 
fame kind of plants grow here as in the caves of Gigha. The 
N. E. end abounds with rabbits, where the foil is a mixture 
of ihells, fand, and earth. The reft of the ifland is mofly, and 
the greater part might be cultivated, but it is found more pro-

iioife of the rock falling wa heard, and the (hock fel^, in their houfes : That

Population* — All the inhabitants of both iflands are Pro- 
teftants of the eflabliflied church of Scotland. The majority 
of them are of the names of Galbreath and M*Neill. The 
former are reckoned the more ancient, and faid to have been 
originally a tall race of men. At prefent there is nothing 
uncommon in their ftature. Tradition fays, that there never 
was. an inflance of a ihipwreck where three of them were 
aboard. The Galbreatbs *, in the Gaelic language, are called 
Breatanuich^ or Clann a Bhreatanuicbj i. e. Britons^ or the 
Children of the Briton^ and were pnce reckoned a great nani^ 
p Scotland, according to the following lines :

Derrj ; on the W. the ifland of Ilaj and the main ocean ; and 
on the N. the iflands of Jura, Scarha, Dana, and the coaft of 
Knapdale, with the hills of Mull appearing behind. The 
pkafure ariling from this view is greatly heightened, by the 
number and variety of flups and fmall veiTels, which conflant- 
ly fail in difierent direftions, and at different, diilances. And 
in ftormy, dark weather, when deprived of this enchanting 
profpedl, the lols is amply made up to the admirer of nature,

CharaSer^-^Tht people are honeft and inoflfeufive, willing 
to oblige, and ready, by every exertion, to relieve the dillrefs 
of £ea£iring men. They are, upon the whole, in a thriving 
condition, content with their fituatlon, and greatly attached 
to their native country. The fuppreiOon o\ private ftills, 
(whicbareas unfriendly to the induilryand morals of a people, 
as they are pernicious to their health), has been attended with 
happy eSe&amp;s. They are now lefs addi&amp;ed to dram- drinking^ 
and more attentive to their bufineEs ; though (lil^ they are not 
fo induflrious as could be wilbed. This, however, is owing 
. to caafes, which it is not in their power wholly to remove. 

Dtfadvantagu*'-Jiiyi&amp;.oii of labour, which is the higheft 
improvement in fociety, has not yet been carried fuch a 
. length, as to entitle the people of Gigha to tlie charader of 
being indufirious. The farmer, accufiomed to a certain mode 
of labouring iox the fupport of his family, never attempts 
any greater exertion, while this objed is accompliihed. There 
. is no marl^t at handy where ready money can be ^ot for the 
produce of the ground 3 and therefore no incitement to raife

a greater quantity, than ferves for family confumption and pay-r 
ment of the rent. Thus, every perfon endeavours to fuppljF 
bimfelf ; and as he does not receive t^ady money for the pro- 
duce of his own labour, he cannot advance it for that of 
others. Hence he cannot apply hist whole attention to his 
own profeffion. One part of the day is employed about his 
farm ; another part allotted for the fifhlng, in order to fupply 
the immediate wants of the family. In like manner, the 
ihoemaker, fmith, taylor, and other handyprafrfmen, cannot 
beftow their whole time on their different profeffions. They 
have families to fupport ; and their employment is not fe 
conftant, or the returns for their labour fo punftual, a^ 
to enable them to devote their whole time to their refpec- 
tive lines of bufinefs. It is neceffary, therefore, to have a 
fpot of ground : this fpot muft be attended to ; and the 
pofleflbr thinks it more for his intereft to labour it himfelf, 
fhan to employ another. Befides, the filbing muft be attended 
to, as mentioned above ; for no man thinks of making a pro- 
feffion tA fijbing which is open to every one: And again, no. 
man will think of purchafing with money what any one can have 
by going for it. All thefe circumftances operate in preventing 
induftry and improvement. That this may not appear con- 
tradidory, it muft be obferved, that the time ufually fpent, 
every day, in the intervals between thefe different occupa- 
tions, is nearly equal to the adual time of labour; and 
therefore, though it cannot juftly be faid, that they are ad- 
dicted to idlenefs more than others, it may with propriety be 
affirmed, that they are not induftrious. In this fenfe, all the 
inhabitants of the Weftern Ifles, being in fimilar circumftan- 
ces, are chargeable with want of induftry. And people who 
are not well acquainted with their peculiar fituation, and who 
form an opinion of their charader, in this refped, by a eom« 
l^iarifpn with the inhabitants of the Low Country, may raflilj

conclude, that it is natural for tbem to be lazy and indoleiin 
But nothing can be more ^fair than to judge of them in 
this way, by a companion with people accuftomed all 
their life to a proper divifion of labour, and regular maxu 
kets for vending and purchafing the produce of their in- 
dnftry. Therefore, the reafons commonly ai&amp;gned for their 
inaftivity are quite erroneous. It is not a natural difpofition 
to be idle, but the want of encouragement and regular em- 
ployment, that checks the induftry of the Highlanders* It is 
well known, that, when habituated to any line of life, they 
fire found careful, aftive and enterprifing. 

Propo/ed Imfrovements.'^Wttt the labour and iaduftrjr of 
fuch a number of able men, as are in the Highlands and Iflaods 
of Scotland, properly direfled and encouraged, the efieASf 
would, in a Ihort time, be fepfibly felt by the nation at large* 
The mod valuable difcoveries might be made ; inezhauftible 
magazines sind materials for every branch of manufadnre 
might be found out ; and the exertions and inventions of a 
great part of the kingdom, which are now lying dormant, 
might, happily for themfelves and fociety, be thus brought 
into afiion* The moft efieaual means of bringbg about . 
fuch a change feems to be, the leflening and regulating die 
prefent duties on £dt and coals ; the ere&amp;ion of towns or 
villages j and opening canals. The attempts that have already 
been made in ere&amp;ing villages, will certainly be attended 
with good effeds ; and if the number were increafed, thefe 
good eSc&amp;s would be multiplied* By a canal through the

buUt a handfbme church in it, which he dedicated to the Vir*

firft introduced this breed of fheep into the countryi about 2Q

the diArid of country betwixt the Cheviot and Lammermuir- 
hills, whofe iheep ftock are very highly imprpved. The 
iheep of the low part of the country are all of this kind, and 
ure found the more profitable the oftener that they have beeu 
crofled by the befl breeds. The number of them, as well as of 
the horfes and black cattle, depends fo much upon the ilate.of 
the lands io different years, whether in com or in pafturage, 
that it is almoft impoflible to give an exad: account of them : 
In genera], there may be from 1500 to 2500 iheep in the pa« 
rifli. The flieep formerly in this country, called Muggt^ were 
a tender, Qow feeding ^imal, with wool over moft oi their 
faces, from whence the name of M^ggs, There is hardly an 
individual of this fpecies now to be met with io the neigh- 
bourhood. Mr. CuUey's kind of fheep, on the other hand, 
have open countenances, ^without any wool on the face from 
the ears forward, and are as kindly feeders as the others are 
flow ones. They are neither long bodied, nor long legged, 
but well made, handfome flieep, deep in their chefl, broad at 
their flioulders, loins, and crops, which lad are. thrown well 
back ; ^nd they are deep and broad of their breafl:s, which are 
well feen before ; and iland on well proportioned, clean, fmall

(fiouttiy and Prejkyttry of Lanark — Synod of Glafgow and 

Air.) 

By tie Rev. Mr. William M'Cubsik.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE account of it given by Mr. Hume of Godfctoft, is, 
that in the reign of Solvathius king of Scotland, about 
the year 767, one Donald Bain (i. e. the white or fair), afpired 
after the crown, gave the king battle, and bad almoft gained 
the vidorj, when a certain nobleman, with his fcms and fol- 
lowersy came to the king's aid, and behaved with fuch courage 
and refolution, that Donald's armj was defeated, and he him- 
felf flain. The king, anxious to know to whom he was fo 
much indebted, and the nobleman being prefent, one of hi» 
lieutenants, pointing to him with his finger, faid, Sboito 
Dugkijffif f. e. ** Behold yonder black grey man." Upon 
which the king gave him much land, and the furname of 
Douglas, which his pofterity ilill retain ; and from him too, ' 
the parifh, as well as the town, caftle and river, derive their 
names. Others fay, that the river Douglas, which runs 
through the parifh, gives name to the town and the noble 
family to whom the pariih belongs. The name is doubtlefs 
of Gaelic original, and fignifies B'iaci Water ^ which is an ex« 
ceeding proper appellation for the river, as it is black, having 
its fource and all its fupplies from amofly country*. 

I SituatiotTf 

* There are other ftreams in Scotland, diftiogoUhed by the name of Boi^hi, 



bf Douglas. ff 

Situation^ Extent^ Soil and Climate, — ^The extent of tfat 
parilh is confiderable, being about 1 2 miles long, and in fotne 
places from 4 to 6, in others from 6 to 7 broad. The pari&amp;* 
is fituatedy about 40 miles from the fea, everj waj. The foil 
is variable, except the holms, which being a new foil formed 
hj the river, is pretty uniform ; but the ground on either 
fide is very fpouty, occasioned in fome places bj the outbudfs 
of the coal and other minerals ; but in mod places bj the 
bottom being a cold wet till. The lands ire moftlj laid out 
in fheep farms. In the ftrath, and along the banks of the 
river, there are feveral arable farms ; but the lands occupied 
in this manner, bear fmall proportion, to what are laid out in 
iheep walks. Their pafture is hillj, though not very hig)i ; 
and is both green and heathy. The air is very moift, particu* 
larly in fpring and autumn. The winds generally blow im- 
petuoufly about the time of the equinox, and frequently ia 
autumn ihake a deal of com. They blow moftly from the 
S. W., which bemg the diredion of the river, and the banks 
high on each fide, what would be accounted a moderate breeze 
in other places, is here often a kind of hurricane. It is how« 
ever a very healthy place ; and there are in it many inftances 
of longevity. Many have exceeded 80 and 90 during the 
incumbency of the prefent minifier. There are a men in the 
parifli at prefent aged 92 ; and it is well authenticated, that a 
man died here, in the beginning of this century, aged at lead 
zio, having lived during a part of 3 centuries. 

Woods and Rivers. — ^Thcre is very little natural wood itf 
this pariih, and that only a kind of bruih. The aih appears 
to have been the favourite tree of our anceftors. At many 
of the old farm fieads, there are large afli trees ; and at the 
Caftle of Douglas there is a row of very aged ones, which/ 
tradition iays, were ufed in barbarous times for hanging their

enemiesy the Englifli. There is alfo fome planting aboul it. 
of a later date*. Lord Douglas, upwards of 20 years ago, 
planted about 300 acres : and within thefe laft zo or it jears, 
above 800 acres more, with oaks, elms, beech, planes, afiieS| 
and firs of different kinds ; which Sn a few years will have a 
fine effed to beautify and ihelter this part of the country. 
Some hundred acres more are yet to be planted to complete 
the plan. The mod confiderable river in the pariih is Dou- 
glas, which takes its rife at the foot of Cairn Table, 9 miles 
above the town, and runs into the Clyde about 7 miles below 
it. There arc 3 fmaller waters in the upper part of the pa- 
xiOi, which all run into Douglas ; namely, Glefpine, Kinnocks, 
mnd Monks. All thefe waters abound with excellent trout $ 
and in fome parts of the water of Douglas there are very fine 
pike. 

Minerals. — This parifli abounds in coal, which will be iri^ 
exhauftiblc for many centuries. There are many different 
feams from 2 to 7 feet in height. The decline of the mine- 
xals is various. At the march with the parifh of Carmichael, 
about I of 3 ; li a mile to the weftward, i of 2 ; and a little 
snore weft, z of if. The ftretch of the coal is nearly paral- 
lei to the courfe of the river, which runs from S. W. to N. 
£. The moft remarkable circumftance, that attends thefe 
coals, is, their being interfe&amp;ed with a great number of fteps, 
which throw the coal down from 30 to 50 feet perpendicular. 
Thefe Heps are from 60 to 200 yards feparate, and lie nearly 
parallel. They crofs tbe ftretch of the coals in a diredion 
nearly weft. Coal is the principal fuel here. As one tackf- 
man rents the coal both in this eftate, and in the eftate of 
Carmichael, the property of the Earl of Hyndford (through 
which eftate the fame feams of coal ftretcb), the demand fro mi 
cither of the works is very irregular and uncertain, being re-

Agriculture and Produce. ^^-Odits are the prevailing and al«' 
moft only grain fo wn here ; the moft extenfive farmers notfow- 
ing more than 3 or 4 acres of bear, with from 2 to 3 of early 
jgrey peafe, and fome potatoes. It is not owing to prejudice, but 
neceffity, that the people have adopted this mode of farming ; 
long experience having ftiewn them, that oats are the crop 
that can be moft depended on. And indeed, fuch is the feve- 
rity of the feafons in this country, that very frequently th'^ 
bear and peafe are deftroyed by the froft before they come to 
maturity: And though oats are a more hardy grain, they are 
fiidted in their growth by the cold, and, in particular late fea«' 
fons, rendered in a great manner ufelefs, both for man and 
beaft. In the year 1782, there was not a boll of tolerable 
oat-meal produced in the pariih. There was neither bear 
nor peafe } and the oat-meal was little better than the duft of 
pd^er years, and very little of it. Great quantities of white

called barley oats^ has been introduced by fome farmers ; but 
^is grain is very liable to (bed, or ibake, before it. is ripe,

lity tb^n the Tweedd^de -, and ftraw is the principal fodder for 
horfet and cattle here. The greatqft part of this paciih feems 
better adapted for grazing than tillage, and would probably 
turn out to greater advantage that way ; for fervants wages 
are greatly advanced \ and the return in corn being fo very

THIS diftri&amp;y formed anciently a part of the panib of 
Drummelzier, but was erefied into a diiUnfi pariih ia 
zi!43. It is about 9 miles in length, and in many places as 
much in breadth* It is a hillj country, with fome fiats and 
snorafles. A number of the hills are very beautifuly being co« 
Tered with grafs to the very tops ; others have a mixture of 
beath ; fome are of a great height, particularly Hartfield and 
Bvoadlaw, which are about 1800 feet above the level of the 
fea. The river Tweed has its fource at the fouth-weft ex*. 
tremity of the pariih, and runs through it in a north eaft di- 
reftioo* It is joined by the waters of Core, Fruid, and TaU 
la, ^befides feveral fmaller bums or rivulets, all of which 
abound with trouts. 

Cultivation and Prtf/&amp;^^.— The arable parts of the parifli 
product eats, barley, &amp;c. upon a light loam, with gravel and 
fand at the bottom ; but, owing to the great rams, and early 
frofts, the crops are very precarious ; indeed the whole of the 
parifh is by nature principally adapted for pafiure. The 
mutton fed upon the heathy hills and flats, is remarkable for

of England, are particolarlj fond of the Twecdfmuir breed of 
flieep ; they buy them of all ages, and drive them to thetf^ 
farms, where they are much efteemed, being healthy and good 
tfarivers* A number' of the young flieep are fold at the Lin*- 
ton markets, in the month of June, to be driven to the OchiL 
and Alva hills, and other places in the Highlands of Scotland 9 
a number of lambs, ydd ibeep, and draught ewes, are fold to 
the butcher, and help to fupply the markets of Edinburgh, 
Glafgow, &amp;c. The flieep farmers, commonly called. ilore- 
mafters, begin to fmear their fheep abont the middle of Oc

proted the animal agaioft the bclemency of the weather. 
This operation, no doubt, leflens the value of the wool, but it

mer, and lately fold at 6 s. and 68. 6 d. per ftone: a great

into coarfie cloth for family ufe, and fome is fpun into yam, 
and fold in that ftate. Several attempts have been made to

Englifli breed of flieep, from thofe belonging to Mr. Bake*

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1002111">KILMARTIN</name>. 

{County and Synod qf ArgyU-^PrtJbyUry of Inverary,) 

By the Rev. Mr. Hugh Campbell.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Narne^ 

REMOTE^ Highland parifbes, diftant from the feenes of 
great and memorable e'^nts, backward in moft kinds 
of improvements, particulariy in agriculture, and without trade 
or manufaftures, cannot be expe&amp;ed to furnifli much matter 
for ftatiftical inquirj. — The name of this pari(b is, and has 
been Kilmartin, as far back as either record or tradition caa 
trace it. It is fuppofed to have been given, in memory of 
feme reputed faint, in a diftant period of Chriftianitj. Such 
etymologies of names,, particularly thofe of ancient burial 
places, which were generally places of worlhip, are not un* 
common. In this country, fuch places were called Ki/Is* 
Kilmartin was therefore the burial- place of St. Martin, and 
probably alfo his refidence. 

Extent^ Surface^ SoU^ Climate^ \3^. — The form of the pa- 
riih is oblong, running from S. W. to N. E. Its length is 
from z I to 12 miles, and its greateft breadth about 3 miles. 
The appearance of the country in the lower, or 3. W. end of 

the 



tf Kilmartin. 91 

the pariih, is rather hilly than mouatainoiis, with arable and 
paftare groonds intermixed. Soaie of the hills being covered 
with green, and others with ihort heath, are confidered as 
good paftare for cattle. The upper or N. £. end is much 
higher land, more adapted to pailure than tillage, (though it 
contains a coniiderable extent of arable ground), and, till of 
late, has been occupied as fucb. The foil in the lower end is 
rather light, yet fertile, producing what are here confidered 
as good crops. In the upper end it is deeper, yet the land 
being high and cold, the grain is late in ripening and ill fill* 
cd. The yaUey, from the church of Kilmartin, to Lochow, is 
one of the moft beautiful in the Highlands. The rocks co* 
Tered on each fide with trees to their fummits, form a pic« 
turefque aj^earance ; and the luxuriance of the wood fliews 
that planting of every fort would thrive welL The cli- 
mate does not differ much from other parts of the country ; 
but although wet, is not unhealthy. Agues ^re feldom 
known, nor are there any pulmonary complaints^ Fevers, of 
the low and nervous fort, are found amongft the lower clafs« 
arifing from want of cleanlinefs, and from a poor diet. The 
foil is fertile, and yields good crops of barley. There is a 
large traft of mofs near Crinan, which is very improveable; 
and the proprietor, Mr. Malcolm of Pohalloch, much to his 
credit, intends, it is laid, to let it out in fmall portions to 
tenants, for improving it, which will be of great ufe, both by 
increafing population, and by fetting an example, worthy to 
be followed, in other parts of the country. 

Laketf ^r.-— The only confiderable lake in this parifii is 
Lochon^, a part of which forms a boundary between it and 
Glafrie to the N. £. for about 6 miles. The whole lake is 
computed to be 24 miles in length ; but it is not broad in 

Ma any 



9 2 Stati/iical Account 

any part. It abounds with tronts and falmon. The fifliing, to 
a certain extent^ is the property of an heritor of this parilh. 
There is a pecular fpecies of fi(h in it, called black trouts^ 
which are fliort and thick, black in the ikin, and red in the 
fiOi. The incumbent has feen one of them that weighed i61b. 
and when cut up, two fmall trouts were taken out of it 
entire, one of them meafuring 12 inches, the other. lo. 
This ii(hing, however, has not hitherto been fo very produc* 
tive, as to make it an objeft worthy of much public notice. 

Sea Coqft and ttjb* — The extent of coaft will be from 7 to 
8 miles, nearly S. and N., formed by an arm of the fea, 
called Loch Craignilh. The fea, by which the fouth part of 
this pariih and North Knapdale is bounded to the W. and 
N. W., is formed into a ftrait by the Ifland of Jura, which 
divides it from the Weftern Ocean. The fliorc is, for 
the moil part, high and rocky, except the Bay of Crinan, and 
the end of Lgch Craignilb, (which are fine flat fand), and a few 
other fmaller creeks. 

There is a fpecies of fifli taken on this coaft, which goes 
by the general name of Grey fifli. They are of different 
lizes, mod of them much larger than herrings. They are 
generally caught in the evening and morning, with rods and 
lines, but not in great quantities ; though they are very ufe« 
ful, contributing not only to the fupport of thofe, who refide 
within a mile or two of the coaft, during the fummer, which 
is the fcareeft feafon, but affording them alfo light in the win- 
ter by their oil.— -There arelikewife in the Bay of Crinan, cod, 
ling, turbot, foles, &amp;c. in great abundance^ but the people 
are not ikilful in catching them— Herrings are frequently 
taken in Loch Craig nifli and Loch Crinan, though not to any 
great extent \ alfo the fineft oyfters that are any where to be 
found, and in great plenty, Jn the former, about 6 years 

ago, 



of Kilmartin. 53 

ago, there were about 500 1. worth of herrings caught, by from 
20 to 30 boats, in the courfe of 4 or 5 weeks, (though moft of 
them were ill provided with nets or ikilful hands), and fold 
in the country, at from 10 d. to i s. the hundred. They gene- 
rally appear upon the coaft from July to Auguft. The other 
fea animals, are, feals, peltocks, otters, and fome fmall whales, 
that come to the coaft in purfuit of the herrings* 

The fea weed, ufefiil for manure, and driven afliore by the 
ftorms, is a fort of long grafs, called fea grafs ; it is generally 
ufed for potatoes ; and when laid on in large quantities, gives 
middling crops of that root. There is alfo a weed, called 
tangle^ fometimes made into kelp, which is a richer manure, 
and, when moderately laid on, and not often Repeated, (with- 
out a mixture of fome cooling (luff, to correft the hotfcalding 
nature of it), is found to give good crops of bear. The kelp, 
is not fo confiderable, as might be expefted from the extent of 

fhore, for it produces only from 10 to 12 tons yearly. The 

courfe of the tides, upon the fliore and adjacent fea, is pretty 
much from N. to S.,' and the reverfe. The coaft of this jpa- 
riih does not lie in the courfe of vefTels ; but the excellent

and they are frequently detained in this harbour, for feveral weeks, waiting for 
a fair wind to take them round the Mull of Kintyre. By a fnrvey recently 
made, it has been found pradicable, to make a navigable canal for large fea- 
bttilt veifels, from this to Jjoch Gilp, which is only 5 tniles acrofs. And Mr. 
Reanie, an eminent engineer, who furveyed it, is of opinion, that it maybe 
made, at a very moderate expence, and with plenty of water for boats and 
barges, as well as large veflels. It is hardly poflible to ezprefs the aftonifliing

harbours for coafting veilels. — The lower end of this pariih*9 
npoB the Bay of Crinan, and contiguous to the place of the 
propofed canal, is confidered by many as a proper fituation 
for a village, there being fooae arable land, with a great ex- 
tent of low flat mo(s coming to the ihore, which might not 
only fumiih convenient fuel, but could be eafily improved 
by drainbgt and with the advantage of ihell iand» which is in 

great 

the people of t^ part of the kingdom. It will not only enable the inhahittnti, 
to avoid entirely the vciy dangerous pafTage round the MuU of Kintyre, but, 
hj afibrding a ready market for all the produdions of the Weftem Ifles, it will 
invite the people to purfue a variety of kinds of indufby, to vrhich they have 
hitherto been ftrangers. Above all, it will enable them to fapply themlclvet 
irith ialt and coaU ; and if the duty were taken off the laft, and rock lalt allow- 
«d to be imported, the people in thefe countries would be as happy as they are 
BOW miferable, and they would be under no temptation of leaving their native 
Ibily to try their fortunes in America.— A fubfcription is fct on foot for this in»- 
yortant purpofe ; and there is little doubt, that, from the fpirited exertions now 
SMiking, a fufficient fum will he raifed. And, when the great magnitude of the 
trade is confidered, there is reafon to believe, that it will repay the fubfcribers 
▼ery liberally for the iiuns they may advance. If that ihould take place, a 
communication for boats, could be made from thence to Lochow, which is only 
5 miles difbant, and would open an extenfive and fertile country of near %% miles, 
and be of great advanuge, to the Unded property, of that part of the county of

been very produftive. The fiih, are generally (old in the

Population. — There are no records, by which the ftate of 
this pariih, with regard to population, can be traced rery far 
back ; the general belief is, that it has decreafed between 70 
and 80 fouls within thefe laft 20 years*. — The increafe how- 
ever within thefe 40 years is confiderable. The prefent num- 
ber of fouls (all of whom refide in the country), is as follows :

• What has aflfcAcdthe population moft, within that period, is, the laying oot 
fome lands entirely in pafture ; 2 or 3 farms being now thrown into the hands 
of one grazier, which were formerly polTcfled, fome by 4, and fome by 8 tenanta 
each, but are now the relldence only of a herd or two : And at the end of the 
leaTes, which are very (hort in this country, (being only from 5 to 7 years with 
the lower order of tenants), fuch farms as are adapted to it are,ahnoft always, 
laid oot in paflure. This has not operated, however, fo much again ft popabtion 
in general, as againft a particular dais of the inhabicants. It reduces the number 
of the tenants, but it adds to that of the cottagers, as they are often kept, upon 
fome of the farms, that are laid out in pafture. But although this may in part make 
up the deficiency in population, brought on by this mode of occupying lands; 
yet, upon the whole, it is found, that there has been fome decreafe in the num^r 
ber of inhabitants ilncc the commenccmect of it, or within thcfc ao years.

Climate and Difea/es — The climate is rather rainy ; yet 
the inhahltants depend more upon temperance and exercife, 
than phyfic, for health. There are none of the faculty there- 
fore in the parifh, though fome refide at no great diflance. 
There are no dedrudive epidemical diilempers, but the fmall- 
pox and meaffes. The danger of the former is nearly done 
away by inoculation (which is. become pretty general here), 
and that danger would be flill lefs, if the lower people paid more

fall 16wer. llicrc may be about zo young lads, who hire themfclves for the 
north fifhing yearly, and return lo the parifh when it is over ; there being no 
■vcffeN from this place at that fifhing. 

Bctt^ een io and 25 years ago, at different periods, about 40 families of 
tenants have been deprived of tfieir- poffcllions by a number of large farms be- 
iag laid out Into pafttA-e. By tbe common calculation, this would diminiih the 
population ^out.aoo. But^'upon many of the farms, fome of the former poi^ 
fclTors are retained as cotters, and. others are put in, to preferve the houfes, or 
iiggiagst as they are called, in cafe it might be found necelTary, at fome future 
p5rio«J, to rptwn to the former mode of occupying the farms by fmall tenants,

Sons. There is another complaint vrhich prevails among 
children, and generally thofe about 12 years of age and

particularly dangerous, when it attacks very young children. 
It is generally very lingering. The continuance and fe verity 
of it, may confiderably depend, upon the feafon of the year 
when it comes on.

Cultivation and Produce. — There is no general furvey of 
this parilh; though a few of the heritors have got their eftates 
xneafured^ yet neither the arable, nor the paflure ground, is laid 
out by meafure. The arable land is divided into in^Jield and out' 
Jield'f the in-field into three equal parts; in one of thefe theire is 
bear, in another oats, and the third is moftly in potatoes. Next 
year, the bear follows the potatoes, oats the former bear, and

is continued from year to jear ^ the manure being generally 
lime, and the dung the cattle makes in winter. The out* 
field, is allowed 'to lie lej, or in pa0ure, for % years, and the 
milk cattle and (heep are folded upon it : Then there are 2 
running crops of oats, and fometimes 3, taken of it, and the

property has taken place within thefe 4 years ; and there has 
been nearly the fame proportion with regard to the rife of 
rent in the reft of the pafture and arable land. The great 
demand for black cattle, and the flieep ftocks, brought theex- 
tenfive hill land (the greateft part of which is covered with 
heath), into repute, which, about 40 years ago, and- even af^ 
ter that period, was very low rented, as of little value to 
cither poffeffor or proprietor. On this property, there is about 
600 1. faid to be laid out in ftone dikes. The rent of cot 
houfcs, the only kind that are let, will be from 10 s. to 15 s., 
without cither grafs or potatoe land: The fervices arc la 
days with their viftuals ; but there being few refiding heri- 
tors, thefe fervices are moftly commuted to both cotters and 
tenants, the cotters for 6 d. per day, the tenants for i s.j they 
being ftill, however, liable for fervices with horfes. 

Stock and Produce* — As to the average value of the live 
ftock, it is not eafy afcertained with any great accuracy, the 
knowing ones, in that way, differing in opinion ; yet, at a me- 
dium, it may be from 4 1. to 4 1. 10 s. the cow, of 3 years old

The church was built in the year 1601. The walls are ilrong, 
but the plan is incommodious. It is a long narrow ftripe, 
and has had no reparation or improvement fince it was built^

which the condition of real obje&amp;s might be rendered more

Village^ Fuel:, Wr— There afe no villages, except Kilmar- 
tin, which is the place of worfliip, and other parochial meet* 
ings. It has a commodious inn, fituated upon the great road 
from the fouth end of Kintyre, by Tarbert and Lochgilp, and 
leading to Fort William, by Craignifli and Lorn. It has 3 
markets in the year, i for black cattle, and 2 for horfes, where 
the country people gather from 15 to 20 miles round, with 
webs of linen and woollen clothes, and fuch fmall parcels of 
lint, as can be fpared from their families. Although fituated 
upon the coaft *, there are few feafaring people, as there is 
no trade to employ them. The harbour behind Ilan da-vain, 
and below Duntroon Cafile, has good anchorage, and fafe from 
all winds, with eafy accefs to veffels of any burden. — The

they were got off without any £tfther damage, but the lofs of a little time, and

endeavour to make their own ; but when they are, the ordi- 
nary price is from 20 d. to 2 s. the cart, according to the time 
they are bought, in harveft or fpring. The cart may fur« 
nifli I fire, to an ordinary family, for 5 or 6 days. 

CbaraSfer^ i^r.-^The people, in general, are of a middling 
fize, fquat, and pretty ftrong made, though not very remarkable 
for extraordinary ftrcngth. They are from jf feet to 5 feet 10 
inches, few of them 6 feet. In general, they are difpofed to induf- 
try, if it were properly diredted. They are little attached to a 
military life ; but when induced to enter into the fervice, 
they have turned out good foldiers, and become even fond of 
the profcffian. The few gentry here, live genteelly, without 
being extravagant. The other clafs of the inhabitants, are 
economids from necefCty ; their only luxury being a little 
whiiky occafionally, which excites fome mirth and glee. 
Their general charaAer, however, is fobriety. They com- 
plain of a difficulty in making up their rents, and confequent- 
ly, they muft pinch themfelves in fome of the comforts, or 
even neceflaries, of life ; yet, upon the whole, they feem 
cheerful and contented. 

Di/advaniages.^^The writer of this article will not prc 
fume to fay, whether the rent of farms here, may or noay not 
be too high ; but he will venture to afTert, that the proprietors 
of arable farms, do not put them in that condition, which 
would enable the tenant to make the mod of them. They are 
indeed generally inclofed, as to their limits or boundaries with 
the neighbouring farms, but all within, is one great open. 
The leafes given, being only from 7 to 9 years, and fome 
even ihorter, are confidered as a difcouragement to improve- 
ment. Few of the fmall tenants of arable farms here, can af- 
ford 



of Kilmartin. 107 

ford to lay out much money upon their farms ; but even if 
any of them (hould have the fpirit, to lay out part of their 
time and labour, in improving a piece of land, which other- 
wife might be of little value, from the profped of advan- 
tage to themfelvesy though not immediate, upon looking for- 
ward, he is difcouraged, as he finds his leafe, before he had 
time to put his £arm in order, drawing near an end ; and thus 
the fruit of his labour, from which he might have any return 
himCelf, is to be conveyed to another, for a trifle of more rent* 
For 2 or 3 years, therefore} before the end of the leafe, the tenant 
does nothing but what brings an immediate return. The leafe 
being fo fhort, makes the return of thefe periods frequent, 
which muft hurt the farms confiderably, and confequently 
the proprietors themfelves, ultimately. Another circum* 
ftance, which is confidered as un£sivourable to improvement, 
is, the crouding many tenants upon one farm ; 4, 6, and 8. 
It is well known, that no work, under the 'management o£ 
many, where every one claims an equal ihare in the direction, 
can go fmoothly on. Different opinions may occafion fome 
obflxu£Uon, efpecially if any thing, out of the common trad, 
is to be done« By this obfervation, it is not meant to put 
the farms into fewer hands $ but to divide them, and for the 
xnoft part to have but one on each poffeiBon ; and when they 
happen to be larger, two. This would bring on a confiderable 
outlay; yet might form a fource of more fure income to the pro- 
prietor, and greater comfort to the tenant. This divifion has 
been found v^rj ufeful in other parts of Argyll-fhire«

This parifli, and indeed the whole of the country, is hap-

of Scotland. Here, all are of the Eftabliflied Church.

during theCe 30 years, who have emigrated to North America. 
Some young men and women, go yearly to ferve in the Low 
Country, merely in expeftation of higher wages, though 
they generally return within a year or two. A coniiderable 
number, particularly of the cotter clafs, go to the harveft ; 
fome as far as the Lothians. Three families, this year, have 
gone to the cotton work, and fome others fpeak of following 
them, though it feems to be with reludance, as they confider 
the employment to be rather unfavourable to health, having 
formerly led an afiive life. — The language commonly fpoken, 
is the Gaelic, which is the native tongue, though the Englifli is

clafs of tenants cannot afford to indulge in. — ^The wages of a

other work in that way, is from i s. to 14 d. ; taylors, 8 d.

fome fpinning and knitting, in the intervals of labour by bro*

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q758625">AUCHTERTOUL</name>. 

{County and Synod ^f Fife — Pre/by tery of Kirkcaldy.) 
By tie Rev. Mr. John Sgott.</head> 



<p>Name^ Extent and ProfpeB. 



AUCHTER is faid to be an Erfe word, fignifying a height ; 
and toulj or tool^ feems to be a corruption of 7^^ /, the name 
bj which a fmall ftream of water, that rifes in the pariih, and 
runs into the fea toward the eaft, is diftinguiflied. Thus 
Auchtertool feems to fignify the heights, or higher grounds 
upon the TeeL The parifh is about 2 miles in length, and z 
mile in breadth. There is a fmall village in the parifh, and 
the church is fituated about half an Englifh mile to the weft 
cf it. The ground about the church and manfe is elevated 
and commanding, and takes in a fine view of the fea to the 
eaft, as far as the eye can reach, comprehending in it, the 
Ifls of May, the Bafs, North-Berwick Law, and a point of 
the Lothian coaft, which ftretches a confiderable way into the 
fea. 

Sttrfact and SoiL — The forface of the ground is very an« 
equal, and varied with eminences and little hills, which caufes 
a confiderable difference in the nature and quality of the foil ; 
the land being light and thin towards the tops of the rifing 

grounds^ 



of AucbttrtQul. Ill 

grounds, and richer and deeper as you defcend. The foil is 
light* free and open ; and fuch parts of it, as have a warm 
fouthem expofure, are of a good quality : But the ground to- 
ward the N. W. end of the pariih, is of a worfe nature, 
being a four, wet, clayey foil, and better fitted for pafture 
than for cultivation. A few acres, in the neighbourhood, are 
covered with heath,, and a few are foft and marfiiy. Thefe laft 
have occafionally been burnt, and for 2 or 3 years afterwards 
produced good crops ; but they are not of fuch a quality as 
to render them fit for the purpofes of general cultivation, or 
produAive for any length of time. Several of the faces and 
tops of the hills and rifing grounds, are interfperfed and cover- 
ed with whins, which render them not only unfit for cultiva- 
tion, but of a trifling value even for pafture. If thefe were 
inclofed an4 planted, they would both ferve to give a warmth 
and ihelter to the neighbouring ground (things very much 
wanted in this climate), and tend greatly to improve and 
beautify the face of the country, by giving it a more romantic 
and pifturefque appearance. Some gentlvmen, in the neigh- 
bourhood, are beginning to plant a little on their eftates. The 
plan, however, is making but a flow progrefs. 

Miis^ri/r.— There are both free-ftone and lime-flone in 'the 
pariih ; but none of them are wrought. The tenants, how- 
ever, have liberty from the Earl of Moray, the proprietor, 
to ufe as much of the lime-ftone as they pleafe, for manure 
to their lands ; a circumftance which is of material advantage 
to them. The ground is moftly inclofed, partly with fione 
dikes, and partly with hedges. 

Climate and Lake. — ^The pariih of Auchtertoul, is about 5 
miles diftant from tl^ ihore to the eaft, and 4 to the fottth. 
In confequence ot this fituation, the air is reckoned good and 

3 healthy ; 



A I

healthy ; being oeltber fo near the fea, as to render it too 
thin and penetrating, nor at fo great a diftance from it, as to 
render it thick and unwholefomp. There is onljr one foiali 
lake in the parifli (Camilla Loch), in which there are feme 
perch. The lake takes its naoae from the old houfe of Ca- 
milla*, adjacent to it; which was fo called after one of the 
Counteiles of Moray, whofe name was Campbell. 

Population. — ^With refpeft to the ancient ftatc of the popu^ 
lation, it cannot be exadll j afcertained. But from the regiiler 
of marriages and baptifms, which extends as far back as the 
year 1675, compared with the regifters that are k«pt at pre- 
fent, it appears to have been formerly confiderably more po- 
pulous than it is now. This feems owing to the pradice o£ 
uniting farms, which has taken place here, as well as in many 
other parts of the country. What ufed formerly to be 2 or 3 
farms, is now thrown into i, and rented by the fame tenant; 
fo that the number of families in the pariih, is thereby de* 
creafed ; and as there is no trade or manufactures carried on 
in the village, to draw the people in from the country, the 
population is confiderably diminiijied. Since 1755, that di- 
minution has amounted to 55, the population, at prefent, being 
334, and according to Dr. Webfter's return, having been 389 
fouls. This taile for enlarging ^d uniting farms, which

* Its ancient name was Hailyardi, when it belonged to the family of the 
Skenes. It is faid to have been the rendezvous of the Fife lairds at the rebellion 
in the year 1 715. When James Vth of Scotland was on his road to the 
palace of Falkland, after the defeat of his army on the £n glifli border, under 
the command of Oliver binclair, his favourite, he lodged all night in the hcufe 
of Hallyards, as he palled, where he was courteoufly received by the Lady of 
Grange, ** ant a/ificnt andgodlie matrone^* as Knox calls her. It feems then to 
have belonged to the Kirkcaldies of Grange, a family of conHdeiablc note in the 
hiftory of Scotland. It is now a ruin.

fetms to be on the iiicreafe throughout Scotland^ will perhaps, 
^veDtualljy be unfavourable x6 the population of the country, 
fthd moil undoubtedly to the perfotial chara£ier and morals of 
its inhabitailts. It forced the people from the a^live, healthy 
employments of a country life, to take refuge iii maniifa&amp;ur. 
ing towns and pdpuloiis citie^, which may literally be faid to 
be the graves of this human fpecies. It is accordingly ob« 
ierved, of towns in gehetal, and 6i large manufaduring towns 
ih particular; that the iilhabitants are of a more fickly and 
delicate appearance, thah their neighbours in the country. 
This may arife from the op'eration of various caiifes. From 
fhe fed^ntary life, tb which they are accuftomed, which en- 
ervates and enfeebles the cdnftitution ; from the impure and 
tmwholefome air, which they are coiiftantly breathing ; and 
above all, froifa the habits of diffipation and profligacy, which 
are always tbd certainly conttaAed, id any great concourfe of 
people. And; as it is ftom tbwiis like thefe, that oiir armies 
and navies ate mbfily fupplied With recruits, it is eafy tb fee. 
How ill fitted, men; of fuch a dfcfcription and mode of life, will, 
iti time, become for defending the liberties and deareft rights 
of their fellow citizens, ilnd enduring the watchings, the 
dangers sliid the toils, which are ihcid^nt td the profeffions of 
the foldier and the failcir. It Was the lame body of men, that, 
on the banks of the Thrafymenui^ and the Aujidus^ humbled 
the pride 6f the Rbman eagle, and empurpled the £eld with 
patrician blood, who were afterwards routed on the plains of 
Zama^ though ftill fighting under a leader the foremoft in the 
i^brld, whofe very name was alindft fufiicient to fecure him 
of vidory. But the luxuries of Saguntujn^ ajccording to the 
Roman hiflorian*, had enervated and enfeebled the victorious 
Carthaginians, and rendered them an unequal match for the 
hardy Romans, over whom they had fo often triumphed.

Evils like thefe, may not indeed be very fcnfibly perceived 
or felt, for a confiderable time : But, though their operation 
may be flow, yet it will not, on that atcount, be the lefs ccr* 
tain ; nor the lefs to be dreaded in its tendency and confe- 
quences, as an accelerator of national weaknefs and decline. 
But in our ardour to extend our manufa£lures and our com- 
merce, and thereby to multiply the delicacies and luxuries of 
life, as well as to increafe our tafte and deiirc for the ufe af 
them, we perhaps but too readily forget, that human nature 
is but too liable to temptation and corruption, and that infirmity 
of body, and depravity of mind, are, fooner or later, the al- 
mod certain confequences of every great aflemblage of our 
fpecies. We perhaps but too readily forget, that the profpe- 
rity, the (lability, and the glory of nations, do not confift fo 
much in the wealthy — no, nor even in the numbers^ of their 
inhabitants — as in their political, their military, and their 
perfonal charader and virtues ; — as in the penetration and the 
depth of mind, which they are able to difplay, in difcovering 
where their true intereds lie \ in the promptitude and the 
ardour, with ii^hich they are, at all times, prepared to guard 
and to defend their rights ; and in the pradlice of thofe private 
and public virtues, which are alike conducive to the welfare 
and fiability of kingdoms, and the perfeftion and aggrandife- 
ment of the fpecies.

from (hefe, that the greateft part of our weavers receive their employment; and 
it is this, which draws in fo many of them to fettle in the village. A great 
part of the women too, who refidc in the villagej are employed in fpinning

There is one thrcftiing machine lately erefted.^-The ftile of 
farming is, in general, carried on after the new plan of huf- 
bandrj, and is much improved of late years. This feems 
chiefly owing to the introduftion of fown grafs, cabbage and 
turnips* The former ferves to give reft and folidity to the 
ibil, and prepares it for the produftion of future crops ; the 
latter cleanfes and pulverifes it, and opens it to receive the 
influences of the fun and air, the great ^uickeners apd fofter- 
ers of vegetation, Th$ hay, thps ]:aifed, is fold, at an ave- 
rage, about 4 4» per ftone, and brings a good profit to the 
farmer* Cattle are brought into the houfe, fome time be- 
tween Michaelmas and Martinmas, and fed on turnips for fe- 
veral months, when they are fold tp the butcher, about the 
end of winter, or beginning of fpring. This pradice, inde* 
pendent of th^ advantage, which the ground receives, by pre- 
paring it for the turpips and cabbage, togi^ther ij^ith the weed«- 
ing and hoeing which art afterwards given it, and independ- 
ent of what profit is tQ b(^ made of the cattle, which are fome- 
times bought cheap, and fold dear, gives, moreover, a great 
command of dung to enrich the reft of the land; a circum- 
ftance of capital importance to the country farmer, who can- 
not find manure to buy ; ^and which is, of itfelf, perhaps^ 
fuiBcient to recomipend the feeding of (»ttle, although few 
pther advantages attended it. 

The land is generally plowed with a horfes ; except where 
it is wet or fteep, when 3 are ufed. But there is a divifion 
of opinion as to the ufe of the new and the old plough ; fom;

mifled or convnlfed, by defigning and fcditious men y if the 
■nk and tlie fall of kingdoms, have, in all ages, been chiefly 
produced by moral caufes ; and if the morals, the opinions, 
and the behaviour of men, be intimately conneded with the 
inftruAions they receive, and the principles they imbibe, 
during their early years ;•— if thefe things be fo, the inftruc«- 
tioQ and education of youth ought certainly to be reckoned a 
inatter of primary concern, in every well regulated date ; 
more efpecially by thofe, who lit at the helm of government, 
and are entrufled with the management of public affairs. But 
how is it pofCble, that the purpofes of public indruflion 
ibould be properly attained, in the prefent fituation of many 
of our fchoohnafters, with refpe£l to falaries and appoint- 
snents ? Is it in truth to be expefted^ that any perfon, who 
haa been at the ezpence of an education, fufBcient to qualify 
him for being a teacher and inftruftor of youth, ihould be- 
take himfelf to that irkfome and laborious profef&amp;on, when 
the emoluments are fo poor, (in country pariflies efpecially, 
vihtTt the fchool wages are fmall, and there is no opportunity 
of raifing a large fchool), as to be inferior to the wages of a 
day labourer, or a common fervant ? The time will certainly 
oome, when the eyes of the nation will be opened to their 
own heft interefts, as well as to thofe of their fellow creatures; 
and this ufeful body of men will be placed in circumfiances, 
more likely to enfure the great ends of education, and public 
inftruAioo, both to individuals, and the community.

Mifcellaneous Obfervations* — ^The parifli is fupplied with 
coals from the neighbouring parilh of Auchterderran : The 
diftance maj be from 2 to 3 miles. The price is 18 d. for as 
many as 2 horfes can eafilj draw on a cart ; and the (ame 
fum for driving them home* — There is x public road goes 
through the parifh from £. to W. It is kept in repair by the 
ilatute labour. Each plough of land pays to it annually los. 
Sterling ; half a plough pays 5 s., and downward in the fame 
proportion. Each hoafeholder, not on the poor's roll, pays 
18 d. annually. — Both men and women fervants wages have 
rifen greatly of late. Men fervants ufed to get 6L Sterling 
for the year ; and women, al. los. : But a man fervant, now, 
receives 8 1. ; and a woman 3 1., for the year. The caufe of 
this fudden rife in the wages, is the manufadures, which 
are carrying on in the fea coaft towns, together with the re« 
pairing and making the roads through the country, which 
employ a great number of hands, and render fervaiits fcarct 
as well as dear. A day labourer's wages are 14 d. or 15 d.

Name^ Situation^ Extent^ lie, 

THE name of ihb pariih is of uncertain dcffiiraticft!; 
Some think that the letter i has fafeen funk in the firft 
fyllablei for eafe of pronunciation ; and though it is noW 
pronounced Kirlooiy that it was originally Kirklook ; parti- 
cularljv asly in the immediate neighbourhood, Kirton, and 
Kirftile, is put for Kirktoui and Kirkftile. In regard to the 
laft part of the name, it was formerly written with a double 
o^ and maj have been derived from its local fituation, as it 
commands a very extenfive lodk^ or profpeft to the S. and 
S. W. Others, preferring its prefent form (Carluke), make 
it of Gaelic origin \ and are of opinion, that it denotes a place 
of worlhip, dedicated to the faint of that name, and that it 
properly is the Kirk of St. Luke*. The village of Carluke 

is 

* From the Hiftory of Sir Willi a u Wa ll acE| the ancieot Scotch war* 
rior, it appears, that, about 500 yean ago, when the place of worihip flood Mi 
the low ground, near the tiver Clyde, the i^ame of thU pariih was Kirk-foreJI^ 

or 



of Carluke. til 

Is ftbbut 5 tneafurcd ihiles from Lanark, 6n the road leadinj; 
toCUaTgow ; about lo from, Hanilton, 19 from Glafgow, and 
33 from Edinburgh. The pari(h itfelf id about 7 miles in 
lengthi from the Clyde to its boundary on the eaft ; and fully 
4t in breadth* It muft therefore contain upwards of 50 
fquare miles. It may be obferved alfo, thajt the higher part 
of the parifli of Garilairs, {Mojfplai)^ was originally in this 
pM*i(h, and ftiU continues to pay ftipend to the minifter of 
Garluke. 

^urfare^ Soit^ t^c— This parifii rifes Conflderably above the 
level of the fea, its higher grounds being nearly equal to the 
Kirk of ShottS, while its lower grounds are little higher than 
fhe Holms of Dalziell and Hamilton. It has, on this account* 
a grtrat declivity, and, in the upper parts, is very much wafli- 
ed by thb heavy rains from the S. and the S. W. From the 
oppofite fide of the riVer Clyde, this parifh is feen to the 
greateft advantage ) and the numerous orchards, natural 
woods, and modem inclofures, which enrich its banks, afford 
a plbafant profpeft of cultivation. As the propofed road 
from Lanark to Hamilton, on the fouth bank of the river, is 
feon to be carried into execution, thefe beauties and improve- 
ments will be more acceffible to the eye of the public. Thd

Or the Kirk of the Foreft. Accordingly, in tKe lower part of thiii|»iriih, tTiere H 
Aiil a large diftriift much interfperfed with natural woods, called the Brai%Mod ; 
and the firname Poreft abounds more among the people here, than in any other 
parifh perhaps in Scotland. At that time, the kirk ftood in a foreft, near the 
Clyde, on a piece of rifing ground, where the prefcnt farm houfe of Mauidf- 
Isc^mains ftaads, and which, among the old people here, ftill retains the 
aame of AUey Suads„ 

It need hardly be obferved, that the Scotch word Kirt, for a p%ce of wor- 
ship, approaches nearer to the Original Greek, Ku^tes, oims, than the J^wgliAi word, 
Churei, and ought perhaps to be OQide ufe of, at Uail in Scotland.

St Bothwell, for the life of a cottoa mill^ few get up, but in 
high floods. Some faint attempts have been made to get this 
grievance redrefled \ bat as yet thejr have been iaeiedual. 

As this parilh is not much encumbered with muirs, moffes 
and mountains, it is moftlj under the plough* The foil^ 
however, is of very different qualities in the different regions 
of the diftrift, On the river Clyde, which may be called 
the firft and lowed region, the holm ground is of a free and 
fertile nature, producing (as ,it is faid here), ** meal for 
com *,*' and foroetimes more. But on the banks riiing be« 
hind the holms, the ground is deep, and the foil a fine mel« 
low cUiy, many yards deep ; and is therefore, in general, co« 
vered with woods and orchards. As the ground rifes to the 
eaft, in what may be called the fecond region, the foil is o£ 
a clay quality, with a hard bottom, requiring much labour 
and culture to render it produftive ; but, when attended to, 
it fufficiently repays the Xarmer's induAry. In the middle, or 
third region, about the kirk, and the eftates of Kirton and 
Whitehall, the crofts are naturally rich and loamy, though 
not far from the till. But the more didant fields (the *' o$a» 
Jields^* as they are here called), though plowed fometimes to keep 
tjiem in proper padure, are generally diallow and poor, with 
a bad bottom, and very unprodudive. In the fourth and 
fifth regions, the foil, even in the out-fields, becomes more 
deep and earthy; yet, being in fome degree mixed with mofs, 
and lefs favourably fituated as to climate, it brings, at lad, 
much leis meal into the granary, and lefs money into the poc- 
ket of the farmer, who choofes to keep it under the 
plough.

jf^ricMliunf Gra/si (^r.— Of late yean, the ttanner of 
fanning here is rtvj much changed to the hetten On th« 
lower and more fertile grounds, the gentlemen farmers have^ 
in fome meafurci adopt^l the praftical {Hirt of Lord Kaimes's 
fyftem, fo far as is fuited to their foil; and make alfo much 
ufe of the inilruments of huftandrj prefcribed bjr him. In 
this thej find their account : jet the inferior claffes of farm- 
ers follow them but at a diftance ; for being unable to expend 
fo much, thej onlj copy the more eafj and lefs expenfive 
parts of the gentlemen's example. So far as they go, how* 
«vef, thej reap great advantage: For after deriving much 
benefit from a. prudent rotation of crops, thej are able to 
laj down their ground in proper order, and to draw about 
5 L JSterliag from each milk cow thej paftnce, and fometimea 
mor% if the cow is (b large as to be of 6 L or 7 L value. la

* Of the node of grafi Canning, in the fiEth and highell region of the parxfli, 
the following plan is partaoilarly approved of. The farm is firft drained and in- 
dofedy and, if poffible, good roads are made, even through the moft fwampy 
parts of It. Soch places as hare already a good fward, are laid dry liy a Jieer 
fi^Atr plough ; the m&amp;es are cut, and the iield top drelTed wick £me or dung^ 
or both together. To bring the ground to a proper Ibrm, m certain qoantity is 
farole np each year; plowing it oot towards the furrow, and tajdng a crop of 
oats. Before winter fets in, all that is intended to be fallowed next fummer, is 
ribbed; that is, every third furrow is turned op. This, it is thought, has the 
double advantage, of opening 'an immenie number of drains, to difcharge the 
water, and of ezpofing the ground to the air and fro(t During fummer, they 
continue to throw out occafionally every 3d furrow, till the whole is plowed to 
the leveL This is called rih'falUw* They, find, they can work it at all times, 
and in all weathers (froft excepted), as the fallow is always dry. LafUy, they 
break it acrofs the ribs, and draw it up twice into ftraight ridges, from ^ to S 
feet broad, taking care,'that no water lodges in any part of the field. They 
fow the ground, thus fallowed, with oats and graft in fpring ; and at any time

as they were centuries ago.^ and yet, that, from the ad* 
ranee in the prices of cattle, calves^ butter, cheefe^ 8lc« 
one of their Utile cows will bring them about 4L qf 
4I. 10 s. per ann. In the high grounds, thepefore, it may 
be fuppoied, that they have more profit by keeping their 
grounds in grais, than by cultivating oats, &amp;c. But though 
their grain is of a bad quality, and feldom yields more than 
two thirds in meal ; yet, in order to prevent rulhes, in the 
wet foils, they are obliged to plough every 3d and 4th year : 
And, where the foil is drier, they find it neceffary to plough 
pvery jth or 6th year, to prevent it frpm cunning in^ healhy

pure and lalubrioasy as in any part of Scotland. Hence few 
epidemical diftempers have prevailed in this parifli, even when

^liarter of the parish, indeed, modiy belonging to the Eadof 
Hyodford, there is one vein, or rather feveral rich veins, 
from 7 to 10 feet deep. Free«ftone, lime and iron-ftone, are

meriting the name of mountain. There are, however, feve^^

Some difeafes may be ftated, as arifing from fancy, or a difordered imftgiiMJ 
Uoa merely. An old man died here fome ^me a^o, who had, for upwards of

quity. In the great cairn of Mauldflie Law, there was 
lately found an urn, of a roand, or rather oval form, in 
which had been depofited the bones of a human being. In 
digging nigh the top of the hill, great quantities of a(hes and 
burnt materials were found. Qn the S.W. corner of the^hill, 
there is a place which iiili retains the name of Gallowlie. 
There, the gallows flood, on which, during the reign of the 
feudal fyftecn, the ancient barons were wont to execute of- 
fenders. The prifon, with a dark fubterraneons vault under

From the King^s Law, on the N. £. corner of the parifh, a 
part of 13 or 14 ihires may be feen, when the atmofphere is 
favourable. On Mauldflie Law, there were more cairns than 
one. In the greater part of thofe above mentioned, human 
bones have been found by the farmers, in urns of different 
fizes. % 

Villages* — There are feveral villages ; but all of them on the 
decline, except Bradwood and Carluke. The caufes of this, 
in -the more remote villages, appear to be, the conCtant drain 
to the manufa&amp;uring towns of Glafgow, Faifley, &amp;c. ; the 
number of hands employed in the coal, iron, and cotton works 
in the neighbourhood, and the inclination which many farm- 
ers, in the decline of life, now have, to lay out what money 
they may have faved, on building houfes adjoining to the public 
roads, or in fuch villages as thefe roads run through, where 
fomething may be eafily gained,' and their money better fe- 
cured, than in the hands of their brother farmers, of whom 
many, of late, have failed. There are indeed many &amp;rm- 
hottfes buik lately in this parifh, on new improvements. But

May 1792, laid the foundation of his new caftle^ at Mauldf- 
lie. The number of inhabitants, though upon the increafe, 
is not fo great as might have been expeded. The reafons al' 
ready afiigned, in a great degree, account for it. In 1755, 
the whole inhabitants of the parifli were ftatcd by Dr. Web- 
fter at 1459. They amounted, about 25 years ago, to 1592 : 
and in Aucufl 1792, the number was 1730. From the pa- 
rifli regiller (which perhaps is not very accurately kept), it 
would appear, that the annual average of births, marriages 
and burials, for 10 years paft, is as follows .• births, 40 ; mar- 
riages, 18 ; burials, 28. The proportion between males aod 
females, for the fame length of time, appears to be, nearly, 
as XI to 10^

Kirk Zands^ Religious Houfes^ \3c. — In this parifh, there ar^ 
fome kirk lands that pay no Aipend, but have been burdened 
with grafs to the minifter, viz. the two farms of Kirton and 
Kirftile* On the S. £. near the houfe of Lee, there is a re* 
ligious houfe, or hermitage, of great antiquity, which is called 
St, O/waliTs Chapel ; and nigh to it there is a fmall field, called 
Friar* s Croft^ which fufficlently indicates its origin. On the W.

is now no veftigr. The place where it flood, ftill retains the 
name of Chapel Yard\ and the remains of it, it is faid, were

and the lands adjacent, pay ftipend to the minifter, in com- 
mon with the reft of the pariifa. So alfo do the Hofpital lands 
of Eafter, Wefter and Middle Seats (called Hofpital Shields^ 
Thefe Hofpital lands pay annually to the family of Lee the

by charter to repay annually, along with 20 merks from St. 
Leonard's Lands, Lanark, to the poor of the pariihes of Car-

called for, and now recorded in the parifh regifter here •.

the fummer fcafon, the original farm houfes on the Clyde were called MauUf 
and feem to have hceo the manfion houfes (as in the North Highlands to this 
day), where the principal part of the family reilded throughout the year. Such 
were the Mains of Mauldllie, Milton, Waygatefliaw, firadwood and Heads : 
mil comprehending, at a former period, lands running up into the higher part 
of the parifh — ^There are, in this parilh, 3 places alfo called Halb, which merit 
fome attention. Hail- Bar, Hall-Craig , and Hail-Hii/. Hall-Bar, in the fouth 
of the pari(h, is an ancient fquare tower, of a venerable appearance, with a bat- 
tlement and garden on the top. There is a concealed flair leading up to the bat- 
tlement and garden. It is built upon a rock, in a pidurefque, romantic, 
and very inacceflible iltuation. It is evident, from its form and (Ituation, it muft 
at fome period have been a place of ftrength ; but the traditions coivcerning k 
are very uncertain. Though the lands of Bradwood, around it, have been feu« 
ed out by the families of Lauderdale and Carnwath, they have cbofen to retain 
this tower and fmall garden, with free " ifli and entry," which they only rent at 
about 10 8. Sterl. per annum ; from which it is probable they confidered it as a 
• v^uable piece of antiquity. Whether it has ever belonged to the Lockharts of 
Bar, in Ayrlhire, is not known. — Hall-Craig is a modern houfe at prefent; but 
on the promontory of the rock on which it Hands, it appears, that there was 
formerly a place of flrength, from which it has got its name. A part of the 
old hall is yet viflble on the very pinnacle of the rock. The vcft:ges of fome 
walls and valilrs have been difcovercd within the garden j and latcl/ there was 
dug up, when drefling -the ground, a caufeway, leading in to the point of the 
promontory ,^-Hall-Hill is adjacent to the Earl of Hyndford*8 new gardens, 
near to the ilte of the Old Abbey, referred to in the beginning of this account. 
As this hill (lands juft at the entrance to the holm, or rather on the holm itfelf, 
it may, from this circumftance, more probably have derived its name, than from 
its vicinity to the old hall of Mauldflie, which flood more than aoo yards to 
to the N. W, in a Ut, or (hcltered iltuation, beyond the rivulet. Perhaps it 
jhould be called Haugh-iiill ; it being a fingular thing for a hill to be in a 
haugh or holm. The bafe of this little green mount is evidently artificial, and 
its cgntents, except a fmall part on the wefl, a rich, black earth from top to 
bottom. Many human bones have been difcovered in it. A man digging into 
the hill lately, on the fouth fide, flnick upon a large quantity, as if part of a 
chamcl houfe. The incumbeat^ when walking upon it, found fcreral human

bones, thrown up lately by planting young trees upon it. Having mai« a pit 
on the top, to the depth of 6 feet, even there, many bones were difcovered; and 
the foil itfelf, at that depth, was much; blacker than a^ny croft in the parifh. 
That he might fatisfy himfcif with regard to the bones being human, he (hewed 
them to feveral medical gentlemen, who all aflured him that they were. It it 
therefore prefumable, that this hill was the family tumulas, v.' here the MlUt o£ 
Mauldilie were buried ; and for that reafon might have been originally called 
Haugb-KUl, in oppoiicion to hai^ows-JCill (or ffadx9Vf4'KiU), which lies in the 
highefi part of the parifli : XUI, in Gaelic, Cgnifying a tomb. '^This circum* 
ilance alone, however, can fcarcely account for fuch a vaft quantity of bones, and 
lich black earth, in one tumulus. It is therefore probable, as thia little hill is fo 
nigh the fite of the old Abbey, that, about 3 or 4 centuries ago, when the parifli 
increafed fo as to be inhabited towards the Shields, and when the kirk was found 
necefifary to be ere^ed at Carluke, as more convenient for the whole inhabitants; 
that at that time, this tumulus would be made the repnfitory of the bones and 
confecrated earth that would be found in the Abbey-Steads at removing the 
kirk, and turning the facred ground into Au:h pafture, or aiabk ground, as the 
fpiht of thefe fuperfiitious times would permit. There are 3 circumftanccsthat 
feem to favour this conjedure. J^irft, The ground where the Abbey ftood, is 
now a clay of as pure a quality, and white colour, as the adjoining fields ; which, 
without fome excavation, can fcarcely be fuppofcd, after being a burial place for 
perhaps near 1 000 years. Scemdly, The whole earth on the mount, appears of 
a blacker and much richer quality than any to be found (but in kirk-yards), 
within many miles of it, even blacker and richer than the fatteft earth in the 
oldeft burying ground in Carluke kirk-yard; this lafl having been only employ- 
ed as burying ground for 3 or 4 centuries dt moil. lafliy, It does not appear, 
that the family of Mauldllie had taken up any btrying ground at the kirk of 
Carluke till about the end of laft century, when their prefcnt aifle was built. 
From this it ts probabfe, that the family, before that time, muft have buried 
fomewhere elfe than at Carluke. It doetf not appear, that they had buried on 
the Abbey Steads, as there is no tradition, or vifibfe veftige of it. It is there- 
fore probable, that they buried their dead on the top of the tumulus, where the 
whole facred earth of the Abbey Steads had been coUeded. Accordingly, the 
fummit was flattened, and fo continues to this day. Stones have tumbled from 
it, which appear to have been uiedj cither in a tomb, or Ibme building of decent 
orchiteAure.

As this parifli abounds with coal, and, in the higher parts, 
alfo, with peat and turf, it is more burdened with poor than 
fome others. Upon an average, there are no le(s than 30 con-

diftribution, is, I believe, about 80 1. Sterling. Tbb fum is

Raadsf ^r.-^Through this parifli there is one great tuni'^ 
pike roady leading from Glafgow to Peebles, &amp;lc. It is well 
made, and has on it feyeral toll-bars, though none in this diC- 
trift* At the village of Carluke, a branch goes off to Lanark, 
made by the ftatute labour. Since the (latute work was con- 
verted into money, the parifli roads are, in every refpeft, im- 
proved ; fo that the communication is now more eafy, and 
the farmers property, adjoining to the roads, fecured from 
damage*. 

* with re£pc£t to articles of proyiiloo» their prices of Ute haTc Tcry much 
advanced ; fo that, where the farmer has many commodities to difpofe of, he 
can afford to live eafy, pay a reafonable rent to the proprietor, and even fpend 
fomething extraordinary himfelf. Fowls, eggs, butter, veal, lamb and muttMi, 
all fell at very high prices. Within thefe laft %o years, they are dovbled ; 
which is feverely felt by annuitants of every defcription. Beef and mutton, in 
the markets here, are equal in quality to any in Edinburgh or Glafgow ; and 
they fell nearly at the fame rate. Horfes and cows have alTo doubled thdr price 
within thefe 20 or 30 years. Amidft thefe revolutions, the poor farmer of a 
few acres, at 10 1. or so 1. rent, who can with difficulty fupport his femily on the 
produce of his ixnall farm, fuffers the moft. He has nothing to fell, perhaps 
fomething to purchafe. The cottagers and day-labourers, when compared with 
him, are affluent and comfortable. It is natural to inquire, whence this increafc 
of price in every article of provifion (grain alone excepted) can arife ? Is it 
that the number of confumers have multiplied in an equal proportion to thii 
advance? — or that the modem modes of farming have diminlihed, rather than 
incrcafed the quantity produced f — No : the increafe of the confumers, upon the 
whole, uby no means in pr.oportion to this advance of price, as we fee from the 
ftatiAical accounts already publiihed ; and we know from fa^, that many farms 
bring more than double in the market, and none lefs, than they ufed formerly 
to do. Whence then does it proceed ? Among the many other caufes to which 
this may be afcribed, perhaps the principal one is, the great increafe «f banks 
in Scotland and England, and the enormous quantity of paper which they cir- 
culate, which finks the value of money, infomuch, that in purchailng many of 
the neceffaries of life, a fum of money will not go half fo far as it ufed to do. 
' And though the different kinds of grain are more ftable and fixed in their prices 
' than other things, this is evidently owing to the com laws with refpe^ to im- 
portation, of which the farmers complaia fo loudly.

Mitts^ t^f.— In this, and the whole higher parts of Clydef- 
'dale, there are no mills for grinding wheat, which is a great 
difadvantage. In this parifli, however, there are 5 common 
corn mi)ls. The firft, and probablj the only corn mills in this 
country for fome time, were thofe of Mauldflie, which per- 
haps may have derived its name from fwo/o, to grind. The 
mills of Mauldflie appear to have comprehended, at firft, what 
is now called Milton, and alfo 3 or 4 mills on the lower part 
of Carluke Burn. At that time, there was a wooden bridge 
(the veftiges of which are yet vifible), fitted up in the rocks 
at Milton, to make the communication to thefe mills eafier 
from the fuuth and weft on the oppofite fide of the Clyde : 
and farmers on the caft, at the diftancc of about 7 miles, 
were bound, by charters, to grind at the mills of Mauldflie. 
It appears alfo, that, about 500 years ago. King Robert Bruce 
was proprietor of thefe mills ; for it is recorded, that he grant- 
ed 10 merks Sterling, out of his mills of IVfaldflay (fo it was 
then written), for the purpofe of keeping a lamp perpetually 
burning upon the tomb of St. Machute at Lefmahago*. There 
was lately found, near the foot of the pariih, the remains of a 
hand-mill, which liadbeen ufed for grinding before the period 
of water mills. It is a very large whin, or muir, ftone, fo 
fcooped into the form of a large bafon, as to receive a leilcr 
ilone correfponding to it, with a handle. 

Antiquities^ Eminent Men^ &amp;c. — Some Scotch coins, as an- 
cient as Alexander I. have been found in this parifli, both at 
Chapel- Yard, and St. Ofwald's Chapel. From S. £. to N.W. 
runs the Roman Road, called here Waiting's Street^ (perhaps 
a corruption of Vitellius^s Street^. In fome places, efpecially 

at Killcaigow-Law, it is ftill fo vifible, that the manner of

its formation can eafily be afcertained. The Romans appear 
to have placed broad ftones in the bottom of the road, where 
the ground was foft, and broke others very fmall, with which 
they covered him. Roman coins at Bumhoufe and Caftle-hill 
were found in the diredlion of this road, and a deicription of 
them was lately given in the Scots Magazine. — Robert Cock- 
burn, A. M. aged 89, who wrote many trafts in favour of 
Chriflianity, died, and was buried here a few years ago. This 
parifli gave birth to Major General William Roy, whofe cha- 
rafter and abilities as a maihematician. Sec. are well known *•

1^83, the people in this pariih, iike many others, were in 
vtrj great want of grain, occafioned by the general failnre of 
the crops. What they had from their farms, was much da- 
maged, efpecially on the higher grounds ; but, by occafional 
fupplies of peafe from Leith, and the kind attention and libe- 
ral contributions of the more opulent heritors, the poor here 
were fo well provided for, that none of them fuffered froo^ 
1¥ant. 

Advantages and Bifadvantages. — ^The principal diCidvan* 
tages, under which this pariih labours, appear to be the fol? 
lowing: — ^Though the ground ftands much in need of dung, 
and fome of it cannot be made very produdive by lime alone, 
yet, by lying at a diftance from large towns, that fort of ma- 
nure cannot eafily be procured, but in the fmall quantities 
which the farmers themfelves produoe.-^This being a dayej 
pountry, in fome places, during the drought of fummer, the 
cattle are at a lofs for want of water, and are thereby liable 
to certain difeafes, well known to the farmer, which, in the 
woody part of the country, are particularly prevalent— —As 
there is a continual drain from the pariih, both of young men 
and women, to the neighbouring cotton millj, iron works, &amp;c^ 
the farmer is often at a lofs for labourers ; and fervants wages 
are thereby rendered much higher, than the mailer can well

(vtAuals excluded), he receives, from 14 d. to 15 d. a dar, 
during the fummer; fo that the farmers now begin to perceive^ 
that it is their iotereft to encourage cottagers, and to fubmit 
to the rifk of being thereby burdeded with a heavier poor's 
rate. ladced, as we are in this pariAi attentive to the poor, 
and well fupplied with fuel, we have generally many labour- 
ers reforting here in the decline of life ; but from them no 
labour of importance can be expeded, for any confiderable

foon become a burden upon the pari fh— From the quick de-

part of the parilh, however, they are expofed, during the

from the want of a free circulation of air. 

But though the parilh labours under thefe difadvantages, jtt 
there are alfo circumfiances in its favour, which tend to coun- 
terbalance them. Being at a moderate diftance from Glafgow,

living among them for about 30 jears, the prefent incumbent 
can faj with truths that thej are in general of good nader- 
ftandings, moderate in their views, and of humane difpofi* 
tions. Among thofe who attend the Eftablifhed Church, there 
is fcarce an inftance, either of wild enthufiafmi or of a per** 
fecuting and cruel fpirit. Profanitj, drunkennefs, fwearing, 
diihonefty, &amp;c. are hj no means prevalent. The general body 
of the people, are regular in their attendance on public wor- 
fliip, fober and virtuous. No child murder has been known 
to be committed here in the memory of man. . The difcipline 
of the church has been always exercifed with mildnefs. In 
ordinary cafes, only one appearance is now required, and 
antenuptial fornication difmifTed with a feffional rebuke, like a 
private marriage ; fo that none are hardened by frequent ap- 
pearances ; and marriage is encouraged in all. To conclude ^ 
in fome parts of this pari(h, much benefit is derived from the 
great improvement which has been lately made, by gentlemen 
of tafie and public fpirit, in the houfes of their tenants.— 
By being built neat and commodious, well aired, and properly 
lighted, they are found to cheriih, among thofe who inhabit 
them, a fpirit of cleanlinefs and cheerfulnefs« and to contri- 
bute materially to their health. In fuch places accordinglyi^ 
the people can live with more comfort and happinefs than for- 
merly ; they affociate more frequently together ; they culti- 
vate their farms more vigoroufly ; they procure better 
prices fpr their commodities ; and, being thus enabled to drefs 
more decently, and to make a better appearance on public 9C- 
cafions, they have thence an additional inducement, to attend 
with more regularity, the important ordinances of religion.

By the Rev. Johh MoRisoir, D. D.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name* 

ITis not known that the parifli ever had anj other name, thad 
what it now bears* Canifbaj has been fuppofed by tom6 
to have been originallj written Canonfbay ; others conjee* 
ture it to have fome connedion with the Latin vocable Cants. 
It is, however, more probable, that Canute^s-Baj was its 
firft appellation, in honour of the arrival of fomo Norwe- 
gian chief of the name of Canute. There is indeed no ac- 
count of the defcent of fuch a chief upon the coaft, nor is therei 
any bay in the parilh now denominated Canifbay. But as all 
the places of the lead note in the pari(h, are clearly of Nor^ 
wegian derivation, it cannot be fuppofed, that the name o£ 
the di&amp;rift itfelf (hould be an exception. 

Situation and Extenf. — The pariih of Canifbay being tihe 
mod northern land in the ifland of Great Britain, is (Ituated 
in the latitude of 58^ 43' N., about a? of W. longitude from 

Xiondo04

London. The figure of the parifli is remarkable for its 
regularity, exhibiting to the eje the exaft quadrant o( t 
circle, the arch of iwhich divides it from the neighbouring 
pariihes towards the land, lind the two 'containing fides from 
the feas that waih its coafts ; Dungifbay Head is in the yer- 
tix of this quadrant, from which the coaft firetches in % 
ftraight diredion due S and due W« till it meets with Wick 
parifh on one hand, and Dunnet on the other* Each of thefo 
lines maj be reckoned 8 Englilh miles in extent. The 
whole furface of the parifli may be computed to occupy 
ghout 50 fquare miles or upwards. 

Soil^ Surface^ be. — Canifbay is rather a level than a hilly 
diflrift. The Warth Hill is of confiderable height and mag- 
nitude, and is the only one in the pari(h deferving the name« 
The Loch of Mey is*about 2 Scotch miles in circumference. 
There is no river, and only a few rivulets (the chief of which 
is the Bum of Frefwick), in the whole pari(h. A fingle ftone 
(fea-rock excepted) of any confiderable magnitude, is no where 
to be feen above the furface of the earth. There are mineral 
and freih water fprings in abundance. The former are all of 
the chalybeate kind. There is one of excellent quality near 
the old cafile of Frtfwick. Heath in general prevails, 
where agriculture has not reached. There are, however, con- 
fiderable trads of freen pailure land, in different diilrifis of 
the parifli, which require only the advantages of cultivation 
to be made produdive. A light black loam, with an inter- 
mixture of mofs, is, where cultivation prevails, the general 
charader of the foil. TThe reft is entirely mois, reaching, in 
fome places dovim to the fea brink, and yielding peats in the 
mateft abundance, and of as good quality as any in the 

kingdom.

kingdom. The lands about Mej, belonging to the' Earl of 
Caithnels, have an intermixture of clay. 

C7iina/^.«— The climate is diftinguiOied bj variable, 
rather than tempefiuous weather. Remote from the 
mountains, which attrad moifture and occafion rain, fair wea- 
ther is not unufual. The winters are generally mild and 
open, frofts are feldom intenfe, or of long continuance. 
The fnow never thickens to anj depth, and the coaft 
28 fcarcely fprinkled by it, while in more inland pariflies it 
lies to a confiderable depth. The level fituation of the parifii, 
and the fea furrounding it on every fide but one, may be re. 
garded as the caufes of this temperature. The fummers in 
Caniibay, for the fame reafon, are temperately cool ; and high 
winds are, in general, more prevalent than heavy rains. The 
Aurora Borealis begins to exhibit itfelf about the middle 
of harvefl. In no part of Britain is it to be feen tQ 
more advantage. At times^ from the fliifting brilliancy of its 
vivid comifcations, the whole heavens feem to be in mo- 
tion : at other times a fettled bloody tinge prevails over all 
the (ky ; . and on thefe occafions, the whole phenomenon ap- 
pears truly awful and magnifieent. All its appearances feem 
to prove that it is the efied of eleftricity. 

Longevity and Di/ea/es. ^^Thtie'2rt fewdiftridts where more 
good health is enjoyed than in Canifbay. The inhabitants in 
general live to a good old age. There are feveral at prefent in tlie 
pariih betwixt 90 and 100. Many die at an advanced age, with- 
out the recolleftion of a day's illnefs in the courfe of their 
lives. The mod prevalent illneCTes among the people, are 
thofe arifing from obftrufted perfpiration, owing to the va- 
riablenefs of the weather, and perhaps ilili more, to the raw 
and unwholefome vapours transfufed into the atmofphere they 
breathci from the extenfive tracts of fen, muir and mots in 

their

iinfrequenL Fevers prevail as little hete^. perhaps^ as 10 any 
corner of the worid* Inoculation Is not jet in general prac- 
tice ; but though few efcape the fmall pox, the difeafe is fel« 
dom mottal^ Indeed, moft other difeafes are eztremeijr rare^

Pbjmlation. There are 38a faitiilies In thd pzxifbg Inciudd 
log thofe in the ifland of Stroma. The number of males la 
881, and of females 1069, total 1950. The return to Dn 
l¥eb(ler in 1^55^ was onlj X481 foub* The population has 
&amp;erefore increafcd 469 Within thefe 40 jears^ The advance- 
ment of civilization, the free enjojtnent of property, a bettef 
cultivated foil^ the muldplicitj of families 6n finall farms, and 
more extenfive employment In fifliing and the other maritime 
Occupations^ may be eonfideted as the opif ative fources of this 
increale. As thefe eaufes acquire additional energy, propor«»

Tated, and ibme little branchel 6f manufafture eftabUflted, (bd

are. The following lift (hews the number of births, dcathsi

dudtipHcity of families, the foil is broiight up to the higheft: 
pitch if cultivation. — Oats and barley, in alternate crops, with 
the addition of fome flax and potatoes^ are cte fole ob)edsx£ 
agriculture. The foil, at an average, yields about 5 returns 
of oats, apd above 7 of barley ; but in fome particular Ipots, 
no lefs than 11 returns of barley have been resiped. — From 
Martinmas till fpring, the dung of the cattle is left in the 
byre; a bedding of Jry earth or peat mold is thrown above it 
everyday, which mixes with the dung, and, at the fame time^ 
keeps the cattle warm and dry. A cart load 6f this compofl: 
is reckoned more valuable as a manure, than three of pure 
dung, particularly, if thrown out and expofed to the weather

thfough the winter; but the principal manure along the coaft,* 
is tang or fea ware : it comes afhore in the greateft abundantie 
daring the fpring months, when it is moft needed. A 
wind blowing from the land brings the ware from the fea.— , 
This manure is folelj appropriated to the barley crop. It is 
a powerful deanfer of the foil, coalcfces with it in the fhoi'teft 
fpace, exerts and exhauils its nutritive virtues in the nourifli- 
ment of one crop. In whatever manner it is laid upon the 
field, it is a manure of the firft eftimation. Dunghills con- 
fiding of earth and ware, of 6 or 12 month's {landing, feem 
the moft eligible preparation of this valuable manure fdt* the 
foil. From the conftanc ufe of fea-ware as a manure, aloilg 
with the conftituent qualities of the foil, the cultivated lands 
in moft parts of the parifli, are as fine and friable as garden 
mould, and are cultivated in general with lefs ftrength, than, 
comparatively fpeaking, is found requifite in other places of 
the country. The foil being perfeftly clear of latent rock* 
the plough is made of the flighteft conftruftion ; and, in ge- 
'neral, both plough and cattle do not exceed xo 1« Sterling la

clof\ire$t green crops, implements of the moft approyedconftruc- 
ttop, and Iftbouring catt}e of due fize and eftimation, are what 
juftly entitle (hem to the appellation of farmers. Their 
praife would be great indeed, if, by granting longer leafes to 
the tenants, th^y qoi^d perfuade them pnce to begin the bufi- 
nefs of inclofingf apd the culture of wafte ground, which crie^ 
aloud, iMid has f^ried for ages, for the advantages of the fpade 
and the plough, In former tinges, s^nd even thefe not long 
elapfed, unlimited fervi(:es were unqneftionably a part of the 
equivalent, whi^h tenants paid for th^ lands they occupic^. 
Belides money apd vid^ial, a vaft variety «of different artidea

gefts a variety of reflefiions, with which the dignity and bap- 
pinefs of man are deeply ponne&amp;ed* Thefe cnftoms, as they 
are ca]Ied, are now for the mpft pi^rt conyerted into money^ 
Unlimited fervices are no longer exigible. In one half of 
the pariflit two days in fpring, and two in barveft, are the 
ilipulated fervice } nor is this invariably exaded. From the 
operation of prefent arrangements, in a yery ihort time the

is reared and brought up in the pariih, that are neceflarj for tho 
oiltare of the foil. Grafs is one of the principal wants we havo 
ep complain of. Ihe arable foil is fb precious, that the far-^ 
mer thinksy he could not bear taming a^j part of it into graft* 
. The want of indofures and winter herding, precludes him 
Iram the advantages of green crop^. The bed grab farm in

fibove all, the inattention of |he owners, are the caufes of the 
diminution of their number, to a third part of what thej for-

Cso^i.— Dungiibay Head, the Berubtum of Ptolemy, is fi^ 
tuated in the N. E. comer of the ifland of Great Britain, 
where the line of the coaft, from a northern diredion, turns, 
diredly due weft, and continues its courfe,'till it reaches Cape 
Wrath, with little or no variation in its reftiHnear dircftion. 
This -beautiful promontory is of a circular fliape, about- 9 
miles in circumference. Towards the fea, which cncompaffca 
two thirds of the Head, it is one^n tinned precipice. On the 
land fide, you defcend by a gentle liope into a deep valley, hav^ 
ing a fmall mofly rlvtilet running through it, which terxiki. 
nates the Head on that quarter. Near the top of the rock, 
' and on that fide which faces the Orkneys, there is a vaft 
gulph or cavern, (called, by the neighbouring inhabitants, the 
Clufi)i ftretching all af ound perpenclicularly down, - till ks

traves it holds communication, bj an opening^ at the bafe of 
the intervening rock. The bridge betwist this fearful chafm^ 
and the edge of the main rock, towards the fe'a, is about fix 
yards wide. On the higheft part of the head, abont '50 yards 
ffom the edge of the precipice, there are to be feen iridnbi^ 
table marks of fome houfe, or tnanfion, heretofore erefied by 
the hind of man* Its bs^e, which is all that now rematfts, is 
perfe&amp;ly circular, and abbut 20 feet wide. It has probably 
been occupil^d as a watch tower, or place of obfervation, cor- 
r^ponding with another, the veftigcs of which are to be feen 
ofl the top of Warth hill, at about the dlftance of 2 miles. 

Sou^ from the Head, for about 5 miles, the Warth hill 
extends its bafe to the fea brink, llie coaft is every where 
elceeding bold, and the wild and varied magnificence of the 
rocks are peculiarly firiking to the eye of a ft ranger. Be- 
yondy for about a mile, the coad fubfides into a beautiful 
£tndy beach winding around the bay, till it reaches 
the manfion-houfe of Frefwick. Here the coaft again re« 
fumes its boldnefs, which continues with little variation^ till It 
reaches the confines of the parifh* The lands adjacent to the 
ihore, for the laft 3 miles, (a little moor fouth of Frefwick 
es^cepted,) are all under cultivation. The coaft is .beautiful f 
the foil luxuriant and produflive. 

The north coaft has but little of that ftupendous boldnefs^ 
for which the eaftem one is fo remarkable. In coming down 
from the Head, and travelling weftward for two miles, the 
walk is extremely pleafant. The grcateft luxuriancy of 
growth prevails, extending from the ftiore dbout a mile inland. 
The beach itfelf confifts wholly of fiiells and fliell fand,' of the 
pureft white, which conttibute alike to beautify the coaft, 
and to enrich the foil. In the middle of this delightful walk, 
y'oa approach the celebrated refidence of John O^Groat ; but,

luxuriancy of the grafs in this diftrift, feems wholly owing to 
the quickf nii^g influence of this calcareous manure In its neigh* 
bonrhood. Near Barrogil Caftle, is found a fpecies of coal 
which emits a hot vivid flame in burning, but without much 
diflblution of parts, or diminution of (ize, after it becomes 
extinft. It is got near the furface of the earth ; and, in all 
probability, coal of a better quality may he found under it ; but, 
the ftiperabundance of peat fuel, in the mofles of Canifl)ay, 
in a great meafure fupcr fedes tlie necefBty of digging for it. 

Boats and Filing. '^There are about 60 boat3 around the 
coail, and yet not one man who lives entirely by fifliing in 
the whole pariih. Each of thefe boats is the joint property of^ 
perhaps, 6 or 7 different owners. The fifli arc divided accord- 
ing to the value of their refpe£tive fliare^ in the boat ; and, the 
objeA of flfliing is not fale, but the fupport of their families* 
Tlie bufinefs of agriculture, from the benignity of the foil^ 
and the number of hands employed, being foon and eafily dif- 
patched, fhey have abundance of leifure every good day to 
go a fifhing. Hence, every farmer in the pariffa, (the inland 
eftate of Brabfler excepted,) is a fiflierman, and every fiflier- 
man a farmer. There is, perhaps, fcarce an inftance known, of 
one parifliioner ever felling a fifli to another; Fifli-mongers 
have of late engaged fome boats, on the coafl, to fifh cod and ling. 
at a ftipulated value ; but as this branch of induftry is yet but ia 
its infancy, it merits no particular defcription on the prefent 
occafion. On the north coaft, the rapidity of the tides in the 
Pentland Frith is altogether unfavourable to filhing. In very 
flormy weather, cod and ling are, by the force of the billows, 
frequently, thrown in alive upon the fhore, and taken up by 
the people, who on thefe occafions go in quell of' them. Oa 
the eaft coaft, the fame difiiculties not occurring, fifliing might 
unqueftionably turn to good account, if proper exertions were

madC) and boats accuftomed to make a greater ftretch fron 
land, before they dropt their linds. Gray fiih, as thej are 
called, of all kinds, abound every where around the coaft, 
and conftitute a great part of the fuftenance of the inhabitants. 
The fhoals of young fi(h that pour into every creek and bay, 
about the beginning of September, are fuch, that a boll of 
them may be caught at a few hawls, in the courie of one 
evening. They feem to be the intermingled fry of various 
genera, and are called by the inhabitants Celiacs. They are 
tender and delicious in the higheft degree, and, in general, 
between 3 and 4 inches long. While the rapidity of the tides 
on the north coafl is much againft the fifliing of cod and ling, 
there is perhaps no (lation in the world, where a lobfter ii(h« 
ing might be more fuccefsfully carried on. The bays of Mey, 
Gills, and Dungiibay, abound in lobtters to a great degree.— 
A few boats at Mey, for the behoof of MeiTrs. Selby and Go. 
of London, have been employed for the firft time, in this 
branch of induftry, this feafon ; and, from the fuccefs they have 
had, it is to be hoped, this fpecies of fifhing will foon become 
general around the coaft. 

Cburcbf Schools, and Poor^ \ic. — The feilion records reach 
as far back as the , reftoration, but are not continued down 
without many gaps and mutilations. The whole inhabitants 
oftheparifh profefs.the religion of the eftabli(hed churcht 
except a few of the Anabaptift perfuafion. The firft rife of 
that fed in Caithnefs, was in a part of the parifh of Wick, 
where a gentleman of landed property refided, whofe 
views of religion inclined him to profefs and propagate the 
Anabaptift fyftem : Frqpri that diflrid, bordering on Ganif- 
bay, it was imported into this pariih : It is now greatly on the 
decline, and never was accompanied with any fort of outrage, 
wildnels, or violence in its profeiTors* The ftipend of Canif-

from the great abundance of tang-manure, which even, in bad iieaions, ieldom 
fails to enfure a crop. It alfo affords them employment, with fiiitable wages 
during fuirmer, in the manufadure of kelp. A good deal is gained by pilotage 
and not a little by fea expreffes. From thefe combined caufes, and their being 
inured from their earlieft years to habits of fobriety and temperance, they may

nial line, who leave the place of their nativity, in queft of 
fuperior wages in the fouth of Scotland. Many of the young 
men become foldiers, preferring the land to the fea fervice« 
Their charafler in that capacity has always been to theii: 
credit. There are few fuperftitious ufages among them* : 
ghofts and fairies are believed to manifeft themfelves occa- 
fionally. There are three popifh chapels mouldering into 
defolation in the parifli, one at Frefwick, another at Brabfter, 
and a third at St. John's Head. Some fuperftitious rites, now 
in total difufe, were wont to be performed, by the igno- 
rant vulgar, on particular days, at thefe fan&amp;ified ruins. At 
prefent, not a veftige of popery feems to intermingle in the 
creed of the people. There are no wells of preternatural ef- 
ficacy in the parifh. There is no day in the year accounted 
inaufpicious, or, (Sundays excepted) held in higher eflimatioi^

Notwithftanding this alertnefs and pomptitude in a]l their

terefls of its own to faften upon, exerts its power, for the fake

fpirit for prying into the moft hidden concerns of their neigh-

Antiquities and Natural Curiofities. — Houfes, faid to have 
belonged to the Pifts, though in no refpeft remarkable, except 
for their antiquity, are to be feen in different parts of the parifli. 
The profped from Dungiibay Head, may be well reckoned a 
curiofity of the firfl diiUndion of its kind. It commands the 
whole of the Pendand Frith, and as far beyond it as the eye 
can firetch. The Orkney Ifles appear fpread out in that hap- 
py point of vifion, in which fuch objeds are contemplated 
with the greateft pleafure and delight. The German Ocean 
to a great extent, the Murray Frith, and the hills of Banff*, 
Aberdeen, and Murrayfliire, are all under view. No travel- 
ler, when he comes to John 0*Groat*s, will repent a vifit to 
the Head. The Stalks of Dungiftay, as they are called, are 
two piramidal pillars of . naked freeftone-rock. They rear 
their fantaftic fummits a great way into the air, and ftrike 
the eye of a ftranger in approaching them, as the huge fpires 
of Xbme old magnificent Gothic pile. They are frequented 
in fummer by innumerable Tea fowls, who hatch and bring 
forth their young about their fides, while the eagle fits in 
royalty upon their fummits. Near to St. John's Head, upon the 
iiorth coaft, is one of the pleafantefl fpots in the whole parifii* 
It affords evident tokens, of having been, in former ages, a 
xefidence of great refpedability ; from a burying ground, and 
the veftiges of an old chapel in the neighbourhood, now in 
total ruins, as well as from the name it bears, it would iJsem 
to have been confecrated to religious purpofes. From the 
veftiges of a ditch and draw-bridge, defending it on the land 
fide, it mud have been occupied as a place of ftrength and fe- 
curity ; but, whether it has been the refidence of faints or 
heroes, it affords ample proof, that neither tafte nor judgment

were wanting, in the choice of it as an habitation. The de- 
corations of art are alone wanting to render it one of the 
lovelieft fpotsin Caithnefs. In the burn of Stempfler, is found 
white fpar of the purell qualitji^ When put into the fire, a 
very flight degree of heat makes it throw out a confiderable 
portion of phofphoric light, which gradually decays as the 
ftone cools, and is again recruited as the ftone is heated 
a-new. When reduced to a powder, it puts on an exceeding 
brilliant and beautiful appearance during ignition. In elec- 
trical experimentS| it is a non-conduftor, nor does it feem 
foluble in acids. About a quarter of a mile eaft from the 
•hurch, there are 2 fprings of frefli water, at leaft 30 yards 
within flood mark* Betwixt Brabfler and Frefwick there is 
a deep hollow, called, in the dialed of the parifli, the Wolf*s 
geOf which muft have derived its name from being the haunt 
of wolves in former times. There are other circumflancea 
handed down by tradition, which tend to prove, that this 
ravenous animal was once an inhabitant of Canifbay. 

Wild Animals. — ^The quadrupeds are foxes, hares, otters 
and weafels. — Adders are fometimes found in the moiles, but 
they are not numerous. In the links of Frefwick, Dungif- . 
bay and Huna, there are plenty of rabbits, but they turn to 
little account. There are alfo no^oor-fowl, plovers^ fnipes, 
fome partridges, ^nd multitudes of wild pigeons in the rocks* 
Birds .of paflage are, the green plover, wild goofe, fnow-fowl, 
wagtail, fwallow and fail. The fnow-fowl, in the winter, are 
inconceivably numerous. The bill&amp; are exceedingly well 
ftocked with the moor game above mentioned. The coafls, 
throughout the year, abound in multitudes of fea-fowl. In 
the fummer months, the fwarms of fcarfs, marrots, faiks, &amp;c» 
that come to hatch in the rocks of Dungiflay and Stroma, 
are prodigious. They in a manner darken the air, when, on

any fudden alarm, they take wing in a body from their nefts. 
The gun makes frequent and bloody havock among them. 
They are fhot for amufement frcm boats, and the common 
people appropriate their flefh and feathers to their own ufe. 
The fport is cruel and unprofitable, as numbers die upon their 
young in the neft, or expire before they reach the edge of the 
projefting flielve. 

Planting. — ^Therc is no planting in the parilh. A good 
many years ago, an experinient was made on a part of the 
Warth Hill. A few acres were planted with firs.— ^Thcy 
throve very well while young ; but the fence being infuf- 
€cient, and foon mouldering away, and the plantation ezpofed 
to all pofliblc injury, the whole periflied, and at prefent no 
vellige of it is to be feen. The fpot was well chofen, and had 
the plantation been attended to, there is hardly a doubt, but 
that it would have profpered. No charge ought to be brought 
againft the foil and climate, as long as the exertions of induf* 
try are wanting to overcome die obftacles complained of. 
Without a fuitable choice of ground, both as to foil and ihel- 
ter, and without proper inclofures, what fuccefs can or ought 
to be cxpeSed ? The bums of Frefwick, of Dungifbay, and 
the winding braes of Gills, where, in defiance of the depreda* 
tlons, both of man and bead, fome natural bruih-w^od main- 
tains its refidence, feem to claim a preference in experiments 
of this fort. 

Roads, Inns^ Traffic^ \Sc. — The public roads in the parifii are 
thofe leading from Huna to Wick and Thurfo, both lying along 
the doafl, the one in a foutherly, and the other in a wefterly 
direftion. They have never been completed, and are very un- 
comfortable in the winter. A third from Huna, leading in- 
to the middle of the country by Brabilery would be a great 

3 conveniency 



ffCanifbay. i6l 

conveniencj to other parifiiesy as well as to Canifbaj. Tip- 
pling houfes are by far too numerous in the pariih : They 
have undoubtedly a bad influence on the induflry, as well as 
morals of the people. Three, befides the ferry houfes, are all 
that ought to be allowed. From Huna, the ferry boat crofles 
with the mails for Orkney once a week. From Burwick in 
South Rofialdihay, the Orkney mails in like manner cr^fs to 
Iluna. The diflance there, being the fhorteft betwixt Caith« 
nefs and Orkney, is reckoned 4 leagues in extent. \t a paf« 
fenger goes abng with the mails, the freight is is.; but if he 
hires the ferry boat for himfelf^ it is 7 s« Although the Pent-r 
land Frith may be defervedly accounted the moft tempeftuous 
piece of fea, around the ifland of Britain, it is remarkable how 
few accidents happen in croffing it ; but the danger it 
threatens, fuggefts the means of preventing it. The time of 
tide is obferved to a minute, in putting out to fea. The boats 
are ftrong and of good conftrudion ; the boatmen perfed maf- 
ters of their bufinefs, and acquainted from their infancy with 
every circunoflanoe, refpeAing the vsiriation of the tides they 
have to go throogb. In the famm^r feafon, ther^ is almoft a 
continued cotkimunication betwixt Caithnefs and Orkney, ip 
the traffic of horfes. Colts from the highlands of C^Uhnefs, 
from Sutherland and Strathnaver are fold, to Orkney ; and thefe 
veiy colts, when paft their prime, are again brought from Ork* 
aey, and re-iitiported into Caitbnefs. By far the greated 
number of thefe crofs to and from the fliores of Ganiibay, on 
account of the fhortnefs of the paflage. Large boats are nvide 
for tranfporting them ; and the freight of each cok is z s., and 
a full grown horfe is. 8d» to the neareft land. There are 
3 petty markets in tbe^pariib, in the courfe of a yeatr, one ia 
December, and the other in February.

Language %3c. — The Scotch, with an intermixture of fam« 
Norwegian vocables *, is the only language fpoken in the pa- 
rlfli. Tlie pronunciation, as well as language of the peafanCry^ 
is better than what prevails among the vulgar in more fouthem 

counties. 

f The nuncs of plaices feem to b« derived from the ]^niregian language. 
$ter^ which fignifies an ^au^ is the tenninating fyllable of an immenfe number 
of the names of places in, Caithnefs and elfewhere. They coniift for the mud 
part of two fyllables, the firft moft probably being the name of feme diftinguiih- 
cd pofleflbr. Many maritime places, both in Caithnefs and Orkney, derive 
their names froQi fome peculiarity refpe^ng the coaft or the tides» Aaty in the 
J^aniih tongue, fignifies a current of water, or the particular courfe of a tide. 
It feems to claim an affinity with t|ie Gaelic ambtu^ and the Latin ammity both 
fignifying a river .-^Where wch is the terminating fyllable, the place is not only 
maritime, but there is always, in its vicinity, an opening of the coaft, larger 
than a creek, but fmaller than a bay, whole two containing fideaform an angle, 
fimilar to that of the lips, tenninating in the cheek. It ii remarkable, that, ii| 
the Scotch 4iale^ this is always termed the wmI of the mouth,. It does not 
therefore appear, that there is the leaft affinity betwixt w^i and wtf/. The for* 
mer vocable is for the moft part, if not always, maritime : the latter, from the 
meaning of the word, can Have no poffible refpeA to local fitnation. If wck 
were derived from «/««/, we would find wch* as generally inland as upon th^ 
coaft ; and every place bearing the name of wick ought either to be, or to affor| 
fome evidence, that in former ages it had been a village. In Orkney, there are 
a great number of wicks, and in Caithnefs two. They are all upon the coaft, 
and every one of them chara^erifed by an opening in the rocks, of the particular 
figure above defcribed. 

From the above obfervatxons, the names of moft places in Canifbay are of eafy 
derivation. Hmna is made up of the words kml^ and aae. The former is the 
fame as haUow in EngUfii, and hvu in Scotch : The latter is the tide ftream, 
or current, oppofite to the coaft. In confirmation of this etymology, Huna is 
one of the loweft lying places in the parifti, and where the tides are lefs rapid 
than on other parts of the coaft. Stroma is compounded of 5/r«w an4 aot ; the 
former in the Daniih tongue fignifying impetuous, and the latter, a current, as 
already obferved. The tides around Stroma, are fnppofed to run at the rate of 
near 10 knots an hour. Frefwick is the f^ten v;icJk, from/rifi, fignifying green, 
and the figure in the coaft ftrikiogly defined in its vicinity, which is found in every

ks well, and with as little peculiarity of accent, as their equals 
in any part of Scotland. There is fcarcely a place in the 
whole parifli^ whofe name is not of Norwegian derivation. 
The Gaelic is totally unknown in Cgnilbay ; nor is there a 
place throughout the parilh; whofe name indicates the leaft 
affinity to that language.

tfiand of Stroma. — ^The ifland of Stroma is fituated in the 
Pentland Frith^ about a league from the fliore of Canilbay. It 
is a mile long, and half a mile in breadth. It contains 30 
families, 97 females and 73 males, and rents at about X20 L 
Sterling per annum* It is very produ&amp;ive in com ; but the 
inhabitants are obliged to fttpply themfelves with fuel, from 
the moiles on the main land. The tenth iheaf was heretpfote 
taken in part payment of the rent. This, with all other cttf« 
toms and fervicesi has of late been converted, by the pre&amp;nt 
proprietor, at the defire of the people, into money. There are 
few difcriminating features in the charafter of the Stromare* 
ans from the other inhabitants of the parifli. They fpeak 
the fame language, wear the frme apparel, and obferve the 
fame cuftoms. The fea is one of their principal fources of 
fupport. They are dabbling in ialt water from their child-* 
hood upwards. From their political fitnation, and the fim- 
plidty, fobriety and induftry, natural to them, there are 
perhaps few iflandertf on earth happier than thofe of Stroma*

The fea is often exceedingly tempeftuous, around the ifland im 
the winter months. The coaft on the weft is exceedingly bold* 
The tremenduous elevation of the billows, that beat againft 
it during a ftorm» from that quarter, exceeds all power of de» 
fcription. Although the rocks are only inferior to thofe of 
Dungifiay Head, the fpray is tofled above their loftieft fum- 
mits, and falls in fuch profofion as to run in rills to the op- 
pofite fhore. A refervoir, in a commodious fituation, is made 
to receive it, together with the rain which the clouds im- 
part ; and hence, a mill is kept going in the winter monthst 
for grinding the grain of the ifland. The agitation of the. 
fpray is often fo great, that the water in the fpring wdls be* 
comes brakifli, and a fait tafte prevails in the ain The tide

Pettthnd Frith. — The Fentland Frith is reckoned 24 miles 
in length, and varies from 4 to 5 leagues in breadth. It 
has the Orkney Ifles on the N. and the coafts of Caithneis on 
the S., and forms a communication between the German and 
the Atlantic Oceans. In the mouth of the frith, and nearly half 
way between Dungi(bay Head and the Orkneys, are fituated

Ijiag about two leagues to the weft. The parts of the frith; 
moft dangerous to navigatioa. are two currents, firetching from 
Dungilbay Head and St. John's Head, to a confiderable dif- 
tance from land. The former is called the Boars of Bungtf^ 
hay^ and the latter the Main of Mey. The billows in them' 
are often fwoUen to a monftrous fize, even in the fineft fum*^ 
mer day. They feem to arife from the collifion of tides in 
oppofite diredions, and recoiling with increafed impetuofity

fnl pilotage, they are hazardous even in the calmeft weathers 
The tides in every part of the frith are various and irregular^ 
and of courfe the navigation dangerous, efpecially in the 
night, where a very fmall deviation from the proper courfd 
may be attended with fatal confequences. 

A lighUHoufe Propofed, — ^For the above reafons, and toAnf 
more that might be advanced, there is not, around the ifland 
of Britain, a ftation where a light-houfe is more requifite; 
than in the mouth of the Pentland Frith. A year does not pafs,- 
without fome fatal accidents to (hipping, from the want of it; 
Either Dungiibay Head, or the largeft of the Pentland Sker- 
riesi is the ftation where a light-houfe ought to be erefted;. 
A light on the Head would ferve to illuminate the Pentland 
Frith to the weft, and the German Ck:ean to the eaft, as far 
18 the eye could difcern it. No doubt its altitude in foggy 
weather is an argument, agaiijft it, as a ftation for a light 
houfe; but, from the prevalence of winds in this quar* 
ter of the world, fogs would very rarely obftrud the 
light. The Skerry alfo, would unqueftionably be, in many 
refpe&amp;St an excellent ftation. It is eaft of the Head, and of 
every part of the coaft. From its local lituation, it would

Mcpefted from a light-houfe on the Head. It promifcs, in^ 
jdeedy many advantages as a ftation for a light-houfe ; and the 
principal ohje&amp;ions which can be argued againft it, are, the 
great difficulty there would be, to find a perfon willing to a«u 
cept of fo tempefiuous a refidence in the winter months ; and 
the ezpence, which would be at leaft 6 times greater than at 
the Head. Thefe points being confidered, perhaps, it is up- ' 
on the Head where the experiment ought firft to be tried* 
A light-houfe on either of thefe ftations, would be an infallible 
fafeguard to yeflels from miftaking the bays of Reifs and of 
Frefwick in the night, for the Pendand Frith. This has been 
often done, and the moft fatal confequences have enfued. 
All mariners declare, that they would have no more hefi- 
tation in failing through the Pentland Frith, at the dead of 
night, than at mid^day, bad they the guidance of a light- 
houfe to dire&amp; their courfe. The number of vefiels, that pafs 
and repafs in the Pentland Frith, during the courfe of a year,

parifli, which has often been vifited, by travellers from very 
diftant countries, who, it is believed, have rarely been ndade 
acquainted with the peculiar circumftance, which firil gave 
rife to its celebrity ; its fame having been in genKl errone- 
oufly attributed, to its mere local fituation, at the northern 
extremity of the ifland ; whereas, it originated in an event 
not unpleafing to relate, and which fumiihes a ufeful leflbn 
of morality* 

In the reign of James IV. of Scotland, Makotm^ Ga* 
vin and yobn de Groat^ (fuppofed to have been bro* 
thers, and originally from Holland,) arrived in Gaithnefs, 
from the fouth of Scotland, bringing with them, a letter

county of Caithnefs* Thej purchafed, or got pofleilion of, the 
lands of Warfe and Dungifbaj^ Ijiug in the parifh of Ca- 
mfbajy on the fide of the Pentland Frith ; and each of them 
obtained an equal (hare of the property they acquired. In 
procefs of time, their families increafed, and there came to be 
eight different proprietors of the name of Groat, who poffef- 
fed thefe lands amongfl them ; but, whether the three original 
fettlers fplit their property among their children, or whether 
they purchafed for them, fmall poffeiBons from one anotheri 
does not appear. 

Thefe eight families, having lived peaceably and comfort* 
ably in their fmall pofleiEons, for a number of years, eftablifli* 
ed an annual meeting, to celebrate the annivcrfiiry of the arriv* 
al of their anceftors on that coaft. In the courlie of their fefti^ 
vity, on one of thefe occafions, a queftion arofe, refpefting the 
right of taking the door, and fitting at the head of the table, and 
fuch like points of precedency, (each contending for the feni* 
ority and ehieftainlbip of the clan,) which increafed to fuch a 
height, as would probably have proved fatal in it9 c^nfequen- 
ces to fome, if not to all of them, had not John de Groat, 
who was proprietor of the ferry, interpofed. He having ac« 
quired more knowledge of mankind, by his conftant inter** 
courfe with ({rangers paffiog the Pentland Frith, faw the dan^

cure filence, he began with expatiating on the comfort and 
happinefs they had hitherto enjoyed, fince their arrival in that 
remote comer, owing to the harmony which had fubfifted 
among them. He afiured them, that, as foon as they appear- 
ed to fplit and quarrel among themfelves, their neighbours, 
who till then had treated them with refped, would fall upon 
them, take their property from them, and expel them from 
die county^ He therefore conjured them, by the ties of

to their feveral homes ; and he pledged himfelf, that he would 
fatisfy them all with refpeA to precedencj, and prevent the 
poffibilitj of fuch difputes among them, at their future an- 
hiverfary meetings. Thej all acquiefced, and departed itL 
peace. In due time, John de Groat, to fulfil his en- 
gagement,, built ^ room, diflinfi by itfelf, of an o&amp;ogou 
fiiape, with 8 doors and windows in it i and having placed in 
the middle, a table of oak, of the fame ihipe, when the next 
anniverfary meeting took place, he defired each of them to 
enter at his owadooTi aiid to fit at the head of the table"; he 
taking hiinfelf the feat that was left unoccupied. Bj this in- 
genious contrivance, any difputq, in regard to rank, was pre- 
vented, as they all foitnd themfelves on a footing of equality, 
and their former harmony and good humour were reftored. 
That building was then named John O'Groat's houfe, and 
though the houfe is totally gone, the place whete ft flood ftill 
fetains the name, and deferves to be remembered, as long as 
good intentions, and good fenfe, are eftimable in k country *.

<p>Namef Situation^ Extent and Soil. 

THE town of Ncwburgh has evidently giren its name 
to this pariih; and the fignificant term, bj which it if 
denominated, maj have been impofed in reference to fome 
more ancient burgh in the neighbourhood* It forms the 
boundary of the county of Fife, on the N. W— -The extent 
of the pariih is inconfiderable, and its figure very irregular^ 
one part of it being detached from the other *• The foil on 
the N. and E. of the town of Newburgh, where the ground 
islowand flat, confifts of rich clay, not inferior in quality 
to any in the Carfe of Gowrie ; on the we(l of the town, and 
near to the river, where the ground rifes higheri it is light and 
gravellUh ; more foutherly, where the ground fuddenly dips, it 
tends to mofs \ and ftill farther fouth, where the ground again 
rifes into the Ochil Hills, it becomes, in fome places, dry and 
loamy, in others wet and tilly. In the eftate of Pitcairly, 

however,

liowever, owing to the fortunate flopings of the eminences^ 
and the largenefs of the interjacent flats, there are many fields 
well adapted to the purpofes of agricahnre, which have, ac- 
cordingly, been brought by the proprietor, into a ftate of fer- 
tility and cultivation. 

ClimaU^ Di/eqfes^ (^r.^In the hilly parts of the porifh, the 
climate, althengh cold, is reckoned more healthy, dian in the 
lower grounds, on the bank of the river, where the town of 
JNewburgh (lands. Itbere the flat is hemmed in on the fouth, 
by the Ocbil Hills, which obftmft the fun's xnfiuence, while 
it lies open, on the oppoiite fide, to the N. £• winds, that 
blow np the Frith of Tay with piercing keeanels. Notwith- 
Jlanding this, epidemical diftempers are not more frequent, or 
more fatal in Newburgh, than in other parts of the neigh- 
bouring country. Rhenmatifms and confumptions may be 
ftated, as the difeafes, to which its inhabitants are mod liable. 
The praftice of inoculating for the fmall poz, not having be- 
come general, many children are, from time to time, loft by 
that difeafe. In the courfe of fpring and fummer 1791, no 
fewer than 56 children died of it, in the town of Newburgh. 
But \% may be expefled, that the fame diftemper will not in 
future, find fo many Tiftims, as the good fenfe, and weU 
direfted affeftion of parents begin to overturn any prejudices, 
they might formerly have entertained on that fubje&amp;, and to 
^^&amp;i^ them in taking that eafy flep, for faving the lives of 
their offspring, which experience juftifies, and which Provi- 
dence, from the fuccels attending it, feems to fandion and ap^ 
prove. 

J{fv#r/.— No river runs through this parifli. The Tay, 
which waflies its northern extremity, more properly form- 
ing a boimdary to it, than making any part of it* But the 

Y 2 Tay

Jay may ind t place io the ftatiflical accoiint of any diftrift, 
that reaches to its boriier. This noble river^ having rcceivcfd 
the acceffion of the water of the Earn, begba at Newbargh, 
to aflame the appearance of aa arm of the fea ; and, bj the in-r 
habitants of that town and neighbourhood, is deDomioated 
the Broad Water. When the tide in it, however, has ebbed, 
it leaves a cpnfiderable part of its channel dry ; and, ooUca* 
log itfelf into two currents, pailes along the oppofite fides of 
its bed, in what are termed the North and South Deeps. The 
^uth Deep, contains by far the greateil quantity of water, 
and furniihes the courfe, whiph vefTels of burden ufually hold, 
in paiBng up and down the river. As far up as Newburgh, 
the Tay admits veflels of 500 tons burden ; but above the 
confluence of the Earn, beyond which Perth is fituated, vefr 
£els of 200 tons burden, when deep laden, proceed with difi* 
ficulty. Veflels, however, of about 90 or 100 tons burden, 
(in which the trade with Perth is nfually carried on,) eafily 
make the fhore of Perth ; and whep larger veflels are employ* 
ed in that trade, part of their cargoes ii diftributcd among 
lighters, on their arrival at the ihore of Newburgh. 

Salmon Fiflnng^^mJBAits being favourable to commerce, 
the Tay furniihes great quantities of excellent (almon, the 
fifliing of which has, efpecially of late years, becomes con^ 
fiderable fource of wealth to all who have prqerty in the 
river. The proprietor of that part of its channel, qn the foutb 
fide, which eorrefponds to the length of the parifli of New- 
burgh, draws about aoo 1. Sterling, of yearly rent, for hicf 
^fhings \ and, in fituations farther up, where the channel is 
not fo broad, nor the tide fo powerful, proprietors receive a 
much greater rent for a tnuch lefs extent of water. What 
f fiables fiihermen to pay fuch high rents, is^ tl|c great price

Thefe light, but ftrong built Teffds, are kept running at aB 
weathers, with almofl any quantity of fiOi; and, as the 
voyage, in the fiibing (eafon, cannot be long, they generally 
bring iheir cargoes to market perfectly found, efpecially fince 
the praftice has prevailed, of packing the falmon in ice-- 4)ne

this new and gainful trade to the capital.^ and cannot help 
admiring the fpirited induftry of that merchant, by whom it '

from a monopoly of falmon, ihould prevent the iubabitaots of 
three eounties, from (baring in thofe delicacies, which Provi* 
deuce annually fcatters in fuch abundance upon their (hores. 

HiUs and Woodsy—The hills in the parifli of Newbnrgh, 
piefent no remarkable appearance. Like the generality of 
hills, in that extenfive ridge, which runs, with little interrup* 
tion, from the neighbourhood of Stirling, to the^N. £• ex- 
tremity of Fife, they are broad-topped, green, and in many 
places, arable.-^-That abrupt rock near to Newburgb, on the

in the parifli of Newburgh, at leaft within the period to whidi 
its written records reach ; although it is not improbabk, that 
the wood mentioned in the hifiorji of Sir Wiluam Wa£« 
X.ACE, bj the name of Iron^Side^ may have anciently coyer* 
cd its lower grounds. Above 20 years ago, the proprietor 
of Fitcairly» having inclofed the greateft part of his lands, in 
that quarter, with ditches and fione fences, run along many 
ftripes, and interfperfed feveral confiderable clumps of difierent 
kinds of wood, which give a cheering appearance to his eftate^ 
as it unezpeftedly opens on the view of the traveller, in cro£- 
fing a diftrid, otherwife uninclofed, and ill fupplied with trees* 
Of late years, fimilar fteps have been taken, in the lower 
grounds, on the eftate of Mugdrum ; and at no great diftanee 
of time, the beauties of that place, naturally delightful, may 
be much heightened, by various well difpofedf and thriving 
plantations. 



Antiquities.-^ At the N. E. extremity of this parifli, '1 
the river Tay, on a gentle rife, in the middle of a rich, and 
not uneztenfive flat of clay lands, appear the ruins of the an^ 
cient Abbey 0/ Undores. Concerning the hiftory of this 
Abbacy, while it continued under the power of the church, or 
after it was ere&amp;ed into a temporal lordfliip, nothing material 
can be difcovered, which has not already been made public. 
About the year 1741, the abbey, with a fmall part of the ab* 
bey lands, which, till that time, had been retained by the 
family of Lindores, pafled into the hands of the fon of a former 
minifter of Newburgh ; and, by a fubfequent Me, have conoe 
into the poflei&amp;on of the famUy of Mugdrum. What may 
have been the extent of the buildings of the abbey, in former 
times, one cannot judge, as part of the grounds, which they 
once occupied, is now converted into arable land^ Remains 
of the church, however, are ftill extant, which fbew, that it

of the garden walls are ftill fianding, which fuggeft no mean idea 
of the wealth of the clergj who inhabited it, and flronglj mark 
the pains thej had uken, to fecnre the delicacies and luxuries 
of the table. Within thefe walls, and for a finall fpace be- 
yond them, on one fide, the ground continues to be occupied 
by fruit trees, which, havbg been long fioce planted, exhibit 
appearance? of decay, that, viewed in conjundtion with the 
mouldering fragments of flru&amp;ures, half covered at top with 
ivy, and furrounded at bottom with thorn and hazel, give an 
air of melancholy grandeur to the place at large* That 
dwelling houfe, fituated in the heart of the ruins, and occu« 
pied occafionally, till of late years, by the proprietors, or their 
friends, muft have been repaired from fome more ancient fiu 
brie, or an entire new building of flones taken out of the 
walls of the abbey. If we may credit tradition. It wa^ 
reared by the firft Lord Lindores, in the beginning of 
laft century, and has received confiderable additions and 
improvements fince that period. Formerly ftrangers, who 
vifited the ruins of the abbey, had a ftone coffin point- 
ed out to them, which was placed within the area of 
the church, on the north wall, towards the eaft end, which 
was faid to have contained the remains of an Earl of Douglas ; 
but, in confequence of depredations lately made upon the 
walls, it is now covered over with rubbiih. Whether this 
coffin did in fad contain the bones of an Earl of Douglas, or 
of a Duke of Rothfay, or perhaps of fome dignified ^cdefiaftic 
belonging to the abbey, no certain information can be pro- 
cured, as there is not a fingle infcription to be found in any 
part of the church, or of the other buUdings, which might 
lead to the difcovery of fads of fuch remote antiquity* Upon 
the whole, in viewing the abbey of Lindores, nothing is qow 
to be met with, worthy of attaching the curiofity of the vifi-

irill fcarcdy be abk to difcem the fituation Wb^re it was 
placed. 

Befides the ruins of the abbey of Lindores, this parifh con- 
tsina two croflea of very ancient ere&amp;ion. One of tbefe is^ 
pladed on a riling ground, a little weftward of the town of 
Kewbnrghy and within 4 yards of the Tay. The other is fi- 
tsated at the diftance of fomewhat lefs than a mile to the S. 
in an opening of the Ochil Hills, on the confines of Strath- 
eanr, where the road, formerly leading towards Lindores, fe^ 
parates from that which at prefent leads to Auchtermuchty. 
The lower crols, known by the name of the Crofs of Mug- 
dmm, confifts of one latgd ftone placed upright in another, 
which has been hollowed for receiving it, and which ferves 
to retain it in an ereft pofition. Upon the upright ftone, al- 
tiumgh mutilated, remains of the figures of horfes may ht 
traced ; but no veftige of any infcription appears. The up- 
per crofs, called Crofs M^Duff, confifts, at prefent, of one 
large quadrilateral block of freeftone, rudely indented in fe« 
veral places, but is faid to have had formerly another ftone 
ftanding upright ; although the ftone now lying along the 
the ground, has no appearance of ever having been hollowed, 
in die manner of that which forms the bafe of the Crofs of 
Mugdrunx. No fatisfa&amp;ory account can be given of the va« 
rious purpofes, which thefe crofles were originally meant to 
ferve. The tradition, which conneds Crofs M^Duff with the 
jurifdiAion of the powerful Thane of Fife, may not be defti- 
tote of foundation ; but in regard to the Cro(s of Mugdrum, 
even tradition ceafes to furnifh any information. It were

either of the croffes, it continues to preferve the memory of the fpot, in the 
lands belonging to the town of Newburgh, on which more than one unfortunate 
viftim fell a facrifice to the fuperftitioh of former times, intent on ^unifliing the 
crime of witchcraft. The humane provifibos of the legiflature, joined to the fu- 
perior knowledge, which has, of late years, pervaded all ranks of men in fociety, 
bid fail to prevent the return of a phrenfy, which aduated our forefathers unirer- 
fally, and with fatal violence. But we may well be furprifed, in obferving how 
iiear to bur own times, it continued to exert its influence over the judgment, not 
e^ the comnioa people only, but of thofe too, who, by their education, Ihoold 
have been raifed above vulgar prejudices.' As Ute a« the year 1653 » the records 
of this pariih, contain articles of an additional charge, brought by the miniiler

kirk-feflion, for imprecating curfes upon him, beeaufe he had debarred her ac*

was ereded into a burgh of regalitj, under the Abbot gf 
Lindores. In the year i6oC, James VI. ereded the Abbacy 
of Lindores into a temporal Lordfhip ; and, in the year 1631^ 
bis fon Charles I. granted a charter to the town of Newburgh, 
forming the community into a proper royal burgb, with the 
feveral immunities and privileges, ufually conferred on ther 
royal burghs of this kingdom. At prefent, Newburgh has 
no voice in the choice of a rcprefentative to parliament ; but, 
in all other refpeds, it retains the features of a royat burgh. 
Its revenue, indeed, is very inconfiderable, not exceeding 25 L 
Sterling, per annum, out of which the niiinifter receives, yearly, 
no 1. Scotch, in payment of ftipend. NotwithAanding which^ 
its office bearers make a decent appearance ; a (iourt is held in

The town of Newburgh, conlifts of one ftreet of confider- 
mble length, with fmall fuburbs at each end, and a lane lead- 
ing towards the ihore from its centre. The houfes, on each 
6de of the lane, and, in the fuburbs, have been built within 
thefe 30 years. The town itfelf, dbes not occupy more ground 
than it did in the end of laft century j but, in confequence of 
alterations, that have fince been made upon the buildings, it 
mult be capable of containing double the number of inhabit* 
tants. Formerly, the generality of houfes in Newburgh, werp 
low built, and covered with thatch of ftraw, or of reeds* 
Of late years, a better ftyle of architedure has prevailed ; and^ 
at this day, Newburgh has Ibme pretenfions to neatnefs, in 
the ftrudure of its houfes. Sispty years ago, few of its houfea 
concealed their rafters'. — At prefent, fcarcely any of them^ 
and none lately erefted, prefent that naked appearance. On 
the fame fpot, where i % years ago a board was placed in the 
window, to exclude the winter ftorm, may now be feen, a 
Venetian blind, attached to the cafement, for blunting the 
rays of the fummer fun. Within thefe 10 years, not fewer 
than 30 houfes have been rebuilt, within the liberties of 
Newburgh ; fome of which might be rented at 12I. and non6 
for lefs than 5 1. per annum. Preparations are alfo making, 
for rebuilding two or three more. The ftreet of Newburgh, 
which has long been paved with ftoneiT^ having fallen into dif- 
repair, the magiftrates and town council, lately, formed the 
refolution of paving it a new ; and bjr means of afieiTments 
from proprietors within the burgh, together with a fmall al- 
lowance out of the ftatute labour, leviable upon the inhabi-

^ut moCt of the fmall portions of land, which they formerly 
held, and which they generally cultivated with their ow^i 
)iands, having been purchafed of late by the proprietor of 
Mugdrum, and laid out in large parcels, they are now at- 
tached more to particular callings. The trade which occu-. 
pies the greateft number of hands, is that of weaving clotli. 
No fewer than 279 of the inhabitants, are at prefent employ- ^ 
cd in it. Ihe weavers of Newburgh, however, do not yet 
abide conftantly by the loom. Accuftomed from their early 
years, to handle the oar, as well as the {buttle, ^hey betake 
themfelyes, in conCderable numbers, to a fea-faring life, when 
the price of thefe kinds of cloth, which they are in the prac- 
tice of weaving, falls low in the market. While they conti- 
nue nt the loom, they do not, in general, arrange themfelves 
under different maflers, who might furnifli them with materials, 
and pay them for their work. Some of them do indeed follow 
ihat method , and work-flbops may be met with, in which 

near 



•f Newburgb. lt\ 

jaear a dozen of looms are employed by one manofaftarer^ 
But the greater part of them weave ^their own yam, and 
bring their own webs to fale. The webs/ which they com* 
monly weave, are of three kinds, termed by the workmen, 
Silefias^ Ofnaburghs^ and Brown Limns* For fuch cloths, ther^ 
is, generally, a good, and at prefent, 8 very great denund ia 
London and Leeds. The weavers, in Newburgh, however, 
have little direft intercourfe ivith either of thefe places. 
They generally difpofe of their webs, at Newburgh, to a few 
€^i their own number, who again difpofe of tbem at Perth| 
Dundee, Cupar, Auchtermuchty, and Glafgow, to perfons 
there, who purchafe them, either with their own capital, or 
upon commiffion, for the Englifh markets. Not more than 
two of them tranfa&amp; bpfinefs immediately with London. Be- 
fides weavers, Newburgh contains its full proportion of fliop- 
keepers, inn-keepers, fmiths, mafons, carpenters, ihoemakera, 
tailors, butchers, bakers, fifhermen, and feamen. Scarcely 
any 6f its inhabitants find themfelves placed beyond the ne* 
ceffity of employing themfelves in manual labour; although 
few or none of them are engaged in manufa&amp;uring any materi- 
als for exportation, except the linen cloths already mention^t 
and barley into malt. Of the latter, they fend to Edinburgh 
market, in the courfe of one (eafon, about i8oq bolls* 1 ill 
of late years, a great proportion of bread, beer, and butcher's 
meat, confumed in Newburgh, was. brought from Perth, 
Dundee, and the Carfe of Gowrie ; but the bakers, brewers, 
and butchers, are exerting themfelves in their refpedive oc- 
cupations, and they bid fair for fecuring, in future, the cuf- 
tom of the generality of the inhabitants. Formerly, few peo- 
ple reforted from any diftance to Newburgh, for merchant 
goods ; and the retail trade in it was liipited to a few articles, 
in the hard-ware and grocery lines, purchafed commonly by 
|he dealers at Perth, or at Dundee. But within thefe few 

years.

jtasSf feveral ikops have been opened, upon a more extenfivt 
Icale ; and there is reafon to believe, that the demands of the 
town and neighbourhood, will furni(b the keepers of then) 
frith employment. Still, however, no trader has as yet ap- 
peared in Newburgh, whofe extenfive tranfaftions in com- 
SEicrcCy would entitle him to the name and character of a mer-. 
phant f though perhaps the time is not far diftant, when maov 
iriil be found here of that refpe^able defcription, 

Sbore.-^A few yards northward from the town, and^nearlyt 
fUnneSed with it by buildings, although beyond the limits of 
its jnrifdidion, lies the ihore of Newburgh ; which conflfts 
of three continuous piers, projeding into the fouth deep of 
the river Tay, with feveral dwelling houfes, ftore-houfes, 
and other conveniencies for commerce. Thefe piers form 
very £afe ftatioos, for the veflelt employed in the trade on the 
fiver i and although none of any burden can properly be fai4 
to belong to Newburgh, and b^t few are freighted to it, ex« 
cept with coals or lime, they are feldom to be feen without 
Ihips, as the generality of veflels, bound for Perth, mud wai|[ 
at Newburgh the flow of the tide ; and not a few of them» 
muft unload part of their cargoes there, before they can, even 
with the tide, proceed farther up the river. Hence arifes a 
good deal, if not of trade, at leait of ilir, at the ihore of New- 
burgh, which proves qf advantage to the place at large. The 
fmacks employed in the falmon trade, alfo, lie to there, at all 
feafons, and take in all kinds of goods for London market* 
A trade in wood and iron, is likewife carried on at the fliore, 
by a dealer, who refides upon the fpot, and who has obtained 
ft pretty extenfive iale. A tannage is likewife forming, there, 
which will revive a trade, that was carried on at Newburgh, 
hi the end of the laft century. Formerly, great quantities of 
Y)Brnt lime-done, brought by land carriage, from^ tb^ inland 

parts

[arts of Fife, were fliipped at the fliore of Newburgh, txA 
fold to the farmers in the Carfe of Oowrie, for manure. Bat 
the lime works ei'c£led on the Frith of Forth, and oo the 
Englilh coaft, from which the farmers, in the eaft end of 
Stratheam, and in the Carfe of Gowrie, are more readily and 
more cheaply fuppKed, have nearly put an end to that fpeciet 
of traffic. For feveral years pail, great quantities of wheat 
and barley^ purchafed from the farmers in the neighbourhood^ 
hare been fliipped at the fliore of Netrburgh, chiefly for the 
£dinburgh and Glafgow markets. This trade feems likely 
to continue ; and while it brings advantage to Newburgh^ 
moft operate to the benefit of th^ country at large. Or tha 
north fide of Fife, more grain is cultivated, than can be con« 
fumed by the inhabitants. Formerly, a market was, wil^ 
difficulty, found for the furplus ; but, by the connexion eQab«* 
lifliing between Fife and the fouth country, this difficarlt^ 
will be removed, and a new fpur given to the farther cukiva* 
tio« of a diflrift lately much improved^ but capable of being 
rendered greatly more productive. 

I 
Fflrf»j.— There are only 4 farms in this parifli, the remain^ 

ing lands, which are not extenfive, either continuing in the 

pofleflion of the proprietors themfelves, or being divided into 

inconfiderable portions among a variety of feuars, tenants^ 

burghal heritors, and other fmall proprietors. Of thefe farms^ 

kowever^ it may be with truth, afiirmed, that they are at pre- 

fent, in as good a flate of cultivation, as any in the neigh* 

bourhood. Few farms, in the whole extent of the Ochil 

Hills, to the weftward, have been more judicioufly laid out^ 

than two of them, which occupy the eftate of Pitcairly y and 

no farm in the Carfe of Gowrie can be kept in higher order, 

or rendered more productive, than the one which is connefted 

with the Abbey of Lindores, The fourth farm, although* 

formed 



184 



Statijitcdl Jccduifi 



formed but of late, chiefly out of fmail purchafes frdm the 
burghal heritors of Ncwbnrgh, bears evident marks of im- 
provement. 

Rentf Proprietors^ %Sc* — ^The "Valued rent of the parifli 
amoants onlj to 19^8 L 17 s 6 d« Scotch. Its real rent may not 
mtprefent be great ; but, en the expiration of fomeleafes, itmuft 
rife confiderabljr, as land, in the lower grounds, on the eaft of 
Newburgh, lets, at from z L to 3 1. /^r acre ; and, in the higher 
grounds, at from 10 s to 2 1. per acre. The territory of the 
parifli is divided among two greater, and about 30 fmallet 
proprietors, called here, as well as in. other parts of the coun« 
try, portionersi The two greater, and mod of the fmallet 
proprietors, ufaally refide in it. Befides the four farmers^ 
already mentioned, there are few tenauts in the pariihf who 
do not refide in the town, or at the (hore of Newburgh ; anct 
their number^is not great, nor their portions of land extenlive. 
The four greater farmers pay of rent above 5O 1. per annutd 
each ; the other tenants pay much below that funn. 

Crops, — The principal crops in this pari(h are eats, barley,' 
wheat, beans, and a mixture of beans and peafe. Notwith- 
iianding the richnefs of the foil in the lower grounds, it is not 
long fince wheat made a crop there in rotation. Of late years, 
wheat has been fown, not only in the lower grounds, but al- 
fo in the hilly parts of the parifh. As turnips are not found 
a profitable crop in clay lands, they are not cultivated in the 
lands attached to the Abbey of Lindores. Any trials made 
to faife them in the higher grounds, have fucceed^d. But it 
is matter of regret, that farmers, in this part of the Country/ 
fliew fome backwardnefs^ in extending a fpecies of Crop, which, 
when properly conduced, not only meliorates the land, and gives 
it frelh life and vigour, but alfo furniOiesa delicate and nourifh*

log food, either for feeding young catde, and raifing them to 
a greater fize, or fattening the old, and bringing them to a 
better market* Clover and xje grais are generally fown with 
the barlej ; and, after a crop of grafs has been taken for one 
year, the ground is again broke up for oats. Wheat is fown 
after fallow or after pulfe, but commonly after fallow. Ma^ 
nure is laid pn the fallow, or when the land is undergoing 
preparation for a peafe crop. When the feafon will admit, 
beans, or a mixture of beans and peafe, are fown upon the 
manure, and plowed in. Wheat is not fown fo early as for- 
merly, even upon fallow. Farmers are of opinion, that very 
early fowing feldom produces the largeft head, or the heavieft 
grain of wheat* Oats are fown from the beginning' of March 
to the end of April, and the iecd, generally made ufe of, is a 
fpecies of oats termed Grange-bothrey, from a farm of that 
name, in the county of Afigus. Barley is fown in the end 
of April, and through the whole of May. Moft of the feed 
em^oyed is a mixture of different kinds, originally imported 
from England. Though the lands, being under better cul- 
ture than formerly, yield greater quantities of barley, it is re- 
marked, that its quality feems not to be equal. Whether this 
be oiwing to the frequent fowing of wheat, or to the intro- 
dnfiton of lime, as a manure, experience has not yet enabled 
the fanner to determine. The quantity of grain, raifed in 
this pariih, is by no. means equal to the maintenance of its in- ' 
habitants ; but the deficiency is abundantly made up by the 
neighbourhood. 

Population^ ^r.-rFrom the report of ope, who, during the 
indifpofition of the writer, was employed to afcertain the 
number of the pariihioners, it appears, that the parifb, at 
large, contains 1664 fouls, of whom 2552 belong to the town, 
fuburbs, and fhore of Newburgh, and z la to the country part

of the parifli. The inhabitants of the town, fuburbs and fhore, 
confift of 772 males, and 780 females. Of the inhabitants in 
the country, 64 are males, and 48 females. The return to 
Dr. Wcbftcr, in 1755, amounting onljto 1347, it is evident, 
that there has been an increafe, fince that time, of 317 fouls. 
Owing to the manner, in which the publication of marriage 
banns is generally regiftered in Scotland, an accurate account 
of the marriages, that take place in any particular pari(h, can- 
not always be obtained. But the records of this parilh, fup- 
ply the following account of births and deaths, for the laft fix 
years, which there is tvttj reafon to believe, may be depend- 
ed on.

Ecclefiaflical State. — There are three clergymen in the 
pariih of Newburgh ; the miniller of the cftabliflied church, 
of the Burgher Seceders, and of the Congregational Society, 
befides feVeral others, who, without taking the name of cler- 
gymen, teach and exhort, under the denomination of Ana- 
baptiAs, and Unitarians. The Congregational Society is fmalL 
The Burgher Seceders may exceed one third of the whole 
inhabitants of the pariih. In point of numbers, the Anabap-; 
tills and Unitarians fcarcely deferve the name of focieties. 
The Unitarians do not exceed four ; and the Anabaptifls are 
not double that number* The Anabaptifls are conne£led with 
a church of the fame defcription, at Dundee. It may be pre- 
fumed, that the Unitarians have eilabliihed more diftant con- 
nexions* There are alfo, in the pari(h^ feveral families who 
belong to the congregation of Antiburgher Seceders at Aber- 
nethy. The Antiburgher SecefEon, is of long (landing in the 
parifli. But the Burgher SecefHon fprung up in it, on the ad- 
mifGon of the prefent incumbent, into the Eftablifhed Church, 
The town of Newburgh, alfo, contains a few Independents, 
and one or two profcffors of the Epifcopal religion, but no Ro- 
man Catholics. Befides thefe various denominations of Chrif- 
tians, not a few perfons refide within the bounds of this pa- 
riih, who hold communion with no religious fociety, and fel« 
dom join in any public a&amp;s of religious worfliip. A friend 
to principles of toleration, and an advocate for liberty of con- 
fcience, rejoices in obferving men of different views and 
opinions, on fubjeds of religion, living together in the exer- 
cife of mutual charity^ and tranfa&amp;ing peaceably with one 
another, the bufinefs of civil life. — Thefe are happy times. 
Even among the common people, perfecution for the fake of 
coofcitnce begins to be regarded with horror -, and the bigot 
ihould in vain attempt to inflame them with violence, againft 
perfons of fentiments, the moil oppolite to thofe which they

iiztt embraced. At the fame timei cfuividion of the impor* 
tance of religion, to the prefent comfort, and future happinefs 
of mankind, muft produce the deeped regret in the minds of 
thofe, who are called to witnefs liberty of confcience made a 
pretence for negleSing duties, which the beft, in all ages, 
have ever held (acred. 

Lord Vifcount Stormont, and Mr. Haj of Mtlgdmm, are

of meal, (a bolls a pecks of the oats, and the fame quantity 
of the bear being converted to^the town, at 20 L Scotch,) and 
22 L Scotch in money, with a manfe, and a glebe of 4 acres. 
The pariih church is an old Popifli chapel,, fituated within the 
town of Newburglff which, in confequence of a late thorough 
repair, haf been made a very convenient phu» of worihip. 
The manfe is a new building, erefted fince the admii&amp;on of 
the prefent incumbent, on a moft delightful fpot, beyond the 
town of Newburgh, to the eaftward, in full view of the river

5cioo/i.— There are two fchools in the parifli, and one 
teacher in each fchool. The fchool, taught by the pariih 
fchoolmafter, is attended by 60 fcholars, of whom 8 are 
taught Latin, la writing and arithmetic, and 30 Eoglifli. 
The other fchool, which is private, and taught by a Seceder, is 
attended by 55 fcholars, of whom 3 are taught Latin, 11 
writing and arithmetic, and 31 Engliih. During the winter 
feafon, both fchools are reforted to, after the ordinary hours of 
labour, by a coniiderable number of grown up perfons, for 
the purpofe of learning Engliih, writing, arithmetic, book- 
keeping, and navigation. Of late years, the advantages of 
education, have been fully perceived by parents, and are 
eagerly fought for their children. Tlicre is one licenfed

the town of Newfafurgh, have either juft finiihed, or are at 
prefent, profecuting the ftudj of pb jfic, in the uaiverfitj of 
Edinburgh. 

Poor*— There are no poor on the funds, who refide in the 
country part of the parilh. The number of pobf on the 
pariih roll in the town, is confiderabk. They are maintain* 
cd by the intereft of accumulated fums of money, feu-duties 
of a fuperiority in lands purchafed for their behoof, cdlec- 
tions at the church door, and other cafnahies. Befides the 
money given in monthly peafions, confiderable fums are dif- 
tributed eccafionally, to perfona in ftraitened circumftances, 
vho receive no ftated fupplies ; and the education of about 8 
children, is ufually paid for. 

Charader and Manners of the fiople.^n a provincial 
town, inhabited chiefly by failors and weavers, polTefled of 
fmall properties, and nearly on a level with refpeft to riches, 
one does not look for poliflied manners, and the courtly at- 
tentions praftifed in great cities. Till of late years, the inha* 
bitants of Newburgh were remarkable for their rufticity, and 
for the freedom with which they treated their fuperiors. 
'* We will let the heft Lord of the land ken, that when he 
** fets hb foot on Newburgh caufeway, he is Bailie Lyell'a 
'* vaflal,*' was the boaftful language in which they exprefled 
their emancipation from feudal tyranny, and their enjoyment 
of political freedom. The prefent inhabitants retain the fenfe 
of independence, imbibed and cheriflied by their anceftors ; 
but having (bared in the effeds of that civilization, which has 
recently produced fo great a change on the manners of the 
nation at large, they are ftudious of difplaying it with mode- 
ration and courtefy. They mingle with their neighbours m 

the 



J 90 Statl/iical Account 

the tranfafitions of commercial intercoarfe ; and they gradual^ 
1 7 ai&amp;milads to the general charafter of their countrymen. 
The bulk of the inhabitants undoubtedly merit the praife of 
fobriety and induftry ; and inftances of perfons are not want- 
ing, who, by (ignal propriety, in their own deportment, fur- 
niih a daily rebuke to the unprincipled and idle ; and, by fu- 
perior attention to the education of their children, take the 
fureft method of producing a thorough reformation on the 
manners of the people. No perfon belonging to the parifli of 
Newburgh, has fuffered the puniihment of death for any 
crime, within the period to which its records extend. In times 
of peace, Perth receives its moft expert lailors from this dif*- 
tri£b ; whilft, in time of war, Newburgh fupplies the Navy 
of Great Britain, with fteady, well behaved, and gallant 
men* 

Advantages and Difadvantages.^~Tht parifli, and in parti- 
cular, the town of Newburgh, labours under feveral difad van- 
tages. The country near it, on the fouth, is hilly, thinly in- 
habited, and badly provided with roads. Trade being al- 
ready eftabliflied at Perth and at Dundee, militates againft 
its fpeedy acquiiition of commercial confequence. The ap^ 
pointment too, of magiftrates in Newburgh, witliout a reve- 
nue adequate to the fupport of their authority, maybe reckon- 
ed unfavourable to it. When perfons in power are dependent, 
regulations of police may be formed, but will feldom be exe- 
cuted. In every town, men are to be found of weight fuf- 
iicient to thwart thofe fchemes of improvement, which muft 
be profecuted at the perfonal expenceof the projedors. But, 
notwithftanding thefe obvious obftacles, no fpot on the whole 
north fide of Fife, feems better calculated for preparing va- 
rious kinds of manufa&amp;ura for fale, and for fupplying part 
of three counties, with foreign articles of confumption. It 

5 lies 



of Newhurgb. 191 

lies open to the moft difiant markets^ has convenient ftations 
for Slipping, and admits veiTels of coniiderable burden. The 
fertile diftrift of the Carfc of Gowrie, is at no great didance, 
on the north ; and a well cultivated country approacheis on 
the E. and W. There, a malting concern, of great "extent, 
might be eftabliihed ; and, in the immediate neighbourhood, 
might be found no inconvenient fitnation, for anj work re- 
quiring a command of water, while Newburgh ipight furnifh 
plenty of hands for carrying on the operations of the manu- 
fafturer ; as there are hundreds in it already trained to the 
loom, who only want a fpirited merchant, with an adequate 
capital, to direA their induftry into a lucrative channeL The 
time cannot be far diftant, when thefe obvious advantages 
will be feized, in an age of fuch commercial enterprife ; and 
then the town of Newburgh, long poor, though independent, 
will become difiinguiihed for the wealt}), the induftry, and 
the number of its inhabitants, and better entitled to the atten- 
tion of the philofopher and the ftafefman. ^

and Meams^ 



By the Rev. Robert Small, D. D. one of tie Mini/ters of 
that City.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE flkodera name of the pariih is Dundee, from the 
large town fituated in it. This name, formerlj, and 
even fo late as the beginning of the prefent century, was ge- 
nerally fpelled Dondi or Dondie ; and in Queen Mary's charter 
Dondeif in law-Latin it is Deidonum ; and it has been affirmed 
by various Highlanders, that they confider it as fignifying, 
what this Latin imports, the Gift, or otherwife, the Hill of 
God. Thefe circumftances give probability to the tradition, 
that it obtained the name, about the middle of the X2th cen- 
tury, from- David Earl of Huntingdon, who landing here, af- 
ter a dreadful ftorm in his return from the holy wars, defign- 
ed by it to exprefs his gratitude for his deliverance ; and, in 
confequence of a vow, built the prefent parifh church. Had 
the fignlfication been the hill of Tay, as Taodunum^ according 
to Buchanan, it would in Gaelic have been pronounced 
Buntaw. The ancient name was Alec^ in Boece*s Latip,

jUiSfum^ and hj this it is diftinguifhed in the highlands. 
The ilgnification of Alee is faid to be pleafant or beaafifuL 
The language fpoken by the inhabitants, has, from time im- 
mcmorial, been the broad Scotch ; that is Englifh or Saxon, 
tvith a peculiar provincial accent. The namce ot places in 
the parifli are partly in this language, and partly G :eHc. Of 
the forntjer kind are Blaeknefs^ Coldjicie^ Clepingtovm and Clay'* 
fots, Balgay^ Dudbope^ Drumgeiib^ Duntroan, BaldovU^ and 
Tarious others are examples of the latter. 

Situation^ Extent^ Mc. — ^The parifli of Dundee is fitnated 
in the county of Angus, now calle'd, in writings, Forfarfliire, 
from the county town. The length from W. to E. is about 
6 miles, but its breadth is various ; for, towards the weft end, 
it is nearly two miles, towards the middle, where the town 
ftands, not more than one, and towards the eaft end, between 
tiiree and four *. The territory of the parifli belongs to a

intdllgible defcription of its form. The ridge of mountuos, which runs from 
Perth to the eaft promontory of Angus, called the Red Head, feparating be* 
tween this country and Strathmore, is well known, being a continuation of the 
Ochll Hiils; and in the parts where it approaches nearefl to the pai(h of Dun*

the weft, to the Rnock-Hilli near Arbroath on the eaft, where it forms the fouth 
boundary of a fort of vale or ftrach, contained between them artd the ridge oi

Burn, rifes on the north of the Law, and running eaft» and 
then fouth, falls into the Tay at the eaft end of the royalty^ 
and at the difiance of a quarter of a mile from the mouth of 
the former. Between thefe two, on the fea-fhore, and on a' 
low flat ground, the ancient town of Dundee is faid to have 
been fituated. It feems to have confided of two parallel 
ftreets, the Seagate, and on the north of it the Cowgate. In 
the broadeft part of the Seagate, remains of the ancient crofs 
were fome years ago to be feen ; and, by marks in the prefent 
caufeway, its fituation is (till diftinguilhed. Weft from the 
mouth of the firft ftream, the ground rifes into rocks, which 
are from 5c to 90 feet above the level of the Tay. On one 
ef thefe, the ancient caftle ftood, and on the grounds lying 
among them, and declining towards the eaft and fouth from 
them, the more modern and largeft part of the town b fituat«

Huntingdon, a great part of the grounds was probably in % 
ftate of cultivation, and the ordinary defignation of the church 
was for a long time the Kirk in the Jield. From thefe rocks, 
the ground continues to rife all the way weft to Balgay-Hill, 
and forms a fort of ridge, bounded on the fouth by the Tay, 
and on the north by the Balgay ftream. The yalley, where 
the ftream runs, is exceedingly beautiful \ and few fituations 
can be conceived more delightful, than thofe of the caftle of Dud- 
hope, and the houfe of Logie to the north of the valley; of the 
houfe of Balgay, at its weftem extremity ; or of Blacknels on the 
ridge on the fouth of it. On this ridge, the late additions to 
the town have chiefly been built, and they extend along the

gaj, Duntroon, and the Law But the neighbourhood of 
this large town Teems to place all thcfe varieties of foil upoa 
a level. They are, in general, in a ftate of high cultivation, 
and produce valuable crops. Inftead of large pieces of moor, 
which, within the laft 30 years, were to be found every 
where, th^rc is hardly to be feen a fingle fpot. All is culture 
or plantation, except a few acres of common, and very little 
lies wafte through neglefl. 

Cultivation. — ^The number of people, wbo have farms, is 
31 or 3a. But of farmers, properly fo called, and wbo make 
farming their only bufinels, there are not more than 15* Thp 
praftice of one of the moll induilrious and inteHigent, is a# 
follows* He rents 130 acres at 40s. per acre: he keeps 
conflantly 7 fervants, and 8 horfes ; he employs in fpring 
3 ploughs, each wrought by 1 hoifes, and in winter, % 
ploughs wrought by 4 ; and he ufes 4 carts, whofe dimen- 
fions are 8 feet by 4. His land is laid out in 7 divifions cul- 
tivated in this rotation ; I fallow, % wheat, 3. potatoes and 
turnips horfe-hoed, 4. barley, 5. oars, with grafs feeds, 6. grafs, 
chiefly fold green, and cut and carritd off by the buyers, 7. 
grafb cut for hay. In this rotation, the whole manure is 
given to the wheat, and the fjftem fetms to be approved of 
by his neighbours, and generally adopted. He begins to four 
wheat in heptember, oats in March, barley in April, turnips 
from the loth to the middle of June; and his cxDps of giain 
are generally reaped in September, The reap. u^ is uh^-lly 
performed by the fickle, and all the kinds of giain arc bujnd 
infheaves, and, while on the field, fet up in iboiks. Aw acre 
of good turnips fells from 7 1. to 10 L, according to the diiluuep

irom tlie town. The buyer takes them up and carries them 
oSr the grounds, and none are fed off in the field* The pota- 
toes are chiefly planted by Dundee manufacturers, who alfa 
clean them with hand hoes, and take them up, The farmer 
puts the ground in proper order for receiving them, and 
draws from 4 1. to 61. the acre. This prafbice is attended 
vith the beft efiefts, to the health and more eafy fubfiftence 
ef the manufacturer and his family ; and to the farmer ia 
clearing his land from weeds, which it does moreeffedually than 
any other method. An acre of good grafs, for green feeding, 
like the turnip, draws from 7 1. to 10 1. and even 12 1. The 
plough generally ufcd is the improved Scotch one, though Small^s 
plough begins alfo to be introduced. No threfhing machines 
liavc hitherto been employed, though there are many in vari- 
ous parts of the neighbouring country, and though one kind 
of them is fpoken of with approbation. Probably the reafcn is, 
that we have no farms fo large as to make them necefiary, or 
to pay fuflRciently for the original expence. The corns, when 
through t olF the field, are all flacked in the barn-yard, and gew 
aerally raifed about 3 feet above the ground, on wooden 
frames fupported by ftone pillars. Fanners have been, for si 
long time, the only inftruments employed in winnowing. 
The principal manures, in addition to what every farm fup- 
plies, are dung from Dundee, and lime, chiefly from Sunder- 
land. No fervices are in this pariih exaded from the far- 
mers ; and this opprefTive cuftom, though flill fubfifting in 
Ibme other parts of Angus-ihire, Is here happily abolilhed. 

Cattle. — ^Thc greatefl part of the parifli is inclofed with 
licdges and ftone fences, but, except in fome parts diftant fronii 
the town, the inclofures are feldom ufed for paflure. The 
cattle of all kinds are good, but the parifh is not remarkable 
for any peculiar breed. The farmers breed fome borfes, but

ty no means in number fafficient for the demands of the neigh* 
bourhood, or for their own labour. Ti)e market in Dundee* 
for all kinds of butcher meat, is one of the beft in Scotland*. 
No (beep are bred, or even fattened for fale, except a few b/ 
Mr. Guthrie of Craigie. He has tried in his inclofures the 
large fouth country breed, and endeavoured to introduce that 
of Mr. Bakewell, with tolerable fuccefs. The birds aad qua-* 
drupeds, wbich are not domefticated, are the fame that it^ 
quent the other low country parilhes near the fea, and feem to 
require no particular enumeration. No part of the pariifa is 
fubjeA to inundations, except the bottom where Fiethj and 
Dightj join ; but no confiderable damage is done, either to 
the grounds, or to the crops upon them ; aod though the 
cquinoftial tides fometimes rife high, they have not, in any 
perfon's memory, been hurtfuL 

Climate and Difeafes.-^'tJo part of the parilh can be called 
unhealthy* The higher and weft part of the town of Dun* 
dee, and the whole ridge, on which the priucipal additions ta 
it have been built, is naturally as healthy a fituation, (from its 
gravelly bottom, the conftant current of the tides, and its ex« 
pofure to the S. W. winds,) as, perhaps, any in the world. E- 
ven the fuburbs to the N* £. though on a bottom of till, are 
bealthy, for the declivity of the fituation prevents all ftagaa-* 
tion of water. The low grounds behind the town are, in-

* The veal, in particular, has of Ute years become excellent, in confeqnence 
«f an improvement introduced, by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, in the 
management of the calves. Inftead of confining them in low, dirty, and opca 
ftalls, they are placed in boxes nifed fome feet above the groofid, by which. 
means they are more eafily kept dean, warm, and dry, and care is alio takea 
by giving a cover to every box, to exclude the light. In confequence of thefe 
and fome other attentions, the veal equals, if not exccUs, the beil produced is

deed, hitherto, but infufficientlj drained, and the honfes to 
the fouth, which border on them, e^thibit fome inconfiderable 
marks of dampneis. But the principal caufes of unhealthi* 
Befs in Dundee, are the height of the houfes, the narrownefs 
of the tenements and of fome ftreets, bj which the people 
urere too much crowded upon one another* The bounds of 
the rojaltj were too confined for the increafing number of the 
inhabitants, and it was only within the laft 30 years, that 
thej began to extend their l^uildings beyond its limits. But 
with all thefe defe&amp;s, Dundee may be confidered as a very 
healthy place; the fmall-pox, indeed, is often epidemical 
«id fatal, for inoculation is, hitherto, but imperfedly intro- 
duced; but fevers are feldom infediojus, and agues almoft 
unknown. The crowded places of the town, indeed, are un« 
favourable to children, but probably not more fo than other 
crowded places ; and as one evidence of its healthinefe, it may 
be mentioned, that in a diftrid containing 1800 inhabitants^ 
only two perfons, in the fummer of 1789, were found confin- 
ed to bed. Lefs rain falls here than at Perth, for, by the 
Carfe and Siedlaw hills to the north, and the Fi£e hills to the 
fouth, the clouds are attrafted, and frequently carried away 
from this town and neighbourhood *• The village, of the Fer« 
ryf in particular, at the eaft end of the parifh, near Broughty 
(Taftle, is uncommonly dry and wholefome, and, perhaps, bet* 
ter fitted for fea-bathing, than any other place on the eaft 
eoafl. of Scotland. The mod frequent endemial difeafes are con- 
fumptions and the fcrophula, by which laft, perhaps, the for. 
mer are principally produced. The fcrophula feems chiefly 
to aSeft the families of linen-weavers, who fometimes feed 
poorly, and whofe manufa&amp;ure is carried on in damp and 
low floors. We have no lake, or even pool of ftanding

from the town, there are but one or two places where fmall 
veflels can come to land. The harbour of^ Dundee lies to 
the fonth of the rocks, on which the principal part of the 
town is fituated $ and here the ground flopes to the water more 
gently, and the harbour is capable of receiving veiTels of 300 
tons. Eaftward from the flat ground, where the ancient part 
of the town was bnilt, and along the eftate of Graigie, the 
ihore again becomes rocky, but in feveral places fmall vef- 
fels may come to land. Beyond this eftate, the coaft faHs low^ 
cr, excepting at one promontory called the Hare Craigs^ and 
at the Ferry, near Broughty Caftle^ it becomes a flat links^ with 
e fine gravelly beach, where larger veiTels nuiy fafely ap^ 
proach. In the tides there is no peculiarity. As the cun- 
rent in the north fea flows fouth, we have high water about 
half an hour fooner than at Leith, and at the harbour the fife 
from low to high water is, in the higheft ftreams, about xB 
or 10 feet. Some rocks lie off the harbour, but, excepting 
4, which have buoys, or beacons, they rife above the furface 
of the water. The current of the Tay, efpecially after land 
floods, is rapid. Many fand banks lie to the eaftward be^ 
tween this harbour and Errol, and they are all on the north 
fide of the river. The principal channel of the Tay is on the 
Fife fliore, and it is only by this that veflels of any burdeli 
can go up to Perth or Newbui^gh. "Continual incronchment's 
are made by this river, on the low lands of the Carfe of Gow- 
tie, and the Inch of Mugdruro, oppofite to Errol ; and th* foil 
which is walbed away, comes down with the tide, and is de- 
pofited all along our ihores, efpecially in the harbour. A 
bafon, whieh they fliut at high water, and open when the tide 
has left the harbour, was, for a long time, the only refource 
for clearmg away ihe foil, which is thus depofited. The

the foil from fettling ; and before this contrivance the harbour 
was in danger of being filled up. To the eaft of the harbour, 
all the way to Broughty Ciftle, there is an excellent road for 
ihips of any burden, which can get within the bar, acrofs the 
mouth of the river. This is about 8 miles below Dundee, 
and as veiTels can hardly attempt to crofs it, in a fiorm, many 
Shipwrecks happen on the coaft beyond it, when the ilorm is 
from the ead, and the veBTels are found too near the fhore« 
The principal fcene of thefe wrecks is St. Andrew's bay, and

eept fome fea trout, after i( leaves' the pa,riQi, to fall into the

thefe ; and as they foon leave the places where they are onc« 
difturbed, they are now feldom feen farther up than Mony« 
fieth. The falmODi caught in the river, go principally x» 
the London market, freih or pickled. To carry them frelh„ 
the method firft fuggcfted by Mr. George Dempfter, of pack* 
ing them in ice, has been found of the greateil confequenc^ 
and is now confiantly adopted. The price of falmon here it 
•Iways regulated by that of the London market, and general- 
ly goes beyond it* Our falmon fiihings begin later than to- 
wards Perth, and confequently lefs is carried in a frefli ftate 
to London. The rent of all the (almon fiihings in the river 
probably exceeds 3000 1. annually ; but of this rent, thofe on 
our (hores yield a very inconfiderable part. The currents of 
the Tay being rapid, the channels of its waters are often 
changed, and. confequently, in this part of the river the ial"- 
mon often change thei^ courfe, and the annual value of any 
particular fifliing alters. A fiihing on the Fife ihore, oppo^ 
fite to Broughty Callle, was let in 1789, at no greater yearly 
rent than 40 1. and in that year the tackfman is bid to have 
cleared no lefs than 3C0 1. As the parifh is fituated a good way 
within the bar of the river, we have no fea weed for manure. 
Some kelp is made, but in fo fmall a quantity, that the Ihorea 
yield no rent ; and any perfon who pleafes is alkwed to bum 
h. I know of no uncommon plants in the parifh, or any uq« 
common (hells upon its Ihores ; neither fpunges nor corals 
fire to be found.

They were always in feafon, except from February to May, 
The cod and ling are not plentiful^ and they are inferior in 
quality to thofe taken farther north. The mackarel and her* 
rings come from beyond Fife Nefs, and are principally taken 
in Autumn. All the towns of Angus afford excellent 
jnarkets for all thefe kinds of fiih, the town of Dundee efpe« 
cially ; but it is now poorly and irregularly fupplied. Be. 
tween Monyfieth and Arbroath, confiderable quantities o€ 
crabs and lobfters are found. The lobfters went chiefly to the 
XxHidon market, till lately, that by overfi(hing« none were to 
be had of a proper itze, and, on this account they were fat 
fome time fpared, and more of them come to the market of 
Dundee. Mufcles and cockles come from the moath of the 
£den, nearSt. Andrews, and are fold by meafnre. Thedefeft 
ef out Tea fifliing is, that the fiQiermen live too far up the riveo, 
•nd, their boats being fmaller than in the times when fmug- 
gling prevailed, they do not go cut to deep^enough water, and 
cannot always venture to crols the bar. We have no oy£-

are the remains of a fortification, the ditch of which is ftifl

have been fuppofed to be cemented by the force of fire, one

although it has not been jet explored, it is certainly of an« 
common extent— The Ikeletoa of the firil elephant dilTeded 
in Britain, was fome years ago to be feen ; the diffeftion was 
made by Dr. Blair, an eminent phyfician of Dundee, and a 
• memoir which he drew up concerning it, is to be found ict 
the London Philofophical Tranfa&amp;ions. — ^From the council 
minutes, which yet remain, it appears, that coal mines wer» 
wrought in Scotland, at a much more early period than is 
oommonly believed ; for they (hew, that in the i6th century, 
ctoals were the principal and common fuel. The iame mi« 
mites fnrnifli many eridences of the uncertain and changeable 
▼alue of money ; for, in 1589, the price of a boU of coals* 
which probably confiiled, as at prefent, of 800 lb. weight, 
and which now fells at 6 s. cofi* in 1610, z 8.6yd. Mr* 
David Lindfay the parfon, (who afterwards was biihop of 
Brechin, and probably tranflated thence to Edinburgh,) values 
23 bolls of meal, 13 bolls of oats, and 10 bolls of wheat, paid 
him out of the Abbey of Lindores, at no more than 8 1. 6 s. 
8d. yearly ; and in place of that quantity of vidual, has that 
annual fum fettled on him by the council : and, in the fame 
year, Mr. James Gleg leaves the regency or profefforlhip of 
St. Salvator's college, St. Andrews, in order to be chofen rec«

Population. — ^As to the fiate of the population of the town 
and parifhy in remote times, it is impoffible togive any acoounts ; 
nor can thofe which we may attempt to give, even for the lad 
century, be deemed fully fatisfaAoxy- The greateft part of the 
ancient records and documents, is faid to have been carried off or 
deftroyed, at the various fiegesof the town, andefpecially whea 
k was ftormed by Monk ; and though fome council minutes 
lemain, as far back at 1587, and a record of perfons inroUed 
ns burghers, beginning in 15139 they afford very little affif- 
tance in this inveftigation. The regifter of baptifns and 
marriages, reaches no farther back than 1645, and contains 
BO more than five complete years before the fatal affault in 
x65i« As, however, we have of late years, three a&amp;ual enu- 
merations of the inhabitants, one in X766, when their num* 
ber was )bund to be 11,416; one in 1781, when it turned 
•ut 15,700 ; and one in 1788, when it was 199329, we are 
enabled, from a comparifon of the marriages near thefe pe- 
riods, with the marriages about 165 1, to form fome probable 
conjectures about its former population. The annual ave« 
rage of the marriages for the 5 years, previous to 1651, is 85.

* Under the head of sntiquittet may alfo be (Uted the Tsrioot attacks and 
ficfet of the town. It wai twice taken by the Eogliih in the days of King £d« 
ward I. and as often retaken by the heroes Wallace and Bruce, and the caille 
was demoliflied by the latter. It was again taken and reduced to afbes hj 
Richard If. and a fourth time by the Engiilh, who, in the reign of Edward VL 
held Broughty Caftle. The Marquis of Montrofe took it by aflault, «nd gave 
it up to pillage, which feems to have been prevented by the approach of an ar- 
my of the Covenanters ; and to cover his retreat from them, the north and eaft 
]parts of it were fiet on €re. The laft and moft deftni^ive fiege, when it waa» 
■gain taken by aflaalt| and completely pillaged, was in Cromwdl's time by Ocf 
yenHMoBk. 



of Dundee. 109 

Bat the anniiftl average of the marriages, for the 5 yean, imme- 
diately preceding 1766, is 240; and as 140 to 12,416, theac* 
tnal number of inhabitants, in 1766, fo is 85 to 7544. The 
average number of marriages again for the 5 years preceding 
1781, is 149, and as 149 to 15,700, fo is 85 to 8937 ; and, in 
like manner, as 215, the average number of\he marriages for 
the 5 years preceding 1788, is to X9329, fo is 85 to 7641. 
Thefe are the three refults for the number of the inhabitants 
in 1651 J the medium of the three brings it out 8,047  ^"d» 
it is probable, that this conjedure does not err widely from 
the truth. It is tru^ that a iimilar comparifon, inftiluted be- 
tween the averages of the bf ptifms, at thefe different periods, 
would bring out in 1651, a population not le(s than 12,597 ; 
but more inefped feems, on many accounts, to be due to the 
regifter of marriages,, than to that of baptifms. All marriages, 
•whether regular or not, have hitherto been carefully record- 
ed ; but, befides that many neglef^, or find it inconvenient, to 
record their children's names, (and thefe omii&amp;ons are much 
more readily overlooked, in large places, than in fmall), it is 
to be obferved, that previous to 1651, there were few or no 
fe6taries ; whereas, fioce the revolution in 1688, and efpeci- 
ally, fince the rile of the Indep'fendents and Seceders, about 
Z732, many have thought regiftration in the records of the 
Eftablifhed Church, inconfiflent with their religious prin- 
ciples : confequently, the number of recorded baptifms, mud 
now bear a lefs proportion to the number of inhabitants than 
it did formerly ; and, the refult, for the former population, 
which is drawn from them, muft come out too great. 

The lols of people in the fiege by Monk, and efpecially in 
the carnage at the ftomling of the town, appears, on many ac- 
counts, to have been great, and cannot be eUimated at much 
Jefs than a fixth part of the whole inhabitants. Of X59 children, 
bom within the eight months immediately following, no lefs

than 15 are pofthumous ; and as 1599 to 8047, the whole num« 
^ ber of inhabitants, fo is 25 to 11651 ^^ number that maj be 
fuppofed to have been deftroj^d. It is true, that this diminu- 
tion of inhabitants does not produce anj immediate cffeft 
upoQ the marriages^ or baptifms, recorded in the regiften naj, 
that in the fix fucceeding years, the marriages are more nu- 
merous than before the fiege. But among thefe, 66 s^re the 
marriages of Englilh foldiers ; and though the baptifms, dur- 
ing this period, are not upon the whole increafed, but in a 
fmall degree diminiflied, 155 of them are of foldiers' childrep. 
Befides, the money fpent by a numerous garriibn could not 
fail to attrad people by the hopes of profit ; and, the cxaft 
4ifcipline of Cromwell's troops, and the regular diftribution 
of juflice, which took place during the whole time of his 
ufurpation, gave them full and unufual fecurity in their va- 
xious occupations. But on the withdrawing of the garrifou^ 
the deficiency of inhabitants, becomes immediately evident* 
Notwithftanding the acceflions which the garrifon has be^n 
fuppofed to attraft, a calculation from the marfiages brings 
put, after the reftoration, a diminution of 875 in the popula- 
tion ; and, towards the end of the reign of Chales II. and 
during the whole reign of James VIL a diminution of 1420. 
This diminution of population cannot bp afcribed to the 
flight or removal of the inhabitants^ on the forefight of the 
fiege ; for m^ny perfons, and fome even of the higheft ranl^, 
had repaired to Dundee, as a place of fecurity, and ftrength*

two batallions of Lord Duffus's regiment are iaid to have been 
ilaughtered; and, another body fufiered the like fate, in the 
.fquare called the fi(h-niarket. No umifaal provocation ap* 
pears to have been given to this feveritj. On the contrarjr, 
Mr. Gumble, general Monk's cha^^in, and who writes his 
life, fpeaks in high terms of the governor, for his gallant and 
brave defence* His head was, notwithftanding, cut ofF and 
fixed upon a fpike, in one of the abutments at the'fouth weft 
comer of the fteeple; and, till a few years ago, when the 
ftone where the fpike was inferted, fell down, the remains of 
it were obfervable. The fame indignity appears alfo to have 
been done to others* It is a tradition here, that the carnage 
did not ceafe till the third day, when a child was feen in a 
lane, called the Thorter-Row, fucking its murdered mother. 
Several perfons alfo, on this occafion, were carried prifoners 
to London, probably along with the 300 officers furprifed by 
Monk's Colonels, Alured and Morgan, at Alyth, when, col- 
leAing a body to raife the fiege* Among the prifoners, were 
Mr* Andrew Affleck, the parfon, or firil minifter, and Mr. 
John Robertfon the Vicar. They were detained at London 
till fpring 1653 j and, after their return Mr. Robertfon 
was fome time confined in the common prifon of Dundee* 
Mr* Affled was anceftor to the two brothers. Admiral and

Though no probable account can be given of the popula- 
tion in remote times, the town of Dundee appears to have 
been long ago a place of cooiiderable note* Edward I* 
thought it of fufficient confequence to be occupied hj an 
Englifh garrifon ; and, the illuftrious Wallace, (with his 
companions John Blair, probably of the fialthajock family, 
and Sir N. Campbell of Lochow,) is faid, by tradition, to have 
received his education at the Dundee fchool, and in this iitua- 

tion,

U01I9 to have begun his exploits, with the death of the fon to 
the EngUih governor. Of the 4 boroughs* Edinburgh, Perth, 
Dundee and Aberdeen, which were of fiioh conCequence, in 
all the reigns, after that, of Robert Bruce, as to give fecurity 
Cor the obfervation of national treaties, it was the third in 
irank : Its ihare, in the reign of James VI. of the whole pub- 
lic taxes, was a 25th part, and of thofe laid upon the boroughs^ 
femetioies a tenth parr, but more frequently a 5th ; and of 
the xaoo xnerks impofed upon the towns of Dundee, Forfar, 
Arbroath and Perth, for fitting out the yacht, Mary "gallant^ 
to fetch home the king and queen from Denmark, the pro* 
portion paid by Dundee was 700. At the ftorm by Monk, 
Gumble fpeaks of it as a very rich and thriving place \ he 
tells us, in particular, of 60 (hips taken in the harbour, and 
fent away loaded with booty, confifting chiefly of plate and 
money ; and, difapproving of the rapacity of the plunderers, 
mentions, with apparent fatisfadion, the lofs of the whole 
ieet, in croffing the bar of the river. 

A calamity, probably no lefs fatal to the town of Dundee, 
than the fiege and fiorm by Monk, was the fevere 7 years 
dearth in the end of the lad century. The annual average of 
marriages for 5 years, was atthat time reduced to 54; and from 
the effeds of this calamity, we never recovered till feveral years 
after the rebellion in 1745. Though the union of the kingdoms 
put an end to the arbitrary and tyrannical proceedings of the 
government in Scotland, it produced a new caufe of depreffion 
to this particular diftrlA. Our fiaple roanufa&amp;ure was the 
fpinning and weaving the coarfe woollens, called Platding. 
Thefe were fent to the Dutch- market, and there thickened 
and dyed, for clothing to the troops in various parts' of Ger- 
many. This branch of trade, we have, by the lofs of our 
Dutch and French privileges, loA fo completely iince the Uni- 
on, that now no remainder of it is to be found. The annual 

average 



£14 Stattftical Account 

average ef the marriages, for the 5 je^rs pr^ceditfg 1746^ 
does not exceed 56 ; this gives a population no greater than 
5302 ; and from other reafons^ it is probable, that this con-^ 
dufion is not much b«low the truth. At thecrofs, in the prin- 
cipal ftreet of the town, there were not in that year, above 4 
or 5 hbufes completely built of fione, all the reft were part* 
Ij of wood. No (hop rented at more than a 1., or at the ut- 
moft 3 L ; the retailers who rented them were generally poor^ 
^d three ihops at the crofs, which three years ago were fold 
for 450 1. each, were then entirely fhut. At that time, alfo, 
there were only two churches, for public worfhip ; and though 
there were no Seceding mectmg-houfes, and the lodependent 
congregation was very inconfiderable, if one church was well 
filled on Sundays, the other was nearly empty« 

We have no regifter of burials, that can be depended upoo^ 
except for the laft 5 years; and this we eue entirely to the 
care and attention of Dr. Willifon, one of our principal phy- 
ficians. As the infertion of the whole would fwell this ac- 
count to too great bulk, the fafts which follow, as feeming 
to be moft important, are extra&amp;ed from it. From February 
xft. 1787 to ditto 1788, the number of burials was 552 ; from 
1788 to 1789, in v{)iich period a very malignant kind of 
fmall pox raged» the number was 867 ; from 1789 to 1790, 
it was 609 ; from 1790 to X791, when the (mall pox agaia 
raged, accompanied with the chincough, it was 840, and from 
1791 to 1792, 890. The annual average of burials, there- 
fore, for thefe 5 years, is 752 ; and the proportion of deaths, 
to the whole number of inhabitants, may, with probability, 
be reckoned nearly that of z to 31. The excefa of the buri- 
als in 1791, above thofe of any year, wherein the finall pox 
did not prevail, is principally to be afcribed to frefli acceffions 
of inhabitants ; for, though a putrid fore throat was at that 
time epidemicali I do aot find, after the moft minute inquiries, 

that,

tbat it was fatal to more than 50 people. The proportion of 
burials, of males Co thofe of females, is nearly asziotoiij; 
ivhereas the proportion of births, of males to thofe of femalest 
taken from the record of baptifms, bj sf medium of averages 
for 5 years, at different periods, is nearly as 145 to 118. 
The average number of children, dying under a, is 236 : 
from 2 to 5, 98; and of ftilUbom children 50. The moft fatal 
period to people advanced in life, is from 60 to 70, ivhere 
the annual average of death3 is 57 ; and to young people 
paft childhood, from 15 to 25, when the fame average 19 
47^ The moft fatal mouths are January, March, and De- 
cember, the averages of burials in thefe being refpeclively 88, 
73» 74* ^^^ perhaps the mod important fa&amp; in the whole 
regiller, and which ought to excite attention from the perfons 
mod averfe to the pradice of inoculation^ is, that, while in 
1787 and 1789, the average number of children dying under 
5, was only 17I9 a fimilar average fqr the years 1788 at;d 
1790, in which the fmall pox raged, arofe to the aftoniihing 
fi^m of 410* The whole number of people reported as dying 
^bove 90, in all the 5 years of the regifter, is 2 j; of whom one 
was in the 99th year; another above the lootb, another in the 
I02d, and another jrobably in the 107th year of their feve- 
ral lives. The name of the laft was James Peter, who died 
in 1790* A correfponding date of his father and mother's 
marriage, was certainly found in the pariih regifter of Dun- 
nichen. Their mar^age was (aid to have fubiided onlyi year, 
and he affirmed, that he was their only child. 

Since the enui^eration in 1788, the town continues to in- 
creafe with greatei^ rapidity than before ; and the whole in- 
habitants of the totihi and pariih can hardly be eilimated at 
led than 24,000 \ they are certainly rated fulficiently low at

try pari£b, do not exceed I zoo, (and this is nearly doable their 
number in 1 759)9 the town and fuburbs of Dundee maj 
be faid to contain from 22,000 to 22,500 fouls. The re- 
turn to Dr. Webfter in 1755, for the town and diftrid^ 
was only iSt477 fouls; fo that calculating the popnla« 
tion now at the medium number of 23,500, the increafe 
is 11,123 fouls. On the borders of the parifli, there are 
two villages, the North Ferry near Broughty Caftlc, part 
of which runs into the parifti of Monyfieth, and our pro- 
portion of people in it is 166 : the other is Loch-eye, chiefly 
in the parifh of LifF; and in this our proportion is hitherto 
but inconiiderable. 

ManufaBures. The principal and (laple manufafture of 
Dundee is linen of various kinds; viz. i. Ofnaburghs, and other 
iimilar coarfe fabrics of different names, for exportation, and 
which alone, till lately^ were fubjefted to the national ftamps. 
The quantity of thefeftamped, between November 1788 and 
ditto 1789, amounted to 4,242,653 yards, valued at 108, 782 i. 
Z4S. 2d. ; and fnbtrading from this a fourth part, fnp- 
pofed to be brought from fix neighbouring parifhes, to the 
Dundee (lamp offices, there will remain for the quantity 
made in this parifl), 3,181,990 yards, in value, 80,587 1. os. 
8d. 2. All the different forts of canvas for ihipping. This 
fabric is entirely confined to the town, and the quantity an- 
nually made may be rated at 704,000 yards, and valued at 
32,000 1. The cloth of this kind, made by fome of the prin- 
cipal manufadurers, is thought to be fuperior in quality to 
any otker in Britain ; and, by a regulation now introduced; 
and for which we are chiefly indebted to Mr. Graham of 
Fintry, of fubjeding it to the infpeftion of public ftamp-maf- 
ters, will probably retain its charafter. A procefs is alfo 
known, by which the buyer, at a fmall additional expence^ 

maj 



(ftiundec. iij 

The quantity annually made, may amount to 16,600 yards| 
and may be valued at 800 1. 4. Bagging for cotton wool, in 
quantity 165,000 yards, and in value 5,500,!. 5. Some 
diaper by one company lately eftabliflied. 6. The greateft 
part of all the linen neceflary for houfehold purpofes i but 
the quantity and value of this cannot be exadly afcertained. 

Befides all thefe kinds of linen, the manufafture of cotton 
has been lately introduced, and will probably foon become a 
Tery important branch of bufinefs. Seven companies are aU 
ready engaged in it. They employ about 400 men, women and 
cbUdpren, in fpinning cotton into yarn for wool. They are fup« 
pofedto fpin annually 135,000 lbs. of yarn, valued at 20,2501*; 
and, with warp, which they buy f'rom diftant cotton mills^ 
mod of thefe companies have begun to work up their yarn 
into callicoes, handkerchiefs, and coarfe waiftcoats. One 
company alfo fpins yam for muflin, to the annual value of 
3000 1. An Englifli company from Lambeth is alfo engag-. 
cd in eftablifhing an woollen manufa&amp;ure, where every branch 
of the bufinefs, from the wool to the iinifhed cloth, is propofed 
to be carried on. The looms employed in all the kinds of 
weaving, and in all parts of the parifli, are from x8oo to

T he manufadure of coloured thread has been eftablifhed 
in Dundee for 50 or 60 years, and was for a confiderable tims 
peculiar to it. This bufinefs is in the hands of 7 different 
companies or mafters, who ufe 66 twilling mills, and employ 
about 1340 fpinners, and 370 fervants, to make the yarn into 
thread. The quantity annually made is computed at 269,568 lb. 
and valued at 33«6g61. The fpinners live in diftant parts of 
Scotland, where labour is cheaper than in Dundee.

curriers, in dreiling part of what is tanned for upper leathers 
to flioes ; 95 in making boots and ihoes for exportation, and 
aoo in fupplying the confumption of the town. The value 
of boots and ihoes ezpogted maj be about 4385 1. As the 
demand for tanned leather has, for fome jears, greatlj increaf- 
fed, confiderable difficultj is fcmnd in procuring raw hides, 
and the price of oak bark is doubled. This bufinefs is upon 
the increafe. Two new enterpriiing and aftive companies 
have of late engaged in it, fo that probably it will be more 
than doubledt 

Two companies are engaged in manufa&amp;urlng cordage of 
all k-inds for (hipping, and ropes for all the various ufes of 
the country. They employ about 30 perfons, and they alfo 
carry on the whole bufinefs of ihip-chandlers. Soap was fome 
years ago manufactured to a coniiderable amount ; but this 
bufinefi now declines, and laft year only yielded of duty to 
government the fum of 1828 L 19 s. 0^. It is thought 
that this bufinefs will not only be abandoned here, but that 
it will foon be totally loQ to Scotland. The fuppofed caufes 
are either regulations of excife, partial to England, or fu-i 
perior rigour in carrying the common regulations into execu- 
tion. It is poflible, however, that the real caufe may be 
foolifli attempts to underfell their richer Englifh neighbours. 
It may here be mention/ed, as an article of curiofity, that foap 
making was an art known in Dundee, as far back as the 
1 6th century. 

Within thefe 3 or 4 years, the manufafture of glafs has been 
introduced, and the company engaged in it have ereded two 
glals-houfes; one for bottles, and the other for the white kinds 
of window glafs. Hiey employ in the bufinefs 100 perfons, 
and laft year it yielded to government a duty of 3046 1. Ma- 
ny perfons are alfo employed in manufa&amp;uring tobacco and 
fnuff ^ and one company is engaged in a fugar houfe, but of its

omitted as being jet in their infancy, (for example, caft iron 
and fait,) or though long efiablifhedyfufficientlj accounted for 
bj the taxes thej paj to Government, % banking companies 
are eftabliflied in Dundee ; and two diftant companies, one in 
Edinburgh, and one in Paiilejr, have opened bank offices. The 
quantity of paper money, in conftant circulation from all the 
four, is eftimated at 1 60,000 1. Infurances againft fire are al- 
fo made by a company, confiding of ,50 or 60 perfons, whofe 
property is fuppofed to amount to half a million ; and by 
whom, though formed into a company only a few years a- 
go, infurances are already made to the value of 800,000 !• 

Revenue paid to Government. '-^ome, part of the revenue, 
arifing from Dundee to Government, may be accurately or 
nearly afcertained, but a much more confiderable part muft 
be left to conjedure. 

Of the firft kind are the duties of excife for the year, 
ending with the 5th of July 1792, and communicated in 
the moil obliging manner, by Mr. Mitchell, fupervifor ; and 
they are accompanied with a comparative (late of the excif«

habitants. With refpefl to thofe on ale and malt, it ought 
not to pafs unobferyed, that thej have for a long time gradu- 
ally decreafed, and do not now yield a fum equal to its produce 
in 1745» when the pari(h did not contain above 6000 people. 
In that year the town's grant, of twopennies on the pint of ale« 
IS faid to have yielded 500 L In 2757 it gave 423 1. 9 s. and 
its produce in 1791 was no more than 3261. 6 s. ; this dif* 
ference is fuppofed to arife, in a great meafure, from the va- 
rious taxes \ by which the malt liquor here has been fo much 
deb^fed, that it ceafes to be the drink ufed in focial meetings, 
or for refrefhment from the fatigues of labour; and the people, 
deprived of their ancient, exbilerating, and wholefome beve- 
rage^ have recourfe to intoxicating and enervating fpirituous 
liquors. The increafed ufe of thefe is certainly a mod alarm- 
ing circumfiance. They are fold in no lefs than 179 licenfed 
hoqfes; and the nun^ber of non-licenfed ones, where they may 
be procured, is believed to be very great ; whereas formerly 
the town was fufficiently, and perhaps, too Well fupplied by 
five or fix. 

Shippings Exports y Imports^ \Sc. — On the 5 th of January 
1792, there were 116 veiTels, belonging to the port, navigated

To thefe evidences of the thriving date of Dundee, and in« 
deed of the whole neighbouring country, a variety of others 
might be added. In 1772, no more than 5 or 6 houfes were 
to be feen between the weft end of the royalty and Blacknefs ; 
flow upwards of 100 acres have been feued out, in the fame 
diftrift for building on, and upwards of 4000 people fettled 
in it. About 1770, the feu duty, even for the lands nearell 
the town, did not exceed 3I. or 3I. ids. the acre, and this 
was fuppofed to be an advantageous price ; now lots of 10 or 
12 acres, of a much greater diftance, are feued by Mr Hun- 
ter of Blacknefs, at 10 1, and fubfeued at X4l. the acre. 
Among the lateft £eus near the town, may be mentioned about 
4 acres of land, cliieily under the management of the Kirk- 

felToa, 



tf Dundee. 223 

feiSon. Thefe» altogether, for manj years pad, ^ere rented 
at 3L Laft year they were feued at 40 1. the acre. la like 
manner in 1754, when there were only two churches on the 
cftablifliment for public worfhip, the feat rents of that por-i 
tion of them, which was the Town's, properly amounted to no 
more than 21 1. 4 s. 7d. Now, when there are 7 eftabliihed 
churches and chapels, the feat rents of the fame portioa 
amount to 1751* 

Befides the general advantages derived from the conftitU"' 
tion of the Britifh government, and the liberty and fecurity 
its fttbjefts enjoy, in all their lawful occupations, the particu«- 
lar caufe of the increafe and profperity of Dundee is, un« 
doubtedly, the bounty allowed by Parliament on all manafac- 
tured linens. By this the induftry of the inhabitants was firft 
fet in motion, and encouraged ; and their confequent profpe- 
rity, if it be not an evidence in favour of bounties in gene- 
ral, is, at leafl, a decifive one, that, in fome cafes, they are 
wife and judicious, and may be produ&amp;ive of the greateft be- 
nefit. Whether the linen manufafture could now be fup- 
ported without the bounty, or whether the fpirit of indu(lry» 
which is now awakened, could be eafily and profitably di* 
verted into other channels, is a que&amp;ion on which it would 
be prefumptuous in any private perfon to pronounce, and, 
perhaps, any experiment oa the fabjeA might be dangerous. 

Trices of Provifionsy Labour^ t^r— The average prices of 
beef through the year, and without diftinAion of particular 
prices, is 4 s. 6 d. the ftone, and this is alfo tlie general price 
of pork. Mutton, through the year, fells at from 4d. to 5 d*

CtmflittUion^ Privileges^ iSc. — The privileges of the town of 
Dundee, as a free and royal borough, are very ancient. A 
charter by King Robert Bruce, dated March 14th, in the 2 id 
year of his reign, and proceeding upon a recognition of its 
privileges by a jury, mentions its being pofTciTed of them' in 
the time of his prcdecefibr, William, who began to reign in 
1165 ; and that they were as ample as thofe enjoyed by the 
town of Berwick, or by any borough in Scotland. This char- 
ter, the recognition on which it proceeds, with the defigna- 
tions of the jury, and the commiflion to Bernard, Abbot of 
Arbroath, and Mr. Alex. Frafer, Chancellor of Scotland, to 
preiide as King's Lieutenants at the trial, whether now in ex* 
iflence or not, were in the poiTeffion of the Council not above 
50 years ago ; and the writer of this article has had an oppor* 
tunity to fee copies of them, with tranflations from the Latin, 
made by Mr. George Bruce, then redor of the grammar 
fchool. Thefe rights appear alfo to have been confirmed and 
enlarged by many fucceeding princes ; particularly, by David 
Bruce, James IL James IV. Queen Mary, James VL and 
Charles L So uncommon are fome of thefe, that by an edi£t 
of David Bruce, the villages of Coupar in Angus, Keltins, 
Kirriemuir, and Alyth, are prohibited from, holding markets; 
and all perfons difcharged, under the higheft penalties, from 
attending them, as being within the liberties 0/ Dundee. Be- 
fides a confirmation of rights. Queen Mary's charter conveys 
to the town all the pofleffions of the Dominican friars, Mi- 
norites, Francifcans, and Gray Sifters, St. Clement's charch, 
and its chaplabries ; with all their revenues and lands, among 
which were a third part of the lands of Craigie $ and, in par-

fettled, bj an agreement, under the diredion of Sir George 
Haljbiirton of Eotherance, and Sir John Leilie of Newton^ 
Lords of Seflion. Even after this agreement, many of the 
acknowledged powers of the Conftable were grievous and ha* 
miliadng to the inhabitants ; and thefe powers were never fi 
nallj aboliifaed, till the general abolition of all hereditary ja« 
rtfdifti.^s. ' • 

The conftttntton of govertiment eftablifhed in Dandee, ot 
what is called the Sit of the Borough ^ though apparently re« 
publican, is a fpecies of oligarchy, not materially differing 
from thofe eftabliflied, in general, over all the towns in Scot^ 
land. The Town Council is compofed of 20 perfons, include 
ing the magiftrates, confifting of a provoft, and four bailies. 
The annual ele&amp;ion of thefe inagiftrates, and aUb of the dean 
of guild, and treafurer, *is on the Thurfday immediately pre* 
vious to Michaelmas. But the council for the enfiiiifg yeaf

fures fixed, which are. generally decifive in the eleftion of the 
oficers juft now mentioned. The whele 20 counfeUors a^ 
Temble oh that day, and choofe 8 new counfeUors, of wbon 5 
muft be . taken from the gtitldry, or body of free merohantSt 
and 3 from any feparate three of the incorporated trades* No 
more new counfeUors than 8 are nece£GiTy, becaufe the 4

the additKn of thefe 8 new members, they proceed to mak# 
up Uetff or li(l$, for the offices of provoft, bailies^ dean of

people, who, at any time formerly have been bailies ; the 
leet for billies to former counfiellors ; that for the deai^ 
of guild to prefent bailies; and the k^t for the trea-

ihare in the eledion espire^ and the number of old and new 
couafellors is redticed to 26. The letts are then traofmitted 
to the convener of the 9 incorporated trades, to be bj him 
laid before his deacons and their Conftltuents. ^ On the Thurf- 
day thefe 9 deacons ailemble in the town-hall^ along with the 
a6 old and new counfellors, and proceed to eleft from the 
leets» by a majori^^ of votes, the 5 magil^ratesi, the dean of 
guild, and the treafurer. Thus, including the three remain- 
ing bailies. Who continue in the council without eledlon, a 
body of 18 new counfellors is formed for the enfuing year, and 
all the former offices expire; On the Tuefday following, 
thefe 18 choofe the remaining two* 

FrooB this accoititt, it muft be evident, that the formation 
of the new council is almoft entirely in the power of their 
predcfcefforsi and that a-'fociety, thus cinftttuted^ is but in a 
very fmall degree dependant upon the community, whofe in- 
tcrefts are intrufied to their management. No appeal what* 
over is made to the guildry, or great body of merchants, who 
nay beconfidered aft the 'ari/locracy of the place ; and the on* 
]ycontroul the council can receive, in the eledion of thett 
fucccflbrs, is froip the deacons of the incorporated trades, who 
may be confidered as the reprefeutatives of the people* Un- 
leis, however, a confiderable divifion, which feldom happens, 
Ihoold take place among the conndsllors, and at the fame time 
the deacons remain united, this controul muft be of very lit- 
de Gonfequence* Without, therefore, a greater degree both 
0f intelligence and public fpirit, than falls to the common lot 
of bnmaoity, fuch a Ibciety muft be under ftrong induce* 
aents to coafider itfelf as a fraternity diftinfl: from the com-

ger of becoming, in feme degree, arbitrarj and interefted. 

It would, however, be unjuft not to acknowledge, to the ho-* 
Hour of the magiftrates and coaneil of Dundee, that, in many 
inftances, the/ hare exerted themfelves with laudable zeal 
and fuccefs, in pronnoting the puUic good. The building 
and endowing new churches, the paving and lighting ftreets# 
the opening new ones, efpeciaHy ft new pafilige to the Ihore^ 
the building new piers, and the general improreraent of the 
S harbour, are works which they have executed within theb 

16 or 12 years, and which are both of great importance, and 
entitle then to no fmall (hare of praife. Many equally imo 
porCtnt, no doubt, yet remain to be done, and fome may have 
been neglefied \ but to thefe, ic is to be hoped* aooording as 
their revenues may enable them, they will not £m1 to turn 
their attention. 

The revenues of the town, not appropriated t» partkutnr 
purpofes, may amount annually to aiool. If to thefe we 
add the revenues of the gnildry, amounting to 80 1. } of the 
bofpital, for decayed burghen, amounting to 300 1. ; the funi 
•fifing from fome lands, but chiefly from feat rents, for buikU 
!ng and repairmg the churches, computed at j881. ; the inte* 
teft of money mortified for burfaries and fimilar purpofes, a« 
mounting to 60 1. ; and if we alfo include 400 1. levied from 
poor's rates \ the members of council will be found to have 
under their management an annual fum not much (hort of 
4dcol. 

While there was a Parliament in Scotland, Dundee was xe^

fire. The crofs part of the building lay oncdTered'till 1588^ 
when it was again fitted up for ufey by means of general tax*- 
ations laid on the inhabitants, by the authority of the town 
council, and by voluntary contributions. One of the princi^ 
pal contributors was captain Henry Lyell of Blacknefs, who» 
in an infcription^ (on which are his arms, the fame with thofe 
of Lovell)| aflumes the merit of the whole. 

At the Reformation^ only two minifiers feem to have been 
efiablilhed in the parifh, one called tbi Ftirfoh^ and die otbet 
the Vicar. The Scrymfeours of Dudbope^ cpnftables of the 
caftle, were patrons of the firft chargCt and the patronage of 
the laft belonged to the community. As the eare of the pa^ 
riih was too laborious for two minifierst Mr^ Jam^s Robert- 
fon the vicari on obtaining in x6o8, a fixed ftipeod of 800 
merksi refigned to the patrons his vicarage; and^ aboot 1609^ 
they appointed in his room an additional minifter, Mr* Wil* 
liam Wedderbum, who, in 1613, received alio a fixed ftipend^ 
equal to that of Mr. Robertfon, and gave up to the coundU 
the more cafual and infufficient produce of Che vicarage* 
Though thefe tranfa&amp;ions do not appear to have been autho^ 
rifed| by any decree of the Lords of EreftionSy and no confenf 
appears to have been either alked or obtained from the pa* 
iron of the firft charge, the patronage of both the others was 
confidered as the undoubted property of the community. Th^ 
pariih was thus fupplied with three mintfters^ one drawing 
his living from the parfonage teinds, and the other two from 
the various funds within the borough ; and they have always 
ofiiciated as colleagues in the two places of worihip, the choir 
and the fouth part of the crofs building in the ancient churchy 
As the inhabitants were found too numerous for being ac- 
commodated in two churches, the magiftratjes, in the year 1759^ 
fitted up the north part of the crofs building as a chapel of 
eafe; and the town continuing to increafci they built* ia

The Di^icnfiiry was eftabliibed in 1782. It is entirely fop. 
ported by Tolantaiy contributions, and has been of the gregt* 
eft iile. The prefident and principal benefaftor is Lord Doag«« 
la$« Bat the contributions of the remaining heritors, (a verj 
few excepted,) either to this or to any other chariuble inftitu^ 
tions of the place, notwitbftanding all the advantages they de* 
rive from it, are hardly worth the mentioning. To the Oi£» 
penfary, it is alfo now propofed to add an Infirmary ; and the 
liberal and numerous fubfcriptions already obtained, leave 
little reafon to doubt, that the putpofe will foon be carried in* 
|o execution. 

Gtmral €iaraS0r^^The people of Dundee have been for 
m long time entitled to the reputation of induftry, regularity 
and economy; and» notwitbftanding the increafe of their 
wealth and numbers, a juft claim to this reputation ftill co&amp;« 
dnues. As their wealth has been almoft entirely the refult 
of great attention and induftry, it is preferved by the fame 
virtues, and they are ftill ftrangers to extravagant and rui« 
nous luxuries. One inftance of economy and ancient finu 
plicity of manners, will, in fome parts of Britain, hardly meet 
with credit ; that, though we have many burghers, worth 
from 5000 !• to 40,000 L there are not in the whole town, 
more than 9 male houfehold fervants ; and of thefe, not one 
belongs to any perfoo, who can, with propriety, be faid to be 
engaged in trade* This economy does by no means exclude 
^eerful and frequent fecial intercourfe, or abridge their real 
comforts and recreations* It does not even banilh a liberal 
hofpitality ; and inftead of leflening their humanity and com* 
paflion for the miferable, the people of Dundee are inferior 
.to none in generous exertions and contributions, either for the 
relief of particular diftrefles and misfortunes, or for the ef« 
tablilhment and maintenance of public beoeficeat inftitutions.

lence* Tet it would be inconfiftent with truth, not to men^ 
tion, that profperity has introduced among fome, a degree of 
licentiouIbeCi unknown in former times ; and one alarming 
fymptom of it ought not to be concealed, that, notwithftand« 
ing the great accdBons made, iince the year 1788, to the 
Qumbef of inhabitants, the number of annual marriage^ 'has 
hardly received the fmalleft addition. The people of Dundee 
may be alfo charaderifed from their religious habits ; and no 
where in Scotland is public worfliip better, or perhaps fo well 
attended. Their numerous fe£ls indicate their zeal and at- 
tachment to religious principles, and perhaps an excefa of at* 
tention to religious controverfies ; but thefe give very little 
difturbance to the general harmony, and inftead of increaf- 
ing bigotry they feem to weaken it. Though fome feds, not 
only on their firft rife but even at prefent, cannot be acquitted of 
harih and uncharitable opinions, concerning thofe who do not 
adopt their fentiments, mutual toleration evidently prevails i 
and each begins to fufped, that the didates of their own par^ 
have no better claim to infallibUity^ than thofe of others. 

As to the general (ize of the inhabitants, it is certainly in-» 
JTerior to that of the people in the fouth and weft parts of 
Scotland, and even of their neighbours in various parts 61 
Fife : and though the linen manufafture be the great fouroe 
of their opulence and increafe, its influence does not feem fo 
favourable as might be wifhed to health, or friendly to the 
prodttdion of a vigorous and hardy race*

which none could have been more injurious to a country, 
where the former are fo diminutive in fize, and the latter fo

Frith of Forth was exempted from the general duty laid on all 
coals carried by fea, (a duty which the poor, in countries def. 
citute of coal, have feverely feh and bitterly complained of,) 
he procured, that the Tay fliould be included within the 
bounds of the Forth, and that the legal limits of the mouth 
of this river (hould be the Red Head in Angus, and St. Abb*3 
Head in Berwickihire. Dundee has alfo had the honour 
of being reprefented in many parliaments, by George 
DfMrsTER, £fq« of Dunichen, another native citizen* Of 
this gentleman's merits from his country, it would be im«

cd and enlighteticd patriot, Andrew Fletcher. They were 
fettled in Dnndee as merchants, in the i6th centurj, and pof- 
fefled of the lands of InverpeSer near Arbroath ; diftinguiih- 
ing themfelres, during the courfe of the 17th centarj, as 
magiftrates of Dundee, and like their defcendants, in vin- 
dicating its liberties, againft the arbitrary claims and en- 
croachments of the £aimily of Dudhope; and from thefe 
anceftors, it is probable, that he embibed fome portion of 
his patriotic fpirit. He fprung from a fecond fon of this 
Dundee family, and his defcendants are now its reprefcn- 
tatives, the elder branch having failed fome years ago, by the 
death of its laft male. Major Henrt Fletcher of the marines. 
Another branch of it is the family of Balinlhoe, which pro- 
duced the two brothers, Sir Robert and Colonel Fletcher, 
lately diftinguiibed in the Eaft Indies. 

The prefent Lord Loughborough, chief juftice of the com- 
mon pleas in England, is alfo defcended of a family long ref«' 
peSable in Dundee. The chiefs of it were fuccefBvely town 
clerks for near 100 years, and frejquently the town's com- 
miffioners to the parliament. In this iituation they acquir- 
ed the lands of Kingennie and Blackoels, and were honoured 
with the title of baronets. This title is now carried by Sir 
John Wedderburk of Ballendean, a native of Dundee, and 
male reprefeotative of the family. 

Advantages and Dif advantages. — The principal advantages 
of Dundee arc, — the noble river on which it is fituated, opien- 
ing to the inhabitants, a ready communication, not only with 
the London market, but with thofe of the principal and mod 
opulent countries of Europe ; and alfo giving them a confider* 
able extent of inland navigation :— The fertile countries in its 
neighbourhood, the Carfc of Gowric efpecially, full of thriv- 
ing, rich, and intelligent farmers ; whofe induftry, if it was 
fiifft fet in motion by the opulence of towns, and their increaf- 

ing 



of Dundee. 443 

ing demand for country produce, now amply returns the fa- 
vour, by equal demands ou the towns for their merchandife 
and manufaftures ; — ^The induftry, fobriety, and frugality of 
its inhabitants, which virtueSi having been confirmed by long 
habit, will probably continue to be reputable for along period 
to come. In addition to thefe, it mud draw the mod fignal 
benefits from the excellent turnpike roads lately conftrufted, 
and continuing to be extended through all the principal dif- 
trids of Angus, and the neighbouring parts of Perthlhire, 
For thefe the town is entirely indebted to the exertions of a 
few country gentlemen ; and though its inhabitants have had 
no ihare, either in the trouble or the rilk of the undertaking, 
they will be probably the principal Iharers in the profits \ for 
their markets inftead of being often ihut up, and becoming 
inacceilible, will now be open at all feafons of the year, for the 
heavieft goods ; and the people in diftant parts will no longer be 
under the necei&amp;ty of repairing to the lefs abundant markets of 
inferior towns. But if Dundee enjoys thefe advantages, it is 
not without its difadvantages and defers. Among thefe the 
following feem to be the mod remarkable : —The lanes, and 
even feveral ftreets are uncommonly narrow, and the dwellings 
of the inhabitants too clofe upon one another ^— the greateft 
part of the families living by half dozens, as formerly in Edin« 
burgh, under the fame roof, with common flairs, without 
back yards or courts, and many poflefiing only fingle rooms : — 
The late additional fuburbs have been built without apy ge« . 
neral plan, and without the leaft regard to health, elegance or 
cleanlinefs ; though no fituation perhaps in the world, prefent- 
ed better opportunities to provide for all the three : — ^There is 
an almoft total want of public walks and open places, to whicli 
fedentary or delicate people may refort, and children be car- 
ried for air and exercife. Several have been, or are about to 
be converted to private purpofes : one, which is the beft and 
moft important, is generally inaccefUble, through the badnefs

of the lane that leads to it ; and, the high roads being defiU 
tute of foot paths, thofe who have the greateft need of air, 
find themlelves, for a great part of the year, confined to their 
houfes, at lead thej cannot get beyond the (treets ; and thefe 
circumflances are the more vexatious, that the inhabitants of 
the royalty are taxed annually ibout 130 1. for road^fmrnej^ but 
find themfelves and their magiftrates totally excluded, in con- 
fequenee of a late law, from any diredion in the application 
of it :— The principal burying place is too fmall, in propor- 
tion to the parilh. The expence of interment in it is confider- 
ed by the poorer people as too great. Two of the mod an- 
cient burying grounds in the parifh are uninclofed, fo that 
thofe, who, for cheapnefs, have recourfe to them, fuSer the 
mortification of feeing the remains of th^ir friends treated 
with indignity y and, from the ufe of one of thefe, the poor 
have, of late years, been totally excluded.— But the greateft 
of all the difadvantages of Dundee, is the almoil total want of 
public inftitutions, even for the mod fimple and neceflary 
parts of education; nor, excepting a reputable grammar 
fchool, is there an opportunity for parents to have their chil- 
dren infiruded in any branch of human literature ; and this^ 
defe£t is not fupplicd by any tolerable public library. 

Other difadvantages, at lead caufes of difcontent, arife from 
the nature of feveral public laws and inditutions. Com- 
plaints of this kind are expreffed by the trading people, who 
have fuffered lofs in confequence of the law of perpetual 
entailsy or who arc expofed to fuffer it. They think, that 
properly of every kind ought to be liable for the debts it has 
given opportunity to contraft ; that the contrary praftice is 
unjud, and the laws which authorife it, nothing different from 
licences to a /pedes of fwindltng. Befides the afionilhing 
quantity of land in the neighbouring parts of the country, 
brought, of late, under this kind of fcttlement, it is believed, 

that 



•/Dundee. 14^ 

that fhe proportion of this parifli» fub}e£ted to it, is not much 
lefs than 3000 1. a-jear. — Some complaints are alfo made oa 
the fnbjeft of the late com iaxv^ as tending to diminilh the 
freedom of trade in this important article, and tQ render it 
more precarious. The merchant alleges, that, while his Ihip 
is at fea, he is not fure whether the port, to which, from con- 
fidence in the law, he ordered his com, maj not, by procla- 
mation be ihttt up: and certainly it has been attended 
with fome confiderable inconveniencies ; for, during the laft 
fpring, ieed-com, even from England, though often of theut- 
moft importance to this country, and various articles of 
houfehold provifion, which the country does not yet fupply, 
were, by its operation* laid under an abfolute prohibition^ or 
a duty which, with equal efficacy, prevented importation. The 
iotercourfe for com was not at that time permitted, even with 
the county of Fife, from which we are feparattd only by the 
river; and at the prefent time, (November the zith 1792,) 
though the harveft has been bad, and the price of grain con- 
fiderably raifed, two veiTels with grain and meal, one of which 
lies in the harbonr, and the other is daily expeSed, will not 
1e permitted to unload their cargoes. Befides tbefe com- 
plaints, though the people here are happily free from the 
coal ditty^ to which their more northern neighbours are fub- 
jeded, it is only from the duty on Scottifli coal ; and the 
prefent fudden advance in the price of this article, from 4 s. 
to upwards of 6 s. for 800 weight, muft, while they are not 
relieved by importations from England, be feverely felt by all 
the poor. — ^Wxth refpeft to the difcontents, which prevail 
in Dundee, about the itate and mode of the reprefentation of 
the people in parliament, and that they are governed by a 
magiftracy in a great meafure independent on them^ thefe are 
not peculiar to this place, but common to it with all the towns 
in Scotland.

Oae difadvantage of Dundee ari£es from its fituation, and 
hardly admits of a proper remedy. It is the diftance at which 
it is placed from any large frefh water river, with falls fu£- 
ficient for moving the various machinery, now fo important 
to manufa&amp;ures. The neareft falls of this defcription are 
on Dighty, and in the parilh of Monyfieth j but they are 
too diftant for derivbg full advantage from the population 
of Dundee. 

Mifcellaneous Ob/ervations. -^In the year 1782, the corns 
were much damaged by exceiUve rains, the harveft was not 
completed till towards the end of November, and a confider« 
able dearth followed. The inhabitants, however, exerted, on 
this occafion, their ufual generofity ; and at one time, with a 
view of alleviating the diftrefs of the poor, the fum of 200 h 
was raifed in the fpace of two days. But the intention of 
xaiiing this fum was much more laudable,'than the application 
of it. It vfzs employed, together with the produce of other 
funds, in keeping the market prices of grain below the com- 
mon rates of the country, a benefit in which the rich, and 
they who had no need, were partakers equally with the poor ; 
and the confequence was, that they who had grain to fell, car- 
ried it to other markets, which were free from fuch timid and 
impertinent regulations, and where they received their prices 
immediately from the buyers, without having the trouble of 
applying, for any part of them, to truftecs of public money. 
Accordingly, the fupply of the Dundee market, as might have 
been eafily forefeen, was, through the whole feafon, fcanty 
and difEcult ; and depended entirely on the influence the 
magifirates could exert with country gentlemen, and the more 
opulent dafs of farmers. Even the fupply of many families, 
who were not under the necel&amp;ty ci going daily to market, 
became a bufinefs of confiant and vexatious folicitation. The 

people 



of Dundeel i/^j 

Tpeopk of Aberdeen, where the dearth was greater, are faid to 
have aAed much more wifely, bj raifing the market price of 
grain, and to have advertifed large premiums to every importer 
of it ; and we are told, the coofequence was, that their market 
was filled as well as in the ordinary times of plenty ; and the 
prices, of necei&amp;ty, foon fell to their proper leveL A fmall 
quantity of the provifion made by government, for the poor 
of the northern parts of this ifland, was alfo at this time allot- 
ted to Dundee ; and the Kirk-SefEon received fome unfolicit- 
ed donations, amounting to 60 1, for the poor under their in- 
fpe&amp;ion. In thefe, the fhare which Lord Douglas, accor4ing 
to his ufual humanity, contributed, was no lefs than 50 L 

In the two former centuries, the prices of various necef- 
faries of life, as meal, malt, ale, leather, ihoes, &amp;c. were regu- 
kted by the magiftratesand council ; and in making, altering^ 
. and executing their regulations, they created much vexation 
to the dealers, and much ufelefs trouble to themfelves. The 
price of no neceflary of life is now regulated in this manner, 
except of bread made from wheat flour j and neither does the 
attention of the magiftrate to this article, feem to be of much 
greater ufe, than it was to the others, where it has long been 
laid afide ; nor, though it (bould be fuppofed of ufe, does the 
method of regulation adopted here feem to be advantageous. 
On the contrary, it is perhaps the very reverfe of what it 
ought to be ; for the price of bread, concerning which all are 
judges, remains fixed, and the weight, which few have oppor- 
tunity to examine, or even fometimes to know, is variable. 
It is probable, that were this bufinefs freed from the influence 
of corporation laws, it might be as fafely as any other com- 
mitted to the management of thofe engaged in it ; and, that 
by their feparate interefts and competition, it would be equal- 
ly guarded from combination and abufe. Indeed, no corpora- 
tion laws whatever feem to be entitled to much refpefi ; all

of tbem tend| more or lefs,4o create monopolies againft tbe pulK 
lie ; nor iq they always promote the good of tbe very focieties 
they were meant to favour. The prices of admiiEon to the ez- 
ercife of any buiinefs in Dundee, though not fo extravagant as 
in other places, particularly in Aberdeen, are, noiwithftand« 
ing, taxes frequently found to be inconvenient. A merchant 
pays to the Guildry for freedom to himfelf and his pofterity, 
8 L 6 s. 8 d. and^ half this fum for freedom to himfelf only ; 
an apprentice to a merchant pays 1 1. ; a handycraftsman 8 1« 
6 s. 8 d. for admii&amp;on into any of the 9 incorporated trades ; 
and, except at the times i|)propriated to public marketSf no 
granger can, without a confiderable tax, expofe his goods to&amp;le 
for a fingle day.— Of perfons belonging to Dundee, who have 
been condemned, banifbed their country for life, or executed^ 
upon account of felonies, the writer of this account cannot, 
after much inquiry, find more than ihnt during tbe whole 
courfe of the pte&amp;nt century. Since Bridewells^ or penitenti« 
ary houfes, have been eftabliflied in Edinburgh and Glafgow, 
Dundee has been much more peftered than formerly, with va*. 
grants and perfona of doubtful chara&amp;er, zaifmindling and 
petty thefts are more frequent. This will probably produce 
a Bridewell in Dundee. An efiablifliment of this kind is 
certainly neceflary, and the common prifons, and prefent in« 
fli&amp;ions of juftice, are by no means fufficieut to fupply its 
place. With refpeft to our prifons, though among the bed 
in Scotland, they are deftitute of any court or area where the 
prifbners may enjoy the open air. This, however, is at pre* 
fent, the leCs necelTary, as the laws of the country are fuppofp 
ed inhumanely, to exclude debtors from the privilege of 
breathing the fame air with others ; and, it is but very fel- 
dom, that felons fufier long confinement, in the prifons of 
places not vifited by the Circuit Courts of Judiciary. 

In this town, there are feveral public buildings \ but, ex«

ipire of the chapel in the Cowgate, and the town^boufe, none 
of them feems, as a piece of archite&amp;ure, to be entitled to ' 
much attention. Th^ laft is certainly a building of uncom* 
mon tafte and elegance. It waa planned by the elder Adams^ 
aod does him honour. 

Among the regulations imfavourable to the freedom of the 
market, and confequently to the interefts of the inhabitants, 
thofe might have beeninentioned which relate to the trade in 
«oals. There are only 4 births, or places at which TefTels 
loaded with them are permitted to deliver their cargoes ; and^ 
if thefe places are occupied, all other veflels, however great 
the demand may be, are excluded^ and muft continue (hut up, 
unlefs the cargoe (hould be fold in wholefale to one perfon, or 
unleCs the ma&amp;er, if he means to retail, will confent to fell 
below the current price. The firft occupiers, accordingly, 
muft reduce their prices, or fee their rivals carry o£f all their 
cuftomers. The intention of this regulation was, no doubt, to 
prevent any unfair rife of prices from combinations among 
the mafiers. But its real cffecl is to iocreafe the riik and ex- 
pence of the trade, and to induce thofe who are engaged in it 
to have recourfe to other ports, rather than fell at a diminifh- 
cd profit, or at a lofs. Perhaps there is no branch of bufinefs, 
wherein thofe intermediate dealers, often branded in law by the 
names oiforeftaUers and rtgretters^ would be more neceflary, 
or where the encouragement of fuch would tend more to the 
general benefit. When the importer muft alfo turn retailer, 
the time in which he fliould be fetching a new cargo is loft, 
and he brings fewer coals in any given period to market \ and 
he and all his fliips company muft be paid for their time, in- 
flead of one regretter. ^

in the year 1690, betwixt the adherents of King William,

252 Statifitcal Account 

. Extentf Soil and Surface. — The extent of it is very confider- 
able, bebg fullj 13 Scotch miles in length, and generally ^ 
or 4 miles broad, in the old inhabited country ; but on ac« 
count of the late improvements, which are very numerous, the 
breadth, in' fome parts, is no lefs than from 6 to 7 miles. The 
foil is generally dry and thin, with the exception of fome 
flats or low haughs, dofe by the river Spey, which, in point 
of natural fertility, are equal to thofe near the fea fide, which 
is 20 miles diftant from every part of this pari(h. An hun- 
dredth part of the lands of Cromdale is not arable, or even 
green, fo as to render it fit for pafture to black cattle or hor« 
fes. The hills and level grounds are generaUy covered with 
black heath, having fcarce any mixture of grafs connefied 
with it. Though thefe circumftances quickly difcover them- 
felves to the ftranger and traveller, from the unpleafant afpeft 
the country at firft fight exhibits, yet thefe prejudices are foon 
removed, when a pertbn, adverts to the utility and confequence 
of places, formerly, in a great meafure, thought barren and 
ufelefs, now rendered produdi ve of the greateft fource of na- 
tional wealth, by the flocks of flieep, which every where co- 
ver the face of the country ; and which are now triple the 
number they were a few yeari ago, as well as proportionally 
increafed in point of value. The plantations of fir, which are 
numerous, and are thriving faff, will foon have a good effeft 
in fetting ofi" the country to very great advantage. 

Situattan^ Climate and 2)^/z/J/.— The parifli lies within the 
counties of Invernefs and Moray, in almoft an equal propor- 
tion, fome parts of it, lying next to Invernefs, being of the 
ihire of Moray, and feme of thofe lands, neareft to Forres and 
Elgin, belonging to the county of Invernefs. This feeming 
confufion mult have originated from the intereft the difier-

cn^ proprietors, (who held the lands of this country, when 
ihires were firft formed,) had in the principal towns fixed 
upon as head burghs. Cromdale is generally allowed to be 
cztremelj wholefome. Few epidemical di&amp;afes happen in it. 
There are many inftances of longevity as far as 90, and 
there are not a few, even beyond that age. Dr. Buchan, au- 
thor of the Family Phyfician, had occafion to be in this part 
of the country fome years ago, when he very judicioufly re- 
marked, that every man's houfe was built upon a rock, mean* 
ing, that every man had a dry gravelliih fiance whereon to 
found his houfe ; which, the Dodor obferved, is more condu- 
cive to health, than all the benefits that refult from medicine* 
Inoculation univerfally takes place with great fuccefs. All 
prejudices on the fcore of predeftination^ are now happily re- 
moved. 

River and Fi/b, — ^The river Spey is the only one which 
runs through this parifti. From its rapidity every where, it 
is allowed, that more water flows from it, than any other 
river in the kingdom. It is diftinguiihed for vail floats of 
wood, which cover its banks, and are daily carried down by 
its waters to the fea. Sir James Grant's woods of Abeme- 
thy and Duthel, with thofe of Rothiemurchus, lie contigu- 
ous to the Spey, and cover a boundlefs trad of country. 
The Spey was once famous for falmon, all over that extent 
of country, through which it paffes ; b.*t, by a late decifion of 
the houfe of Peers, an exclufive right was given to the Duke 
of Gordon, by means of Cruives^ and all other human devices, 
to monopolize this article at the fource of the river ; which of 
late years has been efieded with fuch fuccefs, that few falmon 
are to be got a fliort way up the country ; and j^it the gentle- 
men of property, hurt by this decifion, allow the wood

belonging to this familj, which often proves injurious ttf 
their arable ground, to pals without the lead moleftation. 

Animals. — The white hare is frequently got in this parifli 
during winter. It is as white as fnow, and the ears are 
tipt with black. Roes, black cocks, and heath hens are 
very numerous. Horfes ufed for work, were, fome years 
ago, generally bred in the country \ but now, owing to the 
flocks of Iheep, which confume the growth of the common 
pafture, they are generally purchafed, and at a very advanced 
price. Farmers, on this account, have reduced their number, 
ufing only two in place of four^ carrying on a deal of their 
labour with oxen, which they employ in the draught as well 
as in the plough. Black cattle are very numerous : they 
amount to 4000 or 50CO within the pdrifh, while iheep may- 
be reckoned from 10,000 to 1 2,000. Goats were once nume- 
rous, but now the pariih could fcarcely mufter 200 of them. 
The wool of our iheep is depreciated on account of the mix- 
ture of black hairs, which is afcribed to the attempts to im- 
prove the breed in point office. The quality of it far exceeds 
^at of Badenoch wool, which is afcribed to the iheep being 
fed upon pure heath \ and the connoifleurs in mutton attribute 
an uncommon fine flavour to iheep fed in this manner. 

Rent and Proprietor s.-'^Thc real rent of the pariih, of 
which Sir James Grant of Grant is the fole proprietor and 
patron, is confiderably beyond 2000 1. a-year. Castle 
Grakt, the feat of his family, is within its bounds. His 
men of buiinefs afiirm, that they are in poiTeiBon of writings, 
which afcertain their refidence there for upwards of 500 years, 
without any failure in the male line all that time ; and though 
they have had the property of the whole pariih, for about 200 
years i yet prior to this, it was divided among different heri* 

tors* 



of Cromdak. ^^i( 

jtors* The price of the acre of arable land, when feued, is 
generally from 81. to 12 1. Sterling, without reckoning any 
thing for grafs or common pafturage. 

Cultivation and Produce, — The union of farms is frequent. 
One man now occupies as much land, as was, 40 years ago, 
poflefied by 5 or 6 families; The principal crops coniifl of 
oats, barley and rye. The tail has, of late years, been in n6 
high eftimation, from the effefl it has in fcourging the ground. 
Wheat is fown here occafionally in fmall quantities. Tur- 
oips and potatoes fucceed to a wifli. Potatoes, in a fliort 
time, will conftitute the one half of the people's food. Sown 
grafs is every where to be met with, and very luxuriant crop$ 
arife from it. The lime quarries are opened by the pro- 
prietor. The country abounds with them. The boll of lime, 
which meafures 24 Scotch pints each iirlot, is fold at 8 d. per 
boll. It is neceffaiy to make this diftindion, as the Banff. 
fhire boll is lefs by a third. A lint mill is ereded by the 
proprietor, and moft people fow flax with fuccefs. A bleach- 
field is juft eftabliflied, which bids fair to be of great advan- 
tage to the country. 

Population. — ^There is not a iingle feftary of any denomi- 
nation in the pariffa ; the whole people being of the eftab- 
liflied church. The number of fouls belonging to the parifli, 
may be ftated at 3«oo, but many of them go occafionally 
fonth, during the fummer feafon, to work at roads, and other 
public works, which » renders the amount fluduating. The

There are two glebes in the parifli, which might be let, as 
the value of both, at 7 1. Sterling a-year. The manfe was 
built 70 years ago, and has been different times repaired fince. 
The offices were lately rebuilt, and are in good order. The

number of begging poor exceeds 20, but thefe go feldom from 
the bounds of this country* Some times 30, or even 40, re«

perfon 19 reduced by accident, or fome fevere diftemper, to 
poverty, the method pradifed for their relief, is ,by a general 
colledion ; and in juftice to the people, if mud b^ laid, that 
their liberality, on all fuch occafions, far exceeds what might 
be expeded. There are np' other funds befides the public col- 
ledions, which, at an average amount from loL to 15 1* Ster* 
ling a- year. Much depends on the price of cattle, and the 
jSide of vidual, which is more or lefs according to the feafon. 
When the family of Grant refide at Caftle Grant, which, for 
fome time paft, has been pretty much the cafe, the collediou 
has thereby been much enlarged, as they conftantly attend 
public worfliip, in all feafons of the year. Their beneficence 
makes every one delicate to giving them trouble, «a every ob*^ 
jed of diftrefs, within their reach, experiences their charity.

a few years hence, the £ngli(h will be the only langoage,- as 
the people ardently wiih their children to read the fcriptures ; 
9od for this purpofe, often^ in the winter, 4 or 5 fchools are 
employed at once in the parilh at their own expeoce.

^^^jrtf..^Orantown is a village erefted under the influence 
of the Grant family, it being little more than 20 years, finge 
the place, where it (lands, was a poor rugged piece of heath* 
It now contains from 300 to 400 inhabitants, fome of whoni 
are as good tradefmen as any in the kingdom. Shoe-

ed in this place immediatelj at the firft building of it, on 
purpofe to keep the people from drinking fpiritous liquors, 
and it continues to give fatisfafiion* Two bakers carry on 
the buiinels of their profeffioa with fuccefs. Butcher meat,

or three public houfes in it, with an elegant town-houfe, 
covering a prifon, agreeable to the jurifdiftion aA, under the 
fanftion of the iheriff of the bounds. Though it has been 
built for fome years, yet few have been confined within its 
walls, which is a high proof of the good behaviour of the 
people. Grantown is, on all hands, furrounded with moft ex* 
eellent mofles, aflbrding peata of the beft quality ; the aflies 
of which, when mixed with lime, make good manure for po- 
tatoes, greens, and cabbages. All kinds of roots are to be met 
with here, in vaft quantities,, and to as great perfeftion, as in 
Inypart of the kingdom ; which, from its former barren Rate, 
is an inconteftible proof, how far the country at large is capa- 
ble of improvement. 

Roadft Wages^ Fueif \ic4 — The ftatufe work goes on very 
punAually, without the finalleft murmur. Stone bridges are 
ereded over almoft every rivulet, either by the proprietor or 
the county -, and of courfc, the roads are in the higheft orden 
The wages 6f fervants have iacreafed, of late years, at a moft 
amazing rate. Six pounds Sterling are commonly given to ca- 
pable men fervants in the year, exclufive of maintenance. Wo* 
men have generally 40 s. Sterling of wages in the year. Got- 
fersy or married fervants are feldom employed, as the bulk of

llie people manage their farms with the help of their children* 
The high wages of men fervants we attribute to the floating 
of wood, which finds bofinefs for all our men, from 16 to 60 
jears of age, who, during the warmfeaibn, receive from i s. to 
f s. 2 d. for each dajs labour. Fuel is every where to be had^ 
on eafj terms, and of the beft quality, through the whole of 
Xbis country. 

Tov^nif.— 'Many public houfes, by the general refolution of 
the counties concerned, have of late been fuppreffed ; and 
there are at prefent only 4, befides thofe mentioned in Gpan« 
town. Two of thefe are on the turnpike road, for the accom- 
modation of travellers* 

Antiquities. ^"Tht only antiquity in the parilh, is the For- 
ialix at Lochindorb, where a thick wall of mafon work, (ao 
feet high even at this period, and fuppofed to have beea 
much higher,) furrounds an acre of land within the Loch, with 
watch towers at every comer, all entire. The entrance to 
this place, is at a gate built of freeftone, which has a gran- 
deur in it, that is eafier felt than ezprefled. Several veftiges 
of houfes are found within ^e walls, befides thofe of a church, 
which, without difficulty, can ftill be traced in the ruins. 
Crreat rafts, or planks pf oak, by the beating of the waters 
againft the old walls, occafionally make their appearance; which 
jconfirms an opinion entertained of this place, that it had been 
a national bufinefs, originally built tipon an artificial ifland. 
Tradition fays, and fome credit is due to the report, that the 
particular account of this building was lofl in the days of 
King Edward I. of England.

^County and Synod of Aberdeen. — Prejbytery of Alford^ 
By Mr. AuxANBER Urqjthart.</head> 



<p>Name^ Situation^ and Extent. 

THERE is no tradition, nor any record, that this pariih 
has had aqy other name than its prefent one. It is 
pretty evident, that it is of Gaelic eztradion. Thofe ikill*d 
in that language fay, that it fignifies Northward^ or a place 
vvith*a northern ezpofure, which is the more probable, as 
there is a range of hills, ivhich run from the fouth eaft to the 
fouth weft comer of the parifli, and which fcreen it from the 
fouth and fouth weft. It is faid, that Towie, the namie of a 
neighbouring parifh, has the fame fignification, for which the 
lame reafon may, with much propriety, be aiSgned. Both 
names are pronounced in the Gaelic, with fomewhat of a gut« 
tural found, as if they were written ^oua. The names of 
many of the farm towns are purely Graelic. The parifti is 
about 22 miles diftant from Aberdeen. Its length from S. 
to N. is about 5 miles, and its greateft breadth about 3. Its 
form would be almoft triangular; did not a confiderable part

There are in it, feveral rifing gronnds, but they are moftly

fonth, and fouth weft, naturally oqcafioo a pretty large bot*- 
tom to the north, where there is no intervening hill between it 
and Keig« The foil is in general of a light nature, in many 
places very fhallow, and abounding with ftnaU ft ones. It is, 
however, in fome places, particularly in the fame grounds^ 
very deep, mixed with mofs and extremely fertile. The air 
is, for the moft part, dry and iieakhy. Several mineral fprings 
have been difcovered, which J1 feem to run 'upon iron ore* 
They have * not been tried in any diftemper. The difeafea 
which are moft frequent, in this and the neighbouring parifti* 
es, are of the a,cnte kind. Many of the labouring people 
have been afflifted with pleurtfies ; but if the patients are let 
blood in proper time, they foon recover. 

Produ€t^ Cattle and Cuttivation.— The annual crops are oats 
and barley. In ordinary years, the parifli does more than fup- 
ply itfelf with provifions. The farmers fend t good deal of 
meal to the Aberdeen market. The oats are generally fown 
between the middk of March and middle of April, and the 
crop is generally reaped between the ift of September and the 
end of October. There were lately found to be 625 black 
cattle, 1471 iheep, and 113 horfes in this pariih. The tenants 
pay confiderable attention to the rearing of blaek cattle ; and 
this attention has been fufficiently rewarded, by the high prtcea 
which they have brought for feveral years paft. There are 
37 ploughs in the pari&amp; $ but many of thefe are rather infig-

nificanty being formed by a jundion, of two or three fmalt 
crofters, who make up a joke among them. There are 52 carts^ 
but manj of thefe are alfo very fmall. There are not above 
1 1 houfeholders, that can properly be denominated farmers* 
Many of the farms are now divided into fmall partitions, 
which are here called crofts, on each of which there is a houfe 
and family. It is now fo expeniive to flock a confiderable 
farm, that fettling upon crofts, is become much more com- 
in)n than formerly. Within thefe 5 or 6 years, two farms 
have been very much improved by a rotation of crops. One 
of them, the greateft part of which is in the hands of the pro«- 
prietor, has been improved by lime, which he brings from 
Aberdeen. About a fifth part of that farm, was, feme time 
ago, let on leafe to an induftrions tenant, who purfues his land* 
lord's plan; For this part, he pays more than the old rent 
of the whole farm ; and yet, it is faid, that he is no lofer 
by the bargain. The people now begin to be more fenlible 
of the advantages refulting from raifing turnips ; and one may 
obferve a fioiall fpot of them in tlie corner of almod every 
croftfman's field. The late Mr. Byres of Tonley, was the 
firft who fowed turnips in the fields in this diftrift. He was 
alfo the firil who had a cart in it about 40 years ago. His fon, 
the prefent proprietor, has of late very much improved his 
eflate. The barren muirs, and dry foil, are employed m raif- 
ing plantations of fir, which are alfo intermixed with almoft 
every other fpeeies of wood common in this part of the coun- 
try. Some of thefe plantations are about i a years old, and 
are in a moft thriving condition. They will not only add 
very much to the value of the eftate, but alfo to the beauty 
of the neighbourhood. There are in thefe plantations, three 
natural dens, through each of which runs a fmall rivulet. 
Through thefe the firs, larix, birk, and oak, make a moft de- 
lightful appearance. One of thefe dens by nature forms a 

beautiful

beautiful bafon, which the proprietor has fille() with water* 
There are, in this bafon, 3 or 4 rifing grounds, which the wa- 
ter does not coven Thefe are planted with various kinds of 
wood and fhrubberjr. From many points Of view, this forms 
a very pleafing (heet of water. The proprietor intends to put 
ft boat upon it, fo as occafionally to afibrd a pleafing fource of 
amufement, and a healthy ezercife. That gentleman, fince 
bis return from abroad, has begun to put lime, in cdnfiderable 
quantities on his arable ground, and his fchemes of improve- 
ment are profecuted with vigour, fpirit and fucceis. 

Heritors^ Reni^ \ic. — ^There are 6 heritors, none of whoai 
has refided for fome years paft, Mr. Byres only excepted. For 
the laft 30 years, he lived chiefly at Rome, where he was well 
known, and defervedly efteemed^ for his tafte, learning, and 
integrity. There has been tio change of property thefe 50 
years, except a very fmall eftate, which has been once or 
twice fold within that period. Kincraigie one of the principal 
cftates, was difpofed of fome years ago by a judicial {ale ; 
but the proprietor having thrown in many objedions to the 
(ale, there is no faying how, or when it will be finally fettled4 
The valued rent of the parifh is 1670 1. 14 s. Scotch. Thof 
teal rent does not mUch exceed 600 L Sterling. 

Population. — It is thought that the population has increafed 
within thefe %o years, though there is a fmall decreafe fince 
2755, when the return to Dr. Webiler amounted to 576 
fouls. The only caufe to which the late increafe can be at- 
tributed» is, the fubdivifion of farms, which has augmented 
the number of fettlers. The whole population, about x% 
months ago, amounted to $60. Of thefe, there were, —

DurnOy a proprietor in this parifli, died about 20 years ago, 
in the io6th year of his age. One of the name of McGregor, 
died *ih the Kirk Town, aged 105. As no regular regifter 
of deaths has been kept, the annual average cannot be afcer* 
tained with that ezadnefs which could be wiihed for ; but, 
it is fuppofed, it will not exceed 9, during the lad ten years. 
The annual average of births is about 15, and of marriages 
'5. The only .diiTenters in this diftrid are Seceders, of the 
Burgher perfuafion, of whom there are 127, including all the 
children of thofe whofe parents are Seceders *

* It may not here be improper to give fome account of their origin in this 
pariih. In the year I766, the miniiler was deiirous to introduce the new me- 
thod of finging, ^hich he found acceptable to many of his pariihiooers. It wal, 
lioweTer, violently oppofed by othcri* The piimiler, notwithftanding, periiiled 
in his dcfign ; and this occaiioned a fchifm among his hearers. The rage of the 
opponents was furious. They foon began to think of revenging themfelvcs 
by leaving the kirk. When the party was fufficiently formed, they built a 
church, and ahoufe for a nilnifter, who was foon procured. What is remark- 
able, isfthat thefe very Seceders have iince adopted the new mode of finging, 
jwh^ch was the fole fource of the original rupture. Their prefent miniiler is the 
fecond, who has held that office. He is a very focial'good fort of a ma6, and 
difcovers a confidcrable degree of moderatiua.

Craigievar is patron, and titular of the teinds. The churdl 
was built in 1737, and the manfe in t^j^i. A new fet of of* 
fices was built in 1790, with a date roof, the firft that has 
been fo well fini(hed in the county of Aberdeen. The heri- 
tors, however, in feveral other parifhes^ being convinced, 
that this is by far the moft durabk, and confcqnentlj, upoB 
the whole, the cheapeft roof, there is little doubt, when re« 
pairs are found necefiary, but that this mode will be adopt- 
ed* The fchoolmafler's fahrj is 100 merks. He has alfo I L 
7 s« Sterling,, paid him as Scdion-Clerk. For fome years paft^ 
the number of fcholars has been very fmalL The fees for 
teaching are 2 s. 6 d. for Latin, 2 s. for arithmetic, x s, 6 d. fos 
reading and writing, and x s^in^t readirg. 

Poor.— The provifion for the poor is fmaU. The feffion fund,, 
however, which is about 50 L, is rather increafing. The annu- 
al colledions for their relief, after deduding the clerk's falary^ 
will be about 6 1. Sterling. There are 7 at prefent upon the 
poor's roll y but all of them are abk to do fomethiiig fortheiv 
own fupport. Befides the quarterly diftributions to the poor^ 
«ccafional fupplies arc alfo given to thofe who £41 into acci- 
dental diftrefs. Yearly colle&amp;ions are made in all the pari(h« 
es of this and the neighbouring counties, for the fupport of 
the Aberdeen Infirmary. 

Inoculation^ — The prejudices of the people in this neigh- 
bourhood, are ftrongly bent againll inoculation for the fmaU 
pox. Some months sgo,. when the prefent incumbent had 
a child inoculated, one man, who has a numerous young 
family, by a fecond wife, (his children of the firfl mar- 
riage having fufiered extremely by the fmall pox,) was defi- 
rous that his young family ihould undergo that operation* 
They were accordingly inoculated| and got through remark- 
ably 



^Uy veil ; bift fo violent were the prejudices of the people, 
that, it b faid, feme of them declared, if the inoculated 
children had died, thej would have coniidered it as a juft 
difpenfation of Providence. It is to be hoped, however, that 
a few more fuccefsful inftances, will have a tendency to re- 
move fo unfortunate an idea. Above all, if the more diC- 
ceming heads of families were attentively to read the Statif* 
tical Survey, it might be of confiderable fervice to them, in that 
«8 well as in many other refpefis« 

SirvarUs^ Wages ^ \3c. — ^Tlierc are only 15 male, and 19 fe- 
male fervants in this parilh. It will no doubt appear firange, 
that this number is fo fmall. Many of thehoufeholders have 
fons and daughters, who alEft at their work ; and thefe are not 
rcckoaed among the number of hired fervants. Many of tlie 
houfeholdcrs are crofters, and they need no fervants. The 
wages of a ploughmaa are about 5 1. Sterling, and the wa« 
ges of a female fervant about 2 1. Many fervants are engaged 
only daring the weeks of the harvell, and in that time, a man 
fervant will fometimes receive al. and a woman 1 1. ; though, 
if the weather be favourable, the harveft will be finifhed in 
the courfe of 5 weeks. The day's wages of a labouring man, 
are from 8 d. to z s. without viduals ; a taylor's wages 6 d. 
or 7 d. and his viftuals. The wages of a common labourer, 
when married, are fcarcely fuf&amp;cient to enable him to bring 
up a family. About 20 years ago, a dozen of eggs fold 
for a'penny ; a hen for 4 d. a pound of butter (28 oz.) at 4 d ; 
a pound of beef 2 d. All thefe articles now give double the 
old price. 

Roads. — ^The roads in this diftrlft are in a much better date, 
than they have been, in any former period. But there is ftill 
room for improvement in this refpeft. Some of the roads lie 

L I 2 pretty 



269 StatiJIicat Account 

prettj low, and, being made on a clay bottom, they become 
exceeding deep and heavy in the winter : nothing but raiiing 
them very high, and fpreading plenty of gravel upon them,' 
will make them tolerable in that feafbn. The date of the 
roads, has lately employed the attention of the gentlemen of 
property in this and the neighbouring parifhes ; and, they 
feem to be thoroughly convinced, that, without good roads, 
the improvement of their eftates muft proceed very flowly, 
A plan and eSimate of a road,' (without a pull in it,) from 
this place to Aberdeen, was, fome weeks ago, given in to a 
meeting of landed gentlemen. The plan and eilimate have 
met with their approbation, and thofe moft interelled in this 
bufinefs, have fubfcribed 50 per cent of their valued rent, fo 
that it is to be hoped, this plan will foon be executed. The 
ilatute labour is generally commuted. 

Fuel^ \Sc. — The fuel principally ufed in this diftrift, is peats 
and turf, which are in great plenty, of a good quality, and 
eafily procured 5 the moft remote parts being only about i{- 
miles, and many not half a mile from the mofs. This may 
be reckoned one of the principal advantages of the parilli. 
Another is, that thofe, who live at the foot of the hills 
already mentioned, may keep a number of fhcep, which 
need no fhepherd ; and this is a confiderable faving to the 
farmer. 

jintiquities* — Little can be faid, with certainty, under the 
article of Antiquities. There was a fhilling of Queen £lixa« 
beth found fome years ago in a mofs, at no great diftance 
from the place where the battle of Alford was fought, be- 
tween Bailly and Montrofe. It is faid, Bailly's ipen flfd 
through this mofs, and that fome of tUem were buried in it. 

It has, perhaps, been there ever fince. Some time ago, a hu- 
man 



inan body, and a fword, were found near the fame fpot* 
Hard bj this mofs, there is a fpot of ground, called the bkedji 
faulds^ where it is probable the flaughter has been verj con- 
fiderable in the chace. N«ar the fame place, on the brow of 
a hill, there is a large flone fianding perpendicular, about pf 
feet round, and \^\ high, which evidently appears to have 
been brought there by human induftry. Beneath it, tradition 
fays, that one of Macbeth^s fons is Interred. However this 
may be, there arc pretty evident marks of Macbeth having 
been in this part of the country. There are the remains of 
an encampment, near the Kirk of Lumphannan, where', it is 
{aid, he and his army defended themfelves for a confiderable 
time. Near this camp, the country people fbew where he fell, 
and the cairn under which he is buried. There are two or 
three large cairns which have never been opened ; and there 
are feveral Druidical Temples in this diftrid. One on a hill 
about % miles from the church, dill retains the name of iht 
Old Kirk of Tough. 

Difadvantagef. — Some veftiges of the feudal fyftem are ftiH , 
difcemible in this diftridt. Several of the tenants are bound 
to perform certain fervices to the. landlord. It ought, how- 
ever to be remarked, that this difadvantage, or rather hard- 
ihip, is by no ireans peculiar to the pariih, but common to 
all in the neighbourhood ; but fuch is the moderation of the 
proprietors here, that thefe fervices are not often exaded, and 
never with rigour. But the principal local difadvantage, 
which the pariih labours under, is its diflance from lime, none 
being nearer than Aberdeen. Limeftone has indeed been dif« 
covered in the pariih, but when fire was applied, it all run in- 
to large lumps. It is to be hoped, that, by future trials, — by 
digging deeper in the rock, it may yet turn out to good 9Cm

this diftrid, particularly if coals were got duty free. 

CharaOeTf (/f.«-The people are in general very induftri* 
ou8t frugal, humane, and obliging. Their morals are thought 
to be ftri&amp;er now than 40 or 50 years ago. Even the Sece« 
ders have loft a great deal of that fiery, intemperate zeal^ 
which fo Orongly marked their charader, about the time of

the li.emory of man, of any individual being banifhed or capi« 
tally conviAcd. The general fize of the .people is about 5 
feet 8 inches. There are fome individuals about fix feet. 

MifceUantous Ohferoations. — ^The principal mar.ufa&amp;ure, iq 
this and the neighbouring parilhes, is the knitting of ftock^ 
ings. In this the females are conftantly employed, except 
during the weeks of harvt&amp;ft. Jn the year 178a and 1783, 
great fcarcity prevailed, and had not a confiderable quantity 
of peafemeal been procured from abroad, and fent to this 
country from Aberdeen, many of the inhabitants muft have 
been in danger of periihing* It ought, however, to be re« 
marked, that the women did fo much extra work, by knit- 
ting (lockings, and the men by building dykes, that they 
earned double the fum they ufually gain in the fame time ; fo 
that the lofs they fuftained was not great, and the fcarcity 
was but little felt.— -There are two or three tippling houfes 
in the parifli, which have an evident tendency to corrupt the 
morals of the people. A good inn, for the accpmiaodatioa 
of travellers, is much wanted $ and, it is prefumed, a proper 
inn*keeper would meet with good encouragement, as the pub^ 
lie road, from Aberdeen to Strath-don and the adjacent coun^ 
try, paffes through this parifli.

Origin qf the Name. 

THE town and pariih of Stirling have the fame name. 
In all records of anj antiquity, it is written Stryveline^ 
or Stryveiittg ; and it is conjedured to have derived this name 
irom the Scotch word ^rjfv^, becaufe of the frequent conten« 
tions about the pofieflion of it, which arofe among the differ- 
ent clans, in the dajs of ancient feud and barbarifm. This, 
however, is mere conjediire, as all difquifitions about the 
origin of names generally are. Buchanan and other Latin au- 
thors uniformallj call it Sterlinum. The town's ancient feal 
has, on one fide, a crucifix erefied on a bridge, with this in« 
fcription. Hie armis Brutif Scotijlant hac cruce tuti. On the 
reverfe is a fortalice, furrounded with trees, with the i;ifcrip« 
tion, CoHtinet hoc nemus et cajlrum Strivilenfe* The town has 
another feal, which contains the arms, viz. A Wolf upon a 
rock| infcribed Oppidum Sterlini.

^7^ Statifiiml Account 

Extent^ Mc. — ^The parifii of Stirling is chiefly confined W 
the town. The whole land in it does not exceed 200 acres. 
The caftle, with the conftabularj, bj which is meant a fmall 
portion of land, formerly annexed to the office of conflable, 
are not reckoned in the parifli of Stirling. As little are the 
Royal Domains, or King's park. They are exempted 
from all parochial afTeiTment, and are in the pariih only quoad 
facra^ and that only iince the chaplain ceafed to officiate, or 
refide in the caftle. The landward part of the parifh lies be-t 
tween the town and the Forth. It extends along the fouth 
fide of the river, from Kildean, about a mile above the bridge 
of Stirling, to the eaft of the town, with fome parks on the 
the fouth of it. Thefe lands, on an average, are rented at 
50 s. per acre. The fmall village, called the Abbey ^ which 
occupies the place where the celebrated Abbacy of Cambuf* 
kenneth once ftood, and which is fituated in a northern link I 

of the Forth, eaft from Stirling, has hitherto, along with the ba- 
i:ony of Cambu (kenneth, in which it is fituated, been reckoned 
part of the parifli of Stirling. What gave rife to this arrange* 
xnent is not known, unlefs it was, that the fervants belonging 
to the Abbacy worftiipped in Stirling ; or that the Canons, 
Monks or Friars of that monaftery, performed divine fervice, 
in the church of Stirling, and formed a kind of connexion 
which continued to fubfift after the reformation. ' One thing 
is certain, that it has fub£(led ; for there is a&amp;ually a feat in 
the church of Stirling, allotted for the inhabitants of that vil- 
lage ; and it appears, that an elder from it has fat in the feC- 
fion of Stirling, almoft uniformly fince the year 1559. "^^^^ 
biarony of Gambuikenneth pays a part of the ftipend of the 
firft minifter of Stirling ; but it is fubjeS to poor's rates in 
the pariih of Logic, and to the jurifdidion of the ffieriffof 
Clackmannan. The commiiTary of Stirling alfo exercifes his 
jurifdi&amp;ion over it, as a part of the parifk of Srirling ;' and 

the 



of Stirlingi a 73 

ibe coihmiflafj of Dumblaoe exercifes his jurifdifiion, as ly- 
ing within the parifh of Logic. 

Climate and Longevity, — The fituation of Stirling is alfo 
reckoned very healthy. The height of the rockf on which 
it {lands, above the level of the fiat carfe grounds, no doubt 
Contributes much to this efieA. Epidemical difeafes are 
Scarcely known. At this very time there are four or five per- . 
fons in Stirling above 90. The Croup, or Cynonche Trachea^ 
Us *, feem^ to be ^noft fatal to children , the aflhma and palfy 
to old age. 

Burgh of Stirling. — Stirling id allowed to be a place of con-* 
fiderable antiquity. Buchanan mentions it again and again, 
fo early as the 9th century, but gives no defcription'of it r 
and to throw any light upon this fubje£l, from the town's 
tharters, is impoflible. The mofl ancient of thefe records is 
granted by King Alexander L and is dated at Kincardine, the 
1 8th of Auguft, in the t2th year of his reign \ whereas there 
is reafon to believe, that Stirling had been incorporated long 
before, as the charter of Alexander is not a charter of ere£tion, 
but only confers fome additional' privileges on the burghers 
and freemen. Alexander the L who granted this charter, 
afcetided the throne anno 1107, and reigned 17 years. It 
therefore bears date in Z120. About the middle of the 12th 
century, it would appear fo have become a place of royal re« 
iidence. David I. kept his court at it, probably that he 
might be near to the Abbacy of Cambuikenneth, which he 
founded anno 1147, and on which he laviflied many marks 
of his favour. He brought the canons of that monaftery from

the neighbourhood .of Arras, in the county of Artois. tiX, 
ancient charters, they fubfcribe themfelves Ahhates de Stryve^ 
ling. Alexander Miln, Abbot of that place, was the firft 
Prefideiit of the Court of Seffion, inftituted by James V, anno 
X531. The Abbacy now belongs to Cowan's Hofpital in 
Stirling, having been purchafed from the predecefTors of Mr. 
Erflcine of Aloa, on whom the property of thefe knds was 
conferred at the reformation. It is probablci that Stirling 
grew to its prefent fize, very foon after it became the tempo- 
rary refidence of royalty ; and, from the moft accurate atten- 
tfon to its fituation and circumflanccs, it may be concluded to 
have undergone very little change, either in fize, or in the 
number of its inhabitants, for the laft 600 years, till very 
lately. JSut to give an account of the antiquities of Stirling, 
however defirable, would only be to wander into a labyrinth 
of conjedure. Mr. Nimm'o, in his hifiory of Stirlingfhire, 
has faid all upon this fubjeft, that can be ftated with any de* 
gree of certainty. There is no regular annal, or regifter, re*- 
fpeding it, previous to the middle of the X5th century; and 
the only one that reaches back to that period, or near it, is 
the regifter of fafines, commencing in I473. The council 
records commence in 1597* « 

Situation and Improvements. — ^The fituation of Stirling is ro- 
mantic. Raifed on a rock in the middle of an extenfive plain, 
in the near neighbourhood of a winding river, which fcems 
unwilling to part from it \ and, having the full view of finely 
cultivated fields, bounded on the fouth by rifing woodlands, and 
on the north by the Ochil hills, it is fcarcely poffible to imagine 
any landfcape more beautiful or piclurefque. Added to its 
fituation, which is Angularly beautiful, it has of late received 
many improvements, exceedingly conducive both to the com- 
ftirt and conveniency of the inhabitants. Water has been 
tix)ught from a confiderable diftance to fupply the town. 

Commodious 



of Stirling 2y^ 

Copimodious fchool houfes, in airy lituations, and a fpacious 
market place, have been ^refled within thcfe few years* A 
noble walk along the fumnait of the rock, at the very root of 
the foQth wall, from the one end of the toWn to the other, 
Ihaded from the fun by a {helving thicket of fine thriving 
trees, has been* lately finifhed at a confiderable expence 
This walk, which is perhaps the fineft thing of the kind, that 
any place can boaft of, was begun, anno X723,by aMr. Edmon* 
iloun of Cambus-Wallace, and finifhed only in the year 1791, 
under the patronage of the prefent magifirates. Much how. 
ever, as has been done to improve the beauty of Stirling, a 
great deal ilill remains to be done. The caftle and Gowan 
Hills, which admit of great improvement, aad which could 
no way hurt the fortrefs, though improved to the utmoft, 
remain like all other government property, as barren, rugged, 
and negleAedi as if the ftem Genius of the north had faid. 
Let them never be touched hy the hand of Art or Indujlry, 

From an attentive obfervation of the grounds on which 
Stirling (lands, and from the beft traditional accounts, Stir^ 
ling feems to have been neither m\ich increafed nor diminifli* 
ed, for feveral centuries. The court raifed it to its prefent 
fize. When that was withdrawn,' necefllty ftimulated to rn«- 
duftry and kept it up. It was ereded into a royal burgbV 
probably as far back as the middle of the 9th century. It 
holds the fifth place in the rank of royal burghs, and was 
one of the Curia quatuor burgorum^ a court which gave birth 
to the prefent Convention of Burghs. The jealous and con-t 
traded fpirit of incorporation^ ever tenacious of ancient cuf^ 
toms, and hoftile to all novelty and invention, nay, expuU 
£ve of the enterprifing ftranger, has kept the inhabiunts of 
Stirling trudging on in the routine of their greaUgreat-grand« 
fathers, as it muft ever do thofe of all places, where improve- 
ment is not forced, by peculiarly advantageous Iqcal ctrcura- 
Glances.

viz. a provoft, 4 bailies, a dean of guild, a treafurer, 7 mer«. 
chant counfellors, and 7 deacons of trade. Befides the ordi- 
nary jurifdi^tion in civil cai^fes, which is common to the ma- 
giftrates of all royal boroughs, and to the (h^rifii of counties, 
the magiftrsites of this town have alfo an es^tenfive criminal 
jurifdidion, conferred upon them by their charters, equal to 
the power of Sheriffs, within their territories. Prior to the 
year 1781, the old council eleSed the new one, 11 members 
at lead of the old council being changed yearly. Six of the 
7 trades fent a leet Qf 4, and the bakers a leet of 8 to the 
council, who had power to put a negative upon the one half 
of each leet. Each incorporation chofe one oi^t of the re^ 
mainder, as their reprefentative in council. The burgh 
having been disfranchifed in 1 775, by a fentence of the Houfe 
of Peers, confirming the decree of the Court of Sedion, his 
Majedy was pleafed, in I78x to reilore it to its privileges of 
dedion, by his poll warrant, in which be made the following 
alterations on the fet. The guildry company of merchants, an-? 
nually elcft 4 members of the new council. , The trades choofe

vener, cannot be continued in their ofEceB mere than 1 years

pany of merchants, is neceflarily changed yeaxiy. The trades 
incorporated by royal charter are, the bakers, weavers, hamf 
mermen, ikinners, butchers, tailors and (hoemakers. The

Peculiar Zifw. — ^There is a remarkable bye Jaw of this com- 
munity, made in 1695, which the members of council mull 
annually take 90 oath to obferve. By it they bind them- 
felves, to take no leafe of any part of the public property, 
under their management, nor to purchafe any part of it ; 
neither to receive any gratification oat of the public funds, 
pnder pretence of a reward for their trouble^ in going about 
the affairs of the borough, or of the hofpttals founded in iu 
By this bye-law, alfo, a hoard of auditors is elefted annually, 
for infpeAing the public accounts, confifting of a members 
chofen by the merchants at large, and % chofen in like manner

« 

Cqfik^ %3c. — ^None can tell, when the caAle was built, any 
more than the town. Even the bridge, which is doubtlels a 
work of much later date, has no memorial of the date of its 
eredion. The whole town ftands upon a rock, ftretching 
from N. E. to S. W. ; and, with the caflle, fituated on the 
utmoft prominence of the rock, towards the north, very 
much refembles the ridge on which the high ftreet and 
caftle of Edinburgh are fituated. Several of' the houfes in 
Stirling, now {landing, are doubtlels of very ancient date. 
In one, which was lately taken down, on the fouth fide of the 
broad flreet, there was a ftone marked IIII. — Mar*s Worip a 
large and aukward edifice^ was begun by the Earl . of that 
name, anno 1570, while he was regent of Scotland, but ne-^

Churches, t?f-— The weft church and tower were, itxsfaid, 
eredted in the time of Alexander III, or at le^ft not later tha^ 
the year 1494; when probably James V, caufed it to be builft^ 
for the accommodation of fome Francifcan Vriars, whom he 
had brought into th^ country, and fettled in a convetit, almoft 
contiguous to this church. It has no date upon it, and 
though of very ' beautiful architedure, it is now fo much 
under ground, and fo low roofed, that no reparation can ever 
render it a comfortsible plaee of worihip. Indeed, it has been 
very little employed for that purpofe fince the reformation,

ed in it, when the people of Stirling chofe to have a third 
minifter. The eaft churph, the prefent place of worOiip, wa$ 
creeled by Cardinal Beaton, and is a more fplendid and mag- 
nificent fabric, but is very little accommodated to the purpofes 
of Prefbyterian worfliip. It would need to be almoft totally 
altered and repaired, to render it either elegant or convenient. 
The abfu^^d pretence of its area teing private property, held 
on np better fecurity, than the gift or conveyance of the kirk-

Ecckfiaftical Hiftory* — ^The charge of Stirling was mad^ 
collegiate in the year 1651. Previous to that period, wefin(| 
a Mr. Robert Montgomery, a Mr. Patrick Simpfon, and a Mr. 
&amp;enry Guthrie minifters of Stirling. Montgomery was de- 
pofed by the aflembly, for a fimoniacal compaft with the Duke 
of Lennox, about the bilhoprick of Glafgow. • Mr. Henry 
Guthrifi was afterwards biihop of Dunkeld, and wrote " Me-

It appears from the council records, that this Mr. Guthrie, 
after his removal from Stirling, refided at Kilfpindie. There 
he probably wrote his memoirs. In i66i» after the death of 
James Guthrie, the council fent feveral deputations to invite 
him back to his charge in Stirling j but he declined it, on ac« 
count of bad health. Mr. Nimmo mentions another Mr, 
Henry Guthriei who was executed in the beginning of the 
reign of Charles IL on account of his adivity in oppoiing 
the meafures of the court. But this certainly was the cele- 
brated Mr. James, who was beheaded in the year x66i, and 
who was minifler of Stirling at that period, along with a Mr. 
David Bennet. There are fome of the faid James's books, 
with the chair in which he fat, ftill in the manfe of Stirling* 
In the council records, a Mr. John Allan is mentioned aj» prior 
to Mr. Bennet*. 

Mr. Ebenezer Erfkine was fettled 3d minifter in X73if * 
where he continued, tUl he was depofed by the General AT- 
fembly in 1738. Upon this, Mr. Eirikine, and three of his bre- 
thren, 

^ ^ By aA of council %, February 1663, Mr. Andrew Kynnter, minifter of Eaft 
Galder, was called and coUated by the biihop of £dinburgh as mioifter, alonj^ 
with Mr. Matthias Simpfon, who fuccceded Mr. Bennet. In 1665, Mr. James 
Forfyth was firft minifter. In 1668, Mr. Patrick Murray was made ad. minifter, 
in the roo«n of Mr. Kynnier who had died in 1664. But from the public conlii- 
fion ilthat period, the vacancy was not fooner fupplitd. An aft of asd January 
x676,appoints a commUIioncr to ^ to Edinburgh or St. Andrews, to fpeak to the 
archbifliop of St« Andrews, and offer to him the perfon whom the council has 
cfaofen to be firft minifter of this burgh s and to deal with his Grace effectually

who had acceded to them, about the Burgefs Oath, hj Mr. 
Moncrieff, which, in 1748, produced a fchifm among them. 

At the headpf the Affociate Sjnod remained Mr. Ebenezer 
£rlkine, and at the head of the other partj, who called them- 
felves Antiburghers, appeared Mr. Adam Gibb. Mr. Gibb 
excommunicated Mr. Erikine and his affociates. The excep- 
tionable claufe in the borgefis oath runs thus : *' Here I pro- 
'' teft before God and jour Lordihips, that I profels and al- 
^ low with mj heart, the true religion prefently ptofeffed 
** within thitf realm^ and authorifed bj the laws thereof j I 
*' ihall abide thereat and defend the famie to mj life's end^ 
^ renouncing the Roman religioti, called Papiftiy.*' 

The Antiburghers decreed, that it was inconfiflent with the 
principles of the SeceiBon, to fwear an attachment to the ef^ 
tablilhed religion, after having deferted it on account of its 
corruptions. The above burgefs oath was ufed at Perth. Id 
Stirling, there never was a word abotit religion in it, until 
fome few jears ago, the following claufe was introduced, at 
the defire of fonoe of the Antiburghers, to fcreen them from 
thecenfure of their minifier and feffion. t* I fwear to be a

The cotton manufa&amp;ure alfo begins to take place here, 
Three companies from Glafgow give out cotton yam to be 
woven, and one of them have about 40 little girls engaged at 
the tambour. Another company have this year got jennies \

Hofpitals^ Wr.— There are three hofpitals. The firft is that 

endowed by Robert Spittal, taylor to King James V. The 

date of the mortification i^ not on record. It is fuppofed to have 

been about i $30. The original fum is not known. It was 

mortified for the fupport and relief of poor tradefmen. There 

was a houfe built for thei^ reception, at the foot of Mary's 

Wynd ; but it is probable they never occupied it, as there is 

not fo much as a Angle tradition where it ftood. The funds 

were laid out on lands in the neighbourhood of Stirling. 

The prefent yearly rent of thefe lands is 231 L Mr. Nimmo, 

who fpeaks from report only, makes it 300 1.; and from 

the fame fource, makes the yearly income of Allan's Hofpital 

alfo 100 1. more than it really is» At prefent, there are 44 pen- 

fioners on SpittaPs Hofpital, 16 of whom, who were deacons 

of trade, receive per week i s. 4 d. :— the reft have weekly i s. . 

2 d. The annual expenditure, for the fupport of the poor on 

this foundation, is about 1721. Sterling* The managers of 

this hofpital are at prefent increafing the funds. The charter 

being loft, the patrons have no rule for diftributing the funds 

^^t cufiom. There is no provifion from this hofpital for the

widows of decayed trtdefmeo. There have been inftaaees of 
this, however, though thej are never admitted on the pen- 
fioD lift. This had been a much better charity ; but was un- 
happily overlook^ by the founder. A poor widow, ft ripped

Cowan's Hospital cornea next in order. It was founded 
and endowed by John Cowan, merchant in Stirling, anno 
1639, for the fupport of la decayed guild brethren. The 
4)riginal mortification was 9322 1. Sterling. There was a neat 
gented houfe ereded by the patrons, after Cowan's deadly 
for the reception of the brethren on whom he had entailed 
bis charity. The fituation of this houfe is moft beautiful and 
comantic. But what is furprifiag, there were Icarcely any to 
be found who would accept the benefit of charity, according 
to the appointment of the founder. The pride of the decayed 
brethren made them fpum at the idea of leaving their own 
honfes, and retiring into an hofpital, to be fupported oi^ 
public charity. For upwards of j)o years, the funds were al- 
lowed to accumulate. The houfe flood empQr for nearly th^ 
Vhole of that period^ nor was it ever completely occn« 
pied. With the accumulated funds, lands were purcfaafed. 
Among others^ thofe of the old Abbacy of Cambuikenneth^ 
The managers appointed by the founder were the town GOun« 
cil, together with the firft minifler of Stirling. They knew 
not what to do with the revenue of the hofpital. At lengthy 
it was refolved, to alter the mode of difpenfing the charity, 
fiill following out the fpirit of the inftttution. Not only de« 
cayed guild^brethren, but their widows and daughters aie ad- 
mitted to a fliare in thefe funds.. The prefent income of the 
lands belonging to Cowan's Hofpital is IX58I. Sterling. Therf 
are above an {lundred pcnfioners on this charity. They re- 
ceive weekly from i s. (J d. to a s. 6 d. each, which amounts

in incidental charities, paying public burdens, and the inte« 
t^tt of money lately borrowed to make an additional and ad- 
imnugeotU purchafe of lands. The funds art carefully ma« 
nagedt and, notwithftamfitig the above large expenditures^ 
inuft increafe. 

John Allak writer in Stirling, in emulationy: very proba-* 
Vly, of the benevolent example of liie above mentioned gentle-^ 
jjaan, would alfo ^gag« in the eftablifliment of an hofpital. 
He had more ezperiencet stud was determined , to render his 
Bounty more extenfively ufeful and beneficial. About the 
year X7^5» therefote, he mortified a fum of money, not for 
the fupport of the indigent fquanderer, the negligent, and the 
ilninduftriouar, but for the maintenance and education of the 
children of decayed tradefinen. The fum mortified was 
30,000 merks. The managers are, the town coimcil, and the 
ftcond minifter. They laid out the money on lands. The 
yeariy rental of thefe lands, at prefent, is 298 1. Sterling* 
There are now 14 boys, maintained clothed and educated oa 
thefe funds. The mailer of the hofpital receives at the rate 
6f XI 1. Sterling annually for each of them. They are admit-' 
ted at 7 years of age, and kept in the houfe till they are 14. 
At leaving the hofpital, they ate allowed ico merks to put 
diem to a trade. The annual expenditure upon the mainte* 
nance, dbthing, and education of thefe boys, is about 164 L 
Sterlmg. According to a claufe in Mr. Allan's will, order- 
ing fupply to be given from thefe funds, to any of his poor 
rdations,. who may be in indigent circumllances, there is ac 
prefent about 37 1. Sterling yearly, paid to eight of his rtla- 
tions, at the rate of z s. 9 d. per week. The furplus funds^ 
after paying public burdens, &amp;cc. go to accumulation. 

Befides thefe charitable foundations, the funds of the guil« 
Atj^ or merchant company, defray the expence of educating

the poor guild brethren's thildreo, affift them in purchafin j 
clotheSy and paying their apprentice fees. The Kirk'^Seffion 
f^js to ^6 paupers annually about 73 1. Sterling, at the rate 
of 6 d. per week to each. From the town's funds, there are 
uz who receive about J 6 1. Sterling annually, at the rate of 
X 8. per week. They alfo pay for teaching 14 or 30 poot 
children to read Englifh. 

To prevent the nuifance oi begging poor, a Icheme^ by anna* 
al voluntary fubfcription, was fet on foot fome years ago, from 
which about 80 paupers receive annually 156L Sterling, at 
the rate of pd. each per week. Be&amp;des all thefe charities, the 
Kirk-Se£lion diftributes betwixt 40 1. and 50 1. Sterling a-year 
to incidental poor. Nearly the fame lum, or more, is diftri- 
buted annually by the Burgher Secei&amp;on ; and the boxes of 
the different incorporations alfo give charity to a confiderable 
extent. It is fuppofed, that every lath perfon in Stirling re- 
ceives charity* 

'!rhis may feem furprifing ; and it will be neceflary to me&amp;« 
ikon fome of the more obvious caufes, why there are fo many 
poor, and fo great confumption of charitable funds, in fuch s 
fmall place as Stirling. It is generally faid, that Stirling being 
fo near the Highlands, and known to be rich in ^nds, a number 
•f indigent people, while they are ftiU capable of labour, but 
have little or no profpeft of fupport at home, ihould infirmi- 
ty or old age come on, emigrate annually into Stirling, and 
take up their rcfidence there, till three years are elapfed, 
when they give in their elaim for fupport^ and are of courfe 
admitted as neceffitous poor. It cannot be denied, but there 
may be fome truth in the allegation, becaufe the greater num- 
ber of poor on the Stirling penfion lifts, are obvioufly of Gae- 
lic extradion. Their names are almoft all Gaelic names. Be- 
fides, there can be no doubt, that the report of rich funds has 
a firong attra6iion. This circumftance, of itfelf, chiefly mul- 
tiplies

tiplies the poor. Increafe the means of dependence, and the 
the effed is unavoidably increafed. This is more efpecially 
the cafe, if the funds are legally eftabliflied, and, if a certain 
age and defcription entitles to a participation of thefe funds. 
It is more than prefumable, that all charitable fupply, ex- 
cept in cafes of abfolute incapacity of labour, (hould be cafif- 
al, exadly proportioned to the deficiency of aftive power, and 
^dependent on the moil accurate inveftigation of the prefent 
circumftances of the pauper. If this is not the cafe, it uni- 
formly cuts the nenres of induftry, and is a nui&amp;nce to fo« 
ciety, rather than an advantage. The indolent and the cla* 
-morous, looking forward with folicitude to that period, when 
they Ihall undoubtedly be entitled to fupport by certain fta- 
tute, remit every exertion, confome like drones any little 
property that may remain to them, and fall at length, with 
eagemefs, into the arms of provided and fecured fupport, witk 
a haughty contempt to this iacred diflate of common fenfci 
•• That he who will not work, fliould not cat;** 

The managers of the eftablifhed charitable funds in Stirling 
are perhaps as accurate, attentive, and impartial, as any fuch 
body of men can be ; but they muft walk by ftatute, and ara 
often obliged to admit upon the funds, thofe who both can and 
0ugbt to labour for their bread. This circumilance has aa 
inflaence extenfively pernicious. Indolence is contagious* 
They who are capable of labour, being rendered indolent and 
' inadive, through dependence on fecured fupport, gave a tinc- 
ture to all their immediate connedions. They are ever found 
among the fauntering and the idle, and confequently increafe 
the number of the poor*

ways prqduftive of depen4cnce. Thej continne the demand 
oa the poor's f^nd \ thej increafe the number of the poor. 
Tlus caufe indeed is not peculiar to Stirling. It operates in 
every plape where (he adminiflratipn is not in the hands of 
the Seffioo, firho, from the frequency of their meetings, an4 
their thorough acquaintancf: with the circumfiances of the 
poor, mnft eyer be the moft iiatnral and judicious difpenfers

men of landed property, who, in many p|ac^ of Scotland^ 
haye contributed to anaibilate the Seflions, will foon find the 
puniihment of their folly, in the enprmous weight of aflefsr 
meat, which they muftlay i^pqn ttieir la^^d, £pr tl^e fupport of 
the daily incieafing poor. 

The great number of low hoyfea ii^ Stirling augments th« 
lift of the poor. The proprietors of Cuch hou£es, unable or 
unwilling to repair them, can let thena only to \bc poor, the 
fluggiih, or thp depraved* None eUe ^urill take them. In 
iiich uncomiortaUe habitations, the fpirits of men are broken| 
or their health impaired ; and they fbon fall unavoidably on 
the funds of the poor« 

The low rate of female labour in Stirling, is another fource 
pf poverty. The )itmofi a woman can e^m by fpinning wool, 
is 3 d. a*day. With this they cannot maintain tbemfelves, 
pay the rent of a houfe, and get other nece^aries. Such fmall 
f ncouragemeat deHtroys induftry. A femide having fo little 
profped of advantage from her labour, i$ at,ix pabs to be ex- 
pert in iC' Many of them will rather be idle altogether than

labour

^I&amp;boiir »s lefs, becatife it iv fo unproduAtve. ManufiEiftarers 
ibould confider themfelves as obliged to increafe the price pi 
female labour. 

Bilt perhaps the chief c^ufc of the numerous poor in Stir^- 
iing is the caftle. This maj feem a paradox, but it is eafy 
to be explained* The fole ufe of this fortrefs, at prefent, is to 
be an afylUm to invalids; About ido of thefe are generally 
ftationed in it; Thefe men, who probably enlifted at firft, 
from diflike to labottr and regularity^ do not find, in the army^ 
much opportunity of becoming attached either to induftry or 
fobriety. Hating generally eontr&amp;ded habits of thonghtlef- 
nefs and diflipatfon, they retire into the caftle, very little qna» 
lified to enjoy the advantages df that fituation. Secured in 
-6 d. a*day, or lodging forward to the Ghelfea penfion, the low 
women in Stirling afpire at a tonneftion with them, and think, 
that when they are wives of caftk foldiers, they (hall never 
^ant; When thefe invalids and penfioncd foldiers are fober 
and indttftribus, they are tety able, with their pay^ to pro- 
vide a decent fiipport for their families \ but few of them are 
of thiii charafter; Being generally ignorant, vicious and de^ 
baiiched^ they get wives like themfelvest ?or make them fo. 
AH their introme is ufually fpent with the day. They never 
get their houfes fumiihed. They live amidft me^nnefs and 
tags; Their mlhdfi are disbafed; Their children are trained 
op. uilder the very i^orft example. The fathers foon die, 
worn out with intemperance. They leave their families beg- 
gared, unprincipled and debauched. Thefe fsimilies are the 
nnrferies of beggars. Nearly one half of the paupers in Stir- 
^ng fpring from thefe nntferies. 

Where there is fo much poyerty, there will of courfe be 
much bafenefs and degeneracy of mind. True religion only 
eui 'tame the heart, and f weeten the manners of the poor. On 
them^ however, thkis generally found to have little influence. 

O o a The 



fl^2 ^tatijlical Account 

The ftrpDg cravings of nature lead them another way. Thefe^ 
being but ill fapplied, produce violence, chagrin, jealoufj^* 
and every ill paffion. Give thens, and they are tolerably 
quiet and orderly ( but withhold or conftrain, (both of which 
are often abfolutely neceflary,) and they are clamorous, furly, 
invidious, and bent on every pradice within their reach, how* - 
ever criminal it may be, to obtain what they need. The 
manners of the inferior ranks in Stirling, muft therefore be 
Beceflarily rough, petulant and difagreeaUe, Harrafled with 
perpetual anxieties about daily bread, they have little or no 
time to think of fuperior objeAs ; and either will not, or can* 
not come within the reach of thofe important lefibns of divine 
truth, which fupport the mind of man, and render him calm, 
TOtient and compofed, even although the field ihould yield vm 
^fBom, 

Bat what ftill farther induces this unwilling complainf, 
againft the manners of the poor, is a circumfiance not peculiar 
to Stirling, though it takes place there. It is found in almoft 
every town, city, and borough, throughout Great Britain, 
and is iingularly difgraceful to a great and enlightened nation. 
There is generally no room in churches for the accommoda^ 
tion of the poor. They muft either loiter away the days of 
public folemnity, in floth and vicious indulgence at home, 
which they will very foon be inclined to do, or they muft 
ftand at an awful diftance, in feme cold unoccupied area, 
which very foon becomes irkfome and intolerable. Befides, 
in fuch lituations, it is {carcely poffible they can receive muck 
advantage from public inftruAion. Let a remedy be provid- 
ed for this evil : Let churches be built, or decent places pro- 
vided for the accommodation of the poor, and their manners 
would foon be correfted, at much lefs expence, and much 
more effedually, than by thoufands expended on die building 
of bridewells and correQion houfes. Charity employed in

preventing vice is charitj indeed. That which is emploje4 
in corri£iing it is pften mere felfiihnefs. ' 

The manners of the inferior ranks are alfo much hurt and 
debafed every where, by the great number of tippling hoiifes, 
and the low price of ardent fpirits* Of thefe, the number ia 
Stirling has been cdniiderablj diminiihed for fome years pad, 
but ought to be ftill more fo« In 1782, there were 94 licenC- 
•d ale houfes in Stirling. In 1790, there were only 68. The 
difference has arifen probably from the additional tax* la 
178^9 a licence coH 1 1. i s.. In 1790, a licence qoft i l.ii Sp 
6d. If the legiflature would increafe the tax upon the retail of ar« 
dent fpirits, it is probable fuch a ftep would contribute much 
to prfevent the growing depravity of the people. It woul4 
diminifh the number of thofe nefts of vitiation. It would 
leffen their accefBbility, efpecially to the weaker fex, who, 
from many circumfiances, are too eafily led to haunt them. 
One of thefe muft be particularly mentioned, though not pe-* 
culiar to Stirling. While females are fervants in families o£ 
fuperior rank^ or even in the houfes of the better kind of 
tradefmen, inftead of receiving abundance of plain and whole, 
fome food, which is their due, they are fooliflily indulged 
with luxuries, which they can tafieno more the moment they 
become the wives of honed labourers. Feeling this change 
#f fituation, which occaiions difagreeable refle&amp;ions, and fub« 
jefted to the uneafineiTes unavoidably conneded with their 
change of date, they betake themfelves to ardent fpirits to kill 
their griefs, and are thus infeniibly led into habits of intoxi- 
cation, which ruin theitlfelves, their interefls, and their fa« 
milies in every refpef^. There is no caufe of increafing im« 
morality, among the lower ranks of the people, more abun- 
dant than this* There is none, which the care of magiflrates 
and rulers ought to be more employed to prevent. If the 
mothers of families are corrupted, virtue muft be gone.

irants, more thtn to tbeic prefent indnlgence. MagifttatH 
and rulers ihould render the venom^ whioh poifons the morals 
of the people, as inacceffible as polfible. 

iThis is more in their power, and taftly more pradicable^ 
as well as likely to be more 'efficient in remedying material 
evils, than the fyftcm fo mnch in vogue among our prefent 
Iciolifis in government, who are for pulling down every 
thing, in order, as they pretend, to build up a more perfeS 
and beautiful edifice* Let the revenue laws be reviewed *• 
By them, the people have been in a maimer compelled to 
ufe fpiritous liquors, for want of wholefome beer. The^ pre^ 
fent mode of gauging the brewer, and of farming the duties 
to the diftiller, has the unavoidable effeft of ruining the for- 
mer^ and encouraging the latter. The coofequenCe is, that 
the brewery, in moft parts of Scotland, produces a thin vapid 
four fluff, under the name of fmall beer, which is all that the 
common people Can poffibly ^et for their money, unlefs they 
go to the expence of Englifh porter, now become the beve4 
rage of the more opulent. The poor labourer, finding that 
the beer he purchafes neither warms nor nouriflies him, fliey 
unavoidably to ardent fpirits, now felling at a veiy reduced 
priee. 

Befides, the diftiller works, as it is called, agdinft time^ i. e. 
he pays fo ^ much annually per gallon, for the contents of his 
ftill, and works without contcouL It is faid, that a diftiller 
can now charge his ftill, no lels than 35 times in ^4 hours, 
inftead of once or twice as formerly, when he was regularly 
furveyed. This pours in fo great a quantity of the common 
dity to the market, that it cannot mifs being cheap. Hence

• Mifcelbmeous Ohfervations. — Stirling being fitoated on the 
ifthmusy betwixt the Forth and Clyde, is, bj means of its 
bridge, the great thorough-fare of the north of Scotland* 
There are only two inns in it which dcferve the name. Theft 
are fpacious and good. — The county meetings are ofually 
held in Stirling. There is no public room, or hall for this 
purpofe. — Stirling is one of the feats of the Circuit Court.-^ 
•The only jail in the county is here. The number of pri- 
fcmers is generally not great. For thefe three laft years, 
there have been only two criminal trials* Petty thefts and 
debt are the ordinary caufes of imprifonment.-— The Falkirk 
diftrift of the county, being the moft populoiis, and no pub* 
lie magiftrate refiding there, it uniformly fumiflies the greaN 
eft number of prifoners.— The banditti always croud to a po-. 
puloos place, where there is no efiabli&amp;ed authority. There 
Ihould be, in every county, a public work-hottfe, for the con- 
finement of the pilferers and fomcrs, who are found to be of 
that county. Banifhment only inereafes their neceifity of 
fiealing. 

In the council honfe of Stirling is the yugg^ appointed bj 
law to be the ftandard of dry meafure in Scotland, It is fta- 
mted and ordained, thaft the wheat firlot fliall contain the full 
of this jugg twenty one times and one fourth ; and that the

the parifli, there is the veftige of an old chapel, called Kirk^

The etjmology of thefe oames is uncertain : probably they 
are either of Celtic or Saxon original.

parifli is e^cecdlnglj rarious, generally thin. In fome places. 
It is a fine loam ; in others, it is a deep watery till, efpecial- 
Ij on the fmall hills of a conical figure, with which the parifli 
abounds. Thefe little hills are all arable ; but thej render 
the fnrface very uneven. The moft luxuriant crops are pro- 
ducedy in general, when the ground is well manured with 
dung, lime, or marl. Lime is imported from England at 1 1. 
Sterling per Carlifle buihel. In the north end of the parifl], 
there is abundance of the fineft ihell marl. On the S* and S. 
W. borders of the pari(h, there are fome hills, moftly covered 
with heath. The higheft of thefe is fteep and rocky, and rifes 
HOC feet above the level of the fea* 

Climate and Diftafes^ l5'r.^Kelton is feldom vifited with 
thofe fogs, or noxious damps, which are unfriendly to health. 
The ait is, in genera], dry and falubrious. No difeafes are 
known to prevail in the pariih, but fuch as appear in other 
places of the country, that are deemed healthful. Rheumatic 
complaints feem to prevail moft. Fevers of diiFerent kinds 
now and then appear, and fometimes confumptions, &amp;c. ^The 
ravages of the fmall pox are greatly prevented by the hu- 
mane and fuccefsful plan of inoculation. Inftances of longe- 
vity have not been a wanting in Kelton. Seventy is not rec- 
koned old age. Numbers arrive at 80 years, and feveral at 
90, and upwards. There is a woman now living in the pa- 
rifli, aged between 97 and 100 years; and a woman died 
lately at the town of Caftle-Douglas, having reached the long 
period of 107 or 108 years. She remembered King William 
the Ill's cavalry pafling through this country to Ireland ift

Produce and Exportation. — ^The chief produce of Kelton is 
oats, which are of a verj good quality. A confiderable quan- 
titjr of barlej, and bigg^ or hear, is raifed in the pariih ; and 
fome wheat. Rje, peafe, and beans, are not much cultivat- 
ed ; but there is plenty of potatoes for home confumption^ 
and a good deal for exportation. The lands are generally 
laid down, or fown out, with rye-grafs and clover. Few have 
yet paid attention to Tnrnips. The average exportation of 
grain is, of late years, about 2000 bolls, ea^ch boll containing 
I X Winchefter buihels, or 32,000 Winchefter buihels in whole. 
The markets are, the north of England, and the weft of Scot- 
land, llie oats, when well cleaned, yield rather more than 
a ftone of meal per buihel. One great hindrance to improve- 
ments, in this place, is th^ high multures. Hemp and flax 
are 4iot much attended to in this pariih. 

Blaci Cattle f SheepfHe.^-^The ftaplecommodity of Galloway, 
which comprehends the ihire of Wigton, and ilewartry of 
Kirkcudbright, is black cattle and iheep. Befldes what are 
ufed in home confumption, many thoufands of black cattle 
are annually driven to the Engliih markets. The black cattle 
in Kelton amount to above 2000, are ftrong made, and of a 
middle fize. . The flieep do not exceed zooo. Thofe fed upon 
the hills are of the fmall old breed of the country ; thofe fed 
on the lower and improved grounds, are much larger ; gene*^ 
rally of a mixed Engliih breed, and have finer wool $ but are 
ilronger, and not fo pleafant to the tafte, as the fmall kind. 
There arc above 300 ^orfes in the pariih, — ^Therc arc 50 
ploughs, and 89 carts employed in hufbandrj(.|

about 90, or 91 males to 100 females. No diftinft regtfler of 
births, marriages and deaths, has been kept in Kelton, fince 
the year 1727 ; and therefore, the different ages of the inha- 
bitants cannot, with any fort of precifion, be flfcertained* 
The increafe of population has been very confiderable in the 
parifh fince the year 1765, and is ftill advancing, with rapid

accommodation of the people. 

JV«/.-^Peats are the fuel that has been commonly u(ed 
in Kelton ; but they are now become very fcarce, as the 
mofs in moft places, is nearly exhaufted. No coal has yet 
been found in this country, and the ezpence of that article 
from England is e^eedingly high. Coals, at prefent, in the 
port of Kirkcudbright, are fold at 1 1. 8 s. Sterling per ton^ 
exclufive of cartage, which, to the canfumer in Kelton, raifei 
the price to about two guineas per ton *• 

Rent^ Heritors^ (^r.— The rental of Kelton, as it ftanda 
upon the Cefs Roll, is 3598 1. Scotch. The real rent is above 
4500 L Sterling. There are x8 Heritors in the pariiOb, 7 of 
whom refide. 

Villages and Mariets. — ^There asv two villages in the pa- 
rifh, both upon the military road, about a mile and a half 
diitant from each other. At the fouth weft village, called 
Rbonboufe or Kdt(m Hili, there is held on the firft Tuefiiay 
after the X7th day of June, O. S. an annual horfe fair, the 
largeft, perhaps, of any in Scotland, where there is, generally, 
a very fine Ihew of all forts of horfes. To this fisur, vaft 
numbers of horfe-dealers refort from England, Ireland, 
and the eaft, fouth, and well of Scotland. Manyjchapmeii 
and hawkers frequent Kelton Hill fair. Upon the hill ad* 
joining to the village, where the fair is held, many large and 
well covered tents are ere&amp;ed by people from Dumfries

black cattle is held upon Monday, beginning in Odober, and 
ending in December, every year,

palled Carlinwarkf now ere&amp;ed into a free and independent 
)urgh of barony, and denominated Cafile^hQugUa^ after the 
fuperior, is fituated at the north comer of the Carlinwark 
Loch. Within the limits of this burgh, there are, at prefent^ 
Jietwcen 600 and 700 inhabitants, where, 26 years ago, there 
were not 20. At this town a banking branch is now eftab* 
liihed \ and, two companies are engaged in the manufadurc 
of cotton : one of thefe companies, (in which the fuperior, 
William Douglas £fq. of Caftle-Douglas, a gentleman of 
great property, and principal heritor of the parilh, is concern- 
ed,) proceeds upon a pretty large fcale. Here, likewife, a 
foap«wprk, brewery, tannery, and woollen manufadory, are 
in contemplation. One great hindrance, however, to the 
cftablifliment and carrying on of extenfive manufadures in this 
place, with fuccefs, and to advantage, is the fcarcity of fuel. 
Should a plao be adopted whereby to remedy that inconveni- 
piiice, it would tend much to the benefit of Kelton, and this 
country in general. Were the tax taken off the importation 
of co^ls from England, that falutary end would, perhaps, in 
a great meafure, be attained. In regard to population, the 
towa «f Cafile-Douglas, is increaling with rapidity, and needs 

pnly mauufaftures to render it coniiderable *•

Wages ^ Servants^ ?/r.— •The common rate of wages given tb 
ft man fervant, fit for everj branch of hufbandry, is from t 
fo 9 guineas per annum. And the wages given to the bcft 
women fervantSi are from 3 L 10 s. to 4 1. 10 s. per stnnum* 
Forty years ago, the very beft men fervants received nd mori 
than 2 1, per annum, and the beft female fervants i ^ s. Ster-^ 
ling. The common rate of wages, then, was confidcrably 
lower than is ftated above. Cotter's wages are now about 151* 
Sterling per annum. Tradefmen have i s. 8 d. per day, and 
fome receive more, ezclufive df viduals. The number of 
men fervants in Kelton, including cotters, of whom there arc 
30, amounts to about loo* The female fervants are aiearly 
double that number.

mill, and one flax mill. Though flax is not much attended to ia 
Kelton, the mill is fupplied from the neighbourhood around,**. 

Lake hnd Marl. — ^Near the north corner of the parifli^ 
there is a lake, commonly called He Carlinwark L^cb^ along 
the weft fide of which runs the military road. The extent 
of this loch, before it was partly drained in the year 1765, 
was 116 fquare acres. Ten feet of water were then taken oH 
from it by a cut, or canal, to the water of Dee. Now it is only 
80 fquare acres in extent. This loch is one great fource of 
improvement to Kelton and the neighbourhood. It contains 

ia 

land. About fix years ago, the poftages received at this ofSce, amounted only to 
iabout 48 or 50 L Sterling, and did not defray the expence of the eftablifliment. 
Now it yields a revenue of 140 1. Sterling per annum, and is ftill upon the incrcafe.

/is»^rovMimf^.-^ince the loch was dnuned^ the face of "the 
country, all around, has undergone a very wonderful change in 
point of improvement. Not only Kelton, but the parifhes of 
Buittle, Grofsmichael, Balmaghie, PartoUi Balmaclellan and 
KeUs» reap the benefit of the marl from the Carlinwark 
Loch and its vicinity. Marl is carried from the Loch in flat 
bottomed boats, along the canal to the Dee, in large quanti« 
ties, for the improvement of the lands on each fide. It is 
conveyed up the river, by means of thefe flats, as far as New 
Galloway, to the diftance of 15 or x 6 miles *• Before the 
late improvements in huflandry, the crops in this place were, 
in general, very light ; and the grain, in quantity and quality, 
inferior, by far, to what it is now. 

jintiqmtiis^^^At the N. E. boundary of the parifh, there 
is the veftige of an old Druidical temple, near to which there 
is an abundant fpring of excell^t water. It was, probably held 
lacred to the worfliip of the pagan God, Tbor. From this 
temple, the farm in which it is fituated, feems to have deriv* 
its name, Hbors or Tors, plural, being now divided into ttj^ 
fir, and netler.

is faid, McClelland of Raeberry, Lord Kirkcudbright, was put to -death by the 
command of Douglas, notwithftanding the king*a letters demanding his releafe* 
This circumftance proved fatal to Douglas, his family and intereft, in this pare 
of the country. The remains of Raebery lie buried in the church of KirkcoN 
mock, as appears from the infcription upon a grave-ftone there. In the centre 
of a cairn, near Gelfton, was found a ftone coffin, above 1 feet long, and 3 fi^

from this ifle, to the oppofite fide, on the N. E. there is a 
road of ftone fecured by piles of oak wood, with an opening, 
fuppofed to have been for a draw-bridge. In feveral places 
of the ^l^och, canoes were foi^nd, which appear to have been 
' hollowed, after the manner of the American Savages, with 
fire. On a fmall ifle, near the north end of the Loch, there 
was found a large iron mallft or hammer, ftained on one end 
with blood. It is now in the hands of the Anti(juarian So*

There is a good deal of what is called balm land, which bears 
very good crops of barley and oats. Sowing of wheat is not 
much ufed in the pariih, nor in this part of the country. 
Lime, which is now greatly ufed as a manure, is brought, at 
the diftance of 1 2 miles, from the fouthermoft part of the pa« 
rifii, and is alfo carried to the high grounds, where the foil is 
not fo good i and in general good crops are produced after 
liming. 

RoadSf ^r.— -The great turn-pike road from Carllfle to 
Glafgow and Edinburgh, pafles through the parifh, from 
fouth to north, about fix mile&amp;. This road was made about 
25 years ago, and has been of the higheft advantage to the im« 
provement of this neighbourhood. A mail coach, from London 
to Glafgow, pafles through the parifh, every day, along the 
laid turn-pike road ; and carriers almoft daily trom Glafgow 
to Carllfle, and the manufafturing towns in England. There 
is a ftage in the parilh, viz. Dinwoodie Green, where the 
mail coach ftops and changes horfcs. This ilage is only 5 
miles diftant from the village of Lockerby, where there is a 
poft office^ II miles from Ecclesfechan, and 1 1 from Moffat, 
which are alfo flages, and have poft of&amp;ces. Through the lat- 
ter village, a diligence paflcs from Dumfries to Edinburgh, 
3 times a- week, which renders travelling from this part of 
the country, to Edinburgh and Glafgow, very eafy and con. 
venient. The parifh is diftant from Edinburgh about 60 
miles, and nearly an equal diftance from Glafgow. 

proprietors and Rent^r^Thetc are fix heritors in the parifh,^ 

but

bat onlj one of them refides, viz. Sir William Jardin^ of Ap-» 
pkgarth, Bart, who h^ s the moil confiderable property in it. 
The valued rent is 6725 merks. The real rent is eftimated 
at between 2800 1. and 3000 L Sterling ; but the proprietors 
are not all willing to difclofe the amount of their rents. 

Population. — ^The number of inhabitantSi in the parifli, have 
greatly decreafed within the laft 15 jears/owing to the pro- 
prietors of the lands, having conjoined a number of fmall 
farms together, and let them to one tenant. The males and 
females bom in the pariih are nearly equal. For the fpace of 
15 years, there has been only eight more males bom. than 
females. This, however, cannot be exa&amp;ly aCcertained, for 
the Seceders feldom enter the names of their children in the 
regiller. The following table exhibits the ancient and pre^^

Churchy l;^r.— -The manfe is an old houfe, built upwards of 
(o years ago* The church is ficu.ated near the river Annan, 

and 



ff AppUgartb, :3ii 

foid was built about 30 years ago. It IS large and well built, 
apd fufficient, at prefent, to coutain the whole inhabitants of tl)e 
parifli. It has a large jarn^ very commodious for difpenC 
ing the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which , in fome of 
the neighbouring parifhes, for want of room in the churches, 
is difpenfed in the fields. The ftipend has beep, for upwards 
of 60 years, 72 L Sterling, including Communion Elements ; 
but the Lords of Council and Seffion have lately been pleaCr 
ed to grant an augmentation of 4 chalders of viftual, 2 of 
them meal, and a of them bear, which wi)l now make the « 
ftipend 100 guineas a-year, or better. The glebe is verj 
^all, only confiding of between 5 and 6 acres. 

It is generally fuppofed, that there have been 2 parifiie9 
annexed to Applegarth, viz. Sibbaldbie and Dinwopdie. It 
is not certain, however, whether Dinwoodie was ever a diC« 
tin&amp; parifli or not. It appears rather to have been a Chapel 
of £afe to Applegarth. Sibbaldbie has been a diftinA parilli ; 
and, fome of the old people, now living, remember to have 
feen the church ilandipg, of which there are ftill fome ve(ti« 
ges. The minifter of Applegarth was in ufe to officiate oc-^ 
caConally at Sibbaldbie, The Marquis of Annandale claims 
the patronage of Sibbaldbie. Sir William Jardine is patrqa 
of Applegarth, and claims alfo the patronage of Sibbaldbie. 

Schools and Poor. — There are 2 fchool-houfes lately built 
in the parifh, at the expence of the heritors, who have volun« 
tary afiefsed themfelves with the payment of 5 1. Sterling an- 
nually, to one of the fchoolmafters, and 3 1. 6 s. 8 d. to the 
Other. There are about 10 or 12 perfons in the pari(h on the 
poor's lift, who occ^fionally get a fmall fupply from the col- 
Jedions made in the church ; and, there is a mortification of 
3 1. 6 s. 8 d. granted by the family of Applegarth, which, bj 
fhe deed of mortification, is to be diftributed at the fight, and

baropy of Applegartti, and nine merk land of Sibbaldbie ; 
which IS that part of the old parifli of Sibbaldbie, that belongs 
to the eftate of Applegarth. 

Fuel and Mills. — ^The common fuel is peats, the procuring 
of wnich occafions a vtry great labour for the people, during 
the whole of fumroer ; and, in wet feafons, the inhabitants are 
^eatlj diftrefled for want of fuel in winter. There are 3 
corn mills in the pari(h, a barley and lint mill were lately- 
built on the water of Dryfe, and another lint mill is now 
building on the water of Annaji. 

Cattle and produce. — There are only  or 3 flieep farms 19 
the pariih. The number of (heep does not exceed 1800 or ' 
aooo. There are about 1500 black cattle, i jo horfes, and 
60 ploughs. The farmers, in general, are in tolerable good 
circumftances ^ and, from the high prices of black eattle, (the 
crops alfo being good after liming, and oats, meal and barley^ 
giving a good price,) they are now better able to pay their 
rents, than they were fome years ago, though the rents have 
been raifed coniiderably. The average price of barley is from 
2 s. 6 d. to 3 s., the Winchefter buihel ; of oats 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. 
end oat meal z s. 8 d. or x s. «^ d. per ftone. Thefe are the 
ftaple commodities by which many of the tenants pay their 
rents. A confiderable number of black cattle alfo are reared 
in the parifli ; and thefe, when about a year and a half old^ 
are fold for about 2 1. 10 s. or 3 L each. 

Cultivation. — Several of the farmers are now getting into a 
better mode of managing their farms, by fummer fallowing, 
by fowing turnips, planting cabbage&amp;, and other green crops ; 
after which they fow barley with grafs feeds. It is not long

ftncethe fowing of barley ivas introdaced into the parifli. Bear» 
which ftill moftlj prevails, was univerfally fown. Few of 
the fjEurms are inclofed. It would be a very great improvemeat 
to this part of the country, and of advantage to the farmers^ 
if their farms were all inclofed, and fubdivided with dykes, 
and hedges. The hedges would thrive exceedingly well, as 
the foil, in general, is good, and where they have been plant- 
ed, they have thriven w^U.

Situmion and ExtenU 



THIS parifli lies within the coantj of Ajr, and difirift 
of Cunninghain ; excepting 4 farms which beloog t«. 
Renfrewlhire, on the border of which it is fituated. It ex^ 
tends about 5 miles in length* £rom £. to W. and its 
breadth is about 4. The land rifes bj a gradual afcent from 
S. to N. where there is a finall ridge of hills, whofe fummits 
are elevated, perhaps about 400 £eet,aboi» the loweft ground 
ifk the pari(h, or 500 feet above the leve^ of the fea. 

Rini^ HtritorSt Cuktvationf l^e.«*-The valued rent, of that 
part of the panih which lies in Ajrihire, is 61 15 L 24 s. ad, 
Scotch; and that of the 4 farms in It^enfrewihire, 2^3 1* ^s* 
8 d. The real rent is believed to be in Ibme places 6 timest 
in others^ 8 times, and, perhaps in others, owing to their vi« 
cinity to the town of Beith, the richnefs of the foil, or tho 
high cultivation of the lands, even 12 tiflics the valued rent«

There are two circmnflances chieflj, which ferve to accounC 
for tbe high tent of lands in this neighbourhood. The coan« 
try is populous, and property is greatlj fubdivided. BeitK 
is furrounded on all fides with cohfiderable villages and towns/ 
to the number of 12, within as many miles. The fiibdivi- 
fion of property is more remarkable, in this and the neigh* 
bouring parilbes, than perhaps in any other part of Scotland. 
There are in this pariih 105 heritors, befides a confiderable 
jDumber of fmaller proprietors in the Tillage* This circum-t 
Aance is fuppofed to have much influence upon the cultiva^i 
tion, and of confequence upon the produce and rent of lands* 
The fmall land-holders generally refide upon their own pro* 
perty ; and improvements made by any of them, in the cul- 
tivation of their lands, and management of their farms, are 
more readily adopted by the reft, than thofe introduced by 
perfons who have lar^e eftates, or carry on farming upon a 
more extcniive fcale, becaufe they are evidently more withiii 
their reach. The lands in this parifli are almoft all arable^ 
and were generally inclofed many years ago. The common 
pradice amongll farmers is to plough only a third part of 
the arable ground annually, upon which they taife oats or 
barley^ but feldom any wheat, peas or beans. Rye-grafs 
feed is frequently fown, where the ground is rich, or well 
manured } but very little clover is raifed, and fometimes hay 
is made from the natural grafs. . 

Cbeefey Cattle^ \Sc. — ^The tenants in this pariih pay their 
rents chiefly from their dairy. They almoft univerfally make 
fwieet milk cheefe. The method of making this cheefe was 
firft introduced into this country, by a farmer's wife in the 
parifli of Dunlop, about the beginning of this century ; and 
from this circumftance, it has got the name of Dunlop cheefe^ 
It is a comilkodity which has been rifing in valae for a long

time paft. The prefentjrice is 7 s. per ftone, cqQtaming 14 iW* 
Englifli. About 100 cows are kept for the purpofe of mak-*^ 
jog cheefe. The average produce from each cow, b^des 
what goes to the ufe of the Tamil j, is fuppofed to be 3 1. xo s. 
Sterling per annum ; and coofequendy, the quantity of eheefe- 
fent to the market annuallTv from this pariibi ihould bring t^ 
the farmers about 3500 1. *• 

Roads and B ridges .^^The great road frotrt Glafgow, by 
iPaifley, to Irvine, Ayr and Port-Patrick, paffes through the 
town of Beith. It is much frequented, efpecialty in fummer* 
A ftage coach, in fome feafons, ruus in that dire&amp;ion fromGlaf- 
gow to Ayr, three times a-week. The pariih roads, in feveral 
places, are not in good repair, owing to the deepnefs of the 
foil, or the fcarcity of proper materials. The ftatute labour 
is paid in money. All the roads are well fupplied with 
bridges, wherever they have been found neceflary. There 
are no turnpikes in the pariih. 

Ecclefiq/lical State. — The Earl of Eglintoun is Patron* 
The ftipend paid to the minifter, by ufe and wont, (for there 
13 no decreet for it,) is 79 bolls of meal, and 17 L la s. 6d. in 
money. The old glebe, upon which a part of the village now 
Hands, was exchanged in 1727, by a formal con trafi betweea 
the Earl of Eglintcvun, the preftrytery of Irvine, and the in- 
cumbent, for a fmall farm near the town of Beith, confiding, 
as is mentioned in the contrad, of 31 acres 3 roods. It would 
appear, that the preleat church was built foon after the refor- 
mation. There is a ftone in the wall, with the date 1593 
upon it J and there is a coat of arms, coarfely done, upon the 

front

front of a gallery, having the' date 1596, and marked with 
the initials of Robert Montgomery of Giffaa^ a younger foD 
of the Earl of Eglintoun, and his lady, who was of the family 
of Loudoun. The church is built in the form of a crofs. In 
1754, one of the afles was lengthened, fo a$ to admit of near« 
ly 200 additional fitters. This was done at the expence of 
the Kirk Seffion, with the advice and confent of the heritors, 
for the behoof of the poof *. 

Populatton.^-^A}}0\it the time of the revolution, or rather ear- 
tier, t^e Kiri'^towtt o/Beitb^ as it was then called, is laid to have 
confiiied only of 5 dwelling heufes, and the minifter*s manfe.' 
Accordingly, the 5 feued houfes are mentioned, as a diAinft 
article, in the cefs books. In the year 17 59, there were 
about 700 examinable perfons in the town, and upwards of 
800 in the country part of the parilh. The return to Dr^ 
Webfier, in 1755^ was 0064 fouls. The number of inhabi- 
tants in the country, has continued much the fame ever fince ; 
but ^he population of the town inereafed fo rapidly, that, in 
J788, it cenuined nearly 1500- examinable perfons. Since 
that period, ho^^'ever, it has rather decreafed. From a very 
accurate enumeration taken lately, with a view to be inferted 

in this paper, the population was found to be as follows :

* From a Latin infcription upon a grave-ftone in the chttrch-yard, it appears, 
that Mr. William M^iTLii^D was minifler here, from 1669 to x68x, when

indulgence. The old people fpeak of fonie curates who fncceeded him, but none

Climate^ tiiftafis^ l^r.— -There are icvetal perfons, both in 
the town and country, above 80 years of age, but none fo old 
as 90. The climate does not a]^pear to be very favourable to 
longevity. Owing to the elevated lituation of the cotintry, 
and its vicinity to the weftern ocean, we have frequent rains 
and ilorms ; and the air contains a greater degree of moifture, 
than in places removed' to a confiderable diftance from the^ 
Atlantic. There is frequently a good deal of licknefs in the 
 village. The difeafes moft common are fevers and confudip- 
tions : the croup * and fncall pox fomdtitkles prove very fatal im 
children. The people, in general, are averfe to inoculation. 
No remarkable inftance of longevity is known to have occurred 
amongft thofe who have refided in the parifli. A native, hawi

yanced age of 123 years. According to his own account, 
he was bom at the farm of Willieyards, but left the pariih 
when young, and inlifted in the army. He ferved as a pri^ 
yate foldier, at the taking of Gibraltar by the Britifh 14 
1704. His name is not to be found in our regifier ; but it is 
known, that there was a family of the name of Tait, at WiU 
^eyardS| more than a century agQ. and fbmc Qf their relations 
ftUl live ia the parifh^ 

Trade and ManufaSures.*^ About the time of the union 
of the two kingdoms, a trade in linen cloth was introdu- 
ced into this place, which became (b coniiderable, that the 
Beith markets were frequented by merchants from the neigh- 
bouring towns every week. Many houfes, foon after this, 
were built on the old glebe, upon tack rights granted by the 
ininiiler ^or half a merk Scotch, of rent per fall ; and, whea 
the Glebe was afterwards exchangedt the £arl of Eglintoua 
became bound to grant feu eights to the holders of thefe tack 
rights, upon equitable conditions, particularly fpecified. About 
the year 1730, the linen bufinefs, which had greatly declined, 
was fucceeded by a coniiderable trade in linen yam. The 
Beith merchants purchafed the yam made in the country 
around, and fold it to the Paifley and Giafgow manufafiurers. 
This trade, when carried to its greateft extent, about the 
year 1760, is fuppofed to have amounted to 16000 1. Sterling 
yearly j and though it has long been upon the decline, lineal 
yam is ftill a confiderable article of merchandife. The de- 
mand for this commodity encouraged the farmers to raife 
great quantities of flax. About 60 hhds. of flax feed were fold 
in this town annually. From 1777 to 1789, the manufadure 
ff filk gauze was carried on to a great extent in this place,

(fuppofed to be a corruption for St. Anthonys day^ and on 
feveral Fridays in the beginning of fpring. It iH obvioua 
from the above ftatementi that the population of the town of 
Beith increafed with its trade ; and that the prefent decreafe 
in the number of its inhabitants, is owing chiefly to the do* 
dine of the filk roanufadure, and to the eztenfive cotton 
works erefted in the neighbourhood, particularly in th^ pa^ 
tiih of Lochwinnoch, and at the town of Johnftone, in the pa«

Poor. — ^Thc funds for fupporting the poor are the weekly 
coUedions at the church door } the hire of the mortcloths ; 
the rent of the poor^s aile, the feats of which are let yearly by 
roup; the rent of a fmall farm, pnrehafed with ^ the poor's 
money in 1695, and a fmall proportion of the dues of procia*

and though the population of the town has begun to decline* 
Befides the diftributions» which thefe funds enable the Seflion 
to make to the poor, they fometimes receive a temporary ai^ 
liftance from occafional charities *• 

Cbaritahli Societies. — There are three charitable focieties 
inBeith; two of thofe commenced in 177a. One of thea 
has 22a 1. of fiock and the other 370 1. The third com- 
menced in 1784, and its funds amount to 300 1. The advan- 
tage of thrfe infiitutions has already been fenfibly felt* by 
thofe of the poor who are entitled to their charity. The 
funds of thefe focities, are depofited in the public banks for 
fccurity. In 178a and 1783, the funds of the two firft men- 
tioned focietiesy together with 40 1. furniihed by the Kirk 
Sefliony were employed under the dire&amp;ion of a Committee^ 
in purchafing grain and meal for the ufe of the inhabitants. 
The roe$iL was fold to the inhabitants in general, a^the market 
price ; but to the members of the focieties, and to the po^r 
^d. cheaper per peck, by proper perfons appointed to rhis 
office, who received a fmall allowance for their trouble. From 
the 28th of October 1782, to the 14th of September 16S?, 
above 1 000 bolls were fold in this manner. As the object 
was to fecure plenty, a premium of 6 d. per boll was given 
for 230 bolls of the above quantity, which had the defired ef« 
fed. 

Since charitable focieties are evidently of great utih'ty to 
the poor, it is a pity they flibuld labour under any difadvan« 
tages, tending to check the ardour of that benevo.eiice, to 
which they owe their exigence. They certainly defervc 
every encouragement from the friends of mankind^ and are

' even entitled to the countenance of government^ and the pro- 
tedion of law. It would doubtlefs ferve the caufe of humanity 
much, to confer upon them fuch privileges, as might enable 
them more fully to carry into effed the laudable purpotes of 
their inftitutton ; and to put them under proper regulations, 
fanftioned by an aQ of the legiflr.ture in their favour ; declar- 
ing amongft other things, that fuch afibciations are legal, and 
their rules, with regard to their own members, capable of 
being enforced by law :-— that they have a right to make fuch 
bye-laws as (hall not contradid any ftatute law of the realm, 
or the original rules of their allociatlon ; — that their articles of 
agreement muft be regiftercd in the Iheriff court books of the 
cpunty to which they belong ;— ^that they fhall lodge their 
cafli with fome banking company for fecurity : that they 
ihall be exempted from ftamp duties oh bills and receipts, in 
regard that- their funds belong to the poor : that it ihall be 
«s competent for them, as for individuals, to purchafe and dif- 
pofe of property in lands or houfes ; and that their capital ihall 
not be allowed to accumulate abpve a certain fum, or beyond 
a certain number of years. Such privileges and regulations 
as thefe, confirmed by legal authority, it is apprehended, 
would encourage the formation of fuch focieties, and thereby 
great relief would be afforded to thedeferving poor ; — any de.* 
ficiency of the ordinary charitable funds would be made up, 
and the neceifity of poor's rates prevented ; which muft al« 
ways be an objed of importance to the nation ; and with fuch 
views thefe remarks are fubmittied to the confideration of tha 
public. 

Vagrant Poor.^The great number of flranger poor, who 
wander through the country, has long been complained of, 
not only as a burthen, but as a nuifanfce ; and to encourage 
-them, is to encourage idlenefs, theft, and debauchery. In 178^^ 
a vigOFous attempt was made to prevent them from begging

in this pariOi. The parlfaioiiers, ia general, fabrcribed 9 
papcTi binding tbemfelves neither to lodge vagrant beggars^ 
nor give them alms. Several of the inhabitants were ap9 
pointed to aft as conftables, in apprehending and carryiog 
them out of the parilb ; any expences neceiTary for this pur-* 
pofe wert to be paid by the heritors. At the fame time, the 
poor of this place were furniihed with certificates, whiph au-i 
thorifed them to b^g within the pariih* The good confe- 
rences of thcfe meafares were, for feme time, remarkable. 
Such regolatioos^ perhaps, might not be fo fuitable for large 
towns ; but, were they generally adopted in coantry pariihes, 
they would, in all probability, have the moft falutary effc&amp;s^ 
Vagrants would be effedually excluded ; the charity of every 
parifli would be bellowed upon its own poor, and there would 
)e lefs occafion for ftents and fuch legal methods of raffing 
fupplies for the poor, as are always burthenibme to the public, 
and frequently prove the occafion. of cruelty and. additional 
diftrefs, to thofe objeds of fyinpathy they are intended to re- 
lieve.

Uught: Latin, Greek, French, £ngliih. Writing, Arithme-* 
tic. Book-keeping, and the praAical branches of the Mathe*

4 months in the year. There are aUb two private fchools in 
the town which are well attended.

Dt^/tfrx.^-There are two difienting meetings in the towfi 
of Bftith : One of them, which is attended bj that clafs of Sece« 
ders, called Antiburghers^ commenced above 30 years ago^ 
The firft minifter ordained to this charge foon after renounced 
his connexion with that fociety, and embraced the communion 
of the £(labli(hed Church. He publiflied at Edinburgh in 
^764,, the teafons which induced him to this meafure, under 
the title of Ji/anwel Addrefs to the AJfociate Congregation of 
Biitb^ by John Laidly^ A. M. It muft be mentioned to the 
honour of thia congregation, that they co*operate, as far as 
their weekly colledions can allow them, with the Eftabliihed 
Chnrch, in fupporting the poor of the parifh. They contri- 
.bute foj: this purpofe at the rate of about 7 1, annually, which 
is diftribuled jointly with the pariih funds formerly mention- 
jed ;— -an example worthy to be imitated; by all diflenters. 
The other diflenting meeting is connefted with the fociety, 
.who are called Relief. It commenced about 9 years ago. 

Antiquities. — Before the reformation, there were 2 chapels 
for public worfhip in this parifh ; one where the prefent 
church now ftands, (whereof a fmall fragment of the wall is 
Aill to be feen,) and the other upon the lands of Treehom, 
one end of which remains entire. This chapel, with two 
acres of land adjoining to it, belonged to thp monaftery of 
Kilwinning, as appears from a charter under the great feal, 
in the pofiefiion of Che proprietor, dated in the year 1594 *• 

There were formerly feveral caftles, or fquare towers in 
the pariQi. All of them have been razed to the foundation 
but one, which forms at prefent a ftately ruin. It was an« 
tiently the feat of the Montgomeries of Giffan.

. Lake and Ftjb — Kiibirnie Locb^ which lies at the weft ciiH of 
this parifli, is fomething more than a mile long, and about 
half a mile broad. It contains trouts, pikes, perches, &amp;c. 
and is frequented in hard ^inters bj many aquatic birds, fuch 
as ducks, geefe, fwans, &amp;c. 

Fuel^ Minerals^ li?^.-— Both peats and coals are ufed for fuel, 
•but chiefly the latter. Peats are always ufed in drying com* 
and for the purpofes of the dairy. The extent of oiols is 
very inconfiderable. Goals are found in many parts of the 
pariih, but have never been wrought with great fuccefs. We 
are plentifully fupplied with that ufeful commodity, from the 
neighbouring pariihes of Dairy, Lochwinnoch, and Kiibirnie : 
and this appears to be the principal ceafon, why proper efforts 
have not .been made, to turn our own coal to greater advao- 
tage. We have abundance of whin ftone, and free ftone is 
found very frequently, but of an inferior quality. There is, 
however, a remarkable fpecies of free (lone near the weft end 
/of this pariih It lies in horizontal lamina^ or flakes, to a 
jconiiderable depth, and thefe are from a to 6 inches thick, and 
from 3 to 4 or 5 feet fquHre, It does not receive the fame 
poliftt as other fretftone, but is of a very firm. contexture, and 
greatly valued on account of its flrength It is ufed chiefly 
ior pavements, and for bridges over fmall rivulets. It bears 
the weight of the heavieft carriages. The limcftone in this 
pari(h is inexhauftiUe : befides the gKat quantities annually 
Jburnt by the farmers upon their own lands, for manure, there 
are 2 public lime-works, which have a regular and extenfivc 
fale. Several beds of ftone marie have been lately dil'covcr^ 
ed, and many rich veins of iron ftone. 

PetrifaBions. — There are various fpecimens of figured 
ilones^ and upon fomc of them, the iropr^nions are exceeding-

ly beautiful. The Hme done abounds with petrifaftions of 
ihellS) entrocbi and other marine produaions ; the exuvia of 
the ancient ocean. In the lands of Robert Montgomery Efq, 
of Bogilown, fome years ago, filicious petrifactions were diP- 
covered, fimilar to thofe found in calcareous fubftances ; the 
fhells poffefling the fpecific qualities of the flint in which thej 
were incorporated. Thefe curious and uncommon produc 
tions of nature were probably the firft of the kind difcovered 
in this part of the world ; at lead they were the firft that 
Ibme of the ableft chemifts in this country had feen. Silici- 
ous petrifactions have been iince found both in England and 
Scotland, but very rarely. 

PropSfed Improvements ^^^Th^ cultivation of trees is much 
negleded in this country. Excepting the policies^ or pleafure 
grounds, around a few country feats, there is very little grow- 
ing wood in this neighbourhood, though there are few places 
where it is more neceffary. Were proprietors to plant a , 
fmall proportion of their land, it would certainly prove of 
great advantage to the foil, as well as afford a flielter for 
cattle, in fo expofed.a fituation. 

Were a navigable canal carried acrofs the country, from 
the Clyde below Paifley, to the fea at Irvine or Saltcoats, it 
would be of effential fervice to this part of the kingdom, and 
to the public in general. The diitanoe is upwards of 20 
miles. Nature feems to poin^t out the line of communica- 
tion, through a narrow ilrath, running in that direction moil 
of the way. In the middle of this; it rath ftands the loch of 
Kilbirnie, about an equal diftance from each end of the pro- 
pofed canal, and it occupies alfo nearly the higheit ground be^ 
tween them. A ftream runs from the north end of this loch in- 
to the Clyde below Faifley, and the water of Garnock, running 

itt

in an oppofite diredion, pafles by the other end of it, an ^ 
empties itfelf into the iea at Irvine. The fall, from the north 
end of Kilbirnie Loch to Clyde, is calculated to be abotit 95 
feet, and the declivity towards the fea can not be much 
more. Were this plan pot in esecutjon, befides fenring- 
many other commercial purpofes, it would lay open immenfe 
treafures of coal, lime and iron flone. But (hould this be 
thought too ezpenfive an undertaking, a canal of only half the 
propofed length, joining Kilbirnie loch, either to the Clyde or 
to the fea, would 11 ill be an objeft of great importance* Co$t' 
Jidering thiprtjtnt high price and/carcity of COALS^ any propo* 
Jal tending to enable proprietors 0/ coals ^ at a diftancejrom pot* 
pulous cities^ to carry them with advantage to marht at home 
or abroad^ deferves their regard. And any improvements fug- 
gefted with a view to fecure plenty, or to lefien the price of a 
commodity fo nfeful and neceiTary, has a claim to the pub^ 
lie attention. 

Whatever reafon. there might be, to impofe a fervitude upon 
llie farmeis in former times, for encouraging the erefiiion of 
corn milU, thirlage is at prefent juftly confidered, not only in 
many in (dances to be inconvenient, but in general burthen* 
fome. The multure and other perquifites paid to the miller, 
and his fervants, amount in fome places to the -iV or fVy or even 
-^ of the produce. This is a heavy tax upon agriculture, and 
it lays the tenant under temptation to carry part of his grain 
elfewhere, to the prejudice of the miller, as often as he can 
avoid detection. It would be of advantage, therefore, both 
to the holders of land, and the proprietors of mills, in this 
and other pariihes, were the latter obliged to fell, and the for« 
nier to buy up this fervitude at a moderate value. i

pariih, and probably about the fame proportion ^f oats, bar- 
lej, peafe. Sec. ; but it is divided into fuch linaU parts, that it 
was impoffible to ftate them accurately. There are fix farms 
in the fouthem part, vit« one of 169 acres ; one of 65 ; one 
of 45 ; one of 47 ; one of 39; and one of 33 acres, all arable : 
and the reft of the eftate of Kirkbuddo is divided into no 
lels than 25 fmall farms. The number of cattle and horfes 
are in proportion to the grafs, and the lands in cultivation. 
There are not above 3 or 4 faddle horfes, and fcarcely any. 
flieep or hogs. 

Rent and Proprietors. — ^The average price of land, lately let 
In the northern part, is about X5 s. and in the fouthem part, 
10 s the acre. The valued rent of the pariih is 1500 U Scotch, 
and the real rent above 1000 1. Sterling. The pariih is di*

The fchool fees are the fame as thofe of Kirkden. The fcho« 
lars are numerous, but the fouthem part of the parifli can 
reap no advantage from the fchool. The weekly cpUedions, 
and the intereft of a fmall fum of money, are found fufficient 
for the maintenance of the poor, of which there are at prefent 
only two fupported by the public funds, and two or three who 
receive fmall fums occafionally*

into one cure, in the year i6i8. B7 a committee of 
parliament, met at Inveraraj, in the year 1650, thefe pariihes 
were disjoined, on account of their great extent, and continu- 
ed feparate till the reftoration ; when, by the memorable J2^* 
/ciffbry A8i they were again united, and have continued lince 
under the paftoral charge of the fame incumbent. 

The parifli of Glenorchay derives its name, from the vale 
where the church is built. It was formery called CLuhan Dyfart^ 
a Celtic word, fignifying, ^* The Temple of the Highefi." The 
place, where the pariib church (lands, was probably the fite of 
the Clachan^ or ** Circle of ftones," of the Druids. Dyfart 
properly means 7%« Highefi God. The founders of a church,

Pagan inhabitants to attend the inftitutions of revealed religion, 
were naturallj led to make choice of a fituation, the more re- 
vered by them^ as being the place where thej had foriDcrlj

refque ifland in Lochow, onee the fite of a fmall nunnery of 
the Ciftertian order"; and where, in a ruinous chapel of that 
religious houfe, public worlhip was alternately performed, till 
the year 1736. A church, more commodious for the parifli, 
was then built on the fouth fide of the lake, oppoiite to Inif- 
hail. 

Extent and Situation. — The length of the united parifhes, 
from £. to W» is above 24 meafured miles. The breadth is va- 
rious and unequal. They are fituated on the borders of the county 
of Perth, near the village of Clifton, and inn of Tayndrom, 
one of the higheft inhabited fituations in North Britain. Here, 
a fmall rivulet marks the divifion of (he counties of Argyll 
and Perth ; part of which runs eaftward into Loch Tay, and 
falls into the German fea ; and part runs weftward into Loch« 
ow, and difcharges itfelf, at Bunaw^ into an Arm of the At- 
lantic ocean. The church of Glenorchay is 15 miles N.E. 
from Inveraray, the chief town of the fhire, and the feat of the 
courts of juftice ; and is nearly at an equal diflance S. E. from 
Bunaw *.

'Which forms a beautiful plain of more than 3 miles in length, 
and half a mile in breadth^ the plains of Auch, of Auchal* 
lader, and part of the lands of Hajfield, the country exclu- 
fively is mountainous and hillj. The river Urchay winds 
in a gentle current through the vale, dividing it into two 
-equal parts. On each fide of the river, the foil is a mixture 
of light earth and fand ; and on the fides of Lochow, as fac 
as the parifli extends, it is. generally a deeper earth and richer 
loam, on beds of till or gravel. The glebe, on which the 
church and manfe are built, is a beautiful oUoag ifle, formed 
by the river Urchay. It is in the centre of the valley and 
above a mile in circumference, and every where bordered 
with natural terraces and ibelving banks i and fringed with 
coppice and various kinds of tree«a to the very edge of the 
xivcr. 

Produce and Culiivation^'^The :rops produced, on thefe 
lands, are the blainfley,^ the early white, and the fmall grey 
«oats ; Scotch bear, potatoes, a few field turnips, fome artificial, 
and much natural, as well as meadow grafles. This ordinary 
return from oats is from 3 -to 4 feeds; of barley, from j to 7, 
and from the boll of potatoes, from 12 to ao. The annual 
change of the difierent feeds is found to be of great advaUi- 
tage, as the fame feed, fown fuccefiively for years, in the fame 
foil, becomes gradually fmall and unprodudive. It is cuf- 
tomary, yearly, to import quantities of feed oats from the high 
grounds near the Kirk of Shotts, and from feveral parts of 
Perthfhire. Culinary plants are coming more and more in« 
to general ufe in this country ; Some years ago it required the 
i|)fluence of the landlord ; and in fome places, an exprefs fti» . 
pulation in the leafe, before the common people could be got 
40 plant greens, or fence a garden.

Potatoes,^^^o where arc potatoes cultivated with more carj 
or thrive better. Thej are mofilj planted in drills, and hoel 
by the plough • The largeft are always feleftcd for feed. 
Thq kinds chieflj ufed, are thofe called here, the London Lady. 
a prolific and fweet potatoe ; the long white^ the dun^ the 
VJifit the early red^ and the purple* From all of them, a 
ftarch is commonly manafadared by a fimple proccfs, for fa- 
mily ufe. Some diftill a fiery and harih fpirit from potatoes ; 
and at times, bread jelly ^ and a very bad cheefe^ are formed of 
this valuable root, when combined with other fubftances of 
nutrition. For nine months ^of the year, potatoes make a 
great part of the food of the middling and lower ranks of peo* 
. pie ; and it maybe faid, with truth, that, till the general intro- 
du£Hon of potatoes into this country, fo little adapted, from foil 
and clinuite, to the growth of other grain, the poor dnd low- 
er clafles pinfcd away, nearly the half of their lime, in want 
and hunger. It is now found, that, by keeping the potatoes 
in a cool place during the fummer months, and checking die 
vegetation by frequent turning and ftirring, they may be jpre- 
ferved fweet and found, from one end of the year to the other ; 
and thus, become a wholcfome and cheap diet to the poor, 
and even, occalipnally, add to the viands of the opulent im 
every ficafon. 

Sheep and Black Cattle — ^The hills and muirs, which, fome 
years ago, were covered with heath and coarfe herbage, are, 
fince the introdudion of large flocks of fheep into the coun-i 
try, gradually getting a richer fward and a greener hue, and 
afford excellent paAure. Every where they abound, with 
fprings and rivulets of pure and fi^ubrious water. Nume- 
rous flocks of large and heavy flieep, now pafture almoft the 
whple year, on th^fe mountains and wilds, where, formerly, 

were

light iheep and goats, fmall hill horfes, as thej were called^ 
and fome hetds of black cattle* Then, it was believed, 
that no domeftic animal could ftand the fevef ities of the win- 
ter on the high and ilormj grounds : even the goats and 
flieep were regularlj houfed and fed in pens, during the 
rigour of the feafon. The confequence was often fatal. 
^¥heIl the provender was confumed before the genial return 
of %ring, cattle of all kinds perilhed in numbers for want of 
fuftenance *. There may be about 20,oco flieep in the pa- 
rifli* A few of the Cheviot breed have been latelj intro- 
duced into Glenorchaj ; and the Earl of Breadalbane, . ever 
anxious to promote the intereft of his country, and the good 
of the people, defigns, it is faid, to fend fome more of the 
i^me kind, to the pariih, for trial. Black cattle have been; 
for years paft, decreafing in number, but improving in ki^d* 
Two bulls, reared in the parlfli, were lately fold, the one at 
X9L the other at 20 L !?terling. Horfes, both for draught 
i^nd faddle, are brought, occaiionally, at high prices, from th^ 
fouth of Scotland, and other places noted for the beft kinds of 
Hoth. 

Wood. — The higher parts of the parifli abounded once, 
with forefts of the largeft and beft pines ; but thefe were cut 
down, about 60 years ago, by a company of adventurers frofki 
Ireland, with little benefit to themlelves, and lefs to the noble 
proprietor of the country. There are ftill fome tradls of na« 
tural firs in Glenorchay : a good deal of oak, intermixed 
with aih| birch, and aller. On the fides of Lochow, efpecially

at Hajfieldy various kinds of wood ; the larchi tbe kectt}/ 
the horfe chefnut, the mountain afli, the lime and the plane^ 
are planted with tafle, and grow with luxuriance and heauty. 
The climate is not favourable for orchards. 

Exports and Imparts. — The exports from the country are 
cattle* wool, woollen yarn, tartans, plaiding and ruflet. The 
imports are, about icoo bolls of meal, merchant goods and 
caih. Exclufive of what is retailed by hawkers, there is 
fold, yearly, from one ftationary (hop in the pariih, to the value 
of 60 1. Sterling, of fnuflf and tobacco. This is an expendi- 
ture that merits reprehenfion. Let the men, however, conti- 
nue to do in this as they choofe, but far be it from the fair 
and refpedable females of this vale, to disfigure their features, 
and to deftroj their powers of fong and fwret cadence, by a 
habit fo repugnant to every thing engaging and cleanly in wo« 
man. There is one licenfed diftillery in the parifh ; the effeft 
of which is the deftrudion of great quantities of grain, 
that, in place of being converted into wholefome bread, pro- 
duces only a deleterious fpirit, ruinous to health, to induttry, 
and to morals. If no fpirits were diftilled in the county, the* 
meal imported would be a trifle. At an average, there is aft- 
annual importation of 40 thoufand bolls into the Ihire* 

Population and Longevity. — As no exsiA public regifters- 
were kept, the ancient ftate of the population of the parifh 
cannot be afcertained with preci&amp;on } hut, it is the general 
belief, that the population is not mat&amp;iiaily different from 
what it was about 40 years ago. Ttiis conjedure is confirm- 
ed by the only inveiligation of the fa£t, that can now be made. 
At prelent, (1792,'^ the total number is 161)9. The return 
to Dr. Webfter in 1755 was 1654, the difference is therefore 
only 15. Gf thefc there are of males, 78 j, of females, 886.

ta this account, the inhabitants of Lorn, Furnace and Fanan» 
are not included. Though the people, in general, attain' 
to an advanced age, there are no late inftances of extra- 
ordinary longevity in the pari(h. A circuoiflanee happen- 
ed a few years ago, ^hich^ it is believed, occurs but feldoni 
any where. At a baptifm in the parifli, there were prefent, 
the child^ajatber and mother^ grandfather and grandmofber^ 
great-grandfather and great ^grandmother ; and the laft pair 
are ftill fo vigorous and healthy, as to make it probable^ 
they may fee the fifth generation of their family. They are 
all in the lower clafs of peafantry, contented with their lot^ 
and chearful in their temper. 

Si/ea/es^^^ColdB and" rheumatic diforders are the moil pre- 
valent difeafes in the pariih* Before inoculation was intro- 
duced, the fmall pox, in iis vifitations, proved very fatal* 
Then, the regimen was literally hot. At whatever feafon- 
the infedion appeared, great fires were kept burning in the 
rooms, or rather ftoves, where often a or 3 wretched ohildren' 
lay gafping, under a weight of deaths, in one bed. Everj 
particle of fre&amp; air was exclttded with the utmoft care ; and 
whilky and faffron, and every thing heating, were adminifter- 
ed with an unfparing hand. The^ confequence was fuch as 
might be expeSed. Numbers were hurried into an untimely 
grave ; and of thofe that efcaped with life, the lofs of an eye, 
fbmetitnes of both, with other ravages of the diforder, often 
marked a treatment &amp; lumatnial and fo deftruftive. Eigh- 
teen years^ ago, a heft boy^ a native of this parifli, ran away 
from a farm in another country, where the meaflco made their 
appearance. He did not,  however, efcape the enemy he 
dreaded. He came to the patifh fchool, and within the fifth

gauge of the people within view of its loftjr fummit. Before 
the ftorm, '* the fpirit of the mountain ihrieks,'* and its head

wolf had his haunts in our wilds and mountains, and not on- 
ly proved fatal to the cattle, but, when impelled by hunger^ 
or inflamed with rage, he even, at times, made depredations 
on the human fpecies. It is faid, that, in the year 1680, the 
laft wolf in Britain was killed by Sir £wen Cameron of

After a winding courfe of 14 miles, the river Urchay falls io« 
to LochoWy at the eaft end, about a mile below the parilh 
jchurch. The lake and river abound with falmon, char, trout 
«nd eels. The laft is the abhorence of almoft all the coio- 
mon people in the highlands, who confider them as water fer- 
pents, and unfit for the ufe of man. Four miles below the 
-church, at a place called Catni(h, ihoals of falmon are takea 
in the Urchay, by a fimple fai^t fatal device. A bold proje£t» 
Ing rock croiTes the bed of the river, nearly from fide to fide* 
Its height is fuch, that few fi(h can overleap the torrent ^ 
which, after rains, raflies forcibly into the pool below. Many 
lalmon, in attempting to leap, fall into a ertel^ or baiket, fixed 
tranbverfely within the ftream. But ^the great ^ughtet is 
«ffe£ted in a more fraudulent manner. On the one fide kJL 
the river there is an open, of the widenefs of a mill-race, bc« 
twixt the rock and the bank. Here a wicker gate is fixed* 
that can be opened and (hut at pleafure. Many yards above 
this entry, the dream is fecured by a like barrier. When 
the water is high and turbid, the fiih are let in below, and 
when the fiiherman is fatisfied with the numbers that have 
pafled into his toils, he ihuts the door pf bis prifon ; and, 
like a mercilefs executioner, he drags his prey with his fpear^ 
one after another on ibore. Scores, at times, are thus de* 
ilroyed in the courfe of a few hours. There are ieveral other 
lakes and rivers, of leiTer note, in the pariih : all of theqiL 
abounding with fine trout.

of Rhodes, and anceftor of the Breadalbane family. Succefiive 
additions were made to Cattle Kilchum, and part of it was 
garrifoncd by the king's forces, in the year 1745, to fecure the 
peace and tranquillity of the country. But now, this great 
mafs of building is tumbling to the ground ; prefenting a 
monument of the mutability of earthly grandeur, and of the 
unavoidable decay of the moft durable works of human art. 

On a fmall ifland, not far from Cattle Kilchurn» called

pafled through his houfe, in the very place where he and his children were a 
moment before. He miffed a child, and no ioliger heard the voice of his wife. 
He looked to the ruins of his hut ; found his child alire and unhurt, in a comer 
where it had been thruft by the fragments of the bed and furniture, difpiaced 
by the rock in its coorfe. In a little, the mother came to the fcene. Their joy

a beautiful Celtic tale, after the manner of Offian the fon of

There is another old ruinous cafile at Auchallader, in the up-

to refirain the incurfiotis of fuch marauders^ as might attempt^

Near it, on the flope of a hill, a fatal conflift took place,

r MufBrals and Indigenous Plants^ — ^On the confines of the parilh 
u lead mine had been wrought for manj jears, by means of a 
level. The 6th of the produft, in bars of lead,, from the 
fmelting mill, was the proportion allowed to the proprietor 
bj the mining companj. It has not been wrought for two 
years back. In feveral hills of this pariih, there are appear* 
ances of lead ore. Cobalt, talc, albeftos, and a beautiful jas- 
per, have been founfl in fmall mafles, among our rocks and 
mountains. By an aft of the Scoth parliament, in the year 
14 24, the mine was declared royal| and to belong to Che 
king, when 3 halfpennies of filver could be fined from the 
pound of lead. Liipeflone of good, quality, is quarried ia va- 
rious parts of the pari(h. Many indigenous herbs, which, 
cofnbined with whifky, formed of old, a great part of the 
Highlander's materia medico^ are now gone much into difufe ; 
Valerian, Tufiilago, Althea, AlUheal, Liver^wort, Plantaiiiy 
Eye-bright, and wild carrot arc found in abundance* 

Well of St. Co/v»ffi!i»— There are no mineral fprings in the 
parilh. A quarter of a mile eaftward from the inn of Dalmaly, 
and near the parifh fchool, is the well of St. Gonnan; memo- 
rable for the ^ightnefs and falubrity of its water. St. Connaa 
was the tutelar faint of the country. He lived, it is iaid^ 
near the well, and he blcfied the fpring. On a little eminence 
hard by, in a humble cot, there dwelt, about 20 years ago, a 
poor old man, principally fupported by the well of St. Connan« 
The whole day he fat, generally at the door of his cot, ready 
to give the paiTengers a drink from his favourite fpring, foe 
which he received feme fmall confideration. It is incredible 
what quantities he himfelf daily drank, for the fpace of 44 
years, that he lived near the well. He never had a complaint : 
he arrived at the age of 85 or 86 years, in the exerclfe of

death. He retiiad to his cell, and in the mondng was found

have found a new occupant, for the whole infide of this foliur/

from thechurch-jard, year after year, as repairs were needed* 

C&amp;yrri.^— The church of Glenorchay, outwardly, appears a 
decent buildbg. Within,* though far from elegant, it is nei- 
ther uncomfortable nor incommodious. Its fituation is com- 
manding, and centrical for the pedple. It is to be regretted, 
Ifaat places approfHriated to the public worlhip of God, ihoold 
not be rendered fuitaUe to a fervice fo facred and fo impor- 
tant. The magnificent temples of the heathen world indicat- 
ed a becoming reverence for the objeds of their worihip. 
The church of Rome, the church of England, and the fevesi 
feparatifts from our own eftabliihment, are careful to have 
foch places, as are confecrated to the fervice of the Uoiverfal 
Parent, made decent and comfortable : whilft, with us of thei

very different from that of^their p^edec^fTyrs. Formerly, in-

tfamif Situatton and ExUnU 

THE etymology of Criech is not perfeftly known; it 
may flgnify the houndiHg parilh, as it is the boundary 
betwixt Sutherland and Rofs for a great way. It may alfo 
fignify the parijb of woods or tri^s» There is ftill a great 
deal of wood in it ; but there . was formerly much more ; 
and fome of the woodsi being feen from the low country^ 
may have given the Aame to the parifli^— -ThiSy however, is 
but conjefture. 

The parilh is of Very great extent. It is, perhaps, one of 
the largeft in Stotland, running from £. to W. or N. W* 
from within 4 computed miles of the burgh of Dornoch on 
the £., to a few miles of the church of AfTint, the pariih on 
the' W. coaft. The length of it from E. to W.- inhabited, is 
reckoned 34 computed miles 3 but the utmoft bounds of the 

' parifli 



ofCriicb. 363 

parifli ftretch far Into the hills and moors, IjiDg between Criech 
and the parilh of Eddirachjlis, and maj be reckoned upwards 
of 40 meafured miles. The breadth of the parifli is yery on- 
equal. In fome places it is but 2 miles broad : in fome 5^ 
and in the top of the parifliy it may be from 5 to xo miles 
broad, and upwards. The parifh of Criech lies on the N. 
of the Kyle or Frith of Tain, and the river Ockel. The 
Itjle flows about iz miles above the church of Criech ; The' 
river Ockel, difcharging itfelf into the Kjle, feparates it from 
the parifli of Kincardioe for 10 miles. The parifli of Criech 
lies oppofite to the parilh'of Kincardine, but ftretches about 
fix miles farther eafiward, oppofite to the parifh of £dder« 
town, feparated from thefe pariflies bj the Kjle and the river 
Ockel. Its length xxx^j be feen to be verj great, from exa* 
mining any common map of Scotland. 

Soil, — ^The foil of the parifli is light and thjn, except in the 
E. end of it, where there is deep loan); and fome meadows 01^ 
the Kyle, and the (ides of rivers in the top of it« The arable land 
moftlylies on the Kyle fide, on a hard gravel. In many places 
the gravel, when dug and mixed with dung, proyes excellent 
manure. As the foil' is thin, and lies cxpofed to the fouth, 
the hfirveft is in general very early, much more fo, than in 
the low country, or in places farther to the fouth. There are 
hills and moors back from the Kyle, where the tenant's cattle 
are paftur^d in fummer. The hills, for the moft part, are 
covere4 wit^ h^^th, with mapy interjacent fpots of green 
grafs, efpecially n^ar fmall rivulets. The face of the parifli 
is hilly.' Perhaps, not a thirtieth part 9f the parifli is cv^tu 
vatcd. 

CUmate and Dijlempers. — The cli^iate is very variou;. In 
th^ eaft end of the parifli, it is as temperate as on the coaft of 
^^therland* While the weather is dry and good in the eait

The clinnatei in general, is healthy, yet there b%ve not been 
many examples of longevity ^r the laft %o years, thongli 
mai^y live till they are paft 70, and fome till 80 : there is one 
living at prefent 80, and another 84* Epidemical fever» 
fometimes occur, and prove mortal, according to the feaibii 
of the year in which they take place. When feyers happen| 
they commonly fpread, occafiooed, perhaps, from the cnftom 
that prevails, of the neighboura commg to vifit the fick per* 
fons, and ftaying lo^g with them. If a perfon is fick^ and therg 
i^ appearance of danger, it is ufual to fee the fmall apartment 
crou4ed with neighbours and friends, many of v^hom muft 
catch the infedion. The rheumatifm is become much morq 
common of late than formerly. iSeveral have been cut o^ 
by the confumption, and there aVe feveral perfons now la* 
bouring under the cancer. 7be fmall pox and meafles have 
fometimes proved very futal. Inoculation for the fmall-pox 
has fcarce been pra&amp;ifed in this parifli. A few have been 
inoculated this very fpxiog for the fmallrpoo^, which have 
proired of the mcft favourable kind. It is diBScpU to iay, to 
whaX the frequency of the rheumatifm is. to be afcri^ed. The 
people now are as well lodged, clothed and fed, as their fore- 
fathers. No difference in their diet has taken place for a

Jiifitf CuUvDatum and Proprietors. — The valued rent of the 
pari(h is 1983 1. Scotch* The real rent may be upwards of 
900 1. Sterlbg. The rent of the feveral. falmon fiihings, oa 
the rivers and frith^ maj amount to 1401. Sterling. Much 
of the arable land is dear. In fome parts of the parifh, the ' 
fowing of a boll of bear, (fomething more than a Scotch 
acre,) pays il. Sterling. In manj places the ground is fit 
onljfor fmall black oats, of which three crops are taken on fuch 
land, and then it is allowed to reft for 3» 4» or 5 years, 
after which it is cropped again. Very few experiments have 
been made, to afcertain how lime would anfwer with fuch 
ground. There are 8 proprietors in the parifh, of whom on- 
ly I refides conftantly. One gentleman pays of rent 1^0 1. 
Sterling. One Iheep farm is rented at 130 1.; but the msb- 
jority of farms are poflefled by fmall tenants* 

Crops and Producf .-^-^Thc chief crops are barley, white 
oats, fmall black oats, potatoes, and a very fmall quantity o'f 
peafi^ The oats are commonly fown in the laft week of 
March, and beginning of April } io the few large farms, the 
oats are fown fooner, if the weather permits. They ufually 
fow bear in the beginning of May. The people here are 
come into the practice of cultivating potatoes to a ropfider- 
able amount, and find their account in it ; they raife as ma. 
ny potatoes, as, at an average, may be fufiicient to fupply the 
place of bread for four or five months in the year. Some have 
them until June, and they commonly begin to ufe them the 
iaft week of Augud, and fometimes fooner. They have proved 
of the greateft benefit to this difirid. Even when viAual is 
very fcarce, and there is a great demand for bread, as foon 
as the potatoes are fit fer food, the demand fiops inftantly. 
The parifli produces, in tolerably good years, rather more vic- 
tual than would be fufficient for fupply ing itfelf.-— There are.

fruit trees only in three or foar gardens, which produce plen«

Ecclefiafiical Statf.~^ThtTe is not one perfon in this pariih, 
who does not belong to the eftabliihed church. There was a 
mlflionarj minifter fettled for upwards of 25 y«ars» in the 
heights of the parilhes of Criech and Kincardine, who 
preached every third Sabbath in the high grounds of Creech, 
He had a falary of ajl. Sterling, from his majeQy's royal boun« 
ty, and of 7I. Sterling from the pariihes. Fifteen computed 
miles of the pariib of Criech were under diis miiEon ; but 
it was difcontinued, and the falary removed, at Whitfunday 
1789, by the Committee for managing the royal bountyi on 
account (as was faid,) of the deficiency of the Society*! 
funds i although the Commitee had no other miHIonary in the 
bounds of tlie preibyteries of Dornoch or Tain, and although 
the extent of thefe two pariihes, contiguous to each other in two 
different preibyteries, the number of the inhabitants, and 
their eager defire for the means of inftruftion, and for living 
the ordinances of the gofpel adminiftered among them, (on 
which they pun&amp;ually attend,) pled loudly for the continu«» 
ance of the miflion* This would have been a great hardfhip 
on the people, as well as on the minifters of their pariihes, 
bad not the knowledge of the cafe excited the compaiTion and 
fy mpathy of Lady Rofs Baillie ; who, out of her own liberality, 
has appointed a permanent miilion in this extenfive diilrift, 
with a better falaty than was afforded by the Committee ; to* 
gether with large accommodations, that will render the ftation 
fufficiently comfortable. 

The ilipend of the eilabliihed minifter is 71 bolls of viflual, 
one half oatmeal and the other half bear ; 25 1. Sterling in 
money, and iL 138. 4d. Sterling for grafs. The decreet was 
ebtaiped fpr theftjpend in 1708. The parilh can bear a great 

augmentation^

ftiigmentatiofl, which is much needed, and it is Hoped will be 
granted ; living being now more than doubled, even in this 
comer, fince the time this flipend was fixed. A new manfo 
was built in 1780; and the church was built lad Summer 
and is now finiihed. 

Paor.—- There are no funds for the poor, but the coUefliioni 
made at dioxcb, which are fmall and pitiful indeed, amounting 
only to 4l« or 5L Sterling a year, and a very little for dues 
of the mort-cloth* The number of the poor on the roll, in 
the eaft divifion of the pariib, is 37, and in the weft ^3 \ in 
all 50* They can fcarce get more than what is necefikry to 
buy flioes to them : Very few, however, of this number go 
about begging* Moft of them earn in harveft and otherwife, 
as much as is neceiTary to fupport them ; they commonly get, 
from fome friend ot neighbour, a little land fpr potatoes, 
which is of great fervice to them. If a perfon is quite poor, 
and unable to work at all, or difeafed, the neighboprs fend in 
what is nearly fu£Bcient; or fome fHend goes about among tho 
tenants, and gets fupplies for fuch an objed. On very ez« 
traordinary emergencies, a coUeftion is raifed in the church. 

Scarciiy in 1 783-4. — This pari(fa,like others in the neigh* 
bourhood, was in great diftrefs in Summer 1783 and 1784, 
efpecially in 1783. None however died for want. On feveral 
eftates, the heritors procured vidual to their tenants' from 
time to time ; the vidua], fent by government, was diftribut« 
ed among moft of the families of the parifli. The poor were 
fingularly indebted to a gentleman in Glafgow, of uncommon 
benevolence, who bad lived in the parifli when a boy, and 
who fent money, and five bolls of white peafe, which were 
difiributed among upwards of 80 parfons, in proportion to 
their neceffity. Some few removed with their families to the

fhores abounding with cockles, &amp;c. which were uocommonljr 
plentiful that feafoni and fupported them for fome time. Bj 
thefe means the lives of the people were providentiallj pre- 
ferved. 

Ferries and Roads. — ^Tbere are no bridges in this parilh; 
but there are 4 or 5 ferries between it and that of Kincardine, 
which are crofied bj cobbles^ or jawls, and boats, that can fer- 
ry over two horfes each, or more. The people in: this pariik 
and neighbourhood, have been amufed from time to time 
with the hopes, that a bridge was to be built over the Kyle, 
at C'ulrain, about four miles above the church of Criech, at 
the expence of government. It would be of great advantage 
to the inhabitants of this diftrift in particular, befides the 
emolument that would accrue to the community at large, if 
the public road around the ferries were brought this way by 
a bridge. Such a bridge would be particularly convenient for 
drovers ; alt the cattle driven to the fouth from Sutherland, 
€aithnefs, and Lord Reay's country, except the parifli of 
Aifint, having hitherto been obliged to cxob the Kyle by 
fwimming ; which, when the weather is bad, and the Kyle 
much fwelled by rains, hurts the cattle greatly, efpecially 
when the night following proves cold. Sometimes they 
refufe to fwim, in which cafe they muft be ferried over 
by the cobble. The people pretend to foretell, whether they 
ihall have a good market or not, by their readinefs to fwim. 
The roads, in this extenfive pari(h, are very bad ; ftatute 
work^is but feldom performed, which may be owing to this 
circumftance, that few heritors refide in it. The roads mighc 
eafily be made good, as the bottom is hard and gr;ivelly. 

^nfti^niriWe— Near the church, there is an obeliik, or high 
ftone, 8 feet long and 4 feet broad, marked diftioftly with the

figii of the crofs. According to tradition, a Danifh chief was 
interred here. On the top of the Duo of Crieoh, a hill of 
a great height above the level of the fea, and rather jetting out 
into the Frith, there are the remains of a raoipart. The walls 
have been cemented with a vitrified fluff, foinething fimilar 
to the r^fofe of iron in a fmith's forge. The cement is as 
hard as 4 rock. It is faid, that this rampart was begun to ht 
built, in the lath century, hy Vt faui M^Tter^ a branch of 
the noble family of Rofs. At the top of the Kyle, there is 
an old caftle, fuppofed to have been a place where jafiice was 
formerly adminiftered* This cenjedure derives fome plauli- 
bility from the name of the hill oppofite to it, which is called 
Curor na Croiie^ The bill of the gibbet *. 

CbaraSier — ^The people, for the moft part, are regular and . 
orderly, and behave inoffenfiyely, and many of them in an ex- 
emplary manner f . It cannot indeed be faid, that they are in- 
duilrious, nor do they enjoy what would much prompt them 
thereto, as there are no manufadures carried on here. But 
what they want in point of induflry, they make up by fru- 
gality. In fome places, wbifky drinking is rather too com- 
mon, which is not eafily avoided ; as they are often employ- 
ed in buying and felling cattle, and making other bargains, in 
the neighbourhood of feyeral diftilleries. Only one perfon 
has fuffered for a capital crime within thefe ao years ; viz. 
for theft and houfe-breaking. 

Difadvantagis. 

* The names of places are almoft all derived from the Gaelic. Some of them 
have references to combats betwixt the clans, as tmdamiafUaek^ pUmUfulfaU;

Difadvantages.^^^ local difadvantBge, which the weflerii di- 
vifion of the pariih labours under, is, that, as much of the arable 
land and meadows lie along the fides of the K jki and the other ri* 
vdrs, the J are fubje A to inundations every Ceafon of the year* The 
want of mannfadores is a di&amp;dvantage, under which this pariih 
fornoerly laboured, in comoaon with the moft of this countrj ; 
though now, by the exertions of a ref^daUe proprietor in the 
pariih, a new fcene is beginning to open itfelf to our view. 
To that circumftance it was in a great meafure owing, that the 
people were not fo induftrious, as otherwife they would have 
been. Young lads, in the fpring and fummer, ufually went in 
great nuoibers to the fouth, in fearch of employment. There, they 
got high wages, and returned in winter to their parents, or re« 
lations, fomewhat in the ilile of gentlemen^ and were a bur- 
den on their friends the whole winter, until they fet out 
again in fpring. Some of them married in the fouth ; others 
died, or were picked up by recruiting parties* Unmarried 
girls went to the fouth alfo for fervice, efpecially before har- 
veft. * It is not unreafonable to conclude, that thefe have beea 
among the caufes, of diminiiking the number of inhabitants. 

The only fpecies of manufadory iji thefe bounds^ previous 
to the erefting the cotton mill, by Mr. DempAer and his part* 
ners, was the fpinning linen yam : This is but a vtrj fcanty 
earning. There are 4 or 5 perfoos in the pariih, who give 
lint out to fpin : one of thefe gets 10,000 fpindles fpun in a 
year ; the others not near fo much : But it is to be obfervedi 
. that they give out lint to fpin, to the people in the neighbour- 
ing pariihcE, as well as to the people of the pariih itfelf: 4d, 
or jd. is the moft that a woman can earn in a day^ and few 
eaju fo much by fpinmng.

vv eft ward to Port-I^eak, being an extent of z 2 or 14 miles. 
The bulk of the eftate is billj, but the hills are of no great 
height, feembg generally to rife about from 500 to 700 feet 
above the level of the Frith. There may be about 200 fa* 
milies living on thefe eftates, with the exception of the 
mains^ or houfe-fieinn, of each place. The farms are of fmall ex« 
tent ip regard to arable ground , They produce ibme corn and po- 
tatoes, hardly fufScient to maintain the families of the tenants. 
The tenants pay their rents by the fale of cattle, which are fed in 
.their hoyfes, on ftraw, through the winter, and pick up a 
miferable fubfiftence on the wafte and common ground of the 
eftate, durins the fummer. The whole of the prefent rent is 
from 700I. to 800I. a year, of which more than a fourth part 
is paidt by the two Urge farms belonging to the mains, or man- 
fion-boufe* The eftates fumifli fome wood, with which, and

ilates io tfaeir form* Once in three yemrs, all the earthy part 
of thefe houfes is thro'WQ on the dunghiU, and new hoofes 
built again of the fame materials. The cattle commonly oc- 
cupy one end of the houfe, daring the winter feafon. Some 
holes in the walls and roofs ferve for windows and chimneys. 
An iron pot, for boiling their food, conftitutes their principal 
furniture. Nothing can exceed the wretched appearance of 
thefe habitations. As to the occupations of the people, the 
women begin to earn a little money by fpinning. The young 
' men go early in the fpring to the fouth country, and hire 
themielves for all kinds of country labour ; towards harveft, 
many of the wotnen alfo go the lame way, to aifift in cutting 
down and getting in the crop. They all return before winter, 
and are faid to pafs their time round good fires of peat, which 
the country every where fumilhes, and to do very little work. 
In the fouth country, however, to which they go, they are 
remarked for their affiduity, and are faid to be indefatigaUe 
in executing all manner of talk work. Thofe, who remain at 
home, attend to the concerns of their com, potatoes, and cattle, 
and to the providing of their fuel from the neighbouring peat 
mofles. The climate, near the banks of the Kyle, or Frith 
of Dornoch, ripens wheat, barley, oats, and peafe ; becoming 
gradually colder, as you recede therefrom, and afcend the hills, 
which are covered with heather, interfperfed with coarfe gra&amp;. 
The vallies among the hills, and the ground on the fides of the 
hflls, appear to be capable of being cultivated ; and there are 
many little rifing grounds, fome flat moors, and the face of 
fome of the hills fo bare and ftoney, as to be fit for plantations 
only. It need hardly be mentioned, that the inhabitants are in 
general poor ; — that is, poflefs little money or goods, except 
a flock of very indifferent cattle. 

It is not the intention, therefore, of the proprietors, to ex- 
aa, for fome time, any incrcafe of rents from thefe people \

ilations remarkably well adapted for villages. They lie oa 
ihe banks of the Kyle, which is a frith or arm of the fea, na« 
'vigable for 7 miles, by veffels of a confideraUe burden, and 
for fmall craft, about 15 miles more. In all, this Frith is navi- 
• gable for 24 miles. To give si beginning to thefe villagesf 
n company is formed, confiding chiefly of Glafgow gentlemen^ 
i^ho have fubferibed a Capital df 3000 1. and made fome pro*- 
^efs in erefting a manufadufe of fpinning cotton by jennies^ 
and of weaving their yarn. Inilrufted perfons are fent from 
Glafgow to condnfi the work, and to teach the natives 6f the 
country the arts of fpinning iCnd weaving. The town is lot-^ 
ted out, and fome honfea for weaving are in forwardnefs. 
Veflels of 56 tons burden can land their cargoes at this 
place. 

A fecond village^ two miles lower down the Kyle, is alfo 
lotted out, and a large warehoiife already built. Here, the 
water is deep enough to rec^ite any veflel, that can enter 
the Kyle, and come over the bar, (known by the name of the 
C%%%inBrigt^ at its mouth, on which there is 4 fathom water 
at fpring tides, and 6 or 7 feet lefs at neap tides. Here alfo,- 
a gentleman has undertaken to eftablifb the weating of linen^ 
and to encourage the extenfion of the fpinning of yarn all 
around the eoiuttry. At both maanfaftures, apprentices will 
be inftruAed in the art of weaving^ in order to introduce \hac

That the people may have nothing to divert their attentidtt' 
from their own bufinefs, all the fervices performed bj them and 
their cattle, to the! rfuperiors, are commuted in to money; and thir* 
lage to the mills of the baronies is alfo aboliihed. Meafures ar« 
taking to give the people fecure pofTeffion, (for their own lives 
at lead,) of their houfes, gardens and arable landS| with full 
liberty to cultivate as much of the wafte land as .they pleafe. 
Their cattle are fuffercd to paAure on the other wafte lands* 
^as long as they ihall remain in a walle condition ; but the pro- 
prietors refer ve to themfelvesy the power of inclofing and 
planting all fuch par^s of the walle landsj as are fit for no 
other purpofe. Some plantations of this kind have been al« 
ready made, and the trees feem to thrive very well on the 
lighted foils. The trees are principally the larch, the Scotch 
fir, and the birch, intermixed with beech and mountain aih. 
The reft of the wafte land is open t» every fettler, who (hall 
incline to cultivate them. Twenty or thirty new fettlers have 
Already exhibited ftrong proofs of what Highlanders can do, in 
the improvement of their own country, .when fecured in the 
enjoyment of the fruits of their labour. It may be worth 
ivhile to mention the nature of this fecurity. The firft fet- 
tlers may innprove as much land as they find wafte around 
them, for which they pay only i s. a- year during their lives.. 
When they die, their heirs have the refufal of their father's 
pofteflion^at an apprized value, to be fixed by arbitrators mutu* 
ally chofen . This rent is invariable, till the next generation, whea 
the valuation is to be repeated ^ and fo on everj generation. A 
little iron for tools, wood for their houfes, and feed potatoes* 
and corn, is furnilhed to them for the firft 2 years. They are 
exempted from every fpecies of perfonal fervice. Thofe, who 
have vifited the mountainous countries of Switzerland, Wales 
and Norway, have feen what liberty and fecurity can do, to-- 
u ards rendering them fertile. In addition to the general free-

iotn, which the inhabitants of this happj ifland enjoy, under our 
-mild and durable conllitution, the inhabitants of thofe eilates 
ivill enjoy perfed fecurity, as occupiers of land. That thofe 
advantages will lead them gradually to better their houfes, to 
improve their lands, an^ to alter their own condition in every 
xefpe6fc for the better, is beyond a doubt. 

To calculate the advantages, which will in time accrue from' 
this fyftem, to theownei;s cf 18,000 acres of land, on which 
it is introduced, would be no eafy matter ; but the following ob- 
fervations, will lead, perhaps, to the forming fome idea of them. 
Land lets, for potatoe grounds and other purpofes, round 
many towns in Scotland, at various rents, from il« upwards. 
Manufa£turers in Lancaihire, and in fome of the counties of 
Scotland, pay for the little fpots they occupy in the country^ 
round their own houfes^ from 1 1. to 4 1. Sterling per acre. 
The cotton manufafture is faid to have doubled the rents of 
Lancafliire, within thefe lad 20 years. The demand for wood is 
very great ; and as all the woods on this eftate, will be near a 
navigable frith, the wood will fetch the current price, and be li- 
able to little d'wdudion, from the facility of carrying it to mar- 
ket ; while the pra£ticability of being fupplied with that article 
from the Baltic, is faid to leflea yearly. The probable future 
value of thefe eftates, ^nnot be eafily afcertained \ but, wc 
know, that wherever induftry has extended itfelf in Scotland, 
the rents of land have rifen at lead threefold, and much more 
in the neighbourhood of towns. It is to be ohfervcd, that this 
fyftem is attended with no expcr.ce of any material confe- 
qucnce, except that part of it, which confills in planting the 
ufelefs land ; which, as it is co:.{iJer.ible, (ptrhaps not lefs 
than 3I. per acre,) may either be omitted, or dene on a fmaller 
fcale and by flow degreed, according to the faculty and incli^ 
sation^of the proprietor,

thought, that it would be a fitter ufe for the Highlands, tocon« 
yert them into Iheep-walks. That it might be better forthe peo- 
ple to cultivate ibeep, infiead of black cattle, is probably true. 
iSThat the (beep iis a hardier, and a more ufeful animal than the 
ox, may be true alfo. That the increafe of rents, by convert* 
ing cattle-breeding farms, into (beep walks, would be more 
fudden, than by the fyiiem here fuggefied, is not to be dif« 
puted. But that the eftates would ultimately become more 
valuable, is by no means fo clear a propofition. Tracks of 
land, which have been converted into (beep farms, yield little 
more, at an average, than il. Sterling, per ico acres. This is 
indeed a better rent than before. But how contemptible mult 
this rent appear, when compared witn an eflatc occupied by 
induilrious manufadurers, and abounding in large woods of 
tbefintft ^r, )irch, and other trees ? It is to be obferved too, 
that there is a certain incompatibility between flieep, and peo- 
ple and trees. No care can proted new plantations from, 
the depredations of fheep ; they overleap every fence, and 
elude the utmofi vigilance of the ihepherd. The leaves of 
trees are their favourite food in fnmmer; and the bark 
jfl theic medicme, as well as food in winter. The lower

food and ibelter of the flock in winter \ and this circumfianco 
fcems to form the chief iocoi&amp;patibilitj, between fliecp and 
people. This argument will have the greateil weight* witb 
thofe, whpfe obfervation o^ inquiries maj have led them, to 
compare the mountainous parts of Spain, appropriated ta 
ibeep-w^lks, with the mountains of Switzetland and Wales,

rifon is pot to be made by units or decimals \ for the advan« 
fage of men inftead of ibeepv are as thoufands to one* As tho

It is true, tbe people need not be driven out of the 
pountry, becaufp ibeep are introduced into it* ViUage^^ 
inay be built for them, where they might be employed 
ia manu€%£tures. \jkX me alk, has that been the cafe ? aod 
let me doubt a little of the (uccefs of villages by compoU 
iion. It is one thing to build a village, to which people may 
refort if they choofe it, and another to drive them from the 
country into villages, where they muft ftarve, unlefs they 
(Change at once their manners, their habits, and their occupationt. 
How much better would it be, gradually to introduQc fpin« 
oing wheels and looms into their houi'es, than to drive them 
from their houfes, their gardens, and their little fields ? Befide^ 
are men as advantageoufly placed in villages, for cuJtivatiDg 
the foil, as when difperCed over every Corner of the eftafee ? 
Towns are fa id to thrive in proportion to the populoii£' 
nefs of the country around them. It is by a mutual exchange 
of commodities, that both towns, and the country around^ in^ 
toalty fupport one another. To conclude, it is neither 1^ '* 
feeding black cattle nor iheep, in the Highlands, that that 
pountry can be improved^ but by the introdufiion of arts and

DUFFUS extends j miles in length, from £• to tif;

cepting a riiing ground, of no great height, near the middle of 
the parifh, which is every whef e arable; Along the coaft, aU 
the length of the pariih, and more than half a mile of the

All this ground had formerly been a rich cultivated foil ; but 
for many years, has been overblown with dry fand, from the 
weftern beach . TheTfand has for fome time ceafed to blow, and 
a great part of this fpace may again be brpoght into' talture^'

All the reft of this parifli is one continued arable plain, ca4 
pable of producing every thing that will grow any where in 
Scotland. The eaftward diftrid is a deep rich claj, refembling 
the Carfe of GoWrie, and is remarkable for fnperior crops of 
wheat, and of peafe and beans. The weftern diftri^ is a 
black earth, in fome places fo much mixed with (and, as to 
render it of inferior quality \ but in other places fo reaiark««

crop on thecoafts of Lothian, where fowing is in general earlier, 
and where agriculture is under Rood. The barley of this dif« 
trid, when fent to the Frith of Forth, yields as good a price 
as the bed Stirlingfhire or call Lothian barley. Along; the 
coaft of this pari(b, there are quarries of fine freeftone, and, a 
little way up from the coaft, quarries of lime*ftone ; a trea« 
fure in agriculture, locked up from us for want of fuel, and 
which nothing but the abolition of the coal' tax can open*

hj erefting monads and balwarks oa the (bore, is left to 
thofe immediatelj concerned to determine. 

Climate^ — ^The fnperior tarlinefs, fertility, and warmth, of 
the plains of Morayfliire, are fafts more certain than eafj to 
be accounted for. It is known, that we are in a Tery northern 
latitude. The mountains of Sutherland and Caithnels, feem to 
be at too great a diftance from ns, to afford us (heker from the 
north winds, which blow over- a great furface of water before 
thej reach us. To the £. we are alfo open to the German 
Ocean. It is true, that we have lefs rain than elfewhere, 
which isTaid to be accounted for bj the flatnefs of our toun* 
tj ; but other counties of Scotland, equally flat, have more 
rain. Our furface alfo inclines to the N., and the only near 
hills we have, are thofe on the S., feemingly more calculated 
lo overihadow and hurt us, then to give us warmth. Itis faid, our 
foil is light, and therefore warm: it is fo in many places ; but 
there are alfo large diftrids of deep black earth, and of rank 
day, where the fame earlinefs appears. After all, were we 
merely to confult tafie and imagination, in the choice of a reii« 
dence, many would prefer what are often to be met with in the 
fouth of Scotland, green hills, with lefs fertility, and warmth 
in the valleys, to our dryer, eadier, and richer plains, with 
the profpeft of black gloomy hills 00 the upper landfcape. 

Diflempers. — ^Pcftoral complaints, rhcumatifra, and fevers, 
are the moft frequent difcafes. The king's evil is not uncom« 
mon ; and of late madnefs feems fo be increafiog, even among 
the common people. Upwards of 20 years ago, agues werfe 
frequent near the Take ; but were confined to that iituation. 
None of the fea-faring people are ever feized with agues* 
The itch is become much more rare th^n it was formerly. 
It is a truth, which no mere EngUJbman will readily believe, 

i that 



of Duffus. 3S7 

that in this comparativelj rode part of Britain, the itch, 
at prefent, is lefs frequent, in proportion to its population, 
than in the Britiih capital* With us, it arlfes from want of 
.deanlinefs in our perfoos and clothes; but in London, 
confined £tuation, flrong feeding, and a thronged population, 
are the co-operating caufes. 

Woods* — Upon the fouth border of this parifli, a common 
was lately divided bj the different proprietors, and planted 
'with Scotch firs. Planting here is doublj meritorious, as wood 
is needed equally for timber and for fuel. It may be obferred, 
that the planting of foreft trees is the only branch of improve- 
ment, io which our country has of late kept pace with the im- 
proving diftrids of Scotland. Within the laft 25 years, con- 
fiderable plantations have been made. In the eaftern diftridsof 
the county, Scotch firs chiefly appear, even in many places 
.where it is prefumed the ground would have nourifhed bet- 
ter wood. In the weftem difiri&amp;s of our county, Scotch fira 
have been employed in the plantations, as they ought to be 
where the foil and climate require it, merely as nurfes in tender 
years, to more beautiful and valuable trees^ as oak» elm, 
alb, Su:. 

Orchards. — ^Buchanan fays, ** that Moray, for pleafantnefs, and 
the profit arifing from fruit trees, furpaiTes all the other counties 
of Scotland.** In modern times/ we have much negle&amp;ed this 
culture; and our orchards are at prefent often found about de- 
ferted cafiles and religious houfes, nearly as much in decay 
as the buildings they furround. 

Braining of Lakes. — ^The art of draining lakes, fo as to 
render grounds fit for agriculture, feems to be here, as it is 
indeed throughout Scotland in general, but in its infancy. 

3 C a T\\9 



^fif Statiftical Account 

The lake of Spinej has been allowed to fpread for.mlles, bd-« 
yond its original bed, and to cover, in whole, or in part, a 
large portion of very rich ground. A few years ago, an im- 
perfeft attempt was made to draw off the water from the up- 
per grounds, by which fome hundreds a-year wece gained to 
the proprietors ; but a complete draining, which is vtrj pra&amp;« 
Icable, and would be deemed eafy in other countries, would 
|roduce thoufands« 

Cultivation. — Agriculture, with a few exceptions, is here 
in a very low ftate. The old plan of inceffant tillage, with* 
out reft to the ground, or without having any fufficient pro- 
portion of it fown out in grafs, or other green crops, ftill pre* 
vails. Grafs, on the little fpots where it is fown, thrives re- 
markably well. Our tenants are either without leafes alto- 
gether, or have leafes too Ihort for anfwering- any valuable 
purpofe. No wonder then that farming has not advanced. 
Our farms are fmall, and we have no fubtenants* The pa- 
rifli is totally openi excepting fuch inclofures as are round 
gentlemen's places. Various are the evils incident to open 
fields. One of the mod teafing, and not the leaft hurtful, is the 
devaftation inceiTaQtly made by our half flarved cattle, upon 
the adjoining com fields, whofe hunger impels them to break 
from the range of grals, to which they are flaked, or from 
the charge of carelefs boys and girls fet to watch them— S«i- 
V^eed is much ufed for a manurct 

Services. — ^Some fervice^ are ftill continued here j and upon •nc 
cftate, the tenth Jheaf is drawn in teind from the field, as part 
of the rent. Rent is paid chiefly in grain, often at the rate 
of a guinea per acre, — z price not too high for the quality of the 
ground ; but too high without leafes, flrength or ikill to cul- 
tivate it. The abjeft fpirit of feudal habits, has made our 

tenantry 



o/Duffus. 3Sj 



tenantrj undervalue their labour, and give to tlie fuperibr 
fuch a proportion of their earnings, as leaves them without a de« 
cent maintenance ; and renders this clafs of men, of all thoie who 
are able to labour, the pooreft and mod dependant among us. 
Their poverty has thruft them out of the rank, which it is 
advantageous to the community, that their profefEoa ihould 
hold.

' containing 400 Ibuls, more than two thirds of whom follow a 
fea-faring life. Moft of the reft are quarriers and ftone mafons« 
Here there are a few fmall boats employed in fifliing, and 7 
large boats are hired to the fifliiog on die weft coaft, on board 
each of which there are fix people. Five large boats, with 
fix people in each, are alfo employed in tranfporting ftones 
from the quarries, to different parts of. the country. Two 
floops are employed, chiefly in carrying grain to the fouth of 
Scotland, and in bringing back coals. 

Imports and Exports. — The principal imports are coals, 

.moftly from Northumberland ; and merchant goods, chiefly 

from London. Our exports are men^ grain, linen yarn, and a 

few black cattle. The firft and the laft go chiefly to England, 

efpecially to the London market. The grain and yam go to 

the fouth of Scotland.

of (hells, or unpacked lime, on the acre. Summer fallow is a

ct the extremity of the pariOi, to the weft ; which being verf 
inconiinodioas, they were, in the year 1689, built near the bridge* 
#f Earn, and are now about the centre of the parifli. The pa^ 
riOiioners ftill continve to occupy the old burying ground 1 
and none bury in the ground about the prefent church. There 
was formeri^ a chapd at Moncriefft a^nd a church at Riikpot*

the year 1653, annexed, quoad facra^ to the pariih of Dron

their miniders. This harmony has,, in a great meafure, pro- 
ceeded from the moderation and good fenfe of the patrons, 
who have always exercifcd their right, in a way that was 
agreeable to the heritors \ and they,' on the other hand, have 
unitormly confulted the peace of th&amp;pariij9, in their applica-

This mineral is gentle in its operation, has an agreeable' eftft 
in relieving the ftomach of crudities, procuring an appetite, 
and exhilarating the fpirits ; and, inftead of weakening, tends 
to ftrengthen the conftitution. The water is of a cooling qua- 
lity, and very efficacious in removing all heat and foulnefs o£ 
the blood. It is ufed both for drinking and bathing. In 
fome cafes the warm bath has the mod falutary effed, efpe* 
cially in fcrophulous and fcorbotic complaints, but ihould be 
ufed with caution, as it tends to weaken, if made too warm^ 
or ufed too frequently. The time, when this mineral was dif- 
tovered, cannot be afcertained with certainty : even tradition 
fiiys nothing of its firft difcovery. There are five diAind: 
iprings, all of the fame quality, but of different degrees of 
ftrength. In the year l^^l, fome experiments were made on- 
one of the mineral fprings, by Dodor Dokald- Monro of 
London, vfhich, in 1772, together with a letter from the late 
Bofior Wood of Perth, on the fame fubjefi, were publiihed 
in the LXII. volume of the Philofophical Tranfadions. This 
year,(i792,)Meirrs. Stoddart and Mitchel, druggifts in Perth,

Origin of the Name* 

FROM the Gaelic, a branch of the Celtic laogttiage, are do* 
rived the names of pbces, not onlj among the mountains 
of Caledonia, but in the more campaign counties of Scotland* 
iTiV fignifies a burying place j and Malie muft have been a pcrfofi 
eminent for pietj, or for fome other extraordinary quality^ 
who probably was the firft that had been interred in that particular 
place, whence the parifii receives its name. This is the mosa 
probable, as it is well known, that, wherever Popery prevail- 
ed, its partilans were wont to dedicate their churches^ and Um 
cred grounds, to fome canonifed faint* And* as a farther evi« 
dence, even the modem Highlanders, when their veracity is 
fufpeded,* wUl nfe the following phrafe : ^* wfir Maiie tha^^*

SituaU^H and Extent. — ^A part of the parifli lies in ArgylU 
Aire, but the greateft part of -it is in the couhtjr of in^erncfs. 
Seing interfered io three different pkoes, bj as manj arms of 
the fea, the parifli is of an irregolar form. The lengthf from 
K. W. to S. £., is about 60 miles in a ftra^ight Kne. The 
greateft breadlh, from N. £• to S. W.» is 30 miles in a line. 
It comprehends about 589 fquare miles, or nearlj 376,96^ 
£ngli(b acres, meafnring in ftraigbt line9» And« addin|^ the 
furface of the hills and vallies, it mnft be, at leaft, one thii4 
more. An account of fuch an extenfive parifli majj to the na^ 
fives of the low comitrjr, appear romantic. 

Surface t Soilt and Ciimate^^^The greateft part of the parifli coa* 
£fts of high grounds ; and, as the heaths yield excellent grafa, 
it is well calculated for flieep* There are, however, many vaU 
lies, of various extent and quall^. Upon the banks of the 
rivers Locby imd Nevis, and in feveial other places, there ia 
a good deal of arable ground, of difFereot qualities : the (oil, 
in general, is fliallow and fandj^ The climate cannot be rec- 
koned unwholefome^ for feveral have lived to an advanced 
age ; jet the air is molft^ for the wipd blows off the fea near- 
ly two-thirds of the year. This accounts for the almoft in- 
ceftant rains which prevail ; not only here, but in all other 
places on the Weft Coaft of Scotland. Here, extreme cold is, 
never known ; and it is remarkably warm clofe to the flioreS| 
where (how feldom lies above 14 hours.

Each caik contains about 80 grilfe, or a8 falmon and 8 
grilfe, or thereabouts. The price of each caik, including fair, 
cooperage, &amp;c. cofts 13 s. The rent of the river, and ex- 
pences attending the fi(hing, are about 370 1. a-year. The 
average of thofe 7 years, is 21954- falmon, and 1513 grilfe, 
equal to 92 barrels ; which, at the medium price of 
3I. 16 s. 8d., are worth only 352 1. 13 s. 4 d. ; whereas the 
rent and expences, as dated, are 3701. per annum. It is, 
however, to be obfer^ed, that it is only within thefe three laft 
years, that the river has been rented fo high ; and likewife, that 
the rent of a farm, worth, at leaft, 50 L per annum^ is includ- 
ed in the 370 1. Every year fince X787, there has been a

great decreafe in the number of fiih caught ; which muft prw 
ceed from fome inattention in preferring the falmon frj. The 
cruiving of the river» it is thought, b the chief caufe, as the filh 
are thereby prevented from going to the frefh-water lakes to 
fpawn. In all the lakes in the north of Scotland, which run 
to the eaft, pikes are to be found, but in none that run to the 
wellern fea, at lead in the Highlands. 

Coqfi. — One of the greateft advantages of the pariih, is the 
vaft extent of fea-ihore it has ; which, computing on both 
fides of Locheile, on the north of Lochleven, and a part of 
both fides of Linge-Hilloch, amounts to about 70 miles,-— 
mod of which is rocky and high. The lands. In fome places, 
rife gradually many yards above the level of the fea, and are 
excellent pafturage for fiieep, or horfes. There is but little 
kelp made in the pariib, becaufe it is moflly the property of 
the landlords : and the tenants cut the fea ware, for manuring 
the ground, the quantity of dung they have being infuiHcient 
for that purpofe. In fome places, the tides run with amazing 
violence and rapidity. There are four very ftrong currents,— 
at Annat, Corran, Ballachulifh, and Culifnagon. * The lands, 
on both fides of Locheile, being fo high, occafion frequent fud- 
den fqualls, which have fometimes proved dangerous. Seve- 
ral have been drowned, of late years, in the parifb. 

Sea Fijb and Fowls^ — Herrings are the fifh . that abound 
mofi, and that are of the greateft benefit. They generally en- 
ter the parifh in the month of July, and continue in feafon, 
provided the weather does not prove very ftormy, till Novem- 
ber. They are not equally numerous every year. The peo- 
ple of Fort- William, (where the greateft number of boats are,) 
reckon that a good fifiiing-feafon, in which they catch about 
aooo barrels : laft year ^1791) there were about 3000 caught;

cftfe that prevails moft in the pariih ; and, fince people have 
ceafed to wear flannel ihirts, it is become much more gene- 
ral. The prejudices, entertained by the inhabitants of this 
pariih againft inoculation, were, for a long time, invincible. 
But the better fort, fetting the example, thp reft gradually 
followed : — for we are fond to imitate our fuperiors. Yet 
there are fome who ftill fay, " That, to inoculate for the 
•* fmall-pox, is to tempt Providence^* In one feafon, 460 
were inoculated, of whom only 3 died ; and their death the 
furgeon imputed to their being in a bad habit of body. Fe- 
vers of the epidemical kind are very frequent. Of late years, 
the dropfy is become pretty common, particularly among 
the poorer fort of people. This is afcribed to their feeding 
fo much upon potatoes, which is now become a fubftitute for 
meal. The jaundice and the ftone are almoft unknown here : 
the former appears ofteneft, however, but the ague has never 
yet invaded the pariih. The itebf which has been imputed^ 
as a difgrace, to this quarter of the ifland, is but rarely feen 
now, even among the loweft clafles of the people. This, 
doubtlefs, is owing to their living in a more cleanly manner 
than their forefathers. But this diftemper is not peculiar to 
a Highlander,— -nor to a Scotch-man. It is a plant which 
grows in countries fouth of the Tweed, elfe there would be 
no word to ezprefs it in the Englijb tongue ; and it is well

Lakes and Rivers. — Loch-Arcbaig, which is i6 miles long^ 
aod one broad, is the onlj frefh-water lake, io the parifli, of 
anj confequeoce. From it flows the Riyer Aichaig, wbich^ 
after raoning about a mile, difcharges itfelf iote LochJochj. 
This lake is partlj in the parilh, and is the fountain of the 
riyer Lochj ; which, near its found, joins the river of Spiaa, 
and thus lofes its name* Spiao, mot through the pariih cf 
Kilmaniyaig. Thcfe lakes are verj deep : there are fome 
others of inferior iize. The length of the river Lochj is 
about IO miles ; and the medium breadth, about 200 feet. It 
is fordable in many places ; yet, ezoeptiug at Torecafile, fmall 
hoats are ibmetimes rowed up to its fountain. It difgorges it« 
felf into the fea« near Fort- William, with fuch rapidity and 
force, that it preferves its dreams entire, for a long way, with- 
out any gnat mixture or tafte of fait water. No other 
ftream, in the pariih, merits the appellation of river. Nevis, 
indeed, after great falls of rain, and when the fnow is ii£. 
folving upen Benevist and the furrounding hills, fwells to a 
great height ; but, in dry weather, it is no more than an in- 
confiderable rivulet. After performing a circuit of about 10 
miles, and forcing its paflage betwixt rocks and mountains, it 
fweeps along the walls of the garrifon of Fort- William, and 
then refigns its waters tp the ocean*

From the altitude of 600, or 700 yards, upward, there is

Looking to the eaft, Loch-Laggan appears, and to tlie 
fouth-eafty Loch-Ranoocb in Perthfhire. But Loch-Taj,

a hori»)ntal pofition, and, placing jour eje on that part of 
it, where Benevis is delineated ; turn it, till the natural po- 
lition of Loch-Rannoch coincides with its image on the map, 
and you will then have before your eye a true reprefentation 
of the objefts in view. In this manner, you will be able to 
difcover the names of thofe high mountains, which rife above 
the reft ; viz. Crouchan Bhane, near Bunaw in Glenorchay ;— - 
Shichallion, Ben-More, and Ben-La wers, in Perthfhire, Bhillaa 
in Glenco, Ben- More, in the ifland of Mull ; Benuais, and 
other hills in Rofsfhire. The whole of the great glen of 
Scotland, from Fort-George, to the found of Mull, is, at once, 
in view ; comprehending the frelh water lakes of Nefs, Oich, 
and Lochy, and all the courfe of the two rivers Nefs and Lo- 
chy, from their fource, to the place where they enter into the 
fait water, running in oppofite diredions, the one north-ealt, 
and the other fouth-weft. The extent of view, on the hori. 
zon of the fea, is about 8o miles. One fees at once, acrofs 
the ifland, eaftward, to the German Sea, and weftward, to the 
Atlantic Ocean. 

Nature, here, appears on a majellic fcale ; and the vail* 
nefs of the profped engages one's whole attention. Particu- 
lar objeds are but few in number, and they of no common 
dimen&amp;ons ; elfe the eye would entirely overlook them. Such 
are thofe high mountains already enumerated ; which rife 
with fublime afped over the other hills. But you are in« 
flantly fenlible, that none of them is elevated fo high as the 
fpot on which you ftand. 

Juft over the opening of the found, at the fouth-weft cor-

tvhich proved a feafonable relief to maoj indigent families. 
There are red cod, lythe, feath, ikate, flounders, mackarels, 
"wrhitings *, and a few haddocks. If the weather be moderate, 
lythes and feaths may be filhed every day of the year. Their 
prices vary, according to their fizes, from ad. to jd. the do« 
zen. They are killed with fmall rods, and a hook, having a 
feather, refembling one of the herring fry. Cod, ikatc, and 
flounder, are caught with long lines, and baits of herring, or 
of mufcles. There are a great many eels and fturgeons. 
Seals, and porpoifes, and other fea animals, are frequently feen 
to chace the falmon, and whales, the herrings. Laft harveft,

The former arrive in the beginning of May.

Beneviu — ^This mountain is 4370 feet high.^ — ^It is eafilj 
afcendedy bj a ridge of the mountatn, towards the weft, 
about a quarter of a mile up the river Nevis, from the hoofe 
where the proprietor refides. There is good pafture ferfiieep, 
here, as well as on the furrounding hills, for a great way up. 
The view is entirely confined within Glenevis hill, till jou 
have got up about 500 yards perpendicular. Indeed, the 
valley, though confined, prefents an agreeaUe proTped. The 
Villa is beautified with a diverfity of boflies, flirubs, and 
birch woods, the feats of roes and deer, befides many love- 
ly fpots of green; a decent, neat, rural manfion, encircled 
by a yOung flourifl^ing plantation ; a river at ^e bottom 
of the vale, which, aftar being broken by a heap of 
mis-lbapen (tones, glides away in a dear 11 ream ^ and, wan- 
dering through woods, vales, and rocks, lofes itfelf in the 
fea. To heighten the pleafore of the charming view, the fea 
and the fhores prefent themfelves. This is fuch a profpefi, 
as muft expand the heart, and delight the fpedator, attached 
to the charms of nature, and to rural fcenes ; and recal le mind 
the days of old, when princes and princefles are feid to have 
tended their herds and flocks, amidft the beauties of Arcadia. 
Upon afcending above this height, the profpeft opens, and 
enlarges, to the fouth-weft, and you behold the Strait of 
Corran, the iflands of Shuna and Lifmore; the fouth-eaft 
part of Mull, together with the iflands of Saile and Kerrera, 
on the oppofite coaft of Argyll. At this altitude, two ele- 
' vated hills make their appearance over thcfe ifles $ which, by 
their fliape, declare themfelves to be ibe Paps of yuta.

J 70 miles, from the horizon of the fca, at the Murray Frith, o/i 
the north eaft, to the ifl^nd of Colunfa, on the fouth weft. 
Could one pafs a night, in 06lober, on the fummit of Bene- 
vis, it is probable, that he would difcover the heavenly bo- 
dies in greater fplendbnr, than upon Mount Blanc itfelf. The

vaft windings whereof make the feveral turnings of the 
mountains rather diverfify th6 fcene, than obflroft the eye. 
Their extremities, declining gradually from their feveral 
fummits, open into vallies, where One has variegated views of 
woods^ rivers, plains, and lakes. The torrents of water, 
which, here and there, tumble down the precipices, and, in 
many places, break through the cracksand cliffs of the rocks,

make proper obfervations, going and returning, in lels than 
9 hours ; and ftill fewer, without feeling, in their limbs, the

Minerals. — ^There is no coal mine in the parlfli ; but a: 
vein of lead ore has been lately difcovered, upon the weft fide 
of Benevis, running eaft and weft, crols a bum, in the heart' 
of a folid rock of fine red granite, with a flope outwards, as it 
defcends; and, but for this flope, in a vertical pofition. It is 
four or five inches thick ; compofcd of about one third of 
ore, and the reft, of white marcafite, with a mixture of ful* 
pbur) and feems to grow thicker, and richer, as it defcends. 
The accefs is not difficult ; and the perpendicular height, 
about 300 yards from the bottom of the valley. Two other 
parallel narrow veins, are to be fecn a few yards lower down. 
Though a trial could be eafily made, none has, as yet, been-

beauttfol cafcade, falling down, bj a gradual flope, from Be-

the vallej, where it unites its flrcams with thofeof the Nevis. 
The appearance of this Iheet of water, immediately attraSa

thofe lofty and grand fentiments of devotion, and thofe pleai» 
fing elevated feelings, which the fublime found of a cafcade, 
or the war of many waters, naturally excite. The windings of 
the river,-*-the verdure of the trees,— the wildriefs of the 
rocks,-»the terrific afpeft of the hills,-^the mift, flying fwift- 
ly on their tops, — the clouds, rolliag along with velocity,— 
the lonely (itnation, remote from human eye,-— «very thing 
confpires to make thb fall of water, one of the grandeft ob- 
jefis in nature. It even excels the famous Fall of Foyers^ 
which cannot be beheld with fo much complacency. It is, 
indeed, awful and fublime \ but has too much of the terrible 
in its appearance.*- About two miles farther up the river Ne^ 
vis, there is another cafcade, which, after forcing its way 
through hills and rocks, has a fall of, at lead, 500 feet per. 
pendicular. It is on the fame fide of the river with the cave.

Adntantages and Difadvantages.^^^JTht great extent of Tea 
fiiore has been already mentioned as an advantage to tbe pa?- 
riih ; nor are the mild winters, and the eafj communicatioa 
with other parts of the world, among the leaft of them. Tbe 
pariih, in general, is well provided with excellent peats, which 
is the chief foci that is ufed. Fort* William, boweyer, is ill 
fupfJied wjtk this n^ceiTarj article. And, indeed, were the 
duty taken off coals, none who live upon the (bore would bum 
any other fuel. Thus^ much time, that ts now unavoidably 
taken up in procuring the article of fire, would be faved ; ant 
many bands might be employed in filking, and other ufeful 
occupations, that, at prefent, are neglefted. Another great 
difadvantage, but not peculiar to this pariih alone, is the dut^ 
upon fait. There are other inconveniences and difadvanta* 
ges, that are peculiar to this pariih, efpecially to Fort-William 
and Maryburgh, but which could be removed without anyi 
great expence. Some of thetie are, the want of a quay, of a

Vropofed Imprtfvements. — In ftormy weather, yeflfek, Ijin^ 
at Fort William, are obliged to unmoor, and crofs to the op-^ 
poiite fliore : where, indeed, there is a pretty fafe harbour, and 
good anchorage, called CamufnugauL This is always attend- 
ed with additional expence and lofs of time, and fometimes 
the veflels receive damage upon the banks. All this could 
be avoided, if only 400I. were laid out in building a proper 
quay. But, fmall as this fum is, the merchants of Fort Wil« 
liam are unable to advance it. The Duke of Gordon, who 
is proprietor of the place, is the only perfon from whom 
ainftance can be expeded. But the necefllty, or utility of 
fuch a work, has never been reprefented to him. There is a 
Hill greater necefllty of eftablifiiing at Fort William, a weekly 
market for butcher meat and other articles. For want of 
this, people feldood have it in their power to purchafe frefli 
meat; and all winter andfpring they feed upon £alt provifions* 
This could be eaiily remedied, an^^'Q^^ ^^ ^^^ neighbouring 
iheep farmers would find it their intereft, were they to fell 
fome of their flock to a butcher in the place. 

Abundance of good water could eafily, and at a imall tx* 
pence, be conduced by pipes. This ought to be done by 
6oTer»ment, becaufe the garrifon is much worfe fupplied 
thaa the village.— The only objeAion, againft a tannery, is, 
that there are too few cattle killed in the country, for keeping 
fuch a work going. But, then, would it not be an eafy mat- 
ter to import undreflfed hiies, and to un them here? This 
is done in other place8.--Agatnft the ere&amp;ion of a faw millp 
there can be no folid objeftion. There was one formerly on 
the river Archaig ; but it did not anfwer the purpofe, on ac- 
count of its diftance from the garrifon i and was therefore

difcontinued. A vaft quantity of timber is imported yearly 
to Fort William, and 6 fawcrs are conftantly employed about 
it: Whereas a mill would faw more in a few days, than all 
t\t 6 would do in a twelvemonth. It ftiould be built upon 
the Nevis, within a few yards of the foot. 

What would be of ftiU greater benefit to this pariffi, and 
likewife to all the furrounding countries, would be the efta- 
blifhment of a manufadory of coarfc woollen cloth. If 
nations confider the exportation of raw materials, as one of the 
greateft difadvantagcs and misfortunes, is it not to be regret- 
ted, that lo.coo ftones of wool fliould be annually exported, 
from this parifii alone, to Liverpool, and other ports of Eng- 
land, whence it is fometimes returned to ourfelves, after it is 
wrought into cloth ? Thus the Englifli roanufaawrer and 
merchant arc enriched by the produce of our country, while 
hundreds of our own people are idle and unemployed through- 
eut the whole year*. 

But the improvement that would be of the greateft advan- 
tage to the parifh, and indeed to the whole kingdom, would 



• This extreme tar£me/s in improwiiumtt muft, in a great degree, be attributed

be, to cut a canal between the weft and eaft feas. Without 
aid from government^ it is too great' an undertaking for pri- 
vate individuals. It could eafilj be accomplifhed ; for there 
are 3 large lakes intervening, viz. Lochy, Oich, and Nefs, 
where (hips of the line might fail. Two miles of drj land 
are the utmoft diftance, following the courfe of the lakes and 
rivers ifluing from them, betwixt Fort William and Invernefs. 
The channels of the rivers would require to be made deeper 
and wider^ and in fome places, no doubt, altered entirely. 
Were this paflage opened, the long and dangerous navigation 
bj the Pentland Frith would be avoided. — Another canal, from 
the head of Locheile to Loch Sheil, would be of verj great ad- 
vantage to this parifli. The diftance, between thefe two lochc^ 
is between 3 and 4 miles of a foft mois. From Loch Sheil a 
river runs into the fea of about a mile long. The benefit of 
fuch a canal would be experienced by all navigators, going 
from the north to the Cljde ; the dangerous point of Ardna* 
murchan would not then be dreaded bj them. 

Manner of living prior to the year l^6^. — ^AU the arable 
ground was carefully cultivated, and fowed, moftlj with oats. 
If the returns were few, the rents were low. Farms were 
divided into (mail proportions among the occupants; jet their 
cattle were grazed in cosounoo, every tenant having cattle'ia 
proportion to the (bare of rent which he paid. The cattle 
were neverthelefs appropriated, and each had his own, and 
their fruits. Befides black cattl^ they had a few (beep and 
.goats ; out of which| they could, at any time, afford to take 
part for. the ufe of their families. And, as they had plenty 
of milk, butter and cheefe, and a good deal of oats, they 
lived very comfortably. In return, they were always ready 
to perform for their landlords every kind of fervice. This 
was rarely an iovoluntary fervicp. For, when they had the

EreQioH and Name. 

THE parifli) mw known by the name of Toriybuni, in« 
eludes the pariflies of Torry and Cromhie. When their 
union took place, cannot be afcertained ; but it appears, from 
certain papers relating to the flipend, that it muft have been 
before the year 1623. The name of the former, ^orry, figni- 
lies, in Gaelic, the King\ Height^ and, with the addicion of 
ium^ the Scotch word for a rivulet, is now the general name 
of both. This addition feems to have been fuggefted by a 
(aalX ftfeam, which runs along the fouth eaft part of the prin« 
cipal village in the parx&amp;, and divtdes the two btronies of 
Torry and Crombie*.

William Erlkine, there are many different feams of coal, of 
various qualities and thicknefs. Great fields of thefe coals 
are ftill to work, (particularly the main coal of Torry, which 
is of the heft quality), but they are all under level. The lands 
of Crombie were found to contain 6 feams of coal, of a quality 
much the fame with that of the Newcaftle, and, like it, turn-

From this comparative ftatement, it appears, by the births, 
that the population of the parifh has been upon the decreab 
during the laft zo years, which is aftually the cafe. In the 
firft period, the coal in the eftate of Crombie was wrought 
to a pretty confideryble extent ; but, when it began to fail, 
numbers of the workmen went to collieries in the neigh- 
bourhood; and at prefent, very few families of them remain in 
the pariih. With regard to the deaths, (tho mediums of which, 
in both periodsi are nearly equals andwbich, in the laft, ought

tfaofe people who have left the pariihy ftill continae to havj 
their dead here, whofe intertnevts, without diftioAiois are ii^ 
ferted in the regifler, aloi^ with tholie of aAnal parifluoners. 
It appears, from the regifler of the dead, which was begun ia 
this parifli in February 1096% that in the year 1697, 114 
died ; and that of theie, 76 died in the months of Janoarj^ 
Febroarj, March and ApriL In the year 1699, 81 died ; of 
whom 40 in the months of September, Odober, November 
and December. This vaft mortality is accounted for by a- 
dearth f , which prevailed, more or leis, for 7 years in the end 
of laft century ; at which period alio, great numbers of fifli- 
are faid to have been thrown in upon the coaft ; of thefe the 
people eat immediately from the want of other food, and there- 
by became the prey of dyfenteries, and other putrid diforders. 
—The great body of the people is compoled of day labour- 
ers tj mechanics, and failors* 

Proprietors and Rent. --^There are 14 heritors in the parifh, 
4 great, and 10 fmalk The valued rent, as appears from 
• an extra^l taken from the cefs hooks of the county, amounts 
to 5,1841. Scotch. There are fome lands, in the pari(h only 
quoad facra^ the valued rent of which is 889L 33. 4d. Scotch.

glebe of two acres and a half, amounts to between 80L and 90L

Latin, Englifliy writing, arithmetic, navigation and book-

and well attended. 

Poor — The nnmber of perfons at prefent on the poor's^

who, though in lels indigent circumftances, fland in need of 
fome affiftance, and receive from time to time, according aa 
the funds will allow. The funds, froo^ whence thefe payments 
are made» arife, chiefly, from the weekly cpUe&amp;ions at thet 
church doors, and the profits of the mortcloth, wh?ch amountt 
in all, to about jol. Sterling yearly. 

Shipping and ^raJlr.— There are 13 veflels belonging to 
this place, viz. z fbip, 3 brigs, and 9 (loops ; whofe burdens^ 
put together, amount to upwards of xooo tons, and give em- 
ployment to about 70 feamen. The larger veflels are engag-i 
ed in foreign trade. The (loops are coafters \ but fome of them 
occaiionally go up the Baltic for wood and grain. We have 
a pa(rage boats, 'the largeft of which was built by the mer- 
chants of Dunfermline, principally for the purpofe of tian- 
porting to Borrowftownnefs their manufa&amp;ured diapers, which 
are brought here in carts, and carried to London by the Bor- 
rowftownnefs traders, and for bringing over the goods, which 
come for them by the fame conveyance : And the other is 
chiefly employed in importing commodities fortheconfumption 
of the inhabitants. There are no manufaSures in the pari(h ; 

but

but there is a coniiderable quantitj of yam fpun for the ma* 
nu&amp;ftiirers in Dunfermline^ which brings into circulation 
here, to the amount of between 400L and 500]. Sterling yearly. 

jintiquiti€S.^^TheTt are no natural curiofittes in the parilh, 
and its antiquities are but few. In a pretty extenfive plain 
field, N. £• of the village of Torryburn, there is a fiat ftone, 
raifed upon one end, of a ihape nearly oblong, £nd meafuriog, 
from the furface to the top, about 8 feet,* and about 4f in 
breadth* Round the edge of it there is a deep circle, and on 
each of the fides a number of ridges, all of which wear the 
appearance of art and antiquity. At about x8 or ao paces 
from this 'ftone, there is a number of fmaller ones, which, 
,from their prefent pofition, feem to have formed part of a 
circle. This place is thought to have been the fcene of a 
battle in ibme former period, atid thefe ftones to mark the 
graves of fome of the chiefs, who had fallen in the engage, 
ment. And the fuppofition is rendered highly probable 
by the name which it ftill bears, To/Ast^i, which is evident- 
ly a corruption of the Scotch word 7Wsu, which fignifies a 

9Ljlgbt. 

In the church-yard, there is part of an epitaph, which, 
from its fingularity, and at the (ame time beautiful fimplicity, 
appears well worth prefervation. When the prefent incum- 
bent entered to his benefice, it was entire upon the grave 
ftone ; but a gentleman, whofe property the burying ground 
now is, perhaps from inattention, caufed part of it to be 
erafed, in order to make room for infertbg the deaths of 
fome of his relations. The following is the epitaph in- 
tire, as originally compofed.

EreBion and Name. 



THIS parifli was ere&amp;ed bj an a£t of the i8th parliamea( 
of King James VI. in the jear 1606. There is a tra« 
dition, that the village Ferrj-Port-on- Craig belonged to the 
neighbouring parifh of Leuchars, previous to that period, and 
had a chapel of eafe, though no record can be found old enough 
to authenticate this fa&amp;. So ftrongly is the tradition thereof 
imprefled on the minds of the people, that the fuppofed 
foundation of this chapel, ever fince that diilant period, has 
to this day remained unplowed, in the midft of a well cul- 
tivated field, named the Chapel, — The pariih has its name 
from its local fituation. There is a public paiTage over the 
Taj, from the village of Ferry-Port- on-Craig on the fouth, 
to Broughtj Cadle, which ftands oppofite, on the north bank 
of the river. This paffage was named Ferry^Port^on^Craig^ 
to diftinguiih it from the many other ferries in this part of 
Scotland. There being at that time no pier, or quay, on either 

fide

ibis paflage was iiiiiich frequented by perfons of all ranks ; 
but fince that period « &amp;wer jieople travel this way, and the 
road has become almoft deferied* The drovers, however, ftilf 
frequently pafs here, having ^«)od oonVeniency for their cat- 
tie on both fides, of the river. It is, indeed, efteemed one 
of the fafeft paflages §ver the Tay, there being no inftance 
(in the memory of the oldeft man alive}', of a paffage boat 
being caft away croffing from the village of Ferry-Port-on- 
Craig to Bmcbty Gaftle ; though th6 rivet at diis piffage

is 4 miles farther eaftward, and nearer the ocean and month 
of the river, than the fiafiage at Dnadee. It is private pro* 
pcxljf being part of the cftate of Scotfcraig. 

Siination^ Surface^ Village^ \3c. — ^Thb pariih is fituated on 
the fouth fide of the river Tay, and ftretches along the fonth 
bank of the river, from its mouth, where it empties itfelf 
into the German ocean, 5 ftatttte miles from £:. to W. It is 
irregular as to its breadth from N« to S«, being in fome places 
one mile, and at other places not above half a mile broad. 
On the £. the furface is flat and low. Though there are n# 
remarkable mountains, yet towards the W* it is high and 
rockjr, where, the hills have not foil enough for cultivation. 
They are moftly covered with whins and fliort grafs, the 
bare rocks appearing but in few places* Where the pariih is 
^ bounded bj the German ocean, the ihorc is fandy ; but where 
it is bounded by the river, it varies, being in fome places 
laody, in others covered with fea gravel. At the village it is 
a rocky fhore. The parifli contains the houfe of Scotfcraig, 
(where the family refides), four farms, with their cottaries^ 
and the village of Ferry-Port»on*Craig, frooi whence the 
parifli has its name. The greateft number of the parifhioners 
live in the Ferry, where the church and manfe are both fitu- 
ated, and are very centrical forthej^ariihioners. 

. JExtintf &amp;f7, mS Produc9. — From a map of the parifli^ 
it appears there are in it 2,016 Scotch acres. The foil is of 
various kinds, coufifting of day, flrong add Kght loam, fimd^ 
,%oA links. The crops that are beft adapted for the clay, 
to produce the greateft profit, are, wheat, beans, barley, 
grafs, and oats. Flax is fown to very good advantage ; but^ 
)&amp; the whole,- it is rather an uncertain crop i it likewife pro-

daces potatoes, but the quality is generally not fo good as in 
light foils. The ftrong loam Itands on a whin rock ; and', where 
there is fnfficiencj of foil, it produces wheat, oats, beans, bar* 
ley, grafs and potatoes, in great perfe&amp;ion. Flax is fometimes 
fown OB this foil, but feldom proves a good crop. The light 
loam is founded mi (and, and produces barl^j, grafs, oats, po- 
tatoes, turnips and flax. This foil produces the two laft arti- 
cles, in a moift feafon, very abundantly ; but when long tra&amp;s 
of dry weather take place, they prove but ppor crops. The 
fand produces barley^ grals, oats, rye, turnips and flax ; all 
which crops, ia a favourable feafon, turn out far beyond what 
a flraoger to the nature of the foil could imagine* The flax 
in particular, turns out to be a very lucrative crop. The 
links produce a kind of pafture for cattle and (heep, and af« 
ford accommodation for the grey rabbits, which, within tbefe 
few years, have turned out very valuable to the pofleflbrs, oa 
account of the extraordinary demand for their fl&amp;ins, which;

Cultivation^ Cattle^ Export^ and Imports^ \3c. — All thei, 
tenants now ufe only ploughs drawn by two horfes \ one man 
both holds the plough, and drives the horfes with a pair of 
long reins. In driving their corn and dung, they ufe carts 
drawn by two horfes. The farmers in the country employ 
17 ploughs. Cultivating the acres occupied by the feu- 
ars in the Ferry, gives fuflicient employment to 3 more, which 
makes the number of ploughs ufed in the whole parifli amount 
to lo.-^There are 61 working horfes. The greatnefs of their 
number is oviing to the villagers in the Ferry, keeping more 
horfes than would be fuflicient for the cultivation of the lan4 
;hey poflefs, were they always employed in agriculture ; but 
they frequently ufe them in drivii^ coals for hire, and fud^

.The people are generaUj healthy* Epidemical diftempers kU

that during 'the incumbency at the prefcnt miniftcr, there

I'he iiicreaf^ iti population, which is chiefly in the villaget 
is owing partly to the neighbouring fanners not inclining to 
keep fuch large cottaries as formerly : This has obliged fe- 
veral families to come into the Ferry, where they hire foiaU 
houfes, and fupport themfelves by their induftiy, either as 
tradefnien or day labourers. The great increafe of ftianofao-

was originally church land, bfslonging to the arohbiOiopric 

of St. Andrew's. The Pope, by his bull, allowed the arch.

Scotch, and 4 bolls of peafe. The yearlj value of the peafe, 
with the (aid fum of monej, is annually paid to the coUeflor* 
of the biihop's rents. It is handed down bj tradition, that a 
Mr. Scott, a fon of the family of Balwirie, in Fife^ was the 
feuer ; and, to diftinguiih it from other farms called Graigf 
he prefixed his own name to it ; hence Scotfcraig. This eftate 
was formerly the property, and the houfe the country refidence» 
of Archhijbop James Sharp, for many years before his, death ; 
and belonged to his fon Sir William Sharp feveral years after 
the death of the bifhop. His arms are ftill on the outer gate, 
dated 1667. 

Antiquity m — ^The only antiquity in the pariih is the re« 
mains of an old caftle, in which there are feveral vaults quite 
entire. We are greatly at a lo(s to know by whom, or aC 
what period it was built, as there is no record to determine, 
nor even any traditional account handed down concerning it ; * 
but it muft have been after the invention of fire arms, em 
brafures being fo placed, as to carry a line of fire round the 
fort. The top of one of the hills is furrounded with the 
foundation of an old wall. As, from the top of this hill, 
there is an extenfive profpeft along the banks of the Tay, and 
the coutitry around, it is fuppofed to have been the place of 
fire fignal, in the time of the Daniih incurfions into Scotland ; 
but there is no record about it. 

^{^/..^There being neither coals, peats, nor wood, found 
for fuel, the dependence of the pariihioQcrs for firing, is upon 
coals brought from a diftance, either from the frith of Forth, 
or by fea, at a confiderable expence. What is called the boll, 
which weighs 8 cwt., or 56 ftone Englifh, is fold here at 
prefent at 6s. the boll. Though we pay no duty for Scotch 
coals, they are confiderably dearer this feafbn, than ever they 
were, remembered to have been, which bears hard upon the

people in the lower ranks of life. Some drive co«ls from 
the coal- works in this, coantiy, at the difiance of 9 or 10 fta^ 
tnte miles, which they fell at 7s. the cart load. Some of the 
cottagers, in the country parifh, bum dryed tnrf and whins ; 
but they all ofe coal as the principal part of their fad. The 
villagers in the Ferry nfe coal only, which they pnrchafe 
at the above prices. 

CharaBer. — ^The people are peaceably difpoCed, and firmly 
attached to the prefent happy civil confticudon of their conn« 
try. They all adhere to the principles of the eftabliflied 
church of Scotland ; and r^gulady attend divine worfliip in 
the parifii kirk, excepting one Unitarian, (who, however, fre« 
quently hears fermon with the other parifliioners)^ and one 
Seceder ;. both of whom came lately into this parifli from 
Dnndee. 

Mifcettamtnu Obfervattons, — ^Theye are no lime-ftone quar* 
ries ; but lime is brought by fea from Sunderland. It is 
fold at the Ferry at xs. 6d. Sterling the boll of wheat meafure, 
or 2s. 4d. Sterling the barley meafure. Some drive lime by 
land carriage, at the diftance of 10 and 15 miles, which can 
be afforded at 3s. xd. the boll, barley meafure. The only 
fione, got in this ground, is a hard whin ftone, which makes 
firo3g and laftlng work when built with good lime. — There 
are two mills for grinding meal, to which the parifliioners are 
thirled only for what meal they make, or what malt is brew- 
ed wi^in the parilh ; but not for the whole crop of com 
growing on the feveral farms. — As there is a conftant weekly 
demand for all kinds of country vivres in Dundee, fome per- 
fons make it their bufinefs to go through this part of the coun- 
try, and gather them up for the Dundee market. The prices 
here are, therefore, always regulated by what they fetch

Situation and Extent, 



THE pariih of Logic is fituat^about 3 miles from Cu« 
par, (the principal tS^n in t^countj of Fife, and the 
feat of the prefbjterj), and about an equal diftance from the 
water fide, or Ferrj, to Dundee. It extends about 2I miles 
in length from E. to W., and i in breadth from S. to N«, 
though in fome parts not quite fo much. The general figure 
of the parifliy may be feen in Ainflie's map of Fife. 

Surface^ Soily Climate^ \ic. — The country is in general hillj, 
but very fertile/ The climate is pretty dry and healthy, except* 
ing near the fmall village of Logie, where there is a marfli, 
which makss the air damp, efpecially in winter.— .There is a 
confiderable mountain in the parifh| called Luckla Hillj upon 
which, it is reported, that the kbgs of Scotland ufed to hunt, 
and on which account it is called the King*s Park, But of 
this circum (lance, there is no authentic record extant. — From

farmers fow a confiderable quantity of grafs and turnips, 
and have very good returns. Tbey rooftly plow their ground 
with horfes ; i|nd oxen are here very Uttle ufed.in hufbandfy. 
There are about aS ploughs, with goieraUy a horfes to « 
plough, befides what the farmers bring up for their own ufe, 
or for fale. Mod of them pay a good part of their remits bj 
bringing up young cattle. There are two pretty confiderable 
flocks of fheep in the parifh. The mutton is fmall, but the 
wool they produce is of a tolerable quality, neither of the 
coarfeft, nor the fined fort. 

Population. — ^The inhabitants, it is faid, are dinuniihed in 
point of number, compared to what they were many years ago ; 
and it is certain, that feveral oottages have been puUcd down 
fince the commencement of this century ; but within thefe 
40 years, there appears to be, upon the whole, very little

Na^ey Extent^ and Situation^ 

C ADDER, the name of this parilh, is derived froai a 
Gaelic word, and faid to fignifj the Bad of the Oat 
Woody which correfponds exadlj to the fituation of Cadder 
Houfe. It is often fpelt Calder, The parifh is 13 miles in 
length from £• to W., and between 3 and 4 miles in breadth*. 
It lies in the northern eztremitj of the county of Lanark. 
The 3 counties, Lanark, Dumbarton, and Stirling, all meet 
at the north point of this pariih. The neareft point of it is 
3 miles from the citj of Glafgow, within half a mile of the 
town of Kirkintilloch, and 3 miles from Kilfjth and Cumber- 
nauld. Gartin^ueen Hill, in this parifh, is faid to be at an 
e^ual diftance from Hamilton, Falkirk, and Stirling.

River and Canai. — The river Kdvia, which rjfcs eaft of 
Kilfjth, runs 6 miles along the northern boundary of the psu 
riih ; but its courfe may be 10 or 12 miles» through fine fer* 
tile baugh grounds. It falls into the river Clyde two miles 
below Glafgow. The Kelvin ufed to overflow its banks in 
time of rain, and do confiderable damage, efpecially in feed 
dme and harveft i but the* proprietors on the north fide, to 
whom it did moil damage, have of late confined it, by a 
great earthen mound, for the moil part along its conxiR^^Jlt 
might, however, have been a much more effe&amp;ual remedy, had 
they firaigbtened, widened, and fecured the bed of the river ^ 
which would be a great faving of ground.— Tbe Forth an4 
Clyde Navigation, comiDooly called the Crutt Csnal^ runs 
through the parilb for 5 miles, and has 4 draw bridges on it. 

LaiiJ and Roads. — About 9o years ago, a lake, nearly in 
the middle of the pariih, was drained by a mine, driven » 
full mile in length under a hill. The mine is in many placet 
90 fieet bdow the furface, whereby 120 acres of fine arable 
ground is gained, which annually produces rich crops, without 
any kind of manure— -There is another lake, called the Bs/bop^i 
Zactf a mile in length, and one fourth of a mile in breadth, 
which is at prefent occupied as a refervoir, by the Great Canal 
Company.— The poft road, from Edinburgh to Glafgow, paile3 
4 miles through this pariih, and croiTes the Great Canal about 
a mile eaft of Cadder kirk. There is alfo a new turnpike road 
made for 4 miles, in the eaft end of this pariih, from Glaf- 
gow by Cumbernauld towards Falkirk, faid to be confiderably 
ihorter than the road by Kilfyth and Kirkintilloch, and with- 
out a pull.-— In 1772, when the heritors met to aiTefa the 
pari&amp; for repairing the bye roads, they found it to con- 
tain 123 ploughgates of land. They alleffed each of thefe 
plougbgates in los* Sterling, and is. 6d. for every cotuger^

making the extent of road neceflary, thej raifed it to xSs.

aA of parliament for repairing roads in the county of Lanark.

Jliinfro/r.— There are a number of freeftone quarries in the 
parifli* The (tones are very fit for building, and take a fine 
poliih. There are alfo yaft quantities of whin rocks, very 
proper materials for roads* We have an inezhauftible rock 
of limeftone, which has of late been wrought to a coufiderable 
extent, both at Grankirk and Robroyftone. — No coal^ fit for 
working, has yet been dilcovercd, though it is the^opinion of 
miners,' and people of flLill, that the feams of coal, which 
have been wrought to fo great advantage, in New Monkland 
on the £. and New Kirkpatrick on the W. extend through 
this pariih. It is to be hoped, that fome public fpirited gen* 
tleman will fearch for, and find this hidden treafute* 

Reni^ Soilf CukivatiMf Produce^ t^r«-— The Talnation of the 
whole pariih, is 61701. Scotch ; and the prefent yearly rent, 
may be about 6oool. Sterling. — ^There is no mountain in this 
parifli. The whole face of thediftrid is generally level* Yet 
we have feveral different foils ; fuch as, light (andy till, deep 
earthy and plenty of mofs for iff A— Improvement of land has 
greatly increafed of late, and is ftill goiogon very rapidly, both 
by the plough and by manure. Excellentcrops of oats, barley, 
clover, and rye grab, potatoes and flaxt are produced. Oats 
have fold, before reaping, at 81. as 6d. per acre, and yielded 
x6 bolls each acre. Potatoes are much cultivated here, and 
ferved up at every table* They are a fubftitute for breads 
among the lower dafs of people, for at leaft xo months in the 
year j and, with very little attention, they make the old crop

raifed from x acre.— Bat flax is the moft advantageous crop 
here: 200 acres arc fown annually; and this year (1792), 
one farmer has fown 30 acres with flax feed : 32 ftones of good 
fcutched flax have been raifed from z acre, and fold at a guinea 
the ftone ; a price perhaps equal to the value of the land on 
which it grew. Riga flax feed, and the fined kinds of Dutch 
feed are moftly fown here ; though fome good crops of flax 
have been raifed from Bofton flax feed. On rich moift foil, 
the fineft flax is raifed from American feed. Fine Dutch, and 
large plump America flax feed are reckoned to agree beft with 
this clfmate. The quantities, commonly fown on z acre, are, 
9f pecks Dutch, 8t Riga, and 8 America flax feed ; this laft 
being much fmaller than the others. — ^The improvements in 
agriculture, in this neighbourhood, are much owing to the 
Great Canal *• Before it was erefied, neither fpade nor bar. 
row was ufed to any purpofe* Now, the wheel-barrow, 
plank, and fpade, are found at every farmer's door ; and, by 
the proper ufe of thefe utenfils, much work is expeditioufly 
performed* 

Eeclifiafiicat State^'^The whole of this pariib, excepting the 
barony of Cadder, and the Midtown of Bedlay, formerly be- 
longed to the fubdeanry of Glafgow. The Bifliop's Land was 
called the BMermonocb Ward (or McnVs 7ot£^«), and corn- 
prehcnds ten townfliips ; each of which contains 8 ploughgates 
of land. The mill of Bedlay is ftill the joint property of 
thefe 10 townfliips. From this ecclefiaftical tenure, are derived 
the names of feveral places in the parifli; fuch as, the Bifi^p^s

of Glafgow, obtained a renunciation of the right of patronage 
by that learned body ; in confequence of which, the heritors 
and elders of the parifli became the ele&amp;ors of the minifler* 
It is a pity, however, that the aft 1690 has not defined pre- 
cifely what amftitutes an heritor ; for this defeft has been at* 
tended with great inconveniences to the parifli of Cadden 
When the church of Cadder was formerly vacant, about the 
year 1745, there were keen difputes as to the title of feveral 
perfons claiming a right to vote under the charafter of heri«- 
'tors ; in confequence of which, the kirk was vacant for near 
two ye^rs. And though the late worthy clergyman, who fuc- 
ceeded on the occafion, died in June 1790, the church flill coo^ 
tinues vacant, owing to a warm difpuU^ with refpeft to the 
title of a number, who voted at a late eleftioa of a roinifter, and 
which is at prefent under litigation before the Court of Sef&amp;on. 
It ought however to be mentioned, that the College of Glaf- 
gow, who are ftiU titulars of the tiends, upon application be- 
ing made to them, generoofly con&amp;nted, much to their honour, 
as well as to the benefit of thb parifli, to allow part of the va- 
cant ilipend to be laid out, in paying the expence of a preacher, 
to officiate at Cadder church during the vacancy, under the 
diieftion of the prefl)ytery of Gla(gow..— The living is S chal-

flated in 17 14, at the joint ezpence of the College of Glafgow, 
and the former and then prefent minider. It is now in a 
ruinous condition. The church was rebuilt in 1750, but not 
finifbed compleatlj till 1784, and is now in good condition. 

Poor. — ^The number on the poor's roll is about 15 annually; 
moftly aged and infirm women, who have from 6d. to is. Ster- 
ling weeklj. Occaiional affi dance is given likewife to poor 
families, of from 5s. to los. Sterling at a time. No public 
charity is given to any that go about begging, except now and 
then a pair of (hoes. — ^The poor's funds arife from the collec- 
tions at the church doors, as. 6d. for every marriage, and the 
intereft of about jool. Sterling, mortified to the kirk feffion. 
Thefe funds have continued, without much iscreafe or dimi- 
nution, for near 50 years pail. 

Schools, — ^There are 4 public fchools in this parilh, 3 of 
which have fmall falaries annexed to them, (z.) The parilh

1744, Mr. Patrick Baird, merchant, left a memorial'worthy

Auchenloch, the place of his nativity. He devoted 15I. Ster-

Mr. James Warden, late minifter of this pariih, bequeathed 
zooo merks Scotch to the ieffion ; the intereft of which is allotted 
to the fnpport of a fcb'sol at Aachenaim, the place of his na-

Leechman, late principal of the Univerfity of Gla^w, dif- 
poocd to the feflion of Cadder, about half an acre of ground, 
for a houfe and garden for the benefit of this Cbhool, of which 
the minifter and elders are patrons. (4.) The fourth IchooU 
houfe is at Chiyftone, in the eaft end of the parifli, where a 
chapel of cafe was built by fubfcription 11 years ago ; but there 
is no falary annexed to it, nor any perquifite for the matter, 
excepting the fchool wages, i%» 6d. per quarter. 

At each of thefe 4 fchools, there may be, at an average, 
30 feholars during the winter half , year, and ao through the 
fummer quarter. When there is any vacancy in the harveft^ 
the fcboolmqfier^s year is only reckoned three garters! J !^^ 
Thus 100 fchoolars, for three quarters, at is. 6d» per quarter, 
pay only aiL los. Sterling per annum, to all the 4 fchoolnuu

Antiquities. — The Roman Wall, or Grabam^s Dike^ is al« 
moft the only antiquity we have in this parifh. It runs 4 
miles in it, and may ftill be traced through Gadder Wood. 
One of the watch towers, on the fouth fide of the wall, about 
a gun-lhot from Gadder kirk, is ftill very vifible.— At Rob- 
royftone, in this pariifay on the xith September 1303, Sir 
William Wallace was betrayed and apprehended, by Sir 
John Monteath, a favourite of King Edward I. of England, 
by whom he was moft unjuftly and ignominioufly put to

f This illiberal idea is refuted by fad. That igMfoiut cannot be the mo- 
ther of moraliiy^ more than of dtvUtoM^ is proTed by eiperience. The good be- 
haTiour of the lower ranks in Scotland, in general, contrafted with the immo- 
ralities, crimes, and annual executions, of many of the (ame ckfs, in the filler 
• kingdom, can be afcribed to nothing fo muth as to the fuperior advanuges, the 
former enjpy, of early education, and proper inflmdion, in the firft principles of 
moral axid and religious duty. Deprive them of thefe, and they will foon be-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1017199">MUTHIL</name> 

(Counfy of Terib'^TreJbyUry of Auchterarder'--Jlynod of 
Perth and Stirling.) 

By the Rev. Mr. John Scott, Minifter.</head>

<p>

Name^ Situation^ and Extetit. 

MUTHIL is fituated on iht borders of die Highlands ; 
and as the names of almoft all the places around are 
Gaelic, and generally defcriptive of their local fituation, it pro- 
b AI7 takes its name from an Erfe word, of fomewhat a fimi- 
lar found, which fignifies the north Jide of the hiiL — ^The pa« 
Tiih is of an irregular ihape, but one of the moft populous of 
the whole country ; and is of great extent, being from 8 to 10 
miles in length, and from 6 to 9 in breadth.— The viilage, 
where the iiri ftands, which gives its name to the parifli, is up- 
on the great military road, leading to Invemefs by Tay Bridge.* 
It is 4 miles fouth from Grief, 17 from Stirling, and nearly 
the fame diftance from Perth. Before the Reformation, it 
was the refidence of the Dean of Dumblane, and in after times, 
the feat of a prefbytery, which now meets at Auchterarder, 
being more in the center of the diftri£t» 

Soil,

Soit and Surface.'^n fo large a parilh, the furface, as maj 
naturallj be fuppofed, is made up of fiat and rifing gs^unds, 
of hills and valleys ; fo that the foil in one place, muft needs 
difier widelj from that in another. In the S. W. part of the 
parifh, there are many thoufand acres, at prefent thought un- 
fit for cuIt^^ation, being completely covered over with heath, 
or with deep mofs. For many miles, thehaughs on the Earn, 
and alfo on the Water of Allan, are; for the moft part, a light 
loam, on a gravelly or fandy bottom, which, with lime or 
marie, produces excellent crops. The higher grounds lie uponi 
bods of till, naturally wet, but, when drained, they are, by 
the above goentioned manures, rendered no lels produ&amp;ive. 

CuItivation*^-^Binct the year 1770, large marie fits have 
been difcovered in both fides of the parifii, and much lime has 
been ufed in agriculture. Almofl: every farmer lays down a 
field annually with grafs feeds, and finds his account in it. 
Lefs ground is oow plowed up, more cattle and horfes 
are reared, and four times the quantity of grain is pro* 
duced. The tenants are therefore in a thriving condition, 
and the peafantry, in .general, are induftrious, fober, and coOfi 
tented in their fiations. — Net only has much arable land bc^n 
meliorated, but what is ftill more worthy of notice, between 
1000 and X 200 acres (in their former ftate good for little)^ 
have, within tbefe laft 30 years, been ii^glofed and planted 
with trees of various kinds, that now ferve to adorn, and, ere 
Jong, will enrich the country ; by affording ufeful timber, 
befides fuel, at an eafy rate, to thoufands, who derive but 
little advantage from their moffes, and live at a great diftance 
£:om coal pits. 

Climate and Di/ea/es^i^^As the pariib abounds in wood, ai^d 
wood and water, the air is in general moiftj and many fitua^

tloof are damp ; jet, upon the whole, the people are tolerably 
healthy^ and live to a good old age. Manj, that are between 
60 ttid 70, work as day labourers ; numbers of others^ be- 
tween 70 and 80 years of age, are going about their ordinary 
bufinefs* A man died lately, ibme years above 90. The moft 
eommon difeafes are fevers, rheumatifms, and confumptions* 
At times, the meafles and hooping cough carry off many in- 
fants. But the fmall pox (formerly fo fatal to children), by 
the improved mode of treatment, deftroys very few. Ino- 
culation is now very common among all ranks ; and the pre- 
judices of the vulgar, againft this moft falutary operation, 
are at an end. The Commiffioners on the Annexed Eftatea 
paid a furgeon, for inoculating the children of the tenants 
and of the pfor. Same hundreds were inoculated at a time, 
and every one of them recovered. It muft give pleafure to 
add, that the prefent* proprietor of the Perth eftate continues 
to employ a ftirgeon, for the fame benevolent purpofe ; and 
alfo to attend the parents that are poor, when they ftand in 
need of medical affiftance. An example well worthy of 
imitation ! 

Birds and ^adrupeds. — There are in the parifli, plenty of 
partridges^ moorfowl and fnipes ; alfo a few heath cocks, or 
Uack cocks ; and, at particular feafons of the year, vaft num- 
bers of plovers, woodcocks, wild ducks, wild geefe and teals. 
—There are abundance of hares, rabbits, foxes, badgers and 
polecats, bred in the parifli. At this time, there are no wild 
deer % but as the horns of both the elke and foreft deer, of a 
very large fize, have of late been found in marie pits, on both 
fides of the parilh, and as the head and horns of the urus^ 
(the h9s ferus of Linnaeus), or mountaiii bull, were lately 
dug up at the fide of a fmall lake, near Drummond Caftle, it

plainlj fliewsy that foreft deer, and the other animals, now &amp; 
little knowut once frequented this part of the conntr j. 

Rivers an^/Fj^.— 'The river Em^ oxEarn^ flows from a beauti« 
ful lake, in a neighbouring pariih to the weftward, and glides 
along the north and eaft fide of the pariih, in a meandering 
courfe, formanj miles. It gives name to one of the moft beau- 
tiful vales in Scotland » called Stratbem, 

Befides the Ero, there are in this parifli the rivers, or wa- . 
ters, of Macbany, Knaick^ and Allan ; all of which abound 
with fine trouts, of a large fize. In fome parts of the Ern, 
there are pike ; and, in fomeTeafons of the year, great num« 
bers of fea trouts, from 31b. to 61b. weight. The fifliermen call 
them wbitlingSf on acc^unt of the. fcales thej have, at their 
firft coming up the river from the fea. Thej are reckoned 
an excellent fifli at the tables of the gentry ; and afford good 
fport to the angler with fly. Largt falmon are found in this 
river, as high as up Lochern, although there no lefs than 5 dikes, 
quite acrofs from bank to bank, at the diftance of fome miles 
from one another, with wooden traps in the middle, where 
the water runs deeped, for catching the falmon, and the 
larger fea trouts, in.their way up the river. Thefe traps are, 
or ought to be, taken up every week, from Saturday evening 
till Monday morning ; which are the only times thefe fiib can 
pafs through, unlefs the river is fo fullas to allow them to over- 
leap the dikes, which feldom happens during the fifiiing fea- 
fun. Below the dikes, near the junflion of the Ern and the 
Tay, there are falmon filbing places, which rent* at a high 
. price. 

Zaies, Roads, and Bridges. --^The lake above mentioned, is 
called the Zocb of Ballocb, and is the only one in the pariih.

property in the parifli $ Mr. Drummond of Perth being pro- 
prietor of more than two thirds of it. Three of them are con«

have done, in planting, inclofiogy ^ad otherwife improving, the

.Qhurckt &amp;c.-TTThe cburcb is. an old fabric, that has flood for 
Some centuries, and has often been repaired. It is faid to 
have been built by Ochiltree Biihop of Dumblane, before tbe 
Reformation : The precife year is not known. It has how- 
ever all the marks of antiquity : The roof is fupported by a 
double row of pillars, with aifles on each fide*, and there is a fquare 
fteeple at the weft end ; diredly oppofi^ to which^ there is in 
the eaft end a quire, which is a narrow building, W:ith a large 
Gothic wbdow. Neax to it, are ftill to be faen the veftigea 
pf three fteps up to the altar.— ^The manfe is a little out of the 
village and was rejiuilt about 9 or ip years ago. The glebe 
conlifts of 8 acres, and the ftipend is about xoo guineas*. — The 
patronage is in the jCrown, as coming in the rpom of the Bifbop 
of Dumblane. Befides ^he pariih church, there are other 
three places of worfliip, viz. a chapel of eafe, a church of 
ilBngland meeting houfe, and a Fopifli chapel. There ar« alfo 
the remains of a Roman catholic cl^urch at Strageath, and a 
chapel 2 miles to the Southward.

of tbe Eitiy nesir Iftnerpefiraj. Its dtmenfions caiinot now be 
afcertaitied with anj degree of exafttiefs ; the lines and ditches 
being completely levelled, except in a few places. But from 
what remains, it feemt Aot to hdvfe been ftronglj fortified, 
j^rom its fite, too, it appears to hare been onlj a temporary 
ftatton for a fmidl army. 

Tbe catnp at ilHocbf as being the ihcit complete of any in 
Scotland, of perhaps in Great Britain, is entitled to a more 
partxcnlar defcription. Its iituation gave it many advantages; 
being on the N. W. fide of a deep mofi, that rnns a long 
way eaftward. On the weft fide, it is partly defended by the 
fteep banks of the water of ELnaick ; which bank rifes per- 
peiidienlatly between 40 and 50 feet. The north and eaft 
fides were tttoft expofed ; and there, we find, rety particular 
care was taken to fecure them. The ground on the eaft is 
pretty regular, and defcends by a gentle flope from the lines 
of fbrtification, which, on that fide, confift of five rows o£ 
ditches, perfeftly entire, and running parallel to one another. 
Thefe altogether are about 5 5 yards in breadth. On xh6 
north fide there are an equal number of. lines and ditches, 
but 20 yards broader than the former. On the weft, befides 
the fteep precipices above mentioned, it was defended by at 
Itaft two ditches. One is ftill vifible ; the others have proba- 
bly been filled up, in making the great military road from 
Stirling to the North. 

The fide of the camp, lying to the fouthward, exhibits to 
the antiquary a lefs pleafing profpeft. Here the peafant's 
rugged habd has laid in ruins a great part of the lines ; 
fo that it may be with propriety laid, in the words of a La- 
fin poet, *• yam feges efi^ ubi TCrojafuit *." However, from 
the r^ains yet to be traced^ it appears there were alfo 3 or 

4 ditches, 



494 Statiflical AccBunt 

4 ditches, which, with its natural advantages, rendered this 
fide as ftrong and as fecure as any of the others. The 4 en- 
tries croffing the lines^ at right angles, ace ftill diftinfilj to be 
lieen. 

The area of the camp is an oUong of 140 jarjds, bj 125 
within the lines. The GeneraPs Quarter rifes above the level 
of the camp, but is not in the center. It is a regular fquare, 
each fide being exa&amp;lj ao yards. At prefeat, it exhibits evi- 
dent marks pi having been inclofed with a Hone waU, and 
contains the foundations of a houfe, 10 yards by 7. That 9 
place of worjihip has been erefked here, is not improbable^ 
as it has obtained the name of Chapel Hill from time imme* 
Xnorial. 

Befides the camp above mentioned, fo completely fortified 
both by nature and art, (and which is fuppofed to have beei^ 
formed by jigricda^ (ox the Roman Jegiops under his com- 
mand,) there are other two encampmei^s adjoining to it, and 
having a communication with one another, containing above 
Z30 acres of ground. Thefe feem to have beep defended by 
nly a ilngle ditch and rampart, and probably were intended 
for the cavillry and auxiliaries* Here was room for all the 
forces, that fought under Agricola near the Grampian moun- 
tains, notwith^nding what has beenfaid by Mr. Gordon, in 
his Itinerarium Septentrionale^ to the contrary ; who probably 
imagined, as others have done iince, that the whole ground at 
Ardoch, fortified by the Romans, lay within the fmall camp 
^bove mentioned. 

It has already been obferved, that the two large encampments 
had a communication with one another; and, that there was ^ 
fubterraneous paiTage from the fmall one, under the bed of 
the river, is more than probable, from a circumfiance now 
to be mentioned. There was a boie near the fide of the pra^ 
toriumf that went in a iloping direSion for many fathoms ;

let down a fecond time, was killed hjfoul air. No attempta 
have been made lince that time. The articles, above mention-* 
ed, lay at the houfe of Ardoch for many years, but were all 
carried off, by ibme of the foldiers in the Duke of Argyll's 
army, in 172 5, after the battle of Sheriftnuir, and could ne« 
ver afterwards be recovered. The mouth of the hole was 
covered up with a millllone, by an old gentleman, who lived 
at the houfe of Ardoch, while the family were in Ruflia, about 
the year 1720, to prevent bases :fiom running into it, when 
purfued by his dogs ; and as earth, to a confiderable depth, 
teas laid over the millftone, the place cannot now be found, 
although diligent fearch has been made for it« • , 

When the Ardoch Family returned to the country, the 
camp was u&amp;d as pafture ground for cattle ; and, by Sir Wil« 
liam Stirling, the preient proprietor, has been inclofed with a 
high ftone wall, that it may never again fuffer by a plough- 
share. He has alfb prohibited the tenants from plowing up, 
or otherwife demoliflung, any part of the remaining lines or 
ramparts round the two larger camps. He hai now an urn,

Origin of the Name. 

THE Gaelic is almoft the only langoage ufed ia thefe 
parifhes, and has been fo, as far back as tradition gses. 
The names of aU the places in them are evidently of Gaelic 
derivation^ and defcriptive of their fitnation^ or fome other 
property. Accordingly, Moy, in Gaelic, Maghj fignifies a 
meadow or plain, which is the nature of the place $ DaIarof« 
ile, or Dalferguffie, is Fergus's valley. The ancient name ia 
Starfach-na-gal^ i.e. the T[brefboldof the Gaeh^ or Highlanders^ 
being the pafs, by which the Highlanders entered to the Low 
Conntry, fo narrow between high mountains, that a few meo 
could defend it againft numbers. It was of great confequenca 
to the proprietor in thofe times, as he could make inroads in* 
to the Low Country, and eafily prevent any purfuit beyond

that pafs. He could likewife hinder anj of the neighbouring 
clans from paiBng this place without his confcnt. So fenlible 
were the/ of their dependence on him, upon this account, 
that thej agreed to paj him a certain tax, as often as he gave 
^hem. permifllon to take this road with their booty; which 
tax is ftill known by the name of Stuic^cbriacb^ i. #• the fteak 
or coUop of the booty, expreffive of the quality of this plunder, 
which was cattle. After the place was cleared of wood and 
cultivated, it obtained the prcfeot name of M^y. It came 
into the poffeiBon of William, the 7th Laird of Mackintolh, in 
the year 1336, and was conveyed to him by David Bifhop of 
of Murray* The Laird of Mackintofh, who is undoubted 
chief of that clan, is likewife captain of Clan Chattan* The 
Clan Chattan confided of 16 tribes, each having their own 
chieftain, ,but all voluntarily united under the government of 
one leader, of whom the prefent Laird of Mackintoih is the 
reprefentative. 

Extent and Surface. — The greateft length of the parift, 
from S. W. to N« £., is about 3Q miles, and the mean breadth 
about 5 miles. This country is bleak and barren, rugged and 
mountainous, except (mall flripes and fpots on each fide of 
the river Fiadbom, to be afterwards defcribed. 

Climate and Dt/ia/es,'*JThe climate is much colder here 
than in the neighbouring parifhes, which is fuppofed to be oc« 
cafioned by the great height of the mountains. Vegetation 
is accordingly later, than in the places that lie nearer the Mur- 
ray Frith ; and the crops, in cold feafons, are liable to fuffer 
by the latenefs of the harveft* The fnow genef^y begins 
to fall about the middle of November, and frequently con- 
tinues until March or April. In the year 1782, the froft and 
fnow overtook the crops of grain almoft before any of them were 

ripe 5 



of Moy and Dalarqffie. 501 

ripe ; and tbej lay buried under the Ihow till February xySj. 
Though every poiTible exertion was made to recover them, 
yet very little was obtained. The people were in the moil 
miierable condition for provifions 1 obliged to purchafe them 
at a great diftance, and at fuch a high price, that many fa* 
milies were put on very ihort allowance. Many were reduced 
to extreme indigence, from which they have hot yet recover, 
ed. — ^But notwithftanding the coldnefs of the climate, the in. 
habitants are as healthy, if not more fo, than their neigh. 
hours. They are not liable to any peculiar local difeafes, and 
many of them live to a very great age* T^vio perfons died 
laft fpring at the age of 93 ; and there are feveral at pr^fent 
in the parifli near 90 years of age, who enjoy their ftrength 
and faculties, Hery little impaired for that advanced age« 

Sail and Produce. — The cultivated ground in the pari(k 
bears but a very (mail proportion to that which is lying wafte, 
perhaps not above a 15th part. But the foil, of what is cuU 
tivated, is, for the moft part, of a very good quality, and, in 
favourable feafons, produces plentiful crops. The grain 
raifed here is chiefly black oats« Some Scotch barley and rye 
are likewile raifed. All the tenants and their cottagers plant 
potatoes, which ordinarily thrive remarkably well, and make 
a confiderable part of their maintenance. In favourable 
years, die produce is nearly equal to the confumptiim of the 
pariih; but, in unfavourable feafons, when the crops fail, they 
are under a neceffity of procuring confiderable quantities of 
grain from other places. The quantity of grain, necefiary for 
the fupport of the inhabitants, would require to be much 
greater, were it not that the numbers of cattle and iheep, kepC 
in the pariih, furnifli them with flefli and milk in aid of other 
provifions.

joi Statifiical Account 

Mode of CuItivation0^J2xm\ng is carried on almoft in the 
fiioie method at prefimt, that was in ufe for ages paft ; yerj 
few improveinents have heen introdnced, nor do the people 
feem difpofed to adopt any* Infiead of laying the whole dung 
of the farm on the barley land, according to the general cuftoai 
in other places, it is all laid here on the ley land, which they 
break op for oats ; excepting a fmall part of it, which is re- 
ierved for the litde barley that is fown, and the potatoes. 

Phugbs^ Catikt Mc. — On account of the Ihortnels of the 
labouring fieafon, the number of ploughs in the pariih, is much 
greater then the quantity of land would otherwife require. 
They are not fewer than 146, and chiefly drawn by 4 horfes 
each, and fometimes there are two oxen along^with the horfes* 
Tbe number of horfes in this parifli is about 900 ; the num* 
ber of black cattle 1,800 ; and of fheep ia,ooo. There is a 
confiderable number of each of thefe kinds of cattle fold an* 
Dually, with the price of which the tenants pay their rents, 
and provide for themCelves all the articles that their fiirms do 
not furnifh. — The iheep, upon the large (heep farms, are of 
the black faced kind ; but thofe, kept by the tenants, are a 
crofs breed, between the large black faced, and the (maU 
Iheep, formerly kept in the country. The wool of the large 
Iheep is of a coarfer quality, than that of the fmall ; the wool 
of the latter fells from x6s to i8s. per ftohe, Dutch weight. 

Wild Animals^ Sird/j iSc. — Foxes are very numerous overall 
this country, and very deftruftive to the iheep and poultry. Of 
late years, a {ox*hunter has been hired by the neighbourhood 
'to deftroy them. The pariih abounds in polecats, otters, and 
badgers. The red deer are very numerous about the fource 
of the Findhom. The woods in Moy abound with roea. 
Black game and groufe are fo plentiful in this pariih, that

wild docks neftle in the ifland in the l^ke of Moj» On a 
high rock, above the river Findhom, an eagle has for manj 
years built her neft* 

^oo&amp;.«— There is a good deal of natural wood on the banks 
tf the river FindhorUi chiefly birch and alders. There is a 
tradition, that before this country came into the pofleifion of 
Af ackinto(hy it was in a great meafure over«run with wood» 
«nd called the Foreft of Strathdeam ; that it was fet on fire 
tiirough careleflnefs, and deftroyed by the inhabitants, when 
they began to clear the ground for cultivation. — ^The Laird of 
Mackintoih has very confiderable plantations of Scotch firs 
mixed with foreft trees \ to which he is mddng additions an- 
nually. Thefe plantations are in a thriving way, and in a fliort 
fpace of time, will decorate the country, and be of very gretft 
Jbrvice to the inhabitants. 

JRrv/Ti.— -The river Findhora takes its rife, in the hills of 
this parifii, from a few inconfiderable fprings, the principal 
.one of which iflues, in a copious ftream, from what is called 
the ChviU Stonif a large rock with a fiflure in it. The di« 
reAion of this river is nearly from S. W. to N. £. After 
running for the courfe of 24 miles through this pariih, it 
pafles through thofe of Calder, Ardclach, Edenkeillie, Dyke 
.and Forres, and falls into the Murray Frith at Findhom, in 
the pariih of Kinlofs. The whole courfe of it, from its fource 
to the fea, is about 50 miles. It is called, in Engliih, FimU 
hom^ from the place at which it enters the (ea ; but the Gae- 
lic name of it is Uifg^tam. From thence this pariih, through 
which it runs for the (pace of 24 miles, is called Strathdeam. 
As this river runs, for all this courfe, between high moun- 
tains, and receives many ftreai^s or rivulets in its progrefst

sad the people at a dtftaace from the liri^e« having firequent 
occafioD to crob the river, often attempt to ford it in an im* 
proper ftate, bj which manj lires are loft. Thb river

Ions dnt have frequent ^tau or floods, that cnaMe the

when the river is low. There are a number of leffer 
flreams and rivnlets in the parilh, but none of them of ftck 
importance as to deferve particular notice* 

Lakt^ Ifiani^ \3c, — The Lake of Moj is the onlj eonfider* 
able one in this pariflu B7 an sAual meafurement of it, taken 
on the ice, its greateft length is i{, and the greatcft breadth 
} of a mile. This lake aboimds wiA tharr (commonlj caB* 
ed red wanui)^ and a great varietj of other trouts, of differ- 
ent fises and colours. About the middle of the lake there ia 
an iflaodt confifting of about % acres of ground* It lies N. 
and S., and is nearly the fliape of a violin. At the fbnth end 
•of the iilandi there are the remains of a honfe, containing 4 
fire rooms, where the Lairds of Mackintofli refided in times of 
trouble. Bj an infcription above the gate, it is faid to haw 
been bnilt in the jear 1665, by Lauchlan the aoth Laird of 
Mackintofli. Adjoining to the houfe, there is a garden, plant- 
ed with fruit trees and currant buflies. It appears, by 
the ruins ftill remaining, that there have formerly been very 
-extenfive buildings in this ifland. The remains of a ftreet, 
the whole length of the ifland, with the foundations of houfes^ 
en each fide, are ftill very vifibk ; and in the year 1760, two 
ovens were discovered, each capable to contain 4 bofliels of 

meal

meal made into bread. In the year 1422, it contained a gar- 
rifon of 400 men. In thofe troublefome times, when it was 
neceflary to live either in fortified or inacceflible places, the 
Lairds of Mackintofli refided here conflantlj, except in the 
winter feafons* At the diftance of fome hundred jards froon 
this, there is an artificial iflaod formed, bj heaping a parcel 
of large round flones upon each other. This place was ufed 
for the confinement of malefa&amp;ors, before the abolition of the 
jurifdi&amp;ion power, which was vefted in the hands of the 
chiefs. When the lake was low, the criminal could fcarce 
Hand wixh dry feet j but after rainp, th^ water rofe to his 
middle. Luckily, however, for the piifoner, in 24 hours he 
was either acquitted or condemned. This place is called 
EUaa^na^glacbf i. c. the Stoney JJkmd. 

Mineral J^^f//.— At the north end of the lake, there, is a 
wen of mineral water, which ii accounted ferviceable for 
headachs, and diforders of the ftomach. There is no account 
of its being analyfed, fo as to have its qualities afcertained ; 
but it appears to be of the chalybeate kind. 

Pofulation. — ^The parifli regifter having been deftroyed a 
few years ago, by an accidental fire, a lift of baptifms and 
marriages cannot now be made out ; nor can the population 
be aicertained in that way. The following is the refult of a 
late enumeration, taken for the purpofe of this ilatement : 
The deaths are not recorded in this, or the neighbouring 
pariflies, and therefore cannot be afcertained*

Ecckjiajltcal ^to/^— This is an united parifli, as alreadj ob» 
ferved» made up of the original parifhes of Moj and Dalarof- 
fie. There is no account, written or traditional, when the 
annexation took place ; yet, in many refpefts, the pariflies are 
diftind and feparate, though under the charge of one minifter. 
There is fttU a church kept up in each, in which divine fer* 
vice is performed alternately. Tbefe churches are 9 miles dis- 
tant from each other : the road is at all times rough, and in 
the ftormy feafon, frequently impaflable. The church of 
Moy was built in the year 1765, and is ftill in good repair. 
The church of Dalaroilie was rebuilt in the year X790« Mr« 
Rofe of Kilravock is accounted patron, and has hitherto al- 
ways prefented to it— The ftipend is 69L 14s. 2d., with a 
fmall glebe in each parifli. The manle was built in the year 
Z765, and has lately received fome reparation, which has 
made it tolerably comfortable.— All the inhabitants of this 
|)ari£h are of the Eftabliihed Church, except a few indivi- 
duals, who are of the Epifcopal Communion, but commonly 
attend divine fervice in the pariib church. 

Schools. — ^There is a parochial fchoel eftaUiOied in this psu 
rifli. The fchool-houfe was rebuilt in 1784, in a pretty fuf* 
ficient manner. The falary is looL Scotch. The fchooU 
mafler is ordinarily feflHon-derk, by which he makes about 
al. IDS. Sterling annually. The fchool fees are, is. for reading 
and writing, zs. 6d. for arithmetic, and as. for Latin. All thefe 
emoluments put together, will make about aol. Sterling in 
the year. The poor are much inclined to give a little edu- 
cation to their children ; but fo extenfive is the parifli, that a 
very inconfiderable part of them only can be accommodated 
by the parochial fchool. 



tf Moy arid l}alaroJf%e. 509 

l^oor. — ^There are a nomber of poor people in this parifli;1at 
noft of them do foniething in the way of providing for their 
own maintenance, and receive what aid can be given them 
from the pariih funds. Thefe funds are very inconfiderabk, 
being onlj the weekly colleAions, which do not exceed 4!. or 
5h Sterling in the year. Such as are altogether incapable of 
labouring are relieved by the neighbourhood : But as the 
prafiice of common begging is not reftrained, many of them 
betake chemfelves to that method of obtainmg fupport. 

Roads and Bridges, — The road from Invernefs to Perth 
pafles through this pariQi. It was made, and is flill kept in 
repair, by Government. Befides a large and ufeful bridge on 
the river Findhorn, there is a number of fmaller ones on 
this road, within the parifh, which were built and kept in re- 
pair at the public ezpence. There are roads of communica- 
tion betwixt the different parts of the parifh, now forming by the 
ftatute labour ; but there is fo much to be done in that way^ 
that it will take a confiderable time before thefe roads can 
be completed. 

Inns and ^Moir/}/.— There are in this pariih 2 inns, on the 
public road, and about 12 fmall public houfes that fell whi&amp;y. 
The whiiky houfes are exceedingly detrimental to the morals 
of the people, as they are fo many temptations, in every dif- 
ferent part of the patifli, to idlenefs, quarrelling, and man/ 
other vices. — ^It is fuppofed, that the coldnefs of the climate 
renders the ufe of fpirits more ne;eflkry than in milder iicu« 
ations ; but whatever may be in that, it is much to be regret- 
ted, that, ijiftead of making that moderate ufe of fpirits, moft 
of the people, that refort to thefe fmall public houfes, feldom 
depart without going to excefs.

Origin of the ITafne. 

THE ancient «ad modern name of the pariih is Lefly ; 
the etjmologj of which is uncertain* There is a tra« 
dition, that one Bartbokmew ie Lejlyn^ a noble Hungarian, 
came to Scotland with Qneen Margaret, about the jear 1067 ; 
that he was a Ion of Walter ie Lejlyn^ who bad taken his 
firoame from the cafile of Lefljn in Hungary, where be was 
bom ; and that he^ or foqae of fais d«fceada»ts, having ob- 
tained a grant of certaio lands in Garioch, called them bj his 
own name. It is certain, that the family of Rothes were 
long proprietors of a confiderable part of the pariih of Leflie*, 
and other lands in Garioch, and it is not igiprobable that 
^he pariih derives its appellation from them* A charter was 
granted hy James U. to George, defigned B^mma it Lejly^

privilege of a weekly market on Thurfday, and a yearly fair 
at Michaelmas. Both thefe, however, have long ago beeo 
difoontinued* 

Situattonj Extent^ Surface^ Soil and ' Climate.^^This pariih 
is fituated in the weft part of that diftrift of Aberdeenlhire 
called Garioch. Its length from E. to W. is about 2 com- 
puted miles, and its breadth nearly the fame. The general 
appearance of the parifh is rather hilly ; but thefe little hills 
are capable of being cultivated almoft to their fummits. The 
Water of Gadie, (o fwcetly celebrated by Arthur Johnfton, in 
his elegant Latin poems, runs through the parilh, from W. 
to E« and divides it almoft into two equal parts. It^ is here 
but an inconiiderable rivulet, but abounds with fmall trout. 
The foil of the lower grounds, on the fouth fide of the water^ 
IS a deep, flrong, rich mould, on a clayey bottom ; and pro- 
duces good crops of bear and oats, with very inSifferent cul- 
ture. The lands on tlie north fide, are a light loamy foil, oa 
a bed of rock or gravel, and though they do not yield fuch 
weighty crops, are earlier than thofe on the fouth fide of the 
pari(h. The air is reckoned falubrious, though rather moift : 
and the feafons are fbmewhat later than in the lower end of 
the Garioch. 

Produce^ Cultivation, Wr.— The chief produftions are oats» 
bear, a few acres of peafe, turnips, potatoes, and a little hay. 
The fpirit of improvement has not yet reached this diflri^, 
or at leaft in a very partial degree ; and the mode of cultiva- 
tion generally adopted is wretchedly bad. The fame method 
of tillage, and cropping the ground, ftlll prevails, which was 
pradifed perhaps 200 years ago. With the advantage of an 
excellent foil, a tolerable climate, and rents by no means ex- 

travigant 



ofLtJly, ^ sn, 



travagamtt the farmer toils on from day to' daj^ harrafles and 
perplexes himfelf, and^ after all, with diflBculty procures the 
ncccflarles of life for hitnfelf and family. Though inftances of 
improvement daily occur, and the benefits refulting from 
thence are obvious, an obQinate attachment to old eftabliftied 
pra&amp;ices too much prevails, and neither precept nor example will 
induce them to alter their plan. What is called infieU is conftan tly 
kept in tillage. The rotation of crops, is, bear, with dung ; then 
two crops of oats, and then the land is dunged again for bear.- 
The dung is laid upon the ftubble during winter, where it 
lies in fmall heaps, expofed to all the inclemency of the feafon^ 
till the oat feed is finiihed. The dung is then fpread, and 
the ground gets a kind of ribbing, and diredly after that the 
feed furrow. The outfields, or faugbs carry 4 crops of oata 
without any dung, and then lie 5 or 6 years in piiftim^ except 
the park on which the cattle are folded upon dtitltg fiimmer, which 
carries5 crops of oats. Some of the faughs are fown with afpe* 
ciea of black bearded oats, which will require 2 and fometime^ 
3 bolls, to yield i boll of meal.-^A^very few of t)ie tenants are 
indeed beginning to adopt a better method of tMnagement. 
They fow a few turnips, and fome rye-grstfs and clover. But 
their great didance from lime and other manures, together 
with the badnefs of the roads and the fcar^ity of money, mud 
render their ptogtels in improvements buft floW.-^Notwith* 
ftandis^ thisr wreidied method of cultivation, the parifli can 
fjiare annually, at an average, about 700 bolls of ineal, and 
200 bolls of bear ; a clear evidence of the goodnefs of the 
foil. An early fpecies of oats has been lately introduced, 
which are likely to be of great benefit. They are a fortnight 
earlier, than the common oats, and produce fully as much 
meal. They are called the Peebles, or Lord ChUf Banm^t mtts^ 
and were firit imported into this country in the year 1783.

Poor. — B^fides the poor upon the rolK who receive public 
charity, a few others get occafional fupplies. None belong* 
ing to the parilh are permitted to beg. This however does 
npr prevent a number of vagrants, from other places, ftroU* 
ing abQUt and extorting alms from the inhabitants, aod often 
pilfering what they can lay their hands upou. The funds be* 
longing tb the poor, above ftated, are lent out at intereft. The 
greateft part of it was mortified bj Mr. William Watfon, and 
Mr. William Forbes, both miniflers of Lefly. In the year 
178a, very little encroachment was made upon the capital 
belonging to the poor ; for though they were pretty numer- 
ous, and proviiions vtrj dear, yet they were liberally fup- 
plied ; the Rev, Mr. Stewart having generoufly lent money to 
the kirk^feflion, without intereft, for purchafing meal to the 
poor fort qf inhabitants, which was fold out at a reduced 
price i ^nd to thofe wl^o coul^ not 9#brd to piirchafe, it w^s

h^€t^.^^hit moft common dKeaies are feven, of the flow 
nerirous kind \ thefe are not often fatal. Sometimes inflamma« 
tory ferers, attended with putrid fymptomst appear, which 
are generally veiy dangerous. Many are likewife fuhjeA to 
rheumatic complaints, and a fcrophulous taint of the blood feema 
to perrade a pretty large proportion, of the inhabitants of this 
and die neighbouring diftrifts, owing perhaps to the poor low. 
diet they ufe, «id the cold damp huts they inhabit. 

TueL — ^The fuel here ufed is peat and turf; neither of 
them good in their kind. This fuel, from the time and la- 
bour it requires, in the heft part of the fummer^ may be reck* 
oned expenfive in the mod favourable feafons, and has al- 
ways been found to retard the improvement of every country, 
and the advancement of manufafiures, efpecially where manure 
mud be brought from a diftance. Could coals from New- 
caftle or Sunderland be got during fummer, at a moderate 
price, the advantage to this diftrift would be confiderable* 
The expeoce of freight and charges of importation muft al- 
ways affeft this part of Scotland : But were the heavy duty 
on coals removed, the revenue of the kingdom, would foon re- 
ceive, from the increafing population and profperity of the 
people^ much more than it ever can derive from a tax, which 
is one of the greateft obftacles to their advancement. 

Minerals. — ^In fcveral places, on the fouth fide of the parifh, 
there is a kind of jafper, or amyanthus, found. It has a 
greenifh kind of tinge, with grey ftreaks inteifperfed. The 
country people make fnuff boxes and other trinkets of it ; 
bnt no quarries have been opened, nor blocks of any fize 
wrought.

5i8 . Statifiical Account ^ 

Antiquities^ t/r«— With regard to antiquitieSy this puifli has 
little to boaft . The remains of two Draidicjal temples ftill appear, 
but neither of them are very entire.— -At the head of the Den 
of ChapletowDy on the eaft fide of the road, leading from 
Leilj to Alford, there is a place called the Four Lards^ Seat^ or 
Zittle yobn^s length* It is a (mall circular, artificial hollow, 
about 5 feet diameter, and 3 or 4 feet deep. Tradition reports 
that four different proprietors met at that place, and dined to- 
gether, each of them fitting upon his own ground. The four 
proprietors are (aid to have been, the Lord of Leilj, Lord 
Glammifs) the proprietor of Putachie, and the Blihop of Aber- 
deen* A little to the fouthweft of this place, there are fome 
veiliges of an encampment, in feveral places, the foilee is very 
difiinct, and in others almoft quite filled up. A little to the 
Weil of this encampment, there are a good manj cairns or 
tumuli. One in particular, larger than the reft, is called coek^s 
cairn. None of them have been opened* There is a tradition, 
that a battle was fought here, but whe;i, or bj whom, is quite 
uncertain.

is none of the leaft confiderable. Thither the fuperflous pro- 
dace of the lands muft be carried, through roads ezecrablj baiL 
The diftance from lime, too, fo neceflarj to the farmer, is 
another gre^t obftacle to improvement* The fcarci^ of fer* 
vants, and the high wages they now demand, are alfo grier^ 
ances, but by no means peculiar to this parifh*. In a word, rent, 
the price of labour, and every article neceflary to a farm 
is greatly railed to the hufbapdman, while the value of the 
produce of his fields continues pretty much the fame. Cattle 
is the only ftock whofe value is increafed ; but this parifli 
does not regr many. 

Propofed Improvements, — All thefe dlfadvantages, however, 
might in a great meafure be overcome, by granting longer 
leafes to the tenants ; by releafing them from thirlage to mills, 
and fervices of every kind ; by ailifting them to build better 
houfes ; by encouraging induftry and improvements of every 
kind ; and, above all, by attending more to the ftate of the 
public roads. The inhabitants perform the flatute work up- 
on the highways ; but good roads will never be made by 
ftatute labour, at leaft in the manner, in which^it is condufted 
in this diftriA. It difirefles the people, but is of no advantage 
to the public. A patriotic zeal, for improving the roads, 

feems, 

* About %Q yean ago, tfce wages of a common male farm feryant were about 
Sl. per amium ; none are now to be got under 61. At that period, the beib 
Ihearer, in harveft, got il. ; the common wages n^w are 2I. A day labourer then 
earned 4d. a day ; now irom 6d. to 8d., befides viduali:. Should fervants 
wages continue to increafe, for a few years, in the fame proportion as they 
have done fince 1^83, the conferences muft be, either the rent of land 
muft fall, or the tcoaat become bankrupt, and the Uads be turned into

Name^ Esteniy and Jppearahce. 

ETYMOLOGY of names is generally matter of conjeaure. 
Hawick may be derived from the Celtic, £a, a manfion, and 
wiV, the crook or conflux of rivers ; or from the Saxon, haf^ 
the fame with our halved^ and wrVi, a common termination 
for a village, fuppofed to be formed from the Latin vica. To 
either of thefe derivations its iltuation agrees ; as the river 
Teviot waflies tlie fide of it towards the north, and thefmaller 
river, Slitridge^ divides ft nearly into two equal parts.— The 
parifli is of confiderable extent, being about 15 niiles long 
from W. to E. and 4^ broad. The general appearance is hilly : 
None of the hiljs, however, are of any remarkable fize ; they 
are moftly green, and afford excellent padure for Iheep.

die town, and at the different fiirms. There is alfo marie in 
different parts of the parifh, which is ufed fuccefsfulj onjand 
in pafture, as well as in tillage. Its tSkOis have not been tried, 
upon land appropriated to the breeding of iheep ; fome imsc*

value, and cbiefij attended to, is the flieep : Bj far the great-

number may be about 8ooo« Thej are of the long white 
faced kind, which bears the (hort clothing wool, fomewhat 
inferior in fixe, as well as in fineneCs of wool, to the iheep of the 
Cheviot Hills. Having been thoughttdefedive in fhape, from 
the lightnefs of the fore quarter, about 20 years ago an at« 
tempc was made to improve it, by means of rams of a breed 
highly efteemed in England. The experiment was repeated^ 
until it was found, that the quality of the wool was thereby 
deteriorated. Judicious farmers now ftudy to improve the 
Uiape of the breed, by feleding the beft lambs of both fexes 
for breeding, without introducing a foreign mixture ; and to 
enlarge the fize and render the wool finer, by increafing the 
Ihelter upon their farms, by affording their flocks plenty of 
food, and by rendering their paflure fweeter and better. For 
this laft purpofe, keeping a lefs flock, and draining of boggy 
or mariby land, are reckoned of great fervice, and attended to 
by good managers. Turnips and broad clover have not been 
given to {heep, in this pariih, except for fattening them ; aU 
though this praftice prevails much in other parts of the coun- 
ty of Roxburgh. But rye^grafs is efteemed a good fpriog^ 
Ibod, where the fituation of a farm admits of its being raifed 
in «biindance. In fmearin^, a much greater proportion of 
butter is ufed than fotmerly ; but the total difufe of tar has.

be attributed to climate ; but in fome mcafure to a pradice

as thej formerly held. This charter is confirmed by another, 
granted by Queen Mary in May 1545.— In confeqnence of thefe 
charters, the burgeffes AtSt their own magiftrated annually. 
There id a ftanding council ; in eonjundion with which, the 
magiftrates manage the town^s Affairs. The whole coniifU of

viz. weavers, tailors, hammermen, fkinners, flefliers, flioemakers, 
and baktets. A treafurer and filrveyor of weights, meafures 
and markets, are annually chofen by th6 council. The clerk 
is ele&amp;ed by the burgeftes at large, and generally continues in 
office during life* The magiftrates receive r^fignations and 
grant infeftments in the town. The fafines are recorded in 
the general or particular regifter for fafines, as they have not, 
like royal burghs, a record for the town*s fafines. They ex- 
pede fervices, cognofce heirs, ftnd pronounce decreets in civil

Previous to this divifion, the cattle belonging to the bur*

and what is exaAed for pafturing the burgefies cattle, now

manufadured laft year, was about 220 packs* of laid and white

yet attempted is common linen tapes and twifts. In thefe 
two articles, there are annually confumed xo tons of linen

price of flax is moderate, the whole of it. The number of 
people employed in fpinning the flax cannot be afcertaiued^ a 
confiderable quantity being fent to diftant villages, at a time, 
to a perfon appointed to give it out in fmall quantities. The 
other people employed may amount to 6^^ This manufadure^ 
which is yet in its infancy, was likewife aided for a few years,

Soil^ CuUSvatum^ \3c. — The foil is various ; light and fimdy 
towards the hill fides ; the infield generallj a loam, eafil^ cul- 
Civated, being neither wet nor too drj. Were the climate 
as favourable as the foil, the ground would produce any fort 
of crop common in Scotland ; but the frequent changes of 
the weather, aiid the frofts, prove very unfaVob^Ue to green 
crops ; excepting turnips and potatoes, which thrive well, 
when the ground is duly prepared. It muftbcadmowledgedi 
that improvements iii sfgriculture and * hu(bandxy are, here, 
only in their infancy. Mod of the greater farmers, however, 
begin to have a few acres in turnips and fown grafs ; but very 
little in fallow, and no wheat, which ifrould be but an uncer- 
tain crop, by reafon of the latenefs of the feafons, the fpiln^ 
and autumnal frofts, and fubfcqu^nt raids : Neither are the 
farmers, at prefent, in a condition to enter iifto regular rota:, 
tions; ad, befided other rtafons, their poffeffions are not of the 
proper fize, and only upon ihort leafes, which are a certain ba^ * 
to kll improvements.-^Some ftone inclofures have beetl made 
of late ; and feveral plantations of wood have been begun up« 
on the Knockefpock eftate. The firft Carts were introduced 
only in 1760, by the miniiler ^nd another xefidenter. They

ftre now become general all over the parifh ; only the horfes are 
ilill of too fmall fize to render carts as ufeful as they might 
be. In good feafons, the parlih has been found to produce 
more grain than fupports the inhabitants; but lince 1781, 
the crops have often proved fhort ; and had it not been for the 
money received, by the fale of black cattle to the fouth coun« 
try dealers, the tenants could not have regularly paid' their 
rents--*A branch of the docking manufaAare, from Aber- 
deen, employs feveral of the women fervants \ but it is too in** 
coniiderable to be much depended upon.-^Although fome of the 

. farmers are getting into a better form of ploughs and farming 
uten^ls, yet the old methods are ilill followed by feveral. 
Dung, . mixed into a fort of compoii with common earth, or 
feal from pafture ground, is ftill the common manure, al- 
though the ground agrees perfe£Uy well with lime, which 
is to be had, at the didance of 10 computed miles, by an ex- 
ceeding bad road; and very little attention is paid towards mak« 
ing it better. There are only 3 or 4 tenants, who have at- 
tempted fallowing or watering ; though fuch trials, as have 
been made, have anfwered well. In particular, a fummer fal- 
low of exbaujled outfield land^ with the addition of a little lime, 
has produced excellent crops of barley and grafs, which be- 
fore afforded neither. The faft is, little can, or will be done, 

^ in the improving line, till the heritors or landlords take the 

lead, and encourage their tenants, either by premiums, or long 

leafes ; by aboliihing fervitudts, and mill multures *, which

ViUagef Marfits^ iif — It appeartt from yarioos decdst that 
|fae town and Tillage of Clatt was ercAcd into a Imrgh of bai. 
rony, with power to hold weekly and annual markets $• Ac- 
cordingly, the late Colonel Harrt G#aiov of Knockefpock, 
heritable proprietor of the laid burgh of barony, and markets 
thereto belongings being determined to give all proper en- 
couragement to the biA weekly markets and fairs, made pulw 
lie intimation, in the Edinburgh and Aberdeen newfpapers, 
of his intention to improve the burgh, and revive and improve 
the markets ; and in the ihort intervals, in which he was per- 
mitted to vifit his eftate here, he began to build better farxa 
houfes ; to form plans for improving and inclofing the grounds; 
of raifing flax, and introducing the linen manufadure, &amp;c. 
But, being foon after called abroad, Vm government fervice in 
the Weft Indies, about the year 1784, his public fpirited de- 
figns were interrupted, and have not been refumed iince, as 
the Colonel died about three years afterwards. By this fatal 
event, Government loft an excellent officer, and experienced 
engineer ; and bis tenants a good mafter, who wiihed to fee

from the high couotrj, down through Glenlivety CaWrach, 
Rhynie^ Sec. towards Aberdeen ; which laft paffes within a 
few paces of the village of Qatt. The great fouth road, 
leading dire&amp;lj north from the Caimie Mounts pafles through 
the town itfelf, and the whole breadth of the pariih. It was 
marde by the military about 25 years ago, and is kept, here, in 
tolerabk repair. This road is fljorter by many miles, than that 
leading by Aberdeen. A proper inn ercfted in the village of 
Glatt, (as was intended by the late Colonel Gordon), would 
render this a moft convenient fiage for travellers, either to 
the fouth or to the north ; and the road being once frequented, 
would contribute quickly to the improvement of the village. 
A fpirited and tnterprifing heritor, by availing bimfelf of 
tbefe, and fome other local advantages, and by circulating a 
little money to begin adventurers in the mercantile and mann« 
faAuring lines, might, through time, be repaid with large * 
increafe ; and, at the fame time, give employment, and a de- 
cent livelihood, to many, who, for want of fuch encourage., 
ment, drudge on through life, burdened with a family, upon 
a few ridges of land, which can hardly afford them either fub- 
fidence, or opportunity of exertion. The great and popular 
objedions, againft attempts of this fort, are, the diflance front 
the county town, or any proper fea port and harbour^ fcarcity 
of fuel^ danger of engrof&amp;ng the working fervants, and with- 
drawing the hands neceffiiry for agriculture, &amp;c. But all 
thefe, in the prefent cafe, might be obviated by a prudent 
economy ; particularly, by introducing a better breed andfize 
of horfes for the carts ; keeping the roads in due repair, by a 
proper application of the ftatute work ; and giving good en- 
couragement to dealers and merchants to fettle in the village, 
and to frequent the fairs and markets. As to want of fuel, 
that complamt would foon ceaie, if the unreafonable coafting

duty ttfam eoalt were taken off, or commuted. And as for 
want of bonds for agriculture, the obvious remedy is, to 
proportion the firms to a proper fize« and to work them, 
either with two-horfe ploughs, or with oxen in hamefs ; ei« 
ther of which would perform double the quantitj of work, 
in the fame time, and to much better purpofe. 

Heritors and Rent, — There are only two heritors, KnockeCr 
pock and Towie, neiiher of whom refide. The eftate of 
Knockefpock comprehends about three fourths of the parifii. 
Of late, that family have refided in the pariih a confiderable 
part of the year, and their fervants are conftantly here. The 
valued rent of this par'fh, as ftated in the cefs books, is 
12751. 48. 4d« Scotch. The grofs rent may be eftimated about 
600L Sterling. The tenants and pofTeiTors of the ground pa^

Chursb^ (/r.-»The fabric of the church had a thorough re« 
pair in 1779; and, with regular feats, would be a decent 
place of worlhip ; but the old clumfy feats being ftill retained, 
diffigures the look of it, and affords lefs convenient accommo- 
dation for the hearers *• The manfe was built about 1725. 
Both manfe and offices have undergone feveral partial repairs, 
and at prefent ftand greatly in need of more. The ilipend is 
500 merks Scotch^ in money, with i61. Scotch for communion 
elements ; 42 bolls iridual of meal and bear ^ fome fervices of 
plowing, and leading turf for fuel ; a garden, and a glebe, not

of feme note, and of Ycry old date. When the feats were removed at laft ro* 
paration, there appeared, on the back wall, and at the end, a neat ublet of 
frecftene, about 3 feet fqoare, with fide colamns and a cornice. In the middle,

as appesurs bj a decreet of locality, dated Jane 1650, and is 
now become very inadequate to the prefent rate and mode of 
living, when the value of money is fo much diminilhed, and 
the price of neceflaries fo much raifed and taxed. In 1760, 
when the prefent incumbent fettled, he had his firft man*(er- 
vant at al. 6s. 8d. Sterling, wages for the year ; at prefent, 
he cannot have one, for the fame office, under fix guineas. 
It is the fame with refpeft to prov-iions, furniture, apparel, 
t^. Almoft every article is tripled in value. 

J£oo/«— There is a parochial fchool, and qualified teacher, 
whofe falary is 6 bolls of meal, coUe&amp;ed in fmall quantities 
from the inhabitants ; befides aol. Scotch, as feffion clerk, 
with the ordinary perquifites for baptifms and marriages j and 
which altogether, with fcholars fees, will not exceed zxl. 
Sterling a year. As this is much about the common rate of 
fchoolmafter's livings through great part of this country, it 
certainly calls for the interference of the Legiflatnre, to make 
fpme more competent and decent provifion for fuch an ufeful 
clafs of men, upon whom the morals and profperity of So- 
ciety, as well as of individuals, fo greatly depends.

ri(h; althongh, Ijing along fo many bighwajs, the place is 
ezceedinglj peftered witb beggars and vagrants, from tbe 
Highlands and more northern diilrifts; as well as withyar^^rx 
and fupplicants from tbe foatb, many of whom are great im* 
poftors. It is nmch to be wifbed, that fome regulations were 
fet on foot for rendering fuch perfons better members of fo^ 
ciety ; or at lead restraining them from becoming fuch bur- 
dens on the public, and intercepting, and often extorting, by 
threats and force, what might be very properly bellowed Tip- 
on real objeds of charity. There are feveral indigent and 
infirm perfons belonging to the parilh, who receive fnpplies 
eccafionally, as well as at three ftated terms, Whitfunday, 
Martinmas, and when the facrament is difpenfed. The week- 
ly coUeftions in the church, and at the fecraments, and the 
dues of the mort-cloth, are the only poor's funds here. But 
they cannot be ezpefted to be very coniiderable in a fmall pa- 
rifli, where there are no refiding heritors, nor gentry who at- 
tend public worlbip ; or, fo far as the incumbent knows, be- 
ftow any thing for the fupport of the parochial poor. Such 
poor as live in and about the more populous villages, are fup- 
plied, by their beneficent neighbours, with fome little necef- 
farics, which they could not otherwife procure ; fuch as milk, 
whey, turnips, potatoes, fuel, So;. When it is known, that 
any old or infirm perfon is in want, it is cuftomary for the 
young lads of that corner, to go out in an evening through 
the pariQi, and to aik meal, or a little money, which the 
people very cheerfully give -, and it proves a moft feafonable 
fupply to feveral, who would be in hazard of fuflfering want^ 
rather than feem to be importunate, or burdenfome.

ihouid have very thin churches* There is not perhaps fo 
inueh of the outward fliew of religion among the people, as 
~ in ibnoie other diftri^, efjfecially where the Secefflon has ob. 
iatned'; but, among the ordinary ranks, there is much de- 
cency, find, it is to be hoped, not a little real devotion. One 
diing, however, is dill niatter of juft complaint, through fe-i 
vera! counties in this northern dlvifion of the ifland; too 
great lastnefi and latitude^ in the manner of obferving the 
Sabbath day ; and which, inftead of being devoted to reli- 
gious exercifes, is often fpeUt in travelling on jotimies ; giv« 
ing and receiving vifits ; fending fervants abroad, on errands 
and meflkges; and fo abftrafting them altogether from the 
fiated returns of public and fecial worfliip, which, to many, 
is almoft the only oieans of iuftruAion they can enjoy. It is 
certainly matter of regret, that in a civilited age and coun*

Origin of the Name. 

TILE name, Drumen, or, as it is more commonlj writ-* 
teni Drymenf is obviouflj derived from the Cekic 
word, Druim^ corrcfponding to the Latin Dorfum^ a ridge 
or eminence. It is peculiarly defcriptive of the appear- 
ance of oon&amp;derable part of the parifli, which is frequents* 
\j interfered by deep ravines, or water courfes, with rifing. 
grounds between ihem. The fame word is alfo to be met with, 
as a component part in the names of maay places, as Drum^ 
qubqfile^ Drumdajh^ Drumliagart, t^r. The etymology o£ 
ihefe, and almoil all the other names in the pariib, is purely 
Celtic.

£ff/^ii^.— It is eztremelj difficult to give an aocurate idea 
of the fimation of this pariih, as it is of ^reat extent, aad 
its outlines are excecdinglj irregular. The utmoft length of 
t}ie inhabited part is about ^5 miles ; but th^ noioors extend 
confiderably farther. The greateft breadth is about 9 miles* 

Surfaot^ Rivers and Fifi^.^-Avk, fome plaoesy the country is 
migged and mountainous; in others, flat^aod level j but, for 
Ae moft part, it is an irregular flope, between the high 
moors and the rivers, cut up by a gr^at number of fnudl, 
but rapid ftreams. The principal rivers, are, the Onchraj, 
die Eorth, and the £nrick. The Duchraj is one of the moft 
confiderable branches of the Forth, and divides this parifli, for 
ibme miles, from that of Aberfoil. Near the church of 
Aberfoil, it joins another confiderable dream ; and the united 
river is then known ibj the xiame ^f Forth. Previous to

Papulation. — Since the jp2x 1756, the population of this 
parifh has greatlj dccreafed. This decreafe is partlj owing 
to the prevalence of large farms. In fevecal parts of the pa- 
rilb, X family now occupies wh%t wa9 formerly in the bands 
of 7 or 8. Another caufe of the diminution is to be founcT 
in the ptogrcis of manufadures. Though none of thefie have 
M yet been eftabliihed in this pariih, they are carried on, at no 
great diftance, to a very con^derable extend The bleaphfields 
and printfields upon the river I,ieven, near Dumbartoni ar^ 
ptrhaps die* moft extenCve in Scotland : and Ibme la^ c^ 
ton mills have been lately ere^d in the neighbouring padAi 
of Balfron. Thefo giv^ employment to a great number of 
hands, at wages fo high *, that the farmers find it almoil im«

As the prices of grain, and the other produdiom of the country, have rifen

Origin of the Name* 



THE name of the pari(b is dearlj c^ Gaelic origin; 
jiodincoillie fignif jing the face (f the wood* It is def- 
criptive of the nature of the parifh, which contained two 
rojal foreftsi Ternway^ or Darnway^ and Drummine. In 
the public records there is preferved a charter, bj King David 
Bruce, granting f o Ricbarb Comtke, a predeceflbr of CUimming 
of Altjre, an heritor in this parifh, the office of forefter of the 
king's foreft olTterkway^ in the earldom of Moray. And there 
is an after grant, in X4781 to Thobcas Cummtk£ of Alter, of 
the office of forefter of the foreft of Drummyne* The remains 
of natural wood, and the great quantities of oak and fir, found 
ia the moiTes of this pariih, prove that the whole face of the 
country was formerly covered with wood. The names of 
many of the places in the parifli, (hew, what indeed might

Extent^ EreSiotij Surface^ \3c. — This parifh is very ezten- 
five, being, from N. to S.» about i% miles ; and, from £• to 
W», about 1 o. It is fometimes called Braemoray \ and it was 
anciently a vicarage to Forres, the feat of the Archdeacon of 
Moray, and comprehended Ardclach, which was not erefied 
into a feparate pariih till the year 1638. The face of the 
country is in general hilly, but not mountainous: The higheft 
hill in it, is called the Knock of Braemoray. The height of 
this hill, which is not confiderable, has not been afcertained 
by meafurement. Upon the banks of the rivers Findhom and 
Divie, there are fome of the mod romantic rural fcenes, which 
woodf water, roeks, and variety of ground can produce. 

Proprietors and Rent. — ^Therc arc 5 proprietors ; of whom 
only I refides conflantly in the parifli, and another occafionally. 
The valued rent of the parifli is 1945I* 8s. Scotch : The real 
rent cannot be dated with any degree of accuracy. 

Rivers and Laie^^^TYkt Findhom, already mentioned, is the 
principal river in this pariih. It takes its rife in the bills* 
betwixt thofe diftrids of Inverneis-fliire called Stratber«rig and 
Strathearn, above 50 miles from the fea ; after traverfing, 
with amaxing rapidity, a trafi of mountainous country, in a 
courfe nearly from S. W. to N. E., it difcfaarges itfelf into 
the Moray Frith, about 4 miles below Forres. Over this 
dangerous river, from its fource to the iea, there are only at 
prefent a bridges *j one cpon the military road, from Avie^ 

more 

* Near to Relugai^ tbe river Findhom runs between two rodu, which are onlf 
7 feet diftant from each oth«r* A plank is here placed over it, which fenres for

more to Tnvernels ; and another at Dulfie, upon the military 
road from Granton to Fort-George. This river croffes the 
great poft road to Nairn and Inveroefs^ £cc. And although 
it often detains the mail for manj hours, and notwithftand* 
ing the lofs of manj lives everj jear, no aid has jet been 
procured from Government to build a bridge over it*. The 
other river, called Divifj or B/aei Water ^^ h\ls into the 
Findbom, and is perhaps one of the mod rapid rivers in 
Scotland, rifing often very fuddenly to a great height. The 
principal branch of it rifes among the hill^ which lie betwixt 
this pariih and Stratbfpej. llie other braiach flows from a 
prettj confiderable lake, in the S. W. corner of the parilli» 
called Lochindorb. This branch is called Dorbaci^ till it joins 
the Divie, about a mile below the church. 

Roads and Bridges. "^Thit road, from Forres to Granton, 
croifes the Divie bj a ftone bridge. The fame road crofles 
the Dorback twice, and at both places there are ftone bridges. 
In the year 1783, another bridge was built over the Divie, 
near its jun&amp;ion with the Findhom. The arch is 6% feet 
wide, fpringing from the rocks on each fide. The ezpence, 
about aaol. Sterling, was defrayed by a grant of lool. from 

4 A a the 

a bridge, and affordi accefs from a confiderable part of the pariih, lying on tho 
weft fide of the river, to the church. Owing to the river being confined fo much at 
this narrow paft betwixt the rocki, it rifes, in floods, to a prodigious height, fome- 
times more than 30 feet above its ordinary channel 

* Mifs BaoDia of Liratir, having procured fome aid from the county 
funds, and fnbfcriptiona from her oeighboars, engaged in building a bridge 
over this rapid river, about a miie below the houfe of Coolmony. An agree- 
ment with workmen was entered into, to execute this ufcfiil underuking ; and, 
in a ihort time, a moft elegant arch, 7s feet wide, was thrown over the river. 
But, through fome unlucky defeat in the work, within lefs thaa a month after 
it was paflable, this ufeful bridge gave way, tad, lA one night, fell into the 
fiver.

Ihe CommnConers ti the Annexed EftstteS, sjK from the 
^Gonnty funds, fome fubfcriptions from the neighbourhood, 
and the remainder by Mr. Cumin of Relugas, who took the 
whole charge of the work. It is a moft ufeful bridge for this 
part of the country, opening a fafe communication, betwixt 
the lower part of it and the higher, at a place where many 
lives were formerly loft.— In addition to the above road, from 
Forres to Granton and Aviemore, Sir James Grant, with a 
view to Ihorten the dtftance from Elgin to Edinburgh, through 
Strathfpey, has planned out a new road, on the eaft'fide of the 
Knock-Hill, intended to pafs through the valley of Plufcar- 
dine. This road is already made, with great labour, and mt 
much expence, from Strathfpey to the extremity of this pa« 
riih. When completed, it will ihorten the diftance from 
Elgin to Granton no led than 8 miles. The gentlemen of 
this pari(h are very attentive to the roads, and call out the 
people t6 .perform the ftatute labour, with great exadnefs, 
every year ; but the roads are of fuch extent, and fo difficult 
to make, that it is impra&amp;icable, upon the prefent fyftem, to 
keep them in very good order. 

Fijbing. — ^There is a coniiderable falmon fifliing upon the 
Findhom, within this pariib, the property of the Earl of 
Moray. It is let to a company in Aberdeen, at 901. Sterling 
of yearly rent. The 2 laft years, 1791 and 1792, have been 
very favourable. The Sluie Pool, where moft of the fid are 
caught, has been celebrated, from the moft ancient times, for 
the great number of fiih taken there. By a letter, dated 7th 
June 1648, from James, then Earl of Moray, to the C^untefs, 
it would appear, that the fifliing was greatly more abundafit 
in thofe days than in latter times ; for he writes, that *^ ia 
** one night, on this pool, 1 9300 lalmon were tsdc^en ; and, at 
^i one draught, fix and twenty fcores." This curious letter is 

ia 



of Edenkeillie 557 

in the prefent Ead's pofleifion. Whence the great difference 

I in modern times can arife, it is not eafy to explain; unlefs from 

the fuperior (kill and induftrj of the fiihennen nearer the fea, 

which prevents fo great a number now getting up the river. 

Above the Sluie Pool, the channel of the river is fo rocky, 

that boats and draught nets cannot be ufed ; and the filihers are 

obliged to ufe hang nets, and other devices of that kind* 

Among the rocks, long iron hooks, here calkd elips^ are ufed 

for catching the fiih* So confiderable is the number caught 

^ bj thefe devices* and by die rod, that the price of falmon, 

I during fummer, is fomctimes fo low as three halfpence per 

I pound, and feldom above twopence* — Salmon are alfo fome- 

times caught in the Divie \ and both rivers afford excellent 

fea trouts and finnocks, and a variety of other trouts of infe« 

rior quality. 

Wood* and Plantations .^^Tht natural woods in this pariih 
are very extenfive. The banks of the river are in general 
covered with trees. Along the weft bank of the Findhorn, 
the ancient foreft of Damway, or Ternway, already mention- 
I tdf ftretches, for upwards of 5 miles, covering about 900 acres 

I of ground, and coniifting of oaks, aihes, elms, birches, allers» 

hollies, mountain afhes, and a few venerable Scotch firs ; with 
beeches, geen trees, poplars,^ and almoft every kind of tree 
produced in Scotland. Among thefe the weeping birch makes 
a diftinguKhed figure ; many of them being fo large as 9 feet 
in girth. Some of the oaks, at the fide of the Findhorn, are 
upwards of 10 feet in girth, at 3 feet from the ground. Thej 
are freih vigorous trees, without the fmalleft appearance of 
decay. Farther up the river, is the wood of Dunduff, which 
is of confiderable extent, and likewife the property of Lord 
Moray. And there is alfo a good deal of natural wood upon 
the eftates of the other proprietors. But the plantations in 

this 



55 8 Statt/lscal Account 

this parifli, are fntl mote ezteofive than the natural vr oods. 
About the year 1767, the prefent Earl of Moray began to 
fill up the vacancies ki the old foreft of Damwajr, and has Cace 
gone on every year, extending his plantations aU around his 
ancient Caftle of Damwayt and near to Caftle-Stewart, in the 
parifli of Petty. The quantity of ground planted by his Lord* 
ihip, including the ancient forefl, is confiderably above 3,400 
acres. Part indeed lies in the neighbouring parifli of Dyke/ 
and part in the parifli of Petty, in Invemefs-fliire, but by much 
the greateft part in this parifli. The nurferies from which 
thefe plantations have been made, except a little at the begins 
ning, have been all raifed at Damway. Scotch firs, planted 
out at two years old, from the feed-bed, are ufed as nurfea ; 
and as foon as they are fit to afford flicker, the more valuable 
kinds of foreft trees, principally oaks, are planted amongft 
them. Thefe oaks, at two years old, are planted from the 
feed*bed into the nurfery, where they remain three years; and 
then, as above mentioned, are planted among the firs. When 
the oaks, and other deciduous trees, are fuffictently advanced, 
the whole of the Scotch firs are to be cleared away ; and fome 
of the earlier plantations are fo well grown, as to admit of the 
firs being completely cut out. Others of them are only clear*- 
ed of the firs in part ; and this operation of clearing goes on 
gradually and regularly. The Noble Planter has already the 
latisfaAion of beholding his publicfpirited plan fully anfwer- 
ing his moft fanguine expedations ; to which he is weirenti* 
tied, as every part of the plan, which is extremely fimpk, 
has been carefully and accurately executed ; and proper atten* 
tion paid to the prefervation of the plantations, which are all 
in the moft flourifliing condition, and already greatly beautify 
the face of the country. Having obtained an accurate account 
of the number of trees planted by the Earl of Moray, fince

It will ftill require many years, before thefe very exteniive 
plautations cao be filled up with oaks i but there is at prefent, 
in the nurferieat a very large ftock of yonog plants coming 
forward. The other proprietors have not been deQcient in 
carrying on this improvement. On the eftate of Logic, there 
are confiderable plantations of Scotch firs, and a confiderable 
number of alhes, planted by the prefent proprietor's father, 
fomc of them near 1 00 feet in height. One of thefe aflies 
was lately fold at 5]. 138., at the rate of xs. 6d. per foot j 
a ftrong proof of the profit of planting. And on the efiate of 
Relugas, about aoo acres have been planted, upon a planfimi« 
lar to Lord Moray's, and upwards of 60fOOO oaks planted out* 
Upon the eftate of Dunpbail, there are fome dd fir plantations, 
which have been cutting down, and felling for the ufe of the 
country, for fieveral years pafl* 

CImaiCf l^^..^The air and climate of Moray, from the mod 
diftant times, have been celebrated, as of the pureft and mod 
iSdubrious quality, by all the writers who have defcribed that 
oountry ; and it has beea a conunon laying, that it enjoyed 
40 days more of fair weather, than moft other places in Scot« 
land. In Wl^itelocVs Memorials, a book of great authority, 
r there is a curious tefUmony in favour of the country,^ in 
Oliver Cromwell^s time : He fays, ** AMeld's regiment was 

* marched 



560 Staiijlical Acctmnt 

^ marched into Murrmyland, whidh is the moil fruitful conntrjr 
« ID Scotland, and the common proverb is, that it hath fifteen 
** days more of fumoier than any other part of the nation.*' * 
It is unneceflarj to mention the praifes given to it hj Bu- 
chanan and others. The fuperior degree of dryneis, perhaps 
applies more to the level plains of Morajt along the fea fide, 
than to this parifli, where more rain falls than in the lower 
parts of the country. But no place can enjoy a healther air 
than this parifh does, being hardly ever troubled with fogs, 
•r pernicious exhalations ; and the rivers, fb far from being 
hurtful, rather tend to purify the air, by tlie rapidity of their 
courfe. There are no difeafes peculiar to this part of the 
country. 

Fruity Orchard^ \3c. — ^Tn the valley of Logic, which is the 
warmeft part of the parifli, ftandard and wall fruit trees grow 
well. Mr Gumming of Logie, befides an excellent garden, 
a good many years ago planted 4 Scotch acres of ground with 
fruit trees. This beautiful orchard is dofe to the Findhom, 
cxpofed to the fouth ; bnt on all other fides well Iheltered by 
higher grounds, and tall foreft trees. In favourable feafons, 
ic already richly repays the expence of planting and indofing* 

Soil^ Cultivation and Produce^^^Thc foil of the lower part 
of the parifli, near the rivers, is of a light dry quality, rather 
tending to fandy ; but, when properly managed, very fertile 
and produdive. A very great proportion of the parifh con« 
fifts of muir and mofs ; great part of which might be improv- 
ed, if lime, of which there is none in this parifli, could be pro* 
cured. For though there is fbme in the parifli of Forres, it is 
too expenfive an article for common tenants to purchafe, and

a triangular forai,aadof confid^rableextcdt ; being about 8 n^iles 
long, from N. to S. and about 6 miles broad from £• to W; 
The general appearance of the countrj is romantic. The 
Grampian nionntairis, on the north, are among the higheft iii 
the neighbourhood. The lei&amp;r hills, in the bottom, are pic-' 
turefane in their forms, having their fides covered with fine 
copfe wood, arid their heads crowned with flrs. The river Em 
flows, in beautiful curves, in the bottom of the vallej. 

Soil and Cultivation. — ^The foil is various, but the greater 
part is lighk and gratellj. T^e hsiughs on the lyanks of 
the Ern, which are frequentlj overflown, produce rich cropsr. 
The banks next the bottom, have long been cultivated as 
infields ; that is, ground which receives all the manure, pro^ 
duced from the lands in the tenants poflefiion. It is therefore 
very rich ; but, from conftant culture in white cr^ps, is much 
infelted with weeds, efpecially if frequent mild rains fucceed 
fowing. Late fowing is therefore praftifed under the old huf- 
haxxArj ; the inconvenience of which is the lefs fislt, as the foH 
is dry, well expofed, and well (heltered, and therefore naturally 
«arly* Another kind of foil, employed in tillage, lies on the 
banks above the infields^ This ground is prepared for yield-*, 
ing three crops of oats, by folding the cattle upon it, or hy 
watering it^ by means of the rivulets which run from th&amp; 
hills : And, after being thus cropped, it is thrown into grafsv

Ihoogh neither limed nor marled are uncommonljr fertile in 
Batural graCs, The lands, which are limed or marled, belong- 
ing to Sir William Murray of Ochtcrtyre, are thrown into 
regular rotations of cropping : And the tenants are thriving, 
under this fyftem* But the greater part of the foil is better 
fitted to produce grafs than corn ; as much of it lies in fteej^ 
banks, abounds vrith ftones, and is liable to be wa(hed away 
by the rains when in tillage* There are no commons in the 
parilh ; apd little mair, er wafte ground, is brought into till- 
age, except by the above mentioned proprietor and his ten- 
nasts. Although a great proportion of the land is incapable 
of being cultivated, yet there is enough of it arable, for pro« 
docing more than i? necefiary for the juatntenance of its 
inhabitants. 

Produce and Cilimate,r^Thc pnriocipal crops are oats and 
barley. Potatoes and peafe are the only green crops raifed by 
the tenants. Turnips are only fown by a very few, chiefly 
proprietors. The foil of the pariih fit for culture, when well 
treated, produces excellept barley, which, all things confider- 
0Aj it found to be a more profitable crop than wheat, which 
has been very little attempted here. A confiderahle quantity of 
iint is raifed in the parifli ; particularly on the haogh grounds^ 
which, from their fituation, receive an annual depofit of rick 
mud ; or on the fpota of infield, which have been for fome^ 
years in grafs, for the fecond crop ; or in old parks, of good 
and.well*laid*down land, alfo for the fecond crop; and on the 
xhoft fertile of the outfields, which can admit' of being 
wrdi watercid. In fliort, the propenfity to fowing liot here is 
fo great, from the profits arifing from it, that the more inteU 
ligent proprietors redrift their tenants to a certain quantity ; 
as lint is a very fcourging crop, and leaves nothing behind tof

Rhtrs and Jj^.~«The priocipal river is the Erne ; which 
would abound with falmon, if they were not prevented from 
getting up, by the cruives and fixed nets iiear the mouth of 
the river. As the proprietors above can get few of them in 
fummer, they take no charge of them during the fpawning 
feafon, when great numbers of them are defiroyed. It is 
therefore probable^ that the owners of the cruives ifould find, 
more advantage in the oommoo ufe xf nets, if the piroprietora 
of the upper grounds had an inteceft in protcfting the lalmoa 
during the forbidden timey becaufe the numbers would be 
much greater than what are now al)owed to be bred. And 
it is a well known faftt t^^t a very great propoi;tion of the 
£dmon bred in a river return to itt unlels prevented by fom^ 
accidental or artificial caufe. 

Laits aad Echo^-^^Thcn are feveral (mall lakes in Ae pa* 
fifli. Tbelargeft of them, Lochtorret, lies in Cjrlentnrret, and 
is furromided by very bold craggy mountains. It is about a 
oiile long, and a quarter of a mile broad. There is alfo a 
fmall lake, in the fame glen, about a mile north from the 
fbraser, remarkable for the great number of trouts which are 
colleAed in a fmall opening ia the middle of it, the only place 
which is free from weeds* There is another Iske, called die 
Loeb o/Mmioairi^ which covers about 30 acres, and contains 
pike, perch and eels. This lake, fituated at the bottom of a 
fine hanging wood, and furronndcd by cultivated fields and 
plantations, is a delightful olqeft to pafiengers, and a great 
beauty to the plesfure grounds of Ochtertyre* It contains a 
rich treafure of iheU marie, which is taken up, in many

It 19 prioctpatlj bj means of this marie, that the proprietor 
has cultivated a confiderable ttaA of wafte and unprodu&amp;ive 
ground, and induced his tenants to adopt a fpirited and regu« 
lar fjfiem of hulbandry.-— On the banks of the laft mentioned 
lake, there is a fine repta^ng echo, produced, it is fuppofed, 
from the walls of an old ruinous caftle, which ftands on » 
gently rifing ground running out into the middle of the lake ;• 
ftnd which was a place of flrength in ancient times^ being* 
then furrounded with water, and accel&amp;ble only in one place 
bj a drawbridge* 

Wwdi aad fTJttr.-— All kinds of wood, produced in Scotland, 
thrive remarkably well in this parilh ; but the oak feems to 
be a particular favourite of the foil. Befides the oak and 
birch, of which the copfewood chiefly coofifts, a great variety 
of other trees have been planted of late, both on the efiate of 
Lawers, the property of Colonel Robertfon, and on that of 
Ochtertyre, the property of Sir William Murray; patticular- 
ly on the lands of the latter, who has, for more than 20 years, 
planted annually incredible numbers of all forts.-— The higheft 
mountain, on 'the northern extremity of the pariih, is Ben* 
chw%Uf which fignifies the molly mountain, there being 
about 40 acres, on its fnmmit, covered with a fpecies of mofs* 
Its elevation, above the level of the fea, is 3921 feet* Near

Wild Animals,,^^TYkt prineipal birds of prey are the cagle^ 
kites raven and falcon, which build their nefts in the craggy 
precipices of Glenttirret. This glen was famous, in formec 
times, for producing falcons of the beft kind, when hawking 
was a favourite amufement in this country. It produced th^ 
pair, which the late Duke of AthoU prefented to the King at 
bis coronation, as a token of his hdding the Ifle of Man of 
the Grown of England. On the hills, are groufe, dottorel, 
plover, and feveral migratory birds, wbofe names are not very 
well known here. A few ptarmigans are to be met with on 
the fummit of Benchonzie ; birds which frequent only the 
tops of high mountains, and which are fupppfed to feed on 
the infeds bred among the grey mofs, which is almoft the 
only plant that grows on fuch elevated ground. In the hilly 
part of the parilh, the fportfmen fometimeSTmeet with a fpe« 
cies of hare, which is of a Uuifli colour io fummer, and white 
as fnow in winter. The principal water fowl, which frequent 
the, lakes, are the wild duck, teal, and widgeon. In the low 
grounds, are found all the birds which ufually breod in a 
woody country. The bullfinches have become very numerous 
of late, attraS^d, it is fuppofcd, by the blolToms of the larch 
trees, which abound io the young plantations, and which af- 
fcrd them food, before the fruit trees put forth their bods.: 
There are partridges, hares and rabbits, iu abundance j and a 
few foaes^ badgers, wild cats, martins and otters. 

Black CattU^ Horja^ Sleeps t/c.-s— There are about 140 
faorfes in the parlfii, between 900 and icoo black cattle, and 
about 5000 fheep. The horfes are of a middling' fize, and in?

|cdenl not very handfomey as the common people pay llttio 
attention to the improvement of the breed. They are equally 
negligent with regard to their black cattle; but it is hoped, 
that the prizes, which the gentlemen of this country mean to 
diftribtttc annually, among the owners of the beft bulls, will 
have the effe&amp; of improving the breed of cattle. The breed 
of bor(e8, too, would foon improve, were every confiderable 
proprietor to keep a haadfome ftallion for the ufe of his te- 
nants. The flieep of this country are of the black faced kind, 
and came originally from Linton. They are hardy ; but their 
wool is ihaggy and coarfe. The avmge price of wool, this 
year, is 8s« per ftoae. The carcafe weighs about 2 ftones Dutch* 
Had the hill grounds been let to experienced iheep farmers 
from the fonth country, the breed of flicep, and the wool, 
would perhaps have been more improved by this time, and 
higher rents given for tho fbeep walks. But as thefe advan- 
tages could not eafily be obtained, without depopulating the 
country, the proprietors have let the hill grounds to their old 
tenants, contenting tbemfelves with what rent they can eafily 
afford to pay. A few of the Cheviot iheep have been lately 
introduced into the flocks kept in the low grounds, for the 
ufe of private families, and thrive very well. T^ie hill tc- 
'nants, however, feem unwilling as yet to make trial of them, 
as they think them too large for their paflure, and not hardy 
enough for ftandiog out fevere winters. As the pafiure im- 
proves under the iheep fyftem, a larger fpecies of that animal 
will be gradually introduced. 

RnU and Pro^nV/or/*— The arable land, in genersl, lets from 
about los. to 15s* per acre; a fmall part of it, indeed, for 20s, 
and upwards. The hill grounds are not let by meafure, but by

Monivaird and Strowan were built. About the beginning of 
laft century, a party of the Murrays and Drummoods having 
quarrelled, the former being worfted in a flLirmifli, fled for 
fonftuary to the church of Monivaird, whither they wero 
purfned by their favage enemies, who fet fire to the toof^ 
which was then thatched with heather, and burnt many of 
them to death. The church is now in very good repair; and^ 
though far from being elegant or commodious, it is at leaft 
as decent as many of the churches of Strathem.

'during the fummer feafon. The chief inconTcniencey we feel^ 
is our diftance from coal ; which, though brought in -carta^ 
over a hilly road, upwards of 20 miles, is a cheaper fuel than 
peats or wo«d. We have now, however, the profpeft of 
having this inconvenience in fome degree remedied, by the 
turnpike road, that is propofed to be carried irom Crieff to 
Blaimgone, which is our neareft coal pit* Indeed, nothing 
feems to be wanting but coals to make this a very thriving 
country, for if that neceilary article could be got at a mo* 
derate price, we ihould find limeftone in abundance for im- 
proving our lands. We fliould alfo have manufa£tures of 
^different kinds eftablilhqd among us, as we have the fineft falls 
xf water for driving machinery, particularly on the Erne and 
^he Turret, in the neighbourhood of the populous village of 
Crieff, On the latter river, there are not lefs than 15 or 1 5 
mills, of different kinds, in the courfe-of a mile and a half ^ 
and as it takes its rife from a lake of confiderable extent, by 
ereding a dike at the .mouth of ^e lake (which could be done 
for 1 51*), a fufficient quantity of water could be obtained, for 
driving the he^vieft machinery, even in the greateft drought. 
The manuf adored goods could be eafily tranfported, ixom. 
Crieff to PerUi, by the turnpike road, which is now forming 
between thefe two towns ; or by a canal, which could be car- 
ried from Crieff to within a mile of the Tay, without a lock. 
Thefe improvements, however, we do not cxpeS to fee car- 
ried to their greateft height, unlefs we can find coal nearer 
than Blaixngone. Our proprietors, therefore, who ihew 
ahundance of public fpirit on moft. occafions, fliould unite^ 
and make a fair trial for diCcovering coal in Strathern. Were 
they to take the lead, all the pariibes around would certainly 
.contribute liberally towards fuch an undertaking.

Names and Extent.^ 



ARRAN is derived from the Gekic word jirin. Ar^ 
fignifies higb^ and In an ijland. Kilbride is (aid tQ 
be compounded of Kil^ a burying place, and Bride^ a coo^ 
tra£tion for Bridget, the name of an ancient faint. The ez« 
tent of the parifb, from Dippin on the fouth^ to Lochranza ox^ 
the north, is 14 miles. A ridge of hills feparates it, on the 
weft, from Kilmorie. The Ifle of Arranis 7 miles in breadth^ 

filoiV, Produce and Catfle.-^The foil is hard and ftosej. 
Moft ^of the farms Ijing on the declivity of hills, the beft 
prepared land fcarce yields two returns. To fupply the de« 
Aciency of com, the inhabitants plant great quantities of po- 
f itoes, which are their principal food for 9 months in the 
year. They lay out, upon feed com and meal, about 500I. 
a year; and they fell annually about 2co bolls of barley;

terides 500 head of black cattle, and 80 (heep. Part of the 
latter are killed for home confurfiption. Oat of thefe articles, 
dnd the profits of their fiflj, they are enabled to pay their 
rents. 



Fijbing. — ^FiQi of all kinds are caught round the ifland. In 
the beginning of winter, fifhermen come from the North 
Country^ to filh for the Glafgow market, and continue with 
fuccefs till May. In July, the herrings frequent the coafti 
when the inhabitants bellow the molt unwearied application 
to the fiihing till the end of November. It is computed, that 
the boats, employed in this fiihing, bring into the ifland no 
iefs thsm lOooL a year. 

Climate and Di/ea/es.-^The air Is very falubrious. There 
IS no fultry heat in fummer, the air beiiig conftantly purified 
by land or fea breexes. People advanced in years, however^ 
6ften complain of coughs and rheumatifms duririg winters 
Thefe difeafes are much owing to the dampnefs of their houfes^ 
and the fcarclty of fuel, to render them warm and comfortable^ 
%hich is occafioned by the coal lax. For many years pad , a great 
fiiumber of children died of the natural £mall pox. Parents 
are no\^ moie reconciled to inoculation, as they find that thi^ 
artificial diltemper, under the diredion of a ikilful furgeon^ 
faves the lives of numbers. There is a diford^r^ no lets fatal 
to children, which feems to be peculiar to this ifland, as it ia 
feldom inown any where clfc, called the tigbt-dayjitknefsi 
Infants are feized with it the 8th day after birth, by the fall- 
ing down of the jaw; attended with violent convulfions. ' Nd 
means have yet been found effeAual to remove this diforder.

the pariih. It is 2,840 feet perpendicular above the level of 
the fea. There is not a more extenfive profped in Britain^ 
than the top of Goatfield affords. Manj tranfpareiit ftones 
are found on it, naturally formed into pentagons, heptagons

carried coaft-wife round the ifland, to the weft fide ^ where 
there are extenfive farms, upon a foil of a mixed loam of 
claj and mofs. Marie and lime, laid on this ground, would 
produce great crops of corn, which is much wanted in the 
ifland. At Cock of Arran there are free ilone, lime ftone, 
iron ore, blind coal and flates. The iIates,.on trial, are found 
to be of an excellent quality. Within an £ngli(h mile of 
Lochrahza harbour, a cart road is already made, from the ilate 
quarry to the ihore. On both fides of Lamhlajh Bay^ there 
is a fine free ftonc, between the beds of which craw coal i^

Harbours and Lighthoufe. — ^There are only 2 harbours ia 
the lilandy viz. Lamblajb and Locbran%a. Lamblafh Baj is 
a fenricircle. Holy IJle^ in the mouth of it, forms the har- 
bour, having an inlet or opening at both points. A light- 
houfe is lately ere&amp;ed on the ifle of Pladda^ which direda 
fhips into the port of Lamblafh at night. The fouth end of 
Arran is rocky ; and many fliipwrecks happened there before 
the light-houfe was ereded. Lochranza, at the north end of 
Arran, affords a fafe harbour for fmall boats, in the time of 
the herring fiiking. An old caftle, fituated at th^ bottom of 
the bay, ferves to direft the boats into \he harbour.

Name and Extent. 

THE origin of the name is uoknowo. It is probaUj itn 
rived from the GaeUc« the language ivhich fonnerlj 
prevailed all over the peniofula of Fife. There is a pariih, 
with almoil the fame name (^Monzie^^ in the prefbjtety of 
Auchterarder, where the names of places are alfo of Celtic 
cxtraftion.— -Moonziei in point of extent and population, is 
I perhaps the fmallefl parochial diflriA in Scotland, and fur- 

I niflies very Sender materials indeed, for ftatiflical obfervation 

and inquiry. It is only x Scotch mile in length, and about 
1 1 in breadth. The number of acres is between f,oco and 

1,100. 

Surface^ Soily Produce^ Cattle^ t#r.— A great part of the pa- 
rifli is hilly, and the reft is flat and low.* The foil is very thin, 
but fertile. In a wet fummer, it produces very good crops, both 
of com and grafs \ but, in a dry feafon, all the hilly ground 
is quite parched. — ^There are 17 ploughs in the parilh. 
I The farmers, now, only put 2 horfes to the plough, and I 

I man both holds and drives. This is a very great faving. There 

^re about 34 or 36 horfes in the parifb i and a very few iheep,

Every country pariih has its philofophers, politicians and divines. Tbefe leaders

have privileges and immunities granted to them, according to the number of 
their children. But their chief objcdlion is on the fcore of religion- Con-

Origin of the Name. 

THE namci like moil other places, has been variouft/ 
fpelt. In the charter granted bj King Robert, in the 
9th- year of his reign, (anno 1315), to "thomas de Erjtyne^ 
it is fpelt j^kvayi and, in fome fubfequent ones, Aulway^ 
Auleway^ and fometimes Alloway. Camden, in his Britannia^ 
feems to think it the Alauna of the Romans *• He fajs, 

" Ptolemy 

* When the Romans crofTed the Forth, it fcenu probable, that it was either 
by the ford 'of Manor, a fmall creek, about 6 miles higher up the ^ater than 
Alloa, or at the ford of the Froik, which is ooly a mile and a half from it* 
There are veftiges of a Roman caufeway, running into the river at Manor ; 
and it is only within thefe 13 or 14 years, that the remains of a fmall eafitUum^ 
for prote&amp;ing the pafTage, have been been totally defaced. In 1774, a fwoid, 
or -dagger, of a compofition refembling brafs, was taken up in a falmon net, 
between the ford of Frofk and Manor. It had on its point a piece of a human 
fcuU. k appeared to be of Roman workmanihip ; and feems to confirm the 
opinion, that this part of the river had been frequented by the Romans, as a 
paflage from the fouth to the north. This dagger was prejfent^d by Mr. 
ALKZAifDEa CoLDSTkEAM, fchoolmafter at Criefif, (into whofe hands it fcU^

SflfiroftVif.— -Alloa is a port in the county of Clackmannan^ 
fituated on the north fide of the river Forth, weft long'. 3^ 4 j'^ 
lat. 56^ I0^ It is about 2 77 miles higher up the frith than 
Leith, and 17 lower down the river than Stirling. The wind* 
logs ef the Forth, between Stirling and Alloa, ate veiy re« 
fiiarkable ; the diftance, from the qiiaj of Alloa,, to the quaj 
of Stirling, meafured in the centre of the river, ts 17 miles, 
and to the bridge of Stirling it is 194 miles; whereas the 
diftance, hj land, from Alloa to the bridge of Stirling, does 
not exceed 7 miles, though the turnings in the road are nu- 
merous. It is the moft confideraUe port in the river ; for 
the upper part of the Frith of Forth begins at Kennet Pans 
and Higgins Neuk— There are 3! feet greater depth of wa* 
ter, in the harbour of Alloai than on the bar of Leith. 

Extentf and &amp;f/.— The parifli is, 00 an average, about 
4 miles from £• to W. and about % miles from N. to S. 
It confifts of about 3*900 acres. It is bounded on the 
fouth bj the Forth ; and thejbeod of the river is fo great, 
that the banks meafure about 57 miles. The grounds, 
pn the banks of the Forth, are . flat, and of a very

yet there are feveral circumftances, which might tend to juftify that conjedure* 
AA«f« was a rural feaft of the Athenians, which was adopted by the Romans, and 
anfwered to oar harv^ hmw» it was alfo nfed to fignify a grove, or fruitfol 
plain, well adapted to the celebration of fuch a feaft. If we fuppofe, that th« 
Romans made good their pafiage acroft the Forth, about the time of harveft, 
we may eafily conjc&amp;are that they (hould conceive the idea of celebrating their 
harveft feaft, at a time which they thought propitious to their wiihes, cfpecially 
in a fituation peculiarly fitted for that purpofe ; and hence they might very na%

grounds rife prettj fiiddenly from the cardesi god are of a light 
kind, but fertile. Towards the centre of the pariih, the 
grounds are preuj high. Thejr are aioft agreeably divcrfified ; 
but die land is much ioCeior in ^aalitj. 

Tovm oftd Tower, %ic* — ^Tbe fitoation of the town is iIeaT 
^t. There are ftrata of rock, that run a coofiderable waj 
between the kerfe and the high grounds, and break off about 
fhe Ferrj, a little abov^ the harbour. On part of this rock 
is built the Tower, and the ancient part of the town of 
yilloa«F— The Tower is the refideni:e of the reprefentatives 
of the family of M4RK, and is now poflc fled by a grandfbti 
of the late £arl ; who has repaired the houTe, and made great 
improvements on the land. It was built prior to the year 
^300. The highf^ turret is 89 feet from the ground, and 
the thicknelsof the walls is 11 feet* Notwith^andiog its being 
£tuated on a flati there is a moft uncommonly fine rich prof- 
ped, from the top of the Tower; and 9 counties can be difbeniT 
ed from itt The gardens, which were laid out by the late 
Earl, in.the old tafle, of long ayenues, and ^lipt hedges, arp

tage. There was ofigipaliy a natural wood to the eaftwaid, 
fsO, the greateft part of it ftill remains. All kinds of trees, 
tthrive remarkably well ; apd there are oaks, beeches, elms, 
planes or fycamores^, limes, and a(bes of confiderable circum^ 
ference. There is an uncommon fine black poplar, that mea^ 
fures X3t feet round, at the height of 3 or 4 feet from the 
ground. The town foriperly almoft furrounded the tower^ 
as in the rude ages they afforded mutual benefits to each other,

have whatever quantity of coals it requires^ at a very eafy 
rate, as they are conveyed from the pits, to the very door of 
the glafs-houfe, by a waggon way. There is a pier adjoining 
to the houfe, by which all materials wanted ure loaded and 
unloaded. It is faid, that there are prepoials niaking for 
building another houfe. The extent, te which the manofiEi&amp;ory 
of glalJB has been carried^ is amazing* It is not half a century, 
fince one glafa hoofe at Leith, and one at Glafgow,.fupplied 
all Scotland, while the Company wrought the one half year 
at the one place, and die next at the other.^ Similar obfervaN 
tions might be made on other manuiiEifiures,r «id lead to very 
enlarged fpeculatkms. — A little to the N. W. of the glafs-* 
houfe, there is a tile and brick work, upon a pretty large fcale^ 
and well employed. Above that,- there is a good tan-work.

Condemned, on an old aft of parliament, diey were reftrained 
within certain limits, from fiihing in that manner ; and the 
fifhing, fince that time, has been moftly abandoned $.— After 
palSng the ferry of Craig Ward, the river becomes narrower; 
and there are fome beautiful iilands, which are called Inches. 
Thefe fumifli excellent pailure for cattle luting the fummer^ 
and are efteemed medicinal for fuch as are weakly or fick» 
They are a gentle kind of fait marfli, as they are entirely- 
covered with water in fpring tides* Thefe Inches are fre« 
quented by great quantities of water fowl, viz. wild ducks,, 
teals, widgebns, gullsy gcc. Sbc. Here they find flielter, and a 
variety of food fuited to their nature. Sometimes fcarts, or 
cormorants, goofeanders, &amp;c. appear here. The ftormy pet« 
terels, or what the failors call Mother Cary^s chickens^ were feeil 
About the Perry laft winter ; and one of them was killed by 
Mr. Erikine, junior. It was thought fingular to fee thefe 
birds, who feldom appear near the land, fo far up the country. 
Upon the point of thefe inches, they ereft what are called 
yaresy a fort of fcaffbld projefting into the water ; upon whicli 
they build little huts to protect them from the weather ; from 
fbefe fcaffolds they let down, at certain times of the tide, their 
Dets, and are ohen very fuccefsfnl in taking the fmaller fiffa,

fleet, and thonght of nothing but a haftjr retreat. It was in the month of 
January, and at the breaking up of a great ftorm. William Kirkcaldy of 
Orange, ittentive to the circvmftancet in which the French were caaght, took 
advantage of this toadon, and aguurched with great expedition towards Surling, 
«ad cut the bridge of Tidlibody, which » over the Devon, to prevent their re- 
treat. The French, finding no other means of efcape, took the roof off the 
,church, and laid it along the bridge where it was cnt^ and got fafe to Stirling. 
4t i» generally believed, that this church remained in the fame difmaotled flate 
till fome years ago, that George Abercromby, Eiq. of Tallibody, covered it 
widi a new roof, and creAcd within it a tomb for lus*{iamily. There is fifll« 
large burying gnmnd roand this church ; and on the TunftXk fide of it, wher9 
.there had been formerly an entry, there is a ftone coQn, witii a niche fur the 
head, and two for the anas, covered with ^. thick hollowed lid, like a tureen. 
{The lid is a good deal broken ; but a curious tradition is preferved of the coffin, 
'vii. ** That a certain young lady of the netghbourhood had declared her af* 
** fedioa for the mii^ifter, who, oiiherirom his ftation, or want of inclination, 
^ made no returns ; that the lady -fickcned and died ; but .gave orders not 10

200 Scotch acres, or 254 Engliih fiatute acies}, who vras remarkahle for hia 
good plowing, draining,, and dreffing of his grounds. His cAmple quickened 
the diligence of his- neighbours. A few years after he was fettled here, he pro- 
pofed to his landlord and brother farmers, to have trials of fltill among the* 
ploughmen ; which fchcme was eagerly adopted^ and MLowuio matcbu were

I'he improved chain plough, on SmalPs conflrudion, was thejooly one ufed; and 
it was computed that i,6ool. never placed the horfes and ploughs on the field. 
The fituation, being (hort ridges on a gentle declivity, fet off tlie (hew to the 
grcateft advantage ; fo that, to any one fond of hufbindry, the fight was moft 
uncommonly delightful and pleafing. In Ihoit, the good effeAs of this ioftitu-

to be as indifpenfiUy neceflary to a farm as the fanners *. 

There is no particular rotation or coarfe of crops univerfal^

It is much to be wiflied that this ca&amp;om was more uaiverfalp

haying cottagers on the very beft ellablifhment ; for the an- 
cient kind of cottars Were bat too often miferably opprefled 
by the tenants, on whofe farms they were eftabli(hed; as 
they often etafted their fervices more rigoroufly, than the 
landlords did £rom the tenants. But as the ploughmen^ iti 
ttiis diftrid, receiye their flated fee (of wages), kitchen mo- 
ney and mealf and pay only xos. or lis. for their cottages, 
(though indeed they generally have them gratii)^ befides 
their mailers* horfes drawing home their coals for thern, no 
oppreflion can well take place. They have alfo the advantage 
of having their wives, and fuch of (heir children as can work 
in the fields, always at hand, who receive the common wages 
during hay-making and haryeft \ and are likewife often em- 
ployed in picking ftones off the land, and pulling or cutting 
down weeds. All this is of confiderable benefit, both to ma. 
fters and fervants, and tends to rear up an ufiful, healthy ge«

Sale of Grami — ^There is not the fmalleft ttfemblaoce of a

able quantity of haj* : Their ufual price is 4d. per ftone ; and 
the haj is weighed, at th^ place where it is flacked to be ufed. 
Some of the farmers have found out their miftakci^ in deferring 
the cutting of their hay till late in the feafon« thinl^ing, bj 
fo doin^, to increafe the quantity. It does fo indeed to the 
eye ; but in reality it is quite the reverfe : For hay, cut at 
the proper time, retains aU the feed in it, and therefore it 
freighs confiderably heavier, and has more nourifbment in \x\ 
and the fecond crop of grafji is earlier, and more plentiful, 
Befides, it does Icfs damage to the ground ; fo that the greedy 
farmer cheats himfelf in every refped. Few^ or almoft no

will probably come in courfe, as their knowledge improves ;

much nejglefied, that it then produced nothing but wild mu- 
ilard *9 and innumerable weeds. After incloHng and laying it 
down in clover, the crop was fol^ green for upwards of 8K 
per acre. Some few people near the town followed the mini- 
fter*s example, and with good fuocefs. Upwards of 7 guinea^

Fjarmi. — ^^Tbere are various opinions concerning the iize of 
farms. In general, fmall farms are reckoned mod advantage^ 
ous for the country ; but it is feldom that any definition of a

f Some years ago, the late Mr. WinDBUBuaN of $t« Germains, in Eaft Lo«

^d. if we may be allowed to judge by analogy, with fome appearance of rea- 
fon. U is allowed, that no trade can be carried on to advantage without a fuf- 
ficient ftock; that the divifion of labour, and large dealings, enable people to 
fell at a lefs profit, as the quantity fufficiently recompences for the lownefs of 
the price. Why fliould the farming trade totally differ from all others f A 
certain fize of a farm is abfolutely neceflary to carry on the bufinefs with any

carried on to the greatefi extent, were they brought about by large or fmall farms ? 
^Examine them miuutely, aod fee where the greauft (kill is difplayed, or the

the fecond period. This is thought to be no more than equitable. Many gen* 
tlcmen, who have tried improving ground thcmfelves, are thoroughly feniible, 
that the bed part of a 19 years tack palTes away before any adequate profit can 
DC received for the expence laid out ; and the farmer, who, from his knowledge

tbofc of this work w^re like their neigbbppr?. About 39 
yearj ago, they w^re perfuaded to give (bme little education 
to their children ; and a few years after (when in fearch of s^

meafure has been fold at a confiderably lower price within thefe 35 years^ 

f The allowance given to the old cottier, when paft labour, was two pecks of 
meal per week, each weighing Sib. Dutch, or 81b. xi oz. avoirdupoife ; and 
he had his free houfe and garden, and likewife his firing, continued to him, the 
fame as when working. Every widow had one peck of meal per week, a free 
houfe, &amp;c. &amp;c. ; and if (he had any fons grown up, who were able to carry on 
their father's work at the coal wall, they continued at it, for behoof of the far 
mily, as they did in their father's lifetime, until they were married. 

I There were fome parts of the old la!^ which were barbarous, and which 
andpubtedly required to be aboHihed ; but it is }ueiUoned, whether the total 
ftpeal of it has ma^e the collier happier, or if it has had the effed of inducing 
common labourers to commence colliers, or to train up their children to the bu- 
iineis, as was faid to be the ezpedlations of the promoters of it ; nor is the price 
of working coal reduced. It is well known to all coalmafters, that a collier can 
never earn fo much in any work, as in that in which he was brought up. The 
prefent law has unhappily encouraged vagrancy amongft the colliers; and» 
whenever they begin to wander, they generaUy bid farewel to indoftry. On 
going to a new place, they confiantly, on fome pretence or other, ga money. 
And as the collier has broken all ties of relationihip and habits, his head is con- 
tinually on the rack to contrive fome method to Aift his place, in hopes of getting 
more money from a new mafter^ withoot working for it.

the piece; their earnings, therefore, depend on their own 
4iligeUce and ikiU. The price of working varies according to 
the quality of die different feitms of coal. A good collier can 
clear from 15I. to J5I. per annum ; an extraordinary clever 
one may perhaps exceed this by xol. or ill. The depth of 
a bearing pic cannot well exceed z8 fathom, or xc8 feet. 
There are traps, or ftairs, down to thefe pits, with a band 
rail to aflift the women and children, who carry up the coals 
€0 their backs. The price given by the colliers is 4d. per 
chalder, of 30 cwt. A diligent bearer often brings up, from 
the bottom of the pit, 6 cfaalders, or 9 tons of coal iu the

iter is obliged to draw them up by gins, which is either 
wrought by horfes, or driven by water. The water gin^ 
which has been in ufe here for thefe 70 or 80 years, is a tnoft 
ingenious Ample maohine ^, There are two collieries in the 
barony of Alloa, the oldeft of them, called the Alloa Pk/, 
is about It mile difiant from the (bore; the other is the Colly-^ 
kmd^ and is about double that diftance. Tbere'ate various 
feams in each colliery ; fome of 3, 4, 5 and 9 feet in thick- 
nefs. They dip to the N. E. about I in 6 or 7. 

The pits are free of all noxious damps, and have in general 
a good roof and pavement, although there are iton floiles over 
fome of the feams. The engine pit of the Alloa coal is about 
48 fathom deep ; and the coal is drained by a water engine; 
there having been a large refervoir of water oollefled (as has 
been already mentioned), for that purpofe, about the begin- 
ning of the century, as the fleam engine was then but lately 

invented; 

ago, the proprietor weighed a piece of coal, that a hmt woman had hrougfac 
•at of a pit, l\ fathoms deep, and was aftoniflied to find it full % cwt« Another 
woman carried an nncommon large piece of coal, from the mouth of the pit €• 
the overfeer's honfe, a diftance of 400 yards \ and, hy the meafore of this piece 
of coal, it TtxaSi have weighed 3 cwt. 

* It is a wheel of 18 feet diameter, and appears as if two wheels were joined 
together, with the buckeu of the one rererfed from thofe of the other. The 
axle is 39 inches diameter, to which the rope that draws up the tubs, or conre, 
is fixed. There is a dftcm placed over the wheel, divided in the middle. Each 
divifion has a valve, esaAly over the centre of the di£Eerent buckets^ which valve 
is opened by a Aider moved from the bottom ; fo that when the wheel turns' 
round, it draws up the tub, or corve, of coals, weighing 6 cwt. and lets down 
the empty one, on ihutting the valve ot thole buckets, and opening the othert 
the corve that has ]aft been emptied is let down, while a frelh corve full of coals

of tHe CoUyland is about 46 fathom deep; and the coal is

. Vol- VIII. 4I The 



« It has often been aiTerted, that there have been more cftates loft than madei 
(efpeciallj in Scotland) by working coal mines. There probably hai been 
feme foundation for foch an aflertion. The czpences of winning and keeping up 
a colliery are eodfiderable, and the cotnmodtty vill not bear a great price ; 

.fo that it is only a large quantity, that can produce a profit adequate to the ex- 
pence. While the coals of the barony of Alloa were brought to the (bore in 
fniall caru by the tenants, the quantity was uncertain, and often not very con* 
fidcrable* In Z768, a waggon way was made to the AUoa piu, which proved to 
he fo great an advantage, that it induced the proprietor to extend it to the Coliy- 
land, in 177]. The fales were by theCe means iocreafed, from i^ooo or zz,ooo 

. chalders, to i5,oooor i6,ocx. In 1785, the AUoa waggon way was worn out, and 
required X^ be ranewed. This was done on a new plan ; and it is now acknow- 
ledged to be the moil complete in Britain. A dcTcriptioo of It may therefore 
be thought ufcful. 

The fleepers are Tcry broad, and only 18 xnchea from centre to centre. A 
rail of foreign fir, 4 inches iquafe, is pinned down to them ; and another rail. 
of the £une dimenfioof, is laid over it, and the wfaok wcU beat up in good clay ; 
on the top of the upper rail is laid a bar of malleable iron, of I j inches breadthi 
and nearly fix-8«hs thick. The waggons have caft iron wheels, %^\ inches diamc. 
ter, and are fuppofed to' weigh altogether about a ton. A waggon carries 30 cwt- 
of coal^, and j waggons are linked together by chains ; fo that z horfc draws 
j^\ tons of coal at once ; and the declivity of tlie way is fo gentle, that the fame 
horfc draws with cafe the ^ empty waggons back to the coai-hilL , The advan- 
tage of puttiilg the weight into 3 waggons, in pUce of z, is very coufiderable : 
They are eafier to fill and empty ; and the throwing the weight over a greater 
furface, does lefs damage to the waggon way, and is likcwife eafier for the 1 
horfe as it is well known, that almoft the only Hxch a horfie has, on a good 
waggon way, is in the firft ftarting of the w;:ggon ; therefore, if the whole 4^ 
tons were put into one waggon, the difficulty would be great \ hut as the wag- 
gons, 



6 it StatyOcal Aicount 

The large coal fent to fea is fold at the Ihore, firom 8s. 6df 
to 5^* per chalder, of 30 cwt. The fmaller coals, ivhich are 
called cbawsy are fold on the coal^hill, for 13d. per cart f qf 
6 cwt. — The cod of the barooj of Alloa is thought to be the 
brtheft weft of anj coal north of the Forth.— -The colliers 
prefef working in fhe night tinne ; fome go into the pits be-r 
tween 8 and 9, and others again later. Thofe who are anxioas, 
on any 'particular occafion, to draw a large fum on the Satur- 
day, continue a very long time at t)ieir yrork : The ufpal time 
is from xo to 11 hours. The men are, in geueral, rather of 
a low ftature, though there are fome of them 6 feet. Manjr 
of the young women are pretty. On Sundays and holidays, 
both men aqd women are clean and neatly dreffed. I'hey eat 

copfiderably 

gottf , what ftioding ftiil, are clofe t« one tnotfaer, and the chains that link 
them together are % feet long, the horfe hat only 30 cwt. of coals to pat in mo- 
tion ; for, when he ftaru the firft waggon, the impetus of it, if it ^oei not ac^* 
tually move, at leaft greatly al&amp;ftt In monng the fecond and third. The firft 
expence of making this kind of waggon way, is undouhtedly great, being 91^ 
leaft I OS. per running yard ; yet the proprietor has been long ago reimborfcd, 
and is a confiderable gainer ; for although this road has been made thefe 6 years, 
it has required no repair worth mentioning, and it is npw near as good as when 
firftlaid. 

f Aboat $s ycv^ 3|r^* tl^* l^i°l ^^ coal was fold for 6d. The price has 
f ifrn gradually as the demand has increafcd. The confumptioo of coal in Scotland 
is confiderably greater than formerly; which is probably owing, in fome meafurc, 
to the improvements of agriculture, &amp;c. the country people having icarnt to 
efiimate the value of their time ; and) by calculating how much is confumed in 
making peats, they find, th«t coals, though brought from a great diOance, 
is a cheaper, as well as a pleafanter fuel. — The cfieA that any extraorXnary ^tf^ 
irefs in tlie country has, on the fale of coal, is very evident. On the (hock that 
credit received, by the great failures in 1772, the fale of coals, at this port, diffli« 
nifhed 6ne third ; and it was 4 years before the ufual^ demand ioA place ; An^ 
the conScqnenccs of the miferablc crop in X78», were felt, pretty nearly in fhf 
fame manner, in x 783.

iiionfiderably more meat thaa other labourers, and «re, on the 
Whole, a happy race of people. They are generally healthy ; 
few of tbem, however^ work at the coal wall after 63 years 
bf age; but they are able to do foine eafy work below ground, 
for many years after that tioie of life. The women live 
longer than the men*

Here bred to thefe woollen emplojmenu. An early edneatibcj 
in this branch gave theni a great fuperioritj ; and this pre* 
eminence opened np a variety of marketSi both at home and 
abroad^ Great quantities were fent to England ; which^ after 
being drefled up, and finiihed off with a peculiar neatneils^ 
were returned and fold in our markets, at a very advanced 
price. The late Lord Cathcart, when prefiding at the 
Board of Police, was attentive to this circumftance, alid pro* 
pofed to bring people from England, who ibould inftrua them 
in drcf&amp;ng their caihblets. At that time the defnand il^as 
great, and the patriotic propofal was not accepted. Till withia 
thefe few years loo looms have been employed in this branch. 
Whether the demand for camblets has diminifhed, or that the 
young people have figured to themfelves an eaiier, or more 
fp^bdy way of getting wealth, by the fea, or the occupations 
cannefted with the diflillery, or to whatever caufe it is owing^ 
there is undoubtedly a great decreafe in this manufafture. 
At prefent, there are oot above 40 camblet looms, and per- 
haps as many employed in ferges, and inferior Jbrts of woollen 
fluffs. The manufadure of narrow apd broad cloths has been 
lately introduced, and promifes well. Scotch, llnglifh, and 
Spanifh wool have all been made nfe of in this trade ; and

,9 of whom had but little employment : There are now 14. 
JSome of them carry on a pretty extenfive trade. The mode of

it is no uncommotn fight to fee 60, 80, or 100 reapers in one 
field. Of late, there haye been undertakers for cutting down 
a.farmer*s crop, at 5s., 5s. 6d., or 6s. per acre, according to 
the apparent eafe or difiiculty of the work. 

Poor, — ^The number of poor, who were formerly obliged 
to accept of conftant ailiftance, was but few, while thofe who 
Aood in need of occafional aid were numerous ; and yet the

* The Lflgiilatnre, id 159 1» plated the care of the poor m the Ki r ■•Sis sign ^ 
ivhich is an ecdefiaiUcal court. They have cftfiemed this ft moft important 
truft ; and have accordingly regarded it as their duty, to be perfe21y well ac- 
quainted with the fituation and difpofitioit, of thofe who appty for relief; and 
af&amp;fted them in proportion, from the colledbions made at the church doors, and 
' other fmall duel payable to the feffioti ; which were, for the moft part, found 
fuflicicnt for the purpofe. Under fnch attentive and careful management, the 
ad, 1671, was, for the moft part, found nnneceffary ; and therefore, it is believed , 
was nenr put in prvAice in any pariih, until the hard winter of 1740. By this 
ad " the heritors, minifteirs and elder* of every pariih, were required to make 
"* a lift of all the poor within the parifh, to liquidate a yearly Aim for their 
^ maintenance ; the one half to be paid by the heritors, the other half by the 
* othcr^houfeholders.** In X 740, fome counties and particular parilhes, in order to 
oblige abfent heritors, to contribute their ihare towards aflifting the poor in their 
ciiftrefs, began to enforce it ; and moft of them have ever fince followed that 
method* although it has brought on fome few difputes about fettlemeots, and 
other difagreeable circumftances attendant on all rates. But the greater part of 
^e country moft happilj.continued to intruft the management of the poor to the 
Icirk-ld&amp;ua ; and it may therefore be fairly prefumed, that m^ft of the kirk* 
£iffioBs m Scotland have been as attentive to this important part of their duty, 
as the feilion of this parifli ; who have executed tbeic tnift, fior this century paft, 
moft faithfully and jadicioufly.

The ftccount of the poor, from which this abftrafi is taken, 
affords many particulars worthy of obfervation ; but it is too 
irolnaunous for this work. Ija general, the number of poor 
feems to have increaled, when the price of meal was high ; 
but although the price was foon reduced, it was a or 3 years 
^fore the numbers returned to the common average ; and in 
iav» years the poor were numerous, although the price of 
sneal was moderate. ^ 

• The coUe&amp;ions at the thurch doors prove the propriety of 
that method of gathering alms. The diminution tha^ began 
to take place in them about 1734, was probably occafionedby 
the feceiEon from the church, as the coUeiftion at die meeting- 
houfe was never taken, (although the law would have allowed 
this to be done), the funds muft confequently have fufiered. 
The afliftance given to the paupers, on the ordinary lift, in 
169X, was z6d. per month. This, at firft view, will appear 
irery inadequate ; and yet there is no tradition of the poor 
liaving been neglefted, or of their fuffering greater dilhefs than 
itt prefent. About the year 1720, a greater allowance was 
given in extraordinary cafes ; but the i6d. per month flill 
•continued the ufual aiBfiance till 1776, when applications 
for afliftance from the kirk-feifion became more frequent and 
preffing ; fo that the minifter was induced to apply to the he- 
ritors, and the reft of the pariihioners, for fome enlargement 
of the fuods, and an aid to prevent ftrolling beggars from 
preying on the pariih ; when an annual contribution was 
cheerfully agreed to, and liberally fubfcribed for. Moft of 
the occafional poor, at that time, were thought proper objeds 
to be put on the ordinary lift. Such of the poor as are put 
on the ordinary lift, are oblig^^o fubfcribe a writing, mak- 
ing over to the heritors, and kirk-feiBon, all their little clothes 
and moveables, which, at their death, are fold for theiocreafe 
^l the fund. This is intended to cut off all improper appli-

The ufiul allawaaice given to a pauper, on the ordinarj . 
lift, is 33. per month. This allowance, though ic maj appear 
fcanty Co fuch as have never thought on the Xnbjed, is ra* 
ther ample, when cpn^pared with that given in 1691. Meal 
was then almoft the only food of the poor ; and the price of 
at, taken on an average of 25 years, was, by the Mid- Lothian 
£ars, xis» per boU, or SAd. per peck. The wages of a la- 
bourer waa then from 5d« to 6d# per day. Th^y i|ow get 
from zod. to is. ; and in all probability they get more con- 
ftant employment -, and the price of meaU by the fame fiars 
and average,:is i^s, s-/«d. per boll, or lO^Ad. per peck. Nor 
do the poor any longer depend folely on meal for their food, 
88 that oftoft agreeable and nouriihing root, the potatoe^ is 
every where raifed in great qnantities, and is happily become 
the ** fuilenance of the poQr» and luxury of the rich**** The 
medium price of it here is from 4d. to 4Tid. per peck, 
weighing full 20 lb« Dutch weight, about equal to ax | lb. 
avoirdupois. It is to be lai^nted, however, that this bleffing 
does not kfien the number of applications for aid from the 
parifh : On the contrary, they are becoming more frequent ; 
«nd receiving pariih ai&amp;ftaoce is no longer looked on, by the 
poor themfelves, or even th^ir relations, wi]^ that horror it 
was formerly. When the receiving pariih fupply comes to 
be regarded as a common occurrence, it is obvious, that the 
poor's rates f will become general in Scotland, unlefs thegreateft 
attention is paid by all ranks of people to prevent it. The 
management of the poor is a moft difficult buGnefs. It is 9er- 
tainly the wifli of every benevolent perfon, to relieve their 
wants as far as poffiUe ^ but to edabliih rates, is creating a 
bnrdcn on the induftrions, without giving relief to the pauper.

church wardens and overfeers* ; as it is no longer confidered, that the concurrence 
«f the inhabitants, for making a rate, is at all neceflary. Though the law requires

Bierc matter of form ; f for, when jufEices have refufed their confent, the Court

CfiJlomJtouJi^ Sec. — The pi^blic revenue and nmtters of trade, 
are ^managed b^ a cuftom^houfe, which was e&amp;abliihed here a 
ihort time after the Union. It ytz^ at firft only a creek, be* 
longing to the port of Bortowftowoneds. The port of Alloa 
not only comprehends th^ town of Al^oa, bat alfo the creeks 
of Clackmannan! Kennetpans, Kincardine, Cambus and Ma** 
nor, on the north fide of the river; Airth, Punmore, or 
EIjAbfloney and.Fallini on the fouth, together with the flior^ 
of Stirling. — The Ihips and yeflels belonging to the port, bjr 
the rett^ma lately made, amount to 1 1 5 ; their tonnage to 7,24 1 ; 
for the navigation whereof 500 men are employed. Th^ 
fiaple trade for thefe (hips is coal. Tlie greateft number of 
the vefTels are employed in the coaft trade-. About 50,000 
tons of coal are annually fcnt, frpqpi the port (o places withia 
the frith of Fgrth, and to parts in the eaft and north of Scot« 
land. The export and import trade is alfo confiderable { it is 
9arrie4 to an4 from the pqr^s of PenpaarJ^ Norway, Ger-» 

mapy, 

|bake up the defidencj, tlitt might bay(» happened, firom the falling off of the 
camblet trade. 

The enlargement of the ferms would probably have been given, at a principal 
realbn for the diminution, if the 3 enumerations had not proved, that the country 
part of the pariih at leaft was not decreaicd. The largeft farm wat let between 
(he yean 1 784 and l^%%% and the nmbett in thf country |iad incrc^fcd in thofe 
(ew yeart 2% foals. The diminution is }.i-incip;(lly in the town of 4-iloa, which 
has indeed been moft rapid and aftoniihingi and can only be accounte( for, by the 
failure of the great diftilleries in the neighbourhood, who purchafcd large quan- 
tities of malt made in this town 1 which bufmeft employed a e«nfiderab!e nvm« 
ber of hands in carrying it on, who were fuddenly thrown oot of employmcBt; 
f nd much about the fame time, a cotton work was fct up at Down, which iy not 
above 10 or i% miles to the weftward of this parifli ; and the report, of their 
giving great en. oungrment, to the young as well as the old, probably induced 
pnany to emigrate from this pariih, aod thereby has occafioncd a temporary de* 
creafc : But as the collieries, and other branches of trade, are in a very fiourifll* 
M^.% way, it is nrobable that a fliort tiipe will replace the deficicnc}.

Chtrcb, l^r.--The church of Alloa was repaired and eii'* 
larged in 1680, bj virtue of a commiffion from the archbifiiop 
of St. Andrews. Its length is 65 feet, excluiive of Mr. 
£dkine*s aifle ; and the breadth 30 feet, befides X2 feet of ad- 
dition to the north. At the weft end it has 2 rows of gal- 
leries. It is now too fmall and incommodious for the numer- 
ous inhabitants of this parifli ; for it is extremely crowded 
when there are 900 hearers, which is often the cafe. There 
have been many deliberations about building a new one, for 
upwards of 30 years paft. To this the heritors are ftrongly 
encouraged, by a donation lately made of i,20ol. by Lady 
Charlotte Erskine* ; who alfo left 800I. Sterling, the in- 
tereft of which is to be applied for an affiftant minifter, whofe 
income altogether now exceeds 70I. per annum. — The prefent 
€hurch has a good appearance to the fouth. The front is of 
hewn ftone. There is a (latue in a niche of St. Mungo,

which fum was to go towards augmenting the falary of the aflift|^ rain-fter. 
Many years ago, an afUftant miniller was eftabliQiad here, by a ^P^ion from

The company was diflblved many years ago ; and the 6ocl. was allowed to re-

unfortunately became bankrupt fome years afterwards, and the whole was loft, 
and nothing left for the afiiftant miniftcr, but the rents of the houfes. This lofs

* Speaking of the public works oecciTary for the improvement of Scotland , 
Lord Marr dya, ** All way« of improving Edinburgh ihould be thought on : 
*' as, in particular, making a large bridge, of three arches, over the grounds be* 
** twizt the North Loch and Phyfic Gardeif, from the High Street at Halker- 
^ ftone*s Wynd to the M'lltnrfey Hill, where mat y fine ftreett might be built, 
** as the inhabitants increafed. The accefs to them would be eafy on all hand«, 
** and the fituation would be agreeable and convenient, hating a noble profpe^ 
** of all the fine ground towards the fea, the frith of Forth, and coaA of Fife. 
" One- large and long ftrect, in a ftraight line, where the Long Gate it now ; 
** on one fide of it would be a fine opportunity for gardens down to the North 
** JL«ch ; and one on the other fide, towards Broughton. No boufes to be on 
** the bridge, the breadth of the North Loch ; .but, felling the places nn the 
" ends of the bridge for houfcs,and the vaults and arches below for warchoufes 
" and cellars, the charge of the bridge might be near defrayed. 

** Another bridge might alfo be made on the other fide of the town, and al- 
" mod as ufeful and commodious as that on the north. The place where it 
*« could be moft cafily made is St. Mary's ^ynd and the Pleafants. The hollow 
" there is not fo deep as where the other bridge is propofed ; fo that it is thought

K great improvement to Scotland, as well as of great fervice to the trade of the 
« whole iiland, efpecially the India trade, by (aving 1 daiigerous long pailag» 
• round Britain, fince, by that canal the weft and eafr fea would be joined. 
•• The way for leading of thii canal is from near Glafgow, by KiUyth, to the 
ic month of the river Carron below Falkirk. It is practicable, as Mr. Adair, 
« Mr. Smith, Mr. M'Gill, and Mr. Sorocold judged, who travelled twice over 
*■ the ground, with a view to this work. From the hills of Campfie, and the 
« river Carron they thought there ^ould be water fufficient gol for filling the 
*' canal ; and that, by the afllfiance of feveral fluices near to Olafgow and fome 
^ in other parts, the canal would be made pradicable for flat bottomed boats of 
^ a very confiderable burden. They computed that 30,0001. Seeding might da 
** the work; but, (hould it coft the double, it would be well beftowed, and be 
«* foon repaid by the profit arifing from the canal." 

Having faid fo much of this unfortunate nobleman, it is no more than juftico 
to the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring parifiies, to mention theiir 
behaviour to him during his exile, while the eftate continued under the dire^on 
of the commiffioncrs of the forfeited eftates. They contributed confiderably 
towards aflifting him under hii misfortunes. Kor {bould an inOance of gratitude
