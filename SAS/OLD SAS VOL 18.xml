<p>Name, Situation. 
^HE town of Kirkaldy has been called by its prefent" 
name, as far back as there are any records of it. It is 
fuppofed to have derived its name from the Culdees, (the Kel 
dei as they are often called in the Old Charters), of whom it

* Statijfical Account 

Fife, on the Frith of Forth, about 10 miles north of Edin- 
burgh. It is the feat of one of the four prefbyteries which 
compofe the provincial fynod of Fife*; and, alternately 
with Cupar, the ordinary feat of the fynod. 

Extent. — The pari/h of Kirkaldy, fo palled from the town, 
is a kind of irregular oblong, extending from S. E. to N. W. 
between 2 and 3 miles, and from N. E, to S. W. about one 
mile. It is bounded on the S. E. by the Frith, on the N. E. 
by the parifh of Dyfart, on the N. W. by the parifhes of Dy- 
fart and Ach|erderran, and on the S. W. by the parifh of 
Abbotfhall. 

This laft parifh, with the exception of 3 farms which be- 
longed to Kinghorn f, was originally a part of the parfonage 
of Kirkaldy. In 1649, the prefbytery on an application from 
the heritors, found that a new kirk fhould be eredted in the 
parifh of Kirkaldy, for the accommodation of the parifhion- 
ers; and recommended to the Commiflioners of the Parliament 
for furrenders and tythes, to carry the erection into effect. 
The next year, the new parifh of Kirkaldy, fince called Abbot-' 
jhall was ere&amp;ed ; and the parifh of Kirkaldy proper, has from 
that time been confined nearly to the burgh, the burgh acres, 
and the common land and moor ; comprehending, in all, an 
extent of about 870 Scotch acres. 

AfpeB of the town. — The town of Kirkaldy is fituated at the 
foot of a bank, on the fea-fhore, along which it ftretches the 
whole breadth of the parifh. It is properly but one long 
flreet, with a few lanes of fmall extent opening on each fide 
of it. The principal part of the ftreet appears to have been 
originally wider than it is now, many of the houfes on both

fides of it {hewing internal evidence *, that they have at fome 
time or other been extended beyond their firll limits, and 
that the property of individuals has been enlarged by encroach- 
ments on that of the community. At prefent, the flreet is 
narrow, in fome places inconveniently fo ; winding and ir- 
regular ; deformed by the frequent projection of contiguous 
houfes and flairs ; and as the traveller daily feels, wretchedly 
paved f. The houfes are in general mean, aukwardly placed 
with their ends to the ftreets, and conflrucled without any 
regard to order or uniformity. Of late, however, a better 
ftile of building has begun to be introduced ; and differ- 
ent fpecimens have been given of an improving tafte in archi- 
tecture. 

- Public Buildings, Toivn-houfe.—The only public buildings 
worthy of notice are, the town-houfe and the church. The 
town-houfe, which was rebuilt in 1678, (lands near the mid- 
dle of the town, and contains the hall in which the magif- 
trates and council affemble for conduding the ordinary bufi-' 
nefs of the burgh. Here too the baillies hold a weekly 
court for judging in queftions between the burgeffes ; and 
the juftices of the peace have occafional meetings for deter- 
mining queftions of revenue, and difcuffing petty caufes that 
are brought before them from the furrounding diftricT. Over 
the town-houfe is the prifon, with feparate apartments for 
debtors and criminals ; and under it the guard-houfe, the 
meal-market, and the public weigh-houfe. The whole forms 
a pbun budding of hewn-ftone, ornamented with a tower and

fpire. The tower contains the town-clock and bell, and 
ferves as a repofftory for the archives of the Burgh. 

The Church— -The church {lands on an elevated fituation, 
on the top of .the bank, which rifes immediately behind the 
town. Jt is a large unfhapely pile, that fecms to have been 
reared at different times, to fuit the growing population of 
the pariih, and in the conftrudion of which convenience has 
been more confulted than unity of defign or beauty. The 
nave or body of the church, is in the antient Gothic, or rather 
tlx Norman ftile of architecture ; without buttreiTes ; with 
low femicircuhir arches, fupported by fhort thick columns, 
and having aides behind them. The choir is fitted up in com- 
mon with the nave for the reception of the parifhioners ; and 
a large wing has been added for their farther accommodation. 
Clofe to one end of the church (lands the fteeple ; which in 
its original form was a plain, and not unhandfome fquare 
tower with a cornice, above which it was covered with a 
roof. But it has been raifed beyond its original height, by the 
addition of a fmaller, and a very difproportionate tower, ter- 
minating in a pyramid. • 

The Siimls — On the one fide of the town, the fea is feparated 
from it by a beach of firm and level fand ; on which the in- 
habitants have always, excepting at the height of the tide, a 
fufe and agreeable walk ; and by which the traveller may 
generally avoid the uneafy jolting of a long and rugged pave- 
ment. As the fand continues firm and fmooth, and the ground 
ihelves gradually for a great way into the fea, this place is pe- 
culiarly favourable for fea bathing ; for which purpofe there 
has been for fome years an increafing rcfort to it, during the 
months of fummer and harvclt.

Afteft of the Pari/h. On the other fide of the town, the 

country immediately joins it, and rifes by a gentle but varied 

afcent, almoft to the oppofite extremity of the parifh 

Taking the parifh by itfelf, the face of it prefents little to the 
view that claims particular notice. In the vicinity of the 
town, where the foil is light and dry, and very fufceptible of 
cultivation, the fields are in general inclofed, and in a regu- 
lar courfe of tillage; and exhibit an appearance in no foiall 

degree pleafing. Farther back, the ground has been more 

recently brought into culture ; and the foil appears to be 
lefs kindly in its nature, and lefs fufceptible of improve- 
ment. But an extenfive proprietor, Mr Ofwald of Dunni- 
keer, having now built a manfion houfe on a fine command- 
ing fite, in the center of the grounds which are at prefent 
the leaft cultivated*, the plan of cultivation and of ornament 
which he has begun, will foon improve the appearance of 
that part of. the parifh. In the profpecl: of building, that 
gentleman fometime ago inclofed and planted a romantic val- 
ley, which ftretches from the eaft end of Kirkaldy towards 
the fite of his new houfe. This valley is now beginning to 
be clofely and beautifully wooded : Fanciful walks, pardy of 
turf, and partly of gravel, are cut through it in different di- 
reaions. To thefe the more refpeaable inhabitants of the 
town are indulged with accefs ; and enjoy in this refpeft 
an advantage which the vicinity of few towns can furnifh. 

Relative Situation.— \{ this parifh, taken by itfelf, affords 
but little to admire in its general appearance, the defea is 
abundantly fupplied by its relative Gtuation.-Cornrnanding 
from different points, a full profpea of the adjacent coun- 
try, from Dyfart on the eaft, to the green-toped hills of 

Gla lsmount 

* The Burgh moor. 



6 Statijlical Account 

Glafsoount on the weft ; and the eye embracing within that 
range the profperous town of Path-head, with the once royal 
cattle of Ravenfheugh * feated on a cliff overhanging the 
Tea ; the town and harbour of Kirkaldy ; the induftrious 
town of Linktown, with the modern church of Abbotfhall; 
the high-placed manfion, the pifturefque grounds, and the 
extenfive improvements, of Mr Fergufon of Raith 5— and 
having extended before it the Frith of Forth, Ikirted by 
the coaft of Lothian from Edinburgh to North-Berwick, 
diverfified by the iflands of Inch-Keith, Bafs, and May, and 
enlivened by a conftant fucceffion of fhips of all burdens, 
paffing and repaffing on their deftined voyages :—The parifh 
of Kirkaldy thus fittfated, forms part of a fcene, in which 
the beauties of external nature, and interefting difplays of 
the operation of mind, are in no ordinary degree united. 

Air and Climate^— Afcending N. W. from the head of the- 
bay which is called by its name, this parifh lies much expofed 
to the eafterly winds. Thefe, efpecially during the latter 
part of fpring, blow frequently, and bring up from the fea, 
a thick difagreeable haze, that renders the air moift and pier- 
cingly cold. But as the wefterly winds prevail, during at 
leaft two thirds of the year, the air is upon the whole dry, 
kindly and wholefome. 

Difea[es.-r-\X. maybe owing partly to this caufe, that there 
are few difeafes which can properly be faid to prevail here j 
and that even thefe few are feldom marked with any peculiar 
fymptoms of violence. The moll prevalent difeafe is the 
chronic rheumatifm, which chiefly affec"ls th£ aged, and even 
thefe chiefly among thofe dalles which are expofed to hard 

labour

labour in the open air. A fpecies of fever with nervous fymp- 
toms, but of no diftinft or regular type, has fome years been 
frequent, particularly in the beginning of winter, and in fpring. 
Children have been more fubjecl: to it than adults. Children are 
frequently and fatally affedted by the difeafe which is called the 
croup. Inftances of confumptions now and then occur, chiefly 
in young females. The palfy, which not long ago was fo rare, 
as to have been vulgarly accounted a fpecial vifitation of God, 
is now by no means uncommon. Scrophulous taints are not 
much known here ; and the meafles, fmall-pox, and other 
epidemical eruptives are obferved to be ufually milder than 
even in the neighbouring parifhes. Innoculation for the 
fmall-pox ispra&amp;ifed with the happieft effect. The religious 
fcruples, which long prevented the general ufe of this falutary 
invention, are every day diminiftifng ; the body of the peo- 
ple yielding to the impreffion of that convincing atteftation in 
favour of it, which Divine Providence has given in its fignal 
fuccefs. 

Longevity. — The inhabitants in general are healthy ; and 
many of them attain a good old age. It is no unfatisfying 
proof of this, that in four years preceeding 1793, tnere lived 
in the parifli 47 perfons who reached the age of 80, the full 
half of which number were alive at one time ; that in five 
years preceding 1791, four inftances occurred in which the 
marriage relation had fybfifted above half a century ; and 
that on an average of 14 years preceding 1.788, the annual 
burials were but as 1 to 59 of the population. 

Population.-^ the firfl day of January 1790, there were 
in the town of Kirkaldy 646 families, containing 2607 fouls; 
in the country parifh, 15 families, containing 66 fouls; in 

the 



8 Statijlical Account 

the whole parifh, 661 families, containing 2673 fouls*: of 
whom 521 were under, and 2152 above, 8 years of age.— 
Of thofe who were above that age, 908 were males, and 1244 
females. The proportion of fouls to a family was 4^ in the 
town, 4± in the country, 4*. in the whole parifh. 

Divifion of the Inhabitanti in 1790.— The inhabitants, reck- 
oning thofe only who had families, or who did bufinefs on 
their own account, were in general divided in the following 
manner :

State of Hufbandry.— Oi thofe who are more or lefs engaged 
in hufbandry, the whole number, including 5 proprietors, is 
25. Many of thefe occupy but a few acres, which they 
cultivate for the fake of accommodation more than of gain. 
This circumftance is not favourable to good hufbandry. The

lar exertion which is neceffary to fuccefs. 

Some other objett engages the firft care ; and the few 
acres are negleded. At any rate, if they anfwer the pur-

m any confidcrable quantity, is in general cultivated with at- 
tention and fuccefs. 

Means of cultivation. -The means of cultivation are here 
obtained with little difficulty. The ftables and ftreets of the 
town afford a regular fupply of manure ; but what is collected 
from the ftreets is lefs valuable, on account of a mixture of 
fand which it receives from the houfes of the ordinary clafs of 

inhabitants, whofe floors are frequently covered with it 

Lime is to be had at a fhort diRance, and at a moderate ex- 
pence ; but it has hitherto been fparingly ufed, particularly 
on the lands lying neareft to the town ; in the idea that the 
foil is too light and warm to permit it to be ufed with fafety. 
Sea-weeds furnifh an occafional accefiion of valuable manure, 
but in a quantity that bears no proportion to the extenfive de- 
mand for it. 

Improvements™ Hujlandry. — The mode of culture has of 
late undergone fome important alterations. The tillage is 
improved ; to which drilling and hoeing, now much ufed in 
all crops, have not a little contributed. Green crops are in- 
troduced ; and the proportion of land employed in them is 
every year increafing. The rotation of crops is better regu- 
lated ; the alternate fucceffionof culmiferous and leguminous 
crops being pretty generally attended to. The implements of 
hufbandry are improved ; particularly the plough. Of this 
valuable inftfument, two kind;; are employed \ the common 
Scotch plough, which begins to be better conftru&amp;ed than 
formerly, and the chain-plough introduced by Small of Black' 
adder-mount. The former is flill the moft prevalent; for of 
24 ploughs ufed in the parifh, 17 are of this kind, and 7 of 
rfie other. The ploughs are all dtawn by horfes, generally 

two

two in each, guided by the ploughman. Oxen, though e- 
qually adapted to the purpofes of hufbandry when managed 
with fkill, though lefs expenfive in the purchafe and the 
maintenance, though equally, if not more durable, and though 
vaflly more valuable, when unfit for work, are here in total 
difufe ; and nearly fo in the whole furroundirig dif. 
tria. 

Cattle end Carriages.— The number of horfes employed in 
the parifh is 139 ; of which 94 are kept for work, 28 for the 
faddle, and 17 for carriages. The carriages are 9 in num- 
ber *, 2 coaches and 7 poft-chaifes. Of thefe a coach, and S 
chaifes are kept for hire. The number of carts is 73. The 
number of milk-cows is 98. Some individuals have been at 
pains to improve their breed of cows, and with good fuccefs. 
But cows are here kept lefs for breeding than for their milk, 
which is fold in the town with great advantage. They 
are commonly fed in the houfe ; the land near the town 
being too valuable to permit much of it to be employed in 
pafture. 

Rent.-Th* rent of land, fituated near the town, runs from 
three to four pounds the acre ; and decreafes, with the dif- 
tance, down to half a guinea. As the greater part of the 
panfh is cultivated by proprietors, the rent of the whole cannot 
be certainly known : but it is computed at L. ,250 fterling , 
which ,s to L, I320 Scots, the valued rent, nearly as n 5 to

Crops j and times of Sowing and Reaping. — The crops ufually 
raifed on the land in tillage are; wheat, fown from the begin- 
ning of October to the end of November, and reaped from 
the 1 2th to the end of Auguft ; — barley, fown from the ift to 
the 20th May, and reaped from the middle of Auguft to the

March, and reaped from the 12th September to the 12th of 
October ; — potatoes, planted from the 20th April to the be-

tober ; — turnips, commonly fown about the 20th June; — clover, 
and generally a fmall proportion of rye-grafs with it, fown 
from the 20th April to the end of May ; and always fown

ffijlory of the Burgh. — It is probable that the local advan- 
tages of vicinity to fuel, to land capable of producing grain, 
and above all to the fea, fo favourable to fubfiftence and fo 
ncceflary to commerce, brought men at rirft to fettle at thi* 
place. It is not known, however, at what particular time 
the town was built ; nor are there any traces of its hiftory be- 
fore it became one of the regality burghs of the lordfhip of 
Dunfermling. It was mortified A. D. 1334, by David II. to 

the 

alia, " to widen the roads to any breadth they fhall think proper, not exceed- 
" ing 40 feet ; and for that purpofe to pull down and demolifh any houfe or 
" building, as well ivithin royal burghs as without the fame ; paying fuch da- 
" mages to the owners or occupiers, as the /aid trujlecs fhall judge reafonable." 

Thefe powers are complained of : ift, As unprecedented and unknown in 
the other counties : ad, As trenching on the chartered rights of royal burghs ; 
the internal government of which is, by charters ratified by parliament, verted 
in their own proper magiftrates : 3d, As aftefting the fecurity of private pro- 
perty, which is thus left, in certain circumftances, to befeized without the 
cpnfent of the owner, and without any other compenfation to him, than 
what the very perfons who are to feize on it judgt reafonable. It is true, there 
lies an appeal on the value of the property to the Juftices of the Peace in 
their general feffions. But as the Juftices are truftees, and in point of in- 
fluence, the principal truftcs under the road aft, th* appeal is nearly from 
we defcription to another defcription of the fame perfons. If the public con- 
venience at times require that the property of individuals (hould be faenficed 
to it; jufticefurcly requires that thofe, whofe property is afTefted, ftioukl be 
fully indemnified,, and that too in the way in which they are moft likely to be 

fatisfied that the indemnification is adequate, the verdift of a jury. 

The confutation of the efTeft which the powers conveyed by the aft atlud- 
ed to might, if exercifed to their full extent, produce on Kirkaldy, has give, 
rife to thefe refleftions. Kirkaldy is properly but one long ftreet, th.ough * hicli 
the great county road at prefent paiTes. As the greater part of this ftreet is 
«nder 40 feet broad, the truftees have it in their power, if theyfiall think*,,, 
to bring it to the full ftatutory breadth, at the e,pence of half a mile of 
demohlhcd houfes ; the owners of which would be obliged to reft fatisfied with

it continued till A. D. 1450, when the commendator and' 
convent, by indentures made with the bailJies and commu- 
nity of Kirkaldy, difponed to them and their fucceffors for 
ever, the burgh and harbour, burgh acres, the fmall cuftoms, 
common pafture in the moor, courts, &amp;c. 

Chartered Privileges.- It was foon after erected into 

a royal burgh, with the cuftomary privileges : And 
thefe were fpecifically ratified by a charter of confirma- 
tion granted by Charles I. in 1644 ; and the burgh, for good 
and gratuitous fervice done by it, erected de novo into a free 
royal burgh and free port, and new and larger immunities 
granted it. Among its privileges were enumerated, the 
powers exprefsly given to the baillies, counfellors and com- 
munity, of electing and conftituting annual magiftrates for 
the adminiftration of juftice and the government of the burgh; 
of uplifting cuftoms and applying them to the public good j 
of holding courts of feizing and incarcerating, and punifhing 
delinquents ; with which were conjoined various other privi- 
leges expreffed in the barbarous language, and fomeof them 
conceived in the barbarous fpirit of the times ; fuch as 
herezelds, bludewits, merchetne mulierum, fork, fofs, fok, 
fak, thoill, thame, wraick, vert, weth, wair, venyfon, in-

Though there be no aurhentic record of the flate of Kir- 
kaldy, at the time it was disjoined from the lordfhip of Dun-, 
fermling, or firft erected unto a royal burgh, it may be 
warrantably fuppofed, that before either of thefe events could 
happen, the place mult have attuned to fome importance.

and navigation were in a great meafure confined to the towns 
which lay on both fides of the Frith of Forth. Thefe had 
•early applied themfelves to the bufinefs of fifhing *, which 
their favourable fituation enabled them to profecute with vi- 
gour and fuccefs. And fo diftinguifhed were thofe of them 
efpecially which lay on the north fide of the frith, that when, 
James VI. in 1602 planted a colony in Lewis, to introduce 
the fifliing trade^among the Weftern iflands, the colony was 
drawn from the coafts- of Fife f . The towns on the Frith of 
Forth too had almoft the exclufive pofleffion of the trade 
with the Low Countries, at that time the only branch of 
commerce of any importance, and were carriers for nearly 
the whole of the northern part of the United Kingdom. 

State in 1644. Of the advantages derived from both 

thefe branches of commerce, Kirkaldy appears to have enjoy- 
ed a principal fhare. Tradition relates that, when Charles I. 
ereded it anew into a royal burgh in 1644, it had an hun- 
dred fail of mips belonging to it. And the tradition is fup- 
ported, by an authentic account, preferved among the records 
of the burgh,of lofTes fuftainedbetwixt that time and the Refto- 
ration. From this account, in which the mafter's name, and 
the feparate value of each {hip are particularly fpecified, it 
appears, that 94 fhips belonging to this port, were during 
that period either loft at fea, or taken by the enemy. 

There are other circumftances too, which ferve to fhew

Early Population. ---i. The population of the parifh was' 
equal, or moft probably fuperior, to what it is at prefent. 
During a period of 14 years, commencing with 1616, the 
yearly average of raftered bjrths was. 121 ; which would 
make the population, computing it as 26 to 1 of the births, 
to have been 3146. For fome time after, the numbers 
appear to have increafed rapidly. In 1643 tne accommoda- 
tion of the parifh required a new wing to be added to the 
church ; ancl in 1^50 it was found neceffary to make a new 
erection «, The annual average of births, for 10 years im- 
mediately preceding the date of that erection, was 174^,' 
which made the whole population about 4541? ; and for the 
fame fpace of time immediately following it, 115; which made 
the population 2990. From this ftatement it appears, that, 
fuppofing the whole inhabitants to be as 2.6 to 1 of the births, 
the parifh of Kirkaldy wag more populous, for fome time after 
its firft reduction to its prefent limits, than it is at this day. 
And were the eftimate tp be made by the proportion which 
the prefent number of inhabitants actually bears to.

that time would appear to have been very confider- 
able f .

In this parilh, however, the computation falls fliort of the real proportion.

ral AfTembly of the pro'teftant churches in France deputed 
Bafnage to the King of Great Britain, to follicit aid forrefifting 
the oppreffibn of Lewis XIII. the town and parifh of Kirkal- 
dy contributed; according to the gudeioiil and perm ffton of the 
King, a pecuniary aid of 1030 merks *. During a period of 
12 years, from 1634 to 1645, at which time nioney was fo 
valuable as to bear intereft at 9 per cent, the weekly collec- 
tions at the church doors were greater than they are at pre* 
fent ; the average amounting to L. 73 : 10 ; while that of the 
fame number of years preceding 1791 does not exceed L. 63

Public Affeffmenis: — -In all public arTeftments, the town' 
was rated as the fixth burgh, and aflefled in the proportion of 
1 to 40 of the whole fupplies levied from the burghs of Scot- 
land f. For feveral years before and after 1650, the month-

and the whole annual births will, on an average of ao years, be 75 ; which, 
compared with the atoal numbers, is nearly in the proportion,of 1 to 35. Eft 
timatedby this proportion, the population frdm 1650 to 1660 would exceed 
4000. 

There is no public regirtcr of burials. But by a very exidl lift kept by the 
grave-d.gger for his own ufe, it appears, that the average of burials for 14 year*

Effefts of the Civil War. — —About the middle of the cen- 
tury, indeed, the profperity of this place received a confide- 
rable check. The quarrel of the Parliament of England with 
Charles I. having in 1643 extended to Scotland, the inhabi- 
tants of Kirkaldy had taken a decided part in it. Feeling 

that love of independence which the commercial fpirit gene- 
rates, and interefted in having the fruits of their induftry 
fecured from the gripe of arbitrary power, they had early ef- 
poufed the fide of liberty : And notwithstanding the conci- 
liating exercife of the royal prerogative, in renewing and ex- 
tending their charter in 1644, they had entered warmly into 
the views of the Parliament. The Solemn League and Cove- 
nant was publicly fworn, and fubferibed. And numbers, ef- 
pecially of the fearrien, joined the army of the Covenanters, 
and were prefent at the battle of Kilfyth f, in the event of

which this place fuffered the lofs of many of its mod a£live 

inhabitants. That unhappy event was followed by a fuc- 

ceffion of misfortunes. No lefs than 58 mips, belonging to 
this port, were either taken or loft at fea, before the EnglHh 
invafion in 1650 ; and from that time to the Reftoration, 36 
mips' more were taken, many of them with cargoes ; making 
in all (as Hated in page 17.) 94 fhips, the vaiue of which is 
afcertained, by a particular appretiation contained in the ac- 
count of lofles already mentioned, to have amounted to the 
fum of L. 53, 791 fter ling. A confiderable number of thefe 
fhips were taken in the harbour of Dundee, when that town 
was ftormed and facked by General Monk ; at which time, 
too, effe&amp;s belonging to the inhabitants of Kirkaldy which 
had been depofited at Dundee as a place of fecurity, were 
carried away or deftroyed, to the value nearly of L. 5000 *. 
Belides this, different individuals fullered the lofs of - money, 
which they had lent to the Committee of Eftates for the pub- 
lic fervice, but which on the eftabliflimenc of the Common- 
wealth it was impoflible to recover f. In confequence of thefe 
heavy lofles, and the (till greater lofs of 480 men killed in 

the 

of thofe who had joined the army, were many of them affirted by public con- 
tributions. Deferters were cited before the kirk-feffion : there is an inftance

the courfe of the war *, the commerce and (hipping of Kirkai- 
dy were deeply affeded. And through the fubfequent inter- 
ruption df the trade with Holland, during three fucceffivc 
wars With that country, aided perhaps by the unfriendly in- 
Hucnce of an arbitrary government on the general fpirit and 
exertions of the people, the place continued to languid 
*mng the ufurpation of Cromwell, arid the defpotic reigns of 
Charles 11. and his fucceflbr James. In 1673 the number of 
*hrps belonging to it had fallen to 2 S . And in 1682 its dif- 
trefs was fo great, that application was made to the Convention 
of burghs to confider its poverty, and to take methods for 
eafing it as to its public burdens. But the burgh having 
fallen under the difpleafure of the Court, on account of the 
Oppofition given by its reprefentative to the arbitrary meafures 
which were then carrying on, the inhabitants Were not 
Only denied relief* but further burdened by an addition of 
2000 merks to their annual affeflment f. The application to 
the Convention was however renewed in 1687, when a vi^- 
fitation of the brirgh Was ordered. A committee appointed 
for that purpofe met at Kirkaldy the following year; and, on 
the evidence of the books and declarations both of the ma- 
gistrates of the burgh and the officers of the cuftoms, repor- 
ted, inter alia, to the Convention, « that the cuftoms payable

Revolution in 1688. — Before the effe£t of this reprefentatio'n 
could be known, the Revolution took place ; an event highly 
grateful to the Scots in general, and particularly to the nvhigs 
ef Fife. The inhabitants of Kirkaldy, entering warmly into 
the fpirit ot it, and anxious to diftinguifh themfelves in the 
fupport of it, found means to apprehend the Earl of Perth, 
who was Lord Chancellor, and bad managed the affairs, of 
Scotland under James; and who knowing that he was generally 
obnoxious on account of the cruelties which he had pra£Hfed 
on the Prefbyterians, withdrew himfelf as foon as the pub- 
lic mind had declared in favour of the Prince of Orange. 
After detaining that nobleman in prifon 5 days and 5 nights, 
under a conftant guard of 300 men, they fent him under a 
Convoy of 3 boats manned with 200 hands to Alloa, where 
they delivered him on receipt into the cuftody of the Earl of 
Mar. The guard of 300 men they found it necefTary to 
keep up for 4 months^ on receiving information that a force 
was coming from the Highlands to burn the town, in re- 
venge for Perth's apprehepfion, — -Thefe fafts, an d a par- 
ticular account of their lofles, having been flared in a peti- 
tion to King William in 1689!, they obtained an abatement

through the country in general, the languifhing trade of 
Kirkaldy revived, and wealth began again to circulate among 
the inhabitants. As one indication of this, the public col- 
ledions at the church doors, which, on an average of 10 years 
preceding 1688, amounted only to L. 58 : 3 : 1, and on that 
year fell to L. 42 : 18 : 7^ produced annually for 4 
years, commencing with 1693, L. 125:7: io ; and L. no 
8s. 2d. on an average of 15 years from 1693 to the 
Union. 



Effe&amp;s of the Union.— This lafl event, whatever advantages 
have been ultimately derived from it to the nation at large, 
was long confidered as an sera of misfortune and diitrefs to 
the trade of Scotland. Taxes, which by the treaty of union 
were kid on many of the necefTaries of life, the duties and 
cuftoms which were impofed on various articles of merchan- 
dife, and the numerous reftrictions with which the Englifli 
contrived, in the narrow fpirit of commercial monopoly, to 
fetter the trade of Scotland in general, were quickly and fe- 
verely felt over the whole of this part of the united kingdom. 
Commerce every where declined j in fpite of the attempts 
which were made to fupport it by the wretched refource of 
fmuggling. It fuffered particularly in the towns on the 
Frith of Forth ; many of which were quickly reduced to dif- 
trefs, and all of them languilhed. This town was involved 
in the common fate. Its fhipping, on which it had till then 
entirely depended, fell rapidly into decay ; and the feveral 
wars, which followed each other with little intermifiion 
for more than half a century, having continued the effect 
which the difadvantageous terms of the Union had begun, 
the trade of this place was at lafl; fo much reduced, that in

two ferry-boats, each of 30 *. 

On the return of peace in 1763^ the fhipping immediately 
revived. By the year 1772, it had increafed to 11 veflels, 
carrying 5 1 5 tons and 49 men ; and although its progrefs was 
retarded by the war with America, it amounted, at the clofe 
of that war, to 12 veflels, carrying 750 tons and 59 men;

Linen ManufaBures. — Theprofperity of this place, which was 
at firft begun; and for a long time entirely fupported by flap- 
ping and commerce, has of late been greaily promoted by 
manufactures ; and particularly by the manufacture of linen. 
The kinds of linen manufactured here are bed-ticks, chec- 
quered and ftriped linens, with a mixture of cotton in fome 
of them, arid a low-priced fpecies Of plain linen. Thefe ap- 
pear to have been taken from the models of Holland and Flan- 
ders ; the names which fome of the fabrics Mill bear, fuch as, 
ftriped Hollands, Dutch checks, Dutch ticks, Flanders checks 
and ticks, pointing their origin to the Low Countries. The 
particular time at which the maWa&amp;ure of thefe articles was 
introduced, is not exadly known ; but they can be traced 
back to the commencement of this century. And proba- 
bility fcems to fupport the opinion that they were intro- 
duced earlier ; perhaps between the middle of the laft 
century and the Revolution, when the dedenfion of their 
Navigation and trade, forced the inhabitants to have 
recourfe to new ways of employing their induftry. 

Manufactures, however, made but little proofs here, till 
the foreign trade had again declined in confequence of ' the 
Union. In 1733, the whole amount of cloth ftamped at 
Kirkaldy* was no more thm 177,740 yards. In 1743, it

had increafed to 316,55c, the computed value of which a- 
mounted to nearly L. 1 1,000 *. And, although during the 
commotions of 1745 and 1746, the fale of manufactures wa3 
in a great degree fuipended, yet that circumftaneedidnotmuch 
affecl their progrefs. They continued to be diligently pro- 
fecuted, and gradually to increafe, till the war of 1755 inter- 
rupted the communication with America and the Weft In- 
dies, at that time, almoft the only market for the goods of 
this diftricr. The efFecls of that interruption, the interval of 
■peace that fucceeded was not fufficient entirely to remove. 
From the value of L. 22,000, to which the manufactures of 
the diitrict bad in fome former years rifen, they fell in 1773 
to L. 15,000 ; and the next year ftill lower. Such indeed 

was 

the feller, and the fame fum on the buyer. For the convenience of dealers in 
linen, public offices are eflablifhed in different diftricts, under the authority 
of trujlees, whom his Majefty is impowered by the fame aft to appoint for 
tver','eeing, direcling, and improving, the linen manufaBure in Scotland. And thefe 
trufh.es have in fome inftances authorifed manufacturers to .(lamp their own 
cloth according to the directions of the act. 

Although the law requiring the (tamping of linen, was founded on appa- 
rent views of public utility, it is doubtful whether any advantage has been 
derived from it fufficient to compenfate the expence and lofsof time, to which 
the manufacturer is fubjected by it. The approbation of the flampmafter is 
never found to have any influence on the judgement of the merchant : Nor is 
it to be fuppofed, that a peifon, who has no connection with the trade, and 
whpfe emoluments depend on the quantity which he (lamps, will be equally 
fcrupulous of affixing the feal of his approbation, as if his intereft depended on 
the quality. If (lamping be found a necehary political regulation, the ends 
of utility appear to be bed attained, by giving the power of damping his own 
cloth to the manufacturer ; whofe credit and inrcieft, operate as a joint fecu • 
rity to the truttecs. ; and to the public, that no improper goods are fent int. 
the market. 

f At that time the whole cloth manufactured in the dirtrift, including the 
parifhes of Kirkaldy, Abbotlhall, Dvfait, Leflie, &amp;c. was damped here, ani 
is included in the computation.

was their ftate about that time, and fo unpromifing had the 
profpect become ; fir It, through the non- importation agree- 
ment of America, and afterwards, through the commence- 
ment of hoftilities with that country, that fome of the ma- 
nufacturers thought of turning their capital into a different 
channel. 

One of them *, however, previoufly refolved on an at* 
tempt to introduce the manufactures of this place into the in- 
ternal consumption of England. The attempt was made, 
and immediately fucceeded ; and the manufacture of checks 
and ticks having been of late refigned in many parts of that 
country, for finer and more profitable articles, and the dif- 
ference in the price of labour too, enabling the Scots ma- 
nufacturer to furnifh them at a tower rate, the demand from 
England has increafed ; and the trade has in confequence 
been progreflively advancing for 15 years, without fuf- 
fering any other interruption, than that periodical ftag- 
nation, which is produced in times of profperity by over- 
trading. 

At prefent the manufactures of Kirkaldy employ about 8 1 o 
looms \ \ of which about 250 are in the parifh about 300

* The late Mr. James Fergus, of the houfe of John Fergus and Sons ; to 
whofe difcernment and fpirit, the manufacturers of this diftricl owe their in- 
troduction to a market which of all others yields the quickeft and fureft rc" 
turns, the inland market of England. 

f This number is afcertained from lifts furnifhed by the manufacturers in- 
dividually. The whole diftricl employs about aooo looms ; the produce of 
which for the year ending ift November 1793, when the returns from the 
fiamp-ofnce to the truftees are made up, may be eftirnated at L. 1 10,000. 

\ The whole looms in the parilh, which are triple the number that 
they were 4 years ago, amount to 266. But of thefe from 10 to 16 are em- 
ployed by inhabitants of the neighbouring parifhes ; two of whom have ftiops 
here for the purchafe of goods, but arc not ranked among the manufacturers,

in the parifh of Abbotfhall, about 100 in the parifh of Dy- 
fart, about 60 in the parifh of Largo, and the reft feat tered 
over the neighbouring parifhes. The annual amount of a 
weaver's work (allowing for the variations of age, ability, and 
habits of application, among the whole weavers employed) is 
found to be at a medium from 10 to 12 pieces, meafuring 
one with another, about 1 10 yards. On this computation, 
the annual produce of a loom runs from nco to 1320 yards, 
worth on the loweft eftimate of yards, and at the average 
price of is. each *, L. 55 : And the annual produce of the 
whole looms employed amounts, on the fame eftimate, nearly 
to 900,000 yards f, worth at the fame average about L. 45,000. 
Reckoning 22 fpindles as the average quantity of yarn to 
a piece, 178,200 fpindles are annually manufactured into 
cloth. Of this quantity about a ninth part is cotton yarn ; 
which is fpun here, and in the neighbourhood, with the af« 
fiftance of machinery ; as mentioned formerly. The flax yarn 
has hitherto been fpun with the hand %. After the flax is 
heckled, the manufacturer fends it to Undertakers in different! 
paits of the country, who give it out to be fpun, and receive 
a certain commiffion on the quantity of yarn returned by them. 
The expence of fpinning, when commiffion and carriage are 
included, amounts at an average to is. 3d. the fpindle. Be-

* The piices of checks run from 6d. to is. 6d. per yard; of ticks, from 7cL 
to as. 6d. The proportion of plain linen is very inconfiderable, perhaps not 
as i to 500 of the whole, and the price is low. As the cheaper fabrics pre- 
vail, a low average is taken. 

f This is nearly as I to 5X of the whole linen made in the county of Fife, 
the amount of which for the year ending the ift, November 1793, was 
5,013,089 yards.

fides the yarn fpun on the manufacturers account, a confi- 
derable quantity is regularly bought in from the neighbour-! 
hood ; and frequently from Montrofe, Brechin, Cupar- An- 
gus, &amp;c. Of the whole linen yarn manufactured, about a 
feventh part is fpun from flax produced in the country ; and 
the Teft from flax imported, chiefly from Riga, at the average 
price of L.45, per ton. For fome years a confiderable 
quantity of yam has been brought into this port from Bremen 
and Hamburgh. The quantity has in one year amounted to 
441,400 lbs; which at 3 lbs. to' the fpindie, made 1475133 
fpindles. Of this, however, but a fmall proportion is com- 
monly ufed in the parifh ; and no great proportion in the 
neighbourhood. The far greater part of it is fent to 
Perth, Dunfermling, Falkland, Auchtermuchty, and fome 
other inland towns, in which coarfe linen is manufac- 
tured. 

Of the yarn ufed in making checks and ticks, about three- 
fourths are whitened, and the remaining fourth dyed. Moft 
of the principal manufacturers whiten and dye forthemfelves; 
the reft employ public bleachers and dyers. The different 
operations of heckling, fpiqning, dyeing, bleaching, warping, 
winding, and weaving, may be computed to employ $f hands 
to every loom , which makes the whole hands employed in 
carrying on the manufafture of the place ; reckoning men, 
women, and children, 4455. Deducing the price of mate! 
rials, (flax, cotton, foap, afhes, indigo, &amp; c .) which, when 
thofe of the belt quality are ufed, will be about one third of 
the value of the cloth, there remains L. 30,000 as the price 
of labour and the manufacturers profit. And this being di- 
vided among the whole number of produaive hands, each is 
found to produce annually to the community about L. 7 Ster 
hng.

them, purchafe annually a confiderable quantity from the 
neighbouring difiriiSt. The value of the cloth purchafed by 
manufacturers or merchants in the courfe of lafl year, ex- 
ceeded L. 30,000. Of the whole cloth, made or purchafed, 
about three fourths are fold in England ; from which a 
fmall proportion is exported to the Weft Indies and Ameri- 
ca. Of the remaining fourth, about one half of it is fold in 
Glafgow for exportation ; the other half is confumed in the 
country *. 

The 

* The above was the ftate of the manufactures of Khkaldy , before the dif- 
trefles which commerce and manufactures in general have fuffered of late be- 
gan to extend to them. Through the operation of particular circumftances, 
thofe diftrefles were prevented for a while from having any confiderable ef- 
feft on this diftricl. An engagement with a navy contractor, which ena- 
bled one of the principal manufacturers of the place, to piuchafe confiderable 
more than the ufual quantity of checks, contributed to keep the trade alive 
there for fome months, after it had fuffered in other places. The manufac- 
turers too, calculating on the profperity of the former year, had prepared a 
large flock of materials for the probable confumption of the fuccecding year : 
And thefe materials, many of them were under the neceffity of working up 
and felling, although with lofs, to retire their bills as they fell due. This 
brought the ufual quantity of cloth, and perhaps a greater quantity than ufu- 
al to the market, during the firft part of the year 1793. But the caufes 
which produced this effect were temporary, and have now ceafed to operate. 
The engagement with the contractor has been for fome months at an end. The 
materials provided in the former year have been generally wrought up. And 
while the profits on the faleof the manufacture have not been fuffident to re- 
place them, the want of ready money cannot now be fupplied, at lead with 
the fame facility as formerly, by negotiating bills. Hence there is already an 
increafing ftagnation. The number of looms employed without the place is 
fair diminifliing. The prices of fpinning and weaving have been twice redu- 
ced within the compafs of a few months. On fome fabrics, the price of 
weaving has fall en ^, on others £ and » , and on a great proportion of the 
coarfer goods, 4- of the former prices. An indubious weaver can ftill earn 
from 8s. t» las. in the week. But the actual earning of all the weavers em-

Leather.—' The next, both in {landing and importance to 
the manufacture of cloth, is leather. This branch was ef- 
tabliflied on a fmall fcale in 1 723 ; but it has fince been much 
extended. At prefent, it employs 16 hands; who manu- 
facture annually from 3200 to 4000 hides of oxen, and cows, 
about the fame number of calf-lkins, and a fmall proportion 
Vol. XVIII; E . , of 

ployed, and for all kinds of work, do not now exceed the weekly average of 
five /hillings. 

Much has of late been faid of the bad effects of high wages on the induf- 
try and profperity of the people. It may be doubted, however, whether 
' fuch reflections are founded on liberal or juft views of the intereft of the com- 
munity. High wages, it is true, like high profits on trade, or high rents of 
land, increafe the means of difllpation to thofe who are addicted to' it, and a- 
hate the neeeffity of their application to indufhious habits. But when the 
mind hath candidly diftinguifhed between things themfelvcs, and the abufe of 
them, it will unqueflionably be found, that liberal wages are on the whole 
attended with important advantages. The liberal reward of labour, inftead 
of abating indurtry, ferves in general to increafe it; that quality, in the o- 
pinion of one of the molt competent judges % " improving like every other, in 
" proportion to the encouragement -which it receives." As high wages facilitate the 
fupport of a family, labourers when they receive them are encouraged to many 
young; and population increafes. The induft'rious are enabled, not only to 
fupport their families comfortably, but in many inflanccs to fave a little, 
which they generally apply to the purchafe of ftock, and begin to' work for 
themfelves. In this way, a number of operative weavers have been of late 
coming forward into the rank of manufacturers, and, by widening the foun- 
dations of the trade, were contributing to increafe the fecurity of its continu- 
ance. By the fall of wages, a lop is put to this gradual advancement. And 
by the ftagnation of trade, which is radically the caufe of that fall, many of 
thofe who were advancing beyond the (late of wo, kmen, are thrown back in- 
to it ; w,th earnings that are hardly fufficicnt to maintain their families In 
this fituation, if they happen to have apprentices, their dirtrefs is often in- 
creafed by them, The ordinary plan on which apprentices are taught here 
is rational and liberal. The time of apprenticed^ is firort, ufually 3 years No 
prem.um ii required for inftrucling them ; But the mafter receives in lieu of it

of feal-fkins. The raw hides and fkins are collected chiefly 
from the county of Fife. Cut as that range is not fuflicient 
to fupply the confumption, a confiderabk quantity is impor- 
ted from the North of Scotland, from Ireland, and fometimes 
from Holland. For fome years back, the price of raw hides 
has been about 7s. per ftone of 22 lbs ; but the prefent 
ftagnation of trade has reduced it under js; 

From 220 to 240 tons of oak bark are annually confumed 
in this manufacture. For many yeurs .the bark was brought 
wholly from England; excepting only a fmall proportion 

from 

ore half of the apprentice's earnings, while the other goes to his own fupport. 
In favourable times, an induftrious apprentice, over and above the Ihare 
which goes to his mafter, earns confidcrably more than is neceflary for his fup- 
port. And as the fufplus is his own, his induftry is conftantly Simulated by 
partaking of its fruits. But when the wages of labour fall fo low, that an ap- 
prentice cannot maintain himfelf with the half of his earnings, — which is the 
cafe at prefent with the young, the weakly, and the inexpert, he muft be- 
come a burden upon his matter, or upon his friends, or abandon the trade. 

If things continue long in their prefent ftate, the confluences will in this 
view, be extenfively injurious to this community. The number of apprentices 
is very great ; the demand for weavers, and the high wages of labour for tw» 
or three years part, having increafed far beyond the ordinary proportion. Not 
only was every hand that could be fpared from the neighbourhood determined 
to the loom ; but plans were formed for procuring fupplies from a diftance. 
Advantageous propo&amp;ls were circulated through different diftriftsof the High- 
lands, in confluence of which about 50 young men, chiefly from Sutherland 
and Caithnefs came to this place as apprentices to the bufmefs of weaving, and 
many more were preparing to follow. Thofe who came had fcarcely begun t« 
feel the advantages of their Htuation, when a reduction of wages took place. 
Difcouraged by this circumftance on the one hand, and tempted on the other, 
by large bounties to enter into the army, moft of them have run off, and en-

price, including freight and carriage, was about L. 5 : 10 per 
ton. But Britilh bark having within the lad 3 or 4 years 
advanced almofl: to double the former price, (from L. 8 to 
L. 10) it has fince been found neceflary to import a great 
proportion of what is ufed here, from Germany and the Ne- 
therlands. The leather, which is of all the ufual denomina- 
tions, viz. bend, crop, {hoe-hides, cordovan, faddler's lea- 
ther, &amp;c. is fold in the neighbouring towns and country, in 
the north of Scotland, in Perth, Glafgow, Edinburgh, and 
occafionally in London. The annual fales have for fome 
years produced at an average from L. 7000 to L. 8000. The 
duties paid on this branch produce annually about L. 47c. 
The wages of a tanner, which are nearly double to what 
they were 30 years ago, run in the week from 6s. to 
10s; thofe of an indudrious currier will average 15s. 

Cotton-fpitming. — The fpinning of cotton, chiefly for woof, 
has been carried on here for 8 or 9 years and till this year 
with confiderable fuccefs. 1111792, 110 hands, reckoning 
men, women, and children, were employed in the town ; 
befides thofe who were employed by manufacturers of this 

parilh, in the neighbourhood At prefent, the number is 

reduced to 75. Thefe prepare and fpin about uoo lbs. of 
cotton in the week, or about 57,000 lbs. in the year. This 
quantity is fpun into 32,000 fpindles of yarn ; which at the 
average price of 4s. per fpindle, yields L. 6400. The yarn is 
fpun on the common jenny ; of which inftrument 29 are em* 
ployed. The carding is performed on cylinder cards, moved 
by horfes. The weekly wages paid to the whole hands em- 
ployed amount to L. 12. 

Before this year, a confiderable quantity of the yarn fpun 
here was fent to Perth, to be wrought into callicoes. At

to erect machinery.

Ship-buihhng.—$hip-hxn\&amp;ix\g was introduced here in 1778. 
Previous to that time, a great proportion of the fhips employ- 
ed in the trade of Great Britain, was built in America ; the 
contiguity of navigable rivers to immenfe forefts making the 
conflu&amp;ion of fhips lefs expenfive in that country than in any 
other. But fince the feparation of America, and efpecially 
fince the regifler adT: of 1785, excluded all (hips not Britifh- 
built from the trade of this country, (hip-building has gene- 
rally increafed in it. 38 VefTels carrying about 3000 tons, 
carpenters meafure (about 4500 dead weight) have been built 
here in 15 years ; moft of them for the ports of the Frith ; 
but fome of them alfo for Glafgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, &amp;c. 
One of the largeft of them for the capital of Zealand. The 
ordinary contract-price for building with oak plank, is from 
L. 4 : 5. to L. 6 per ton of the burden, and the hull is ufu- 
ally from \ to •§- of the price of the {hip when clear to 
fail. The fhip timber ufed here is partly brought from 
England, and partly imported from Hamburgh. The 
number of carpenters employed varies from 10 to 30. 
The average of their daily wages is about is. 8d. 

Manufacture of Stockings. — The manufacturing of (lockings 
has been carried on here fince the 1773. 11 Looms are at 
prefent employed in it; 7 in what is called ci/Jomcriuork, 
1. e. in working materials which families or individuals pre- 
pare for their own comfumpticn, and 4 in manufafturing for 

fale.

fale. Calculating on the average of all fizes and qualities 
of ftockings, every loom employed for fale produces 
annually about 520 pairs, worth from 2S. to 4s. each, or 
about L. 70 the whole produce. The average of the earn- 
ings of an induftrious flocking maker is about 8s. in the 
week. 

Sea Salt. The making of fea fait was once a manu- 
facture here, and a long eftablifhed one. In the town's 
charter of confirmation (1644), the fait pans are mentioned 
as part of the defcription of the burgh. But little or no 
fait has been made fince coal ceafed to be wrought in the 
parifh *. 

JBatik.— The general profperity of this place has been much 
promoted by the eftablifliment of a branch of the bank of 
Scotland m 1785. As moft of the bufmefs of the neigh- 
bouring diftricl: is tranfa&amp;ed through the medium of this 
fcranch, its annual operations in the way of cafh accounts, 
difcounting bills, and circulating fhe paper of the company, 
are very confiderablc. And it is worth while to remark, that 
notwithftanding the increafed facility of obtaining credit 
which has been produced by it, yet no failure of any confe- 
quence has happened here ; nor has the bank, or their agent, 
who guarantees to them all the bills which he difcounts, fuf- 
fered any lofs, fince the office was eftablifhed. 

About two years ago, the banking company of Dundee 
attempted to fhare this profitable trade with the bank of Scot- 
land

land. But owing to the ci/aumftances of the times, the at, 
tempt has not fucceeded. 

Difadvantages.— While different circumftances confpire 
to render this town an advantageous fituation for commerce 
and manufactures, there are obvious difadvantages un- 
der which it labours, u The harbour is narrow, incommo- 
dious, and fo much expofed to an heavy fea from the eaft, 
as to fuffer frequent injury. This, it is poflible in fome 
degree to remedy ; but at an expence to which the funds of 
the town are at prefent inadequate. 2. The parifh affords 
no water for the neceffary operation of bleaching, or for 
driving the machinery by which the fpinning both of cotton 
and flax is now beginning to be performed. 3. The vicinity 
of the capital contributes to increafe the prices of labour and 
provifions, and perhaps too, to produce fome effect on the 
general habits of living : Add to all this, 4. The unfriendly 
influence of corporation and burgh privileges. The corpo- 
ration fpirit, limiting to a few, advantages to which all have a 
natural claim, and making the freedom of the trade, as it is 
called, paramount both to fkill and induftry, cannot in the 
nature of the thing, but operate unfavourably on the profpe- 
rity of the community. It is probably owing to the operation 
of this fpirit, that although free burgage tenure be every way 
fuperior to that of burghs of regality and barony, yet the 
adjacent towns of Linktown and Pathhead, which are of the 
lafl kind, have for 30 years back increafed in more than a 
double proportion to the royal burgh of Kirkaldy. The politics 
of burghs, too, generally affect the public induftry and the 
public morals : Or if they mould not, at any rate they tend 
to abate the public happinefs and profperity. The collifion 
of political opinions and political interefts, dividing the in- 
habitants 



of Kirkaldy, 39 

habitants into parties or fets, not only diminifhes the freedom 
of intercourfe and familiar fociety, but prevents the applica- 
tion of the public ftrength entire) to the profecution of the 
public good*. 

Although this place has fuffered in common with others 
from that unhappy caufe, it is but juftice to fay, that there is 
perhaps none of the burghs of Scotland, of which the con- 
ftitution is more liberal, or of which the government is lefs 
appropriated*. 

Conjlitution of the Burgh. At the time that the oldeft 

exifting records of the burgh commence (A. D. 1586,) the 
form of its government was popular, and extremely fimple. 
The whole administration was vefted in two bailies, annually 
elected by the inhabitants, nybors and freemen at large, who, as 
the minute of election bears, gave them commiJfion t and pro- 
mifed them fubjetlion and ajjiflance. .The bailies, after taking 
an oath of fidelity, named what was called the head court or 
annual ajffe. This court immediately fat, and ordained acls 
and Jiatutes for the public weil : which were inftantly recorded 
as the bailies gUide for their year of office. In 1505 a coun- 
cil was added to affift the bailies. This council, two or 
three years after, affixmed the power of naming a leet, from 
which the inhabitants were to choofe the magiftrates and 
after the preparation of a year or two more, took the elec- 
tion wholly into its own hands, and excluded the community. 
In the charter of confirmation, however, the right of eleding 
their magiftrates was reftored to the community in common 
with the council. And when the burgh was in ,652 incor- 
porated with the commonwealth of England, that right was 
cxprefsly recognifed and continued to them: And « the 
« neighbours aud inhabitants of the town were authorifed and 
" appointed, according to their former rites and cuftoms, fro

" time to time, to nominate and choofe their magnates and o- 
" ther officers for the government of the.burgh *." The Refto- 
ration produced a new confutation ; . the formation of which 
was a fource of violent diflenfions among the inhabitants. 
Thefe were, however, at length compofed by the arbitration 
of the Earl of Rothes, then Prefident of the Privy Council } 
who by his decreet-arbitral pronounced in 1662, eftablifhed 
the fct or confitution which ftill fubfifts ; and which has con- 
tinued fince that time without interruption, fave only during 
the reign of James II. who by his organ, the Privy Council, 
exprefsly nominated and appointed to the magiftracy, &amp;c. 
fucli perfons as he judged moft loyal and ready to promote his 
fervicef. By this conftitution the government of the burgh 
is veiled in a council annually chofen from three claffes of 
inhabitants, mariners, merchants, and craftfmen. The coun- 
cil confifts of 21 members; of whom 10 muft be mariners, 8 
merchants, and 3 craftfmen. The old council elecT: their 
fucceffors; to whom, however, they do not wholly refign 
their places, till they have voted along with them and with 
the deacons % of the incorporated trades in the election of the 
new magistrates. Thefe are taken from the new council ; and 
confift of a provoft, 2 baillies, a dean of guild, and a trea- 
surer. The incorporated trades are 7 in number; and rank 
in the following order ; fmiths, wrights and mafons, wea- 
vers, fhoemakers, taylors, bakers, and flefhers. Here, as in

is enjoyed exclufively by the members of the incorporation ; 
excepting in the cafe of weavers and flefliers. The exclufive 
privileges of the formerwere reducedbyan actof the legiflature 
in 1751 ; by which weavers in flax and hemp are permitted to 
fettle and exercife their trades any where in Scotland, free 
of all corporation dues. And the injurious confequences of 
the corporation privilege are guarded againft, in the cafe of 
the latter, by an z€t of the firft Parliament of Queen Anne, 
(fefs. 1. ch. 7.) ; which declares it to be leifume to all per- 
fons whatfomever, to fell and break all forts of flefhes on 
every lawful day -of the week, and that in all towns and 
burghs of this kingdom, free of any impofition whatfomever, 
the petty cuftom of burghs excepted. 



Parliamentary Reprefentation. — Since the Union of the two 
kingdoms, this burgh joins with the neighbouring burghs of 
Dyfart, Kinghorn, and Burntifland, in fending a reprefenta- 
tive to the Britifh Parliament. Delegates, nominated by the 
councils of the feveral burghs, elecT: the reprefentative. The 
return of the reprefentative is made by the burghs in rotation j 
and in cafe of an equality, the delegate of the-returning 
burgh has a double voice. The greateft number of tbofe 
who vote for the delegate is 28 ; and the choice is determined 
by a majority. The delegate, when chofen, is not mere- 
ly the legal organ by which the fenfe of his conftituents is ex- 
preflcd. He ads in the matter of eledion, without limitation 
or controul ; and his principles are their only fecurity for his 
conveying their fentiments.

* This chatter, winch is referred to in the Charter of Confirmation, but 
without fpecifying its date, is not now to be found. It is probable that the 
papers which related to the erection of the burgh, were either deftroyed in 
1560, when the French, whom the Queen Regent brought into Scotland to 
affift in fuppreffing the Proteftants, plundered and burnt Kirkaldy in their 
defirudive progrefs along the coaft of Fife, or loft in 1651 at the taking of 
Dundee, to which place they had, on Cromwell's invafion, been removed far 
fecurity, with other valuable effects, as mentioned in page 21ft. One or o- 
ther of thefe is ftated in a memorial from the town in 1678 ; as the reafon 
why they could not be produced in a procefs before the Court of Seffion, in 
which an exhibiton of them had been ordered. The fads ftated above are 
taken from different papers in pofTeffion of the burgh. 

f This conveyance is mentioned in an inventory of writs belonging to the 
burgh in 1731.

to the community *. In this fum all public burdens are in- 
cluded; the community having become bound, when their 
lands were feued, to relieve the feuars of all public burdens 
in all time coming ; thus leaving Xp pofterity one incontrover- 
tible proof, at leaft, that they once had property. 

The reft of the revenue is drawn from a port duty pn goods 
landed at the harbour, from the petty cuftoms on goods inter- 
changed with the neighbouring country, and from an impoft of 
2 pennies Scots on the pint of ale brewed in the town for faje, 
or fold into it from the neighbourhood. This laft is a parlia- 
mentary grant, which was firft given for a limited period, in 
J 707, with the burden of L. 10 annually, to the profefibr of 
mathematics in the King's College of Aberdeen ; and which 
has, fince that time, been again and again renewed, without 
?ny burden. The whole revenue produced laft year L. 317 f, 
but it does not average above L. 260. The ordinary purpofes 
to which the revenue is applied, are: 1. The difcharge of 
public burdens, amounting annually to about L. 60. 2. The 
payment of intereft on a debt of L. 2430 %. 3. The repara- 
tion of the harbour. 4. The payment of clerks, officers, and 
all the incidental expences incurred in conducting the bufi- 
nefs of the community.

Ecclefiajllcal State. The ecclefiaftical eftablifhment of 

this parilh has, through the low ftate of the burgh funds, 
fufFered a temporary reduction. In 1614, the date of the 
oldeft ecclefiaftical record, the church appears to have been 
collegiate ; the duty of it having been conducted by two mi- 
nifters, exercifing equal powers, and having nearly an equal 
provifion f. At that time the ftipend of the fecond minifter 
was 800 merks, paid the one half by the heritors, the other 
by the town council j » while that of the firft minifter in 1630, 
was no more than 4S0 merks, a chalder of bear, a chalder of 
oats, and 4 bolls of wheat «. Both charges continued to be 
regularly fupplied, and both minifters to fit as conftituent 
members of all the ecclefiaftical judicatures j|, till  7 59 ; when 
a vacancy happening in the fecond charge, the minifter of the 
firft undertook to do the duty of the whole pariOi, on condi- 
tion of receiving, together with his own ftipend, the half of

Aimed out of it. This, however, may be confidered as balanced by other 
articles confumed in the parifh, which pay duty, but of which the duty is 
either not paid in the parifh, or not included in the above ftatement. Articles 
of the firft kind, are tea, coffee, fugar, rum, porter, vinegar, home-made 
fpirta, tobacco, glafs, paper, filk, printed cloth, fail-cloth and cordage,

that which had been enjoyed by his colleague. This arrange- 
meat, the oitenfible reafon of which was the poverty of the 
burgh, (which after the disjundion of Abbotfhall, paid the 
whole of the fecond minifter's ftipend) ; the prefbytery were 
prevailed on to allow for a time. And although the town- 
council have, ever fince the death of the incumbent with 
whom the arrangement was made, appropriated that fti- 
pend to their own ufe, the charge to this day continues 
vacant. 



Stipend.— The crown prefents to the fir ft charge ; the town 
council were in ufe of fupplying the fecond. The ftipend of 
the fecond charge in 1759, was 1000 merks Scots. The 
prefent ftipend of the firft charge is 120^* bolls of bear, 79^ 
bolls of oats, and 100 merks of vicarage. The laft decreet 
of augmentation (which, was pafled in 1737) gives alfo the 
tiend of fifh according to ufe and wont. But as almoft the 
whole of the fifh fold here, is carried over land, and the ufe 
and wont is underftood to confine the minifter's right to fifh 
carried into the parifh by water, no advantage is at prefent 
derived to him from this part of his decreet. The firft mi- 
nifter has a manfe ; a glebe of about 2* acres, and about the 
fame quantity of land, independent of the glebe, enjoyed fince 
1678 by a private mortification. By a recent judgement of the 
prefbytery, the minifter is found intitled to have this glebe 
enlarged to the legal ftandard, and to have ground affigned 
to him for pufture. This judgement has, however, been 
fufpended, and is now under the review of the Court of 
Scifion.

fmall divifion of the burgh lands, which is called in the regif- 
ter of fafines St. Brifie or St. Bryce's Deal, The church is 
but in indifferent repair ; nor could it well be otherwife, when 
neither the heritors nor town-council have for more than 180 
years taken any charge of it. What repairs it has received 
during that time have been paid for by thekirk-feflion. On the 
recommendation of the heritors and council, the collections 
made at the church doors before the afternoon fervice were 
for a while employed for this purpofe. But the prefbyte- 
ry having inhibited that application of the collections, the 
church has for more than a century been kept in repair out of 
a part of the feat-rents, which are under the management of 
the kirkfeffion. 

Seats. Originally the whole area of the church was in 

their hands : And their records fhew that all the incorpora- 
tions, and fuch of the heritors as have feats, (more than the 
half of them have none) derived their rights from the kirk- 
feffion. They ftill retain about a fourth part of the church ; 
from which they draw annually from L. iS to L. 20. 
The neceffary repairs are defrayed from this fund, the 
remainder of which goes to the maintenance of the poor 
in common with the colkaions. Some of the heritors of 
Abbotfhall retain their feats in the church of Kirkaldy; and 
by a decreet of the Court of Seffion in 1685, are found liable

in the neighbouring parifhes. On the firft of January 1790, 
the diflenters, taking the whole number of fouls, were 595 ; 
which was to the eftablifhment nearly in the proportion of 1 
to 3x and of 1 to 4 -J of the whole population. Thefe were 
divided among the different denominations of diffeniers in the 
following proportions, viz. Burghers 304, antiburghers 2c5, 
prefbytery of relief 51, independents 1 I, epifcopals 10, 
reformed prefbytery 9, Bereans 2, baptift 1, Roman catho-

The diflenters of this place, and particularly thofe of them 
who retain the ftandards of the church, ate diflinguifhed for 
moderation and liberality. Of that forbidding afperity, which 
for fome time after their firft feparation characterized the 
conduct of feceders towards the members of the church, 
there is fcarcely a trace remaining. Good men of the fecef- 
fion and of the eftablifhment, dwell together as brethren in 
the exercife of mutual charity and of mutual efteem. And in 
one of their congregations, the minifter of which refides in 
Kirkaldy and takes his official defignation from it, the eftablifh- 
ed congregation of the place, has not unfrequently by 
name, a friendly intereft in the public prayers.

his living about L. 40. The ftated falaries of both are paid, 
by the town-council. There are feveral private fchools in the 
place. In all the fchools there are about 250 children in the 
Ordinary courfe of attendance: 

The Poor.— -The poor of this parifh are chiefly fuppliedl 
from the collections at the church doors. Thefe; notwith- 
ftanding the increafe of money, which the profper'ity of the 
country has of late produced, are not fo great as they were 
an hundred years ago f. This may be partly a confequence 
6f the Seceffion, which has diminifhetl the numbers of the 
eftablifhed congregation. But it may be partly attributed 
alfo, to a feceffion of a different kind, the feceflion of too 
tnany of thole; who are called " the better fort," from the 
public ordinances of religion.— The Seceders of this clafs are 
unhappily fo numerous in moft parts of the country, that a 
plain man; who mould judge from the general conduct, 
might be apt to conclude, that the pofleffion of a little land, 
a commiflion irl the army or navy, or any diftinaion pro- 
feffional or official, which allows a man to add Efquire to his 
name, were confideted as a charter, entitling the pofleflbr 
to " hold blanch" of Heaven, on paying an occafional duty ;

and that, perhaps, only when demanded by royal proclama- 
tion. This is « a fore evil," of which the country at large h 
at prefent eating the bitter fruits ; no one caufe perhaps hav- 
ing contributed more, if not to excite, at leaft to foment 
that fpirit of « infubordination/' which has of late occafioned 
fuch general alarm. Not only does the irreligion of the 
higher ranks abate their perfonal refpeclability and influence; 
but, as the common people, by a procefs of mind of which 
the^ meanefl are capable, transfer the character of their fu- 
periors whom they know, to thofe whom they know not, 
it has the effect of inducing an unfavourable opinion of the 
holders of place and power in general, And, what is ftill 
more injurious to the interefts of fociety, it operates in the 
way of example, gradually to weaken and deftroy the res- 
traints of religion on the public mind, and fo to leave it 
open, and without a guard to the impreffions of the ill-dif- 
pofed and defigning. 

Were men of rank and fortune to fee their duty, or even 
their intereft, in the proper light, and to cultivate and main- 
tain the religious character; befides the advantage which they 
would derive to themfelves, in refpeft of improvement and 
comfort, they would fecure at once, a perfonal influence, 
and an acceffion of ftrength to the Mate, which, fo long as 
they fet up independant of religion, all their exertions will 
be inefficient to gain. 

Through the irregular attendance of many of the upper 
ranks, the public fupplies for the poor are here drawn 
chiefly from that clafs of inhabitants on which they ought 
to fall lightefl:, thofe whofe perfonal labour is generally 
no more than fufficient for the comfortable maintenance of 
their own families. It is not furprifing, therefore, that 
notwithstanding the populoufnefs of the parifli, the ordinary 
collections for 12 years preceding 1791* produced no mora 
o than

than L. 63 : 10. Since that time, by difpenfing the facra- 
ment twice in the year, and by making an extraordinary 
collection at the new year, they have averaged L. 85. When 
. to this is added, the furplus of feat rents *, the donations 
which are cuftomary among the more opulent on occa- 
fion of marriages and the death of friends, and the intereft 
of an accumulated fum of L. 290, the whole funds, under 
the management of the kirk-feflion, have for 2 or 3 years 
amounted to about L. 110 ; or about L. 100 dear, after 
deducing (the only expence incurred in the management), 
fmall falaries to a treafurer and diftributor, a clerk, and an 
officer. Out of this fum above 40 perfons are regularly 
fupplied ; 8 or 9 of the moft deftitute of whom have 
the additional beneHt of lodging, in a houfe pur- 
chafed for the poor, about 50 years ago. Befides 
the regular penfioners, above 40 more are fupplied occa- 
fionally f. That the whole muft be inadequately fup- 
plied, any one may fee who compares their number with the 
funds to be divided among them. Although no man, who 
has the welfare of his country at heart, would wifh to fee 
poor's rates eftablifhed here pn the fame footing on which 
they are in England, yet the friend of humanity muft regret, 
that fome equitable plan is not generally adopted for fecuring 
more efFedually to the indigent, the neceflary aid of their 
more fortunate brethren. Perhaps the time is not very re- 
mote, when fomething of this kind muft be done. When

fo many of thofe on whom the law refts the burden of the 
poor, beftow neither time, nor thought, nor money, to pro- 
Vide for them, it is not improbable that kirk feflions, whofe 
attention to the poor is merely « a labour of love"; to 
which they are no otherwife bound, than by the common 
obligations of humanity, will find themfelves conftrained to 
do in general, what fome of them already threaten, give up 
collecting at the church doors, and leave it to the civil ma- 
gi ft rate to make provifion for the poor, by putting the laws 
for their fupport in execution. 

It is fortunate for the poor of this parilh that they do not 
all depend upon the public funds. The fociety of feamen, 
the company of merchants, the incorporated trades, the malt- 
men, the carters, have all of them feparate boxes for affifting 
the poor of their refpedive focieties. The feamen, in par- 
ticular, have funds, arifing partly from rents and feu-duties, 
and partly from a poundage on the wages of failors, which e- 
ruble them to pay annually to indigent members of their fo- 
ciety, or to their widows and families, about L. 40, befides 
furnifhing ten of them with a houfe to lodge in. 

Charitable AJfodations — Three different affociations have 
of late been formed here, for the purpofe of affifting the 
members, when their ordinary labour is fufpended by dif- 
trefs. Thefe are all confljtuted on the fame general plan. 
Each member, befides a fmall fum paid on his admiffion, 
contributes at the rate of one penny in the week, and re- 
ceives weekly, when confined, 3 (hillings. To thofe, whofe 
daily fubfiftence depends on their perfonal induftry, this is 
often a feafonable fupply ; and the meanefl labourer can 
without difficulty afford the contribution which entitles him 
to receive it*

Means of Subjiftence, and Wages. — The inhabitants of this 
parifh, upon the whole, enjoy the means of fubfiftence in an 
equal degree with thofe of the fame level in any other pare 
of the country. The late fuccefsful exertions of the trader 
and manufacturer, have, by increafing the demand for all 
kinds of labour, and of courfe increafing their price, contri- 
buted to improve the circumftances of the community in ge- 
neral. And, although the caufe of this improvement does 
not at prefent operate with the fame force, yet weaving, the 
price of which was the firft increafed, is perhaps the only 
fpecies of labour of which the wages have yet fuffered any 
confiderable diminution. Wrights and mafons ftill earn from 
ps. to ios. 6d. in the week; fmiths from 7s. to ios.; fhoe- 
makers from 5s. to ios.; taylors from 6s. to 8s.; hacklers from, 
9s. to 15s.; gardeners from 8s. to 12s.; day-labourers from 
5s. to 7s. in all feafons; and during the time of harveft, and of 
weeding arid hoeing, which, fince drilled crops have become 
fo frequent, continue through a great part of the fummer, 
their earnings are ftill higher. Male farm fervants, and fe- 
male fervants, whether for houfe or farm, are commonly 
hired by the half-year ; and receive of wages, the former 
from L. 3 : ios. to L. 4. the latter from 25s. to 40s. exclu- 
five of their fubfiftence. 

Proviftons.— While fuch is the rate of wages, and labour- 
ers in general are fully employed, provifions are obtained ea- 
fily, and upon the whole at a moderate price. Oat meal, 
now lefs ufed than formerly, but ftill a chief article of food 
among the working clafles, fells, on an average of feven years, 
at is. the peck; flour at is. 4 d. ; peafe and barley meal at 
8d. When oat meal is cheap, the confumption of it is to that 
of flour, nearly in the proportion of two thirds, when dear, 
of one naif. Two thirds of the oat meal confumed here is 

brought

brought from a diftance, chiefly from Mid-Lothian. The 
flour 18 chiefly furnifhed by the county 0 f Fife, though there is 
occafionally a fupply from England. 

The flefh market is well fupplicd in all feafons, and the 
confumption of butcher-meat very confiderable, probably 
three times what it was twenty years ago. The average of 
the number, weight, and value of the different kinds of cat- 
tle which have been annually killed, and fold here for fome 
years, is as follows.

Of this quantity, a full third goes into the confumption of 
the neighbouring parifhes : About 700 (tones are bought for 
fea-ftores, by the fliipmaftets of the place; whofe principal 
fupplies of faltibeef are from Ireland : The remainder (about 
12.530 ftones tron ; or 275.660 lib. Englifh), is confumed in 
the patifh ; and is nearly in the proportion of 4 (tones, 1 1 lib. 
or 103 lib. Englifh, to every man, woman, and child in it. 

The fupply of fifh is leffened, and the price raifed, by the 
nearnefs of the metropolis. There are no fiihers that belong 
to this parifh : About the beginning of fummer, a family or 
two ufually come from Buck-haven, the principal fifhing 
flation on the fouth coaft of Fife, and refide here for a few 
months, for the convenience of fupplying the inhabitants,

over land, on the backs, fometimes of horfes, but more com- 
monly of women. In this way, mod kinds of fifh that are 
caught in the Frith, are pretty regularly brought to Kirkaldy 
in their feafons, haddocks excepted ; which have for feveral 
years, been extremely rare, and have been fold at enormous 
prices. A milling has been paid for a fingie haddock, that 15 
years ago would have fold for a halfpenny. 

The vicinity of Edinburgh has an effect alfo on the prices 
0I " e ggs poultry, and butter. Eggs fell from 4d. to 7d. the 
dozen, hens from is. to is 6d. each, chickens from 8d. to 
is 4d. the pair, butter from 3d. to nd. the pound, green 
cheefe made of fkimmed milk, from 2d. to 3d. the pound*. 
All thefe articles, (together with the yarn that is fpun in the 
neighbourhood with the hand), are regularly expofed to fale, 
in the weekly market, which holds here on Saturday, and 
has this peculiarity, that it begins between 3 and 4 o'clock in 
the morning, and is generally over by 6 o'clock. This cuf- 
tom was probably introduced at firft, to evade the law which 
prohibits Saturday and Monday markets f. And the conve- 
nience of attending the market in the morning, and returning 
home in time for the ordinary labour of the day, has induced 
the country people to continue the cuftom, notwithstanding 
that frequent attempts have been made to alter it. By the 
Charter of Charles, the Burgh had the privilege of holding 
two annual fairs ; one on the third Wednefday of July, ano- 
ther on the hft Wednefday. of September. For a Jong time, 
thefe were regularly kept; but as the conftant trade of the 
place advanced, the fairs gradually diminifhed ; and for 
many years, there hasjnot been a veftige of them.

Manners and CWfcr.-The inhabitants of this pariflt 
fecm in general to enjoy the advantages of their fituation, 
and Hye comfortably. Among the Upper clafles, the ftile of 
living is genteel, but not luxurious or expenfive. Allowing 
for the diverfity of circumftances, all clafles drefs well, and 
are generally civil in their manners, and decent in their ex- 
ternal deportment. Although a confiderable proportion of 
them have been bred to the fea, there is nothing of the rough- 
nefs which common opinion has attached to that profefhon. 
The clafs of feamen is not lefs refpeaable in charafter than 
in numbers. The great body of the people are induftrious 
and fober: but 31 houfes and 19 (hops licenfed to retail fpi- 
tits, — a number that is in the proportion of 1 to 13 of all 
the families in the place, — furnifh room to fufpec~t, that from 
this part of the public character there muft be exceptions. 
Strong drink appears to have been long a confiderable article 
in the confumption of Kirkaldy. A temporary impoft on 
wines and foreign fpirits vented within the burgh, having, by 
a charter of Charles II. been granted to the magiftrates and 
council for the payment of their public debts, the deficiencies 
of that impoft for one year ending November 167 1, are ftated 
in a procefs for recovering them, brought againft the vint- 
ners, to have been 60 pieces, (hogfheads) French wine, 6 
butts Sack, 60 pints Rhenifh, 80 pints Tent, and 80 pints * 
brandy. Far down in the prefent century, it was the prac- 
tice, even among citizens of fome character, to take a regular 
nuhet in the forenoon, and moft commonly to fpend the eve- 
ning in the public houfe. For a confiderable time this prac- 
tice has been given up j and the habit of drinking fpirits to 
excefs is confined to a few, and thefe generally of the very

ioWefl: order. It is remarkable, however, that no lefs than 
8 perfons, and fome of them ranking above the lowefl: order, 
have in little more than 4 years vifibly fallen victims to this 
deftructive habit. With fome exceptions among the two 
extremes, the higher ranks, and the very loweft and mofh 
worthlefs, the inhabitants are regular in attending the ordi- 
nances of religion, and generally obfervant of its moral du- 
ties. Although petty thefts, and otner breaches of law that 
call for correction, may be fuppofed to happen at times in fo 
large a community, yet the public character has been rarely 
ftained by the commiffion of great crimes. One or two in- 
ftances of child-murder have occurred within the remem- 
brance of the prefent generation. But no inhabitant of Kirk- 
aldy has fuffered the punifhment of death fince the com- 
mencement of the laft century ; a man and his wife excepted, 
who were burnt here in 1633, for the fuppofed crime of 
witchcraft *. 

Eminent Men.— In refpe&amp; of intellectual abilities, the in- 
habitants of Kirkaldy are not beneath the ordinary level ; and 
the parifh has at different times produced men that rofe fat 
beyond it. The firft, and not the leaft diftinguifhed, whofe 
name has reached us, is Michael Scot, the Friar Bacon of 

Scotland ; 

* At that time the belief of witchcraft prevailed, and trials and executions 
On account of it were frequent in all the kingdoms of Europe, It was in 1634 
that the famous Urban Grandier was, at the irrigation of Cardinal Richelieu, 
whom he had fatirifed, tried and condemned to the ftake, for exercifing the 
Mack art on fome nuns of Loudun, who were fuppofed to be pofTeired. And it 
was much about the fame time, that the wife of the Marcciial O'Ancr* 
bnrnt for a witch, at the Place de Greve at Paris.

Scotland *; who, in the 13th century, contributed, by his at- 
tainments in fcience, to break the gloom of that benighted 
age. After purfuing with unufual fuccefs the ftudy of lan- 
guages, belles lettres, and mathematics, at home, Mr Scot 
travelled into France, where he refided feveral years. From 
France he removed into Germany, and lived for a while at 
the court of the Emperor Frederick II. a prince the molt e- 
minenc of his time, both for his own learning, and for the en- 
couragement which he gave to learned men. But that prince 
being then engaged in war, Mr Scot withdrew from the court, 
to proTecute* with more advantage in retirement his favou- 
rite ftudies of medicine and chemiftry. After fome years he 
returned through England, (where he was well received by Ed- 
ward I.) into his own country, and there died in 1291. 

The extraordinary difcoveries of this man, particularly in 
chemiftry, made him pafs in that ignorant and fuperftitious 
age, for a magician ; and a thoufand popular ftories are in 
different parts of Scotland told to this day, of his commerce 
with evil fpirits, and of the wonders which he atchieved 
through their agency. He is alfo faid to have been a pro- 
phet; and among other events to have foretold the union of 
Scotland and England f. He left behind him. 1, A tran-

Sir George M'Kenzie calls him one of the greateft Pnilo- 
fophers, Mathematicians, Phyficians, and Linguifts, of the 
times in which he lived ; and fays, that had he not been fo 
much addicted to aftrology, alchymy, phyfiognomy, and chi- 
romancy, he would have deferved well of the republic of let- 
ters. 

Towards the middle of the 17th century, Meffrs George 
and Patrick Gillefpie, natives of this place, and Mr. Robert 
Douglas, who, with Patrick Gillefpie, was fome time minifter 
of.Kirkaldy, diftinguifhed themfelves by their writings and their 
condua, in the ecclefiaftical hiftory of thofe difficult times. 
All the three were zealoufly attached to the caufe of Prefby- 
tery, which was then confidered in Scotland as intimately 
connected with the caufe of general liberty. Two of them, 
Mr George Gillefpie, and Mr Douglas, having been pre- 
vioufly tranflated to Edinburgh, were in 1643 nominated by 
the General Affembly of the church of Scotland, Commiffion- 
ers to the Affembly of Divines at Weftminfter ; in the pro- 
ceedings of which, Mr Gillefpie in particular conduded 
himfelf with much ability and prudence. He was one of the 
firft charaders at that time in the church. He wrote Mif- 
cellanies, &amp;c He died in 1649, at the age of 36. A mar- 
He monument, which was inferibed to his memory, (it is be- 
lieved at the public expence), and which, as an appended in- 
fcnption bears, was pulled clown through the « malign in- 
" fluence of Archbifhop Sharp," but afterwards repaired by the 
relations of Mr Gillefpie, is ftill (landing in this church yard. 

After the death of Charles I. Mr Douglas and Mr Patrick 
Gilkfp,e took different fides. The former efpou fed the in- 
terefts 0 f Charles II. at whefe coronation at Scone in 1651

he preached, and conduded the religious part of that cere- 
mony * The latter favoured the views of the common- 
wealth of England, by whofe commiffioners he was made 
Principal of the Univerficy of Glafgow j but was ejected at 
the Reftoration. The counfels and pens of both were em- 
ployed to fupporc the fides to which they feverally attached 
themfelves. 

During the prefent century this parifh has produced dif- 
ferent perfons, who have attracted public notice. Dr. John 
Dryfdale, late one of the minifters of Edinburgh, and author 
of two volumes of pofthumous fermons, was a native of it, 
and received the rudiments of his education at what his 
learned biographer calls, The obfeure fchool of Kirkaldy. 
He was born in 1718, and died in 1788. 

Kirkaldy was the birth-place of that diftinguifhed ftatef- 
jnan, Mr Ofwald of Dunnikeer. Mr Ofwald was originally 
bred to the bar. — But having in 1741 been chofen to ferve in 
parliament for the diftrict of burghs, of which this is one, he 
bent the whole force of his mind to his parliamentary duty ; 
in the profecution of which, his abilities, integrity, and labo- 
rious attention to the interefts, particularly the commercial 
jnterefts, of bis country, raifed him from the level of a citizen 
of Kirkaldy, to the firit offices and honours of the ftate. He 
was fucceffively a commiffioner of trade and plantations, a 
lord of the treafury, and vice-treafurer of Ireland. He was 
alfo a privy counfellor. After reprefenting this diftri£t of 
burghs in three parliaments, and the county of Fife in a fourth, 
he, in 1768, retired from public bufinefs, on account of ill- 
health induced by too intenfe an application to it. He died 
■p 1769 at the age of 54. 

Kirkaldy has alfo the fignal honour to have given birth to

that eminent benefactor to fociety, Dr Adam Smith, the en- 
lightened author of the " Inquiry into the Nature and Caufes 
" of the Wealth of Nations," and to have been the place of his 
refidence during molt of the time that he was employed in 
■writing that incomparable book. Dr Smith was born in 
1723. He publifhed his Inquiry in 1776; and before his 
death, which happened in 1789, he -had the fingular good for- 
tune to fee it tranflated into the languages, and the principles 
of political economy contained in it, adopted into*the fyftems, 
of almoft all the commercial nations of Europe. He wrote 
alfo "The Theory of Moral Sentiments." — Thofewho would 
know more of this great man, may confult a memoir of his 
life and character publifhed in the fecond volume of " The; 
f* Tran factions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh." 

In the more retired, though not the lead ufeful or ref- 
pe£table fphere of private citizens, Kirkaldy could reckon dif- 
ferent perfons, who would have been diftinguifhed as citizens 
pf the firft clafs in any community.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q852883">SCONE</name> 

(C0UNTr OF PERTH.) 
By Robert Thomas, Preacher of the Gojpeh</head>

Name. 

Hp HIS parldi has always borne its prefent name* It is 
fometimes written Scoon, but more frequently Sconi. 
The word is fuppofed to be of Gaelic original. The people in 
the Highlands call it Skain, thofe who live at a remote diftance 
pronouncing both vowels, and thofe who live nearer pro- 
nouncing the a only, which they found like the Englifh 
long a. 

The word Slain in Gaelic is faid to fignify a rent. But 
though there are feveral chafms, or deep openings of the 
earth formed in feveral places by the conftant adionof two 
brooks ; yet, there is no mark of any fuch conmlfion of na- 
ture, as this origin of the name might be fuppofed to in- 
dicate* 

Situation, and Extent.^lt is fitUated nearly due north from 
Perth, in the county and prefbytery of Perth, and in the 
fynod of Perth and Stirling. It is bounded on the weft by 
the river Tay, which feparates it from the parifhes of Perth

and Redgortnn ; on the north and eaft by the parifh of St. 
Martin; and on the fouth and eaft by the parifh of 
Kinnoul. 

Irs form is irregular 5 but, on the whole, it approaches in 
a certain degree to a fquare. Its extent from north to fouth, 
as well as from eaft to weft, is about 3 Englifh miles ; and 
confequently it confifts of about 9 fquare miles, containing 
about 4600 Scots acres. Of thefe, about 3000 are under 
grafs and corn; 700 planted ; 500 common, (now under fub- 
miffion in order to a divifion), and the reft is either occupied 
by roads and villages, or is hitherto in an uncultivated 
ftate. 

Appearance.— Yxam the fide of the Tay, on the Weft, the 
furface of the earth continues, on the whole, to rife to the 
eaft border, where it is confiderably above the bed of the 
river. Though there is a confiderable part of it in level 
ground ; yet every where, here and there, it forms itfelf 
into fmall hills, of a graduahand eafy afcent. But there are 
no rocks or precipices, except in the quarries, and fcarcely 
any fteep places, except by the fides of brooks. Every fpot 
almoft is arable ; and there is fcarcely a hill, which is not al- 
ready either planted or ploughed. The whole of the weft 
part of the parifh has a cultivated and beautiful appearance. 
Towards the middle, and the eaft border, there is a confide- 
rable quantity of ground planted ; and fome fpots which are 
flill in a ftate of nature. The proportion of what is unculti- 
vated is Comparatively fmall ; and every year ferves to di- 
minifh it. The whole furface, will, nioft probably, in a 
few years, be either corn fields, or plantations. Thofe few 
fpots on the weft fide, which have hitherto been neglected, 
are covered chiefly with furze and broom ; and thofe of the 
lame description, on the eaft, chiefly with dwarf- heaih. 

Soil. 



of Scone, 67 

SoiI.-~ln fome places, efpecially, near the Tay, the foil is 
a llrong rich clay •, in others, it is light and gravelly ; and in 
others, good loam. Every fort of foil in the parifh has 
been much improved by the ufe of lime, and the practice of 
fummer fallowing. On the richer lands, are raifed good 
crops of wheat, barley, oats, peafe and beans, flax, graft, 
cabbages, potatoes and turnip. The lighter lands are not 
fuppofed to be fo well fuited to the culture of wheat •, but 
they afford all the other productions which have been men- 
tioned. 

Climate. — From the high fituation of this parifh, relatively 
to the grounds on the oppofite fide of the Tay, it might per- 
haps be expected, that the cold fhould be more fenfibly felt 
here, than in the vicinity ; yet this is not the cafe, except 
perhaps on the higher grounds, towards the eaftern bounda- 
ry. The greater part of the parifh has a fine fouth-weftern 
expofure ; the higher grounds fhelter the lower ; and feveral 
plantations on the north and eaft, afford a confiderable fhel- 
ter to almoft the whole. 

That chain of hills, which fhelter the Carfe of Gowrie, 
and which, on the north fide, reach within a fhort fpace of 
the fouth border of this parifh, ferves as a barrier to thole 
mifts, which, coming up the Tay from the fea, frequently 
fpread themfelves over a great pare of the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes; the fame hills attract thofe vapours, which are ex- 
haled from the furface of the earth, in the fouth-eaft part of 
the parifh ; the current of air, produced by the running of 
the Tay, is the caufe of a fimilar effe&amp;„ ail along the weft 
border ; and the natural inequality of the furface, in moft 
places, together with the drains which have been made, car- 
ry off both the water which arifes from fprings, and that 
which falls down in fhowers.

The air therefore is upon the whole, mild and dry. A late 
phyfictan much and juftly reputed for his flail in his profef. 
jon, had fuch an opinion of the falubrity of the air of Scone, 
that he ufed to call this parifh the Montpelier of Perth- 
lhire. 

. PfaM^he inhabitants are affiled with no peculiar 
difeafes, but in general enjoy a- very great mare of health ; 
though, there are few or no inftances amongft them of re- 
markable longevity. The cafe of three ladies, fillers, who 
died fome years ago, was fingular. The eldeft lived to the 
age of 9 (, the youngeft to 87, and the other to 88 or 89. 
Fevers are rare. The ague is now fcarcely heard of, Rheu- 
matifm is the moft frequent complaint ; and, what is very re- 
markable, was little known till within the lalt 40 or 50 years. 
Whether this has been owing to a change in the clothing or 
food of the inhabitants, to fome change in the atmofphere, or 
to all thefe circumftances combined with other caufes, is not 
afctrtained. 

The prejudices of the greater part of the people againft ino- 
culation for the fmall pox, have prevented this falutary prac- 
tice from becoming general ; though they have every argu- 
ment from experience in its favour, as fcarcely any of thofe 
children who have been inoculated, have died. 

Rivers — There are two brooks, which ferve three meal- 
milns, a faw-miln, and a waulk-miln; and produce a fmall fort 
of trout. But the Tay is the only river in the parifh. The 
tide flows about a mile above the bridge of Perth, oppofite to 
the houfe of Scone, and to this place the river is navigable 
by large boats. Above this, it becomes (hallow and rapid ; 
but here it is deep and placid, like a floating mirror, re- 
flecting the beautiful fcenery on its banks. It has been 

(aid, 



of Scone. 6g 

faid, that no other river in Britain difcharges more frefh 
water into the fea than the Tay. It produces eel, fome 
perch and pike, and four or five different forts of trout 
in great abundance, fome of which have a fine flavour, 
and weigh, at an average, ab6ut two pounds. But the 
molt valuable fifh which it affords, is falmon, which is 
reckoned excellent, and of which the greater part is ex- 
ported to London and the foreign markets. The fifhings 
are chiefly rented of the proprietors by the merchants of 
Perth, who employ the filhermen. There are five different 
fifhings belonging to the pariffi, which occupy 13 boats 
and 30 fifhermen. The fifhing feafon is from the 29th 
of November, to the 26th of Augult ; but both the 
falmon and the fineft trout are fuppofed to be in their 
greateft perfection in the month of May. The trout, hav- 
ing never been appropriated, affords excellent fport to the 
gentlemen, who are fond of angling. 

The Tay alfo abounds in the pearl-oyfter. Numbers 
of pearls were filhed out of it about thirty-five years 
ago. 

parries. — There are fix or feven quarries of excellent 
free- Rone. In fome of thefe, the ftone is of a reddifh, 
and in others of a gray or azure colour. They differ 
alfo in degrees of haudnefs and finenefs ; but all of them 
are fit for the purpofes of building. 

Population.— The population of this parifh has encreafed. 
very much within the laft twelve years, and is Mill encreafing. 
Scarcely can houfes be buuc fail enough to accommodate 
thofe who want them. 

This has been owing to feveral caufes. Before the end of 
the year 1792, our manufacturers had for feveral years, been 

in

m a more fl 0Urifhing conditlon than at any former per . o ^ 
lh,s encouraged young people to marry; a bleach-field and 
cotton-mill, eftabHfhed at Stormont field, added about 100 to 
the number of inhabitants-; and a great many new houfes 
being built in the village of Scone, the conftant employment 
given to workmen and labourers, and the facility of bringing 
up a family, encouraged (Grangers to fettle in it. The num- 
ber of the people has been. encreafed from thefe caufes, and 
neither fcarcity, epidemical difeafes, nor crimes, have hither- 
to diminifhed it.

Productions. — The vegetable and animal produ&amp;ions are 
pretty much the fame here, as in moil places of the lowlands 
of Scotland. As the parifli exports annually two thirds of its 
corn, it produces as much in one year, as fhould l'erve for 
the internal confumption of three. Molt of the old wood, 
amongft which are fome very fine trees, was planted by

the Vifcount of Stormont, grandfather of the preferit Earl 
Of Mansfield, about feventy years ago. Thi*ee haw-thorn trees 
at the houfe of Kinkarochie are remarkable for their fize. 
The largeft covers with its top a circle, on the earth, 14 
yards in diameter ; and meafures round the middle of the 
trunk, 9 feet. The old wood confifts chiefly of Scotch firs, 
planes, afhes, elms, and horfe chefnuts. The firs have been 
of the greateft fervice for building, fuel, and other purpofes^ 
The trees, in the young plantations, are the Scotch fir, the 
larch, the fpruce fir, and various other forts. All of them 
were planted within the laft 18 years, and are in a very 
thriving ftate. 

The breed of horfes and cattle has of late been much 
improved, partly by their being better fed, and partly by a 
better kind being introduced. The Countefs of Mansfield, a 
patronefs of hufbandry, has led the way, by introducing a 
breed of cattle, remarkable for their fize and fhape. Her 
Ladyfhip, has alfo turned her attention towards improving 
the breed of fheep, by bringing to that extenfive lawn, in 
which the houfe of Scone Is fituated, a flock, partly of the 
Warwick {hire breed, fo much efteemed for their carcafes ; 
and partly of the Spanifh, fo remarkable for the finenefs of 
their wool. The Englifh breed anfwers very weli ; but the 
experiment upon the Spanifh has not yet been fully made. 
Except 30 or 40, all the fheep in the parifh are her Lady* 
fhip's property. 

Agriculture.— It appears from the face of the country, 
from thofe rough grounds and moor-lands, which within 
a few years, have been converted into beautiful and fer- 
tile corn-fields, that modern hufbandry is well underftoocl 
by the farmers. Some of them adopt the following rotation 
Of crops; fallow, wheat, peafe and beans, or other green

74 Stati/lical Account 

crop, barley, grafs, and Iaftly oats. Others divide their 
farms into five, inftead of fix parts : The firft part is, partly 
fallow, and partly a green crop ; the fecond is under wheat 
and barley, with grafs feeds ; the third and fourth, are un- 
der grafs ; and the fifth, under oats. And then the rotation 
begins again with fallow, or a green crop. 

The new plough, ufed here, is confidered as an improve- 
ment upon Small's. It has an iron head for the fock, inftead 
of having the fock upon the fheath and the mould-board, 
which is caft iron, is convex inftead of being concave. The 
Scotch plough alfo is ftill ufed. Flax and potatoes are raifed 
in confiderable quantities. Cabbage and turnip alfo are 
raifed for feeding cattle ; but chiefly for rearing young ftock. 
Every family almoft now feeds a pig with potatoes and a lit- 
tle corn i the bacon of which eats very well with their pota- 
toes ; but they have not yet learnt to ufe turnip for culinary 
purpofes. 

There are 2 farms about 400 acres, 4 above 2co, 6 between 1 
100 and 200, a much greater number from 60 to 100, and a 
ftill greater number of pendicles * ; fomeof which are rented 
by mechanics, who, befides attending to their ground, follow 
alfo their proper occupations. The fmall farmers or pendi- 
clers fell little or none of their corn. Their wives, daughters 
and maid-fervants fpin the flax raifed on the farm ; and the 
money which the yarn brings, pays the rent. It is furprifing 
how fome of thefe fmall tenants, poftcffing only about 12 or 14 



acres, 



* Pendicles are fmall portions of land, which do not enable the occupier tc 
keep horfes fufficient for its cultivation, for which he either depends on the 
aflUtance of the farmers in the vicinity, or on the help of his neighbours who- 
are in the fame fituation, giving them the fame afTiltar.cc in his turn. He 
fcldom keeps more than one hone, and one or perhaps U o cows.

acre?, fhould be able to maintain a family of nearly as many 
perfons ; and yet, upon entering their cottages, one generally 
finds them fnug and comfortable, and is pleafed with feeing 
a group of happy faces. Many of them, however, have 
either the profits of tradefmen, or work as day labourers. It 
has been more common here to unite the fmall, than to 
divide the larger farms. The population is ufually much 
greater, where the farms are fmall, than where they are 
large ; yet, the union of farms has not diminished the num- 
■bcr of the inhabitants of this parifh * ; the village of Scone 
and Stormont- field furnifliing them both with habitations 
and employment. 

If the proprietors of the foil, who difpoffefs the fmall to 
make room for the greater farmers, would build villages on 
their eftates, the population would feldom be diminilhed in 
any fituation ; the wealth and comfort of the people would 
increafe in proportion to the fuperior cultivation of the land $ 
the farmers would find a market for a great part of their 
produce at home, and would have day labourers at com- 
mand ; and the proprietors themfelves would derive advan- 
tages from the villages, far beyond the expence of erecting 
them. 

Lulcfures.—K great part of the parifh is inclofed ; and, on 
fome farms, young hedges of hawthorn are raifing, with 
greater attention than was formerly given to this kind of im- 
provement. In the higher lands, the benefit of inclofures is ful- 
ly underitood; but in fome of the lower, fencing by hedges and 
dykts is difapproved of, the foil not admitting of pafture.

Exports.-Th\s parifh exports annually two thirds of its 
corn befides cattle, a few fheep and fwine, (but no horfe*), 
a confiderable quantity of falmon, linen cloth, and free-ftone, 
and difterent articles of provifion. It imports lime, "coals, 
iron, ropes, and feveral other articles of provifion and cloath- 
ing ; but no meal, and no grain, excepting what is neceflary 
for change of feed. 

7W,«;^-Seyeral of the gentlemens gardens are elegant, 
particularly the Earl of Mansneld's ; and mod of them are 
well (locked with vegetables, and fruit trees, and buflies. 
And not only the handicraftsmen, at their leifure hours, but 
the farmers, begin to pay more attention to their gardens 
than formerly ; a certain indication of the thriving ftate of 
this part of the country, men commonly attending, firft, to 
what is neceHary, and then to what is commodious and 
ornamental. Indeed, the appearance both of the country and 
the people, compared with what it was twenty years ago, 
plainly fhow, that they are « growing richer and happier" j 
an evident proof of the excellence of that conftitution of 
government, under which we have the good fortune to live. 

Church and School,— The church is a very handfome modern 
building, and is much decorated by an ancient family feat of 
very curious workmanfhip belonging to the Earl of Manf- 
field. It was built in the year 1784; the manfe in the year 
1743 ; and the latter has been frequently repaired. The 
living, including the glebe, is about L. 100 Sterling. The 
Right Hon. the Earl of Mansfield is patron. The prefent 
incumbent, the Rev. Mr John Wright, is married, and has 
five children *. Befides, the parifh church, there is alfo a 

meeting-

meeting-houfe, belonging to the Burgrier-Seceders. The 
fchoolmafter has a good houfe, which ferves him both for a 
fchool and a dwelling houfe. His falary as fchoolmafter, and his 
emoluments as feffion clerk, amount together to L. 13 : 4 : 8. 
Sterling. The reft of his income depends on the fees he receives 
from his fcholars. The church, meeting-houfe, and fchool are in 
the village of Scone ; which is ornamented alfo with a market 
crofs, formerly a handfome one, but now much injured by the 
hand of time. 

State of the Poor—The money which fupports the poor, 
\s annually about L. 26 Sterling. It arifes from funds in 
money and heritable property, from dues at deaths and 
marriages, and from the weekly collections at the church 
door. The poor on the parifh lift, are, at an average, about 
twelve. They receive monthly 3s. for their fupport ; but, 
others alfo receive occafional fupply. There are no begging 
poor in the parifh. 

In the year 1782, the crop was very bad and much in- 
jured. But then, the prefent Earl of Mansfield, attentive 
to the fituation of the parifh, fent 30 quarters of feed corn, 
to be diftributed amongft his tenants for the fame quantity of 
the produce in return ; and alfo L. 30 Sterling to be diftri- 
buted amongft the poor of the parifh ; though this was not 
the only time, they have experienced his bounty ; fums, 
nearly* of the fame value, being frequently fent them by his 
Lordfhip. 

Fuel— In fummer, the chief fuel is furze, broom, and the 
weedings of the young plantations ; in winter, coals, which 
are bought at Perth and Bridge- end, a village on the fide of 
the Tay, oppofite to Perth, at 3 s. 6d. the boll of 40 ftones

number of fouls in the village is 466. 

^~fteld Bleach^el^TUs place, prefently pofTefled 
by Meflrs Thomas and John Barland, had its name changed 
from Colenhaugh, to Stormont field, in honour of the pro- 
pnetor, the Earl of Mansfield, formerly known by his title 
of Vifcount of Stormont. It is fituated on the Tay, exaclly 
oppofite to Luncarty, and m a pleafant field, along the fide 
of the river, confiding of about 130 acres. A canal, about 
3 miles in length, and ,8 feet in breadth, cut, at a very 
great expence, through deep banks of the Tay, rock-marle 
and whin (lone, always furnifhes it with an abundant fupply 
of excellent water from the river. A fmall canal alfo from 
the brook of Invcrbuift, affords an occafional fupply ; and the 
bleaching grounds are of a fine dry foil, and have an excellent 
expofure. Adjoining to the bleaching- miln, is a miln for 
fpinning cotton, upon a fmall fcale. The houfe for the ma- 
chinery, is a large ftrudure, fubfi.antially built, of free-ftone, 
and noble in its appearance. Some of the other houfes are 
elegant ; and all of them remarkably neat and commodious. 

iiefides the fall of water, which, at prefent, drives three 
wheels, there are likewife three other feparate falls ; one of 
eight feet, and two of four, equal, by the command of water.

to turri any weight of machinery; which, when fully occu- 
pied, will be an important addition to the induftry, and po- 
pulation of the parifh ; the work, it is prefumed, being as yet 
but in its infancy. There is here bleached, in a very Satis- 
factory manner, a great quantity of britannias, diapers, and 
every other fort of cotton and linen cloth. As labourers 
are fcarce in this part of the country, the only thing wanting 
to compleat Stormont-ndd, is an independent village, pro- 
perly laid out, which would be of the gieatefi advantage, 
both to the proprietor, and the public at large. Mr William 
M'Alpin, a man of genius and enterprize, has the merit of 
having begun, and carried on to a considerable length the 
canal and the buildings of this place. 

There is befides bleached, by the pendiclers in the fummer 
feafon, on a brook that runs through the parifh, fome linen 
cloth. The only other manufacture carried on by the inha- 
bitants is linen, which employs about 50 weavers. The red 
of their handicraftfmen are employed either in weaving 
houfe-hold cloth, or in working for mailers in Perth. 

Bridges and Roads. — The roads and bridges were formerly 
made and repaired by the ftatute labour, fometimes literally 
exacted, and fometimes commuted into money ; but this 
method being found infufficient for the great roa.ds, and 
turnpike ads being obtained, the roads will foon be very 
good. Two turnpike roads interfering the parifh, (and its 
vicinity to Perth,) but not yet compleated, are juftly con- 
fidered by the inhabitants, as very great advantages. 

Eminent Men.—\t is very probable, that the famous John 
Hay, alias John cfe Luce, chief of the Hay'*, was a native of 
this parifh. The inhabitants ftiil point to the village, and 
even to the vtftiges of the houfe, in which he lived, when, 
3 like 



8o Statijlical Account 

like a patriot indeed, he haftened from the plough, to drive 
the Danes from his native land. 

But it is certain, that it can boaft of having given birth to 
the late very eminent Earl of Mansfield. Yet, from what 
appeared in the Newfpapers, on the death of that Nobleman, 
it fhould feemj that, as feven cities contended for the birth of 
Homer, a neighbouring parifh is inclined to difpute with it 
that honour. What perhaps may have in part contributed to 
give rife to the opinion, that he was born in Perth, is the 
following circumftance. The Vifcount of Stormont, his 
father, had a houfe in that town, in which the family fome- 
times refided. And it was in the public grammar fchool 
of Perth, that the Earl, after having been fometime under 
the care of a private tutor, received the rudiments of his edu- 
cation. It would be a proud diftin£Uon to any fchool, to 
have given even the elements of knowledge to a man, who 
was certainly one of the molt eminent perfonages whom this 
country has ever produced j and to whom, as Lord Chef- 
terfield fays in one of his letters to his fon, a numerous 
and noify houfe of commons, would liftcn with fuch atten- 
tion, that one might have heard a pin fall, when he was? 
fpeaking. 

Of the People. — It has been frequently obferved, that the 
inhabitants of the parifh of Scone were diftinguiflied, not 
only by the decency of their drefs and appearance, but by 
the propriety of their manners and behaviour. The fact may 
be accounted for j in part, from the example of the family of 
Stormont, who were patterns of religion and good morals, 
as well as decorous manners ; and in part, from the powerful 
miniftry of a very worthy man, who was a long time their 
pallor-, caufes, which, in a greater or lefs degree, will al- 
ways influence the morals of the people. The general cha- 
racter 



of Scond. g f 

rafter of the prefent race is fobriety, induftry, and oeconomy. 
The lower clafs are humane, civil, obliging, and hofpitable. 
The rich are more : They are genteel, and well bred. But 
the beft proof of their morals is, that moft of them are in 
comfortable, and many of them in affluent circumftances, ac- 
cording to their rank in life ; and that no inftance can be re- 
membered, in which any perfons of this parim fuffered the 
punifliment of crimes. 

The public houfes, (imply as fuch, would not, it is pre- 
fumed, have any bad influence on the morals of the people 
were it not for the immenfe quantities of whifky which they 
retail, in place of well-made ale, which was formerly the 
only beverage. There are men in this part of the country 
wno confider the large diflilleries as gulphs, which fw a ]l ow 
up prodigious quantities of grain, and difcharge nothing but 
what ferves to dertroy the health and morals of the people - 
and they very much defire that the legiflacure would devife 
fome way, which, feconded by the example of the great, 
mould bang again into famion the ufe of home-mad! fer- 
mented malt liquors which the encouragement given t0 the 
diftUlenes has brought almoft entirely into difufe. 

^V^.--Near the eaft boundary of the parim are two 
cn-cles, fa,d to be druidical temples. They are within lA 
yards of each other. Each circle confifts of nine large whin 
Hones, p aced at. unequal diftances , and each circle i. feven 
yards in diameter. u

now a hamlet, bearing that name ■, and it is faid, that there, 
in former times, there was a bridge over the river, and that 
feveral large beams of oak, yet to be feen under the water, 
formed a part of it. 

About a quarter of a mile up the river from this place, are 
the veftiges, it is fuppofed, of an encampment. It is a fpot 
of ground inclofed, on the weft, by the Tay ; and on the 
other fides, by a fofle. Its figure is nearly an oblong, and its 
circumference, about 535 yards. A fmall brook runs through 
it ; and on the fouth fide of this brook, about 30 yards up 
from the river, are the veftiges of a fortification, called the 
Silver caftle ; probably, from a vulgar idea that money was 
hid in it. This place is fituated, nearly about half way be- 
tween the Roman military road, and a place on the oppofite 
fide of the river, where the battle of Luncarty was fought 
between the Danes and the Scots. But time, and the recent 
operations of the plough, have now almoft obliterated thofe 
monuments of ancient times. 

Perhaps the veftiges of the famous John Hay's houfe, and 
the crofs of Scone, maybe clafled among the antiquities. 
The former is nothing but the remains of a cottage, a little 
raifed above the furface of the earth, and covered with grafs. 
The latter is a narrow upright ftone, thirteen feet high, orna- 
mented at the top, and placed m an o&amp;agoaal ftone, that 
refts on a quadrangular flight of fteps. 

But what excites the curiofity of every perfon who has 
been interefted in reading the hiftory of Scotland, and attrafts- 
the attention of alinoft every traveller, is Scone. This being 
anciently the refidence of our kings, and the fcene of the 
moft intending and fpWid anions, feme account of if. 
muft be exoeaed by the reader. At the Reformation the

booty, fpolledand burnt both the ancient Abbey and Palace *. 
The Abbey wall, from the foundations which have been dug 
up, is fuppofed to have inclofed a fpace of 12 acres. 

« This Abbey, fays Spottifwood, was founded by Alexati- 
« der the firft, 1 1 14, and was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, 
« and St. Michael. It was the place where our kings were 
c accuftomed to be crowned, and where the fatal marble 
" chair, now at Weftminfter, was ufually kept. It former- 
« ly belonged to the Culdees, if we truft George Buchanan, 
« and feveral other authors ; and it was erected into a tem- 
" poral lordfliip, in favour of Sir David Murray, a cadet of 
* the family of Tullibardine, in the year 1604" f. 

It is uncertain whether the prefent houfe of Scone, a feat 
of the Earl of Mansfield, ftands on any part of the founda- 
tions of the former buildings. Two lines of a Scotch poet, 
a native of Perth %, who had every opportunity of informing 
himfelf with regard to this particular, would lead a perform 
to fuppofe, that it does. 

As tue thus talk'd, our barge did fweet'y pafs, 
By Scone's fair Palace, fometime Abbey was. 

It is about a mile due north, from the town of Perth. It 
ftands upon a piece of rifing ground, about half a mile from 
the Tay ; and is fituated in the rnidft of an exteniive lawn, 
■which Hopes gradually towards the river. 

Round the houfe, except on the fouth weft, where it is 
open, runs a fhrubery and young plantation, interfered with 
ferpentiue gravel walks ; and intermixed with old trees,

before ,t, and on each fide, the verdant furface of the lawn 

ipreads itfelf, covered with daifies, and variegated with trees 

planted fingly, and in clumps. 

This fcene, bounded by the river, which flows gently be- 

Ticath, is admired by all ft„ngers who vifit this country ; 

and is greatly heightened by the beauty and variety of the 

banks of the river, as far as Perth. 

Nothing can be more delightful than the profpeft from 
the houfe, to the weftward. On the left hand, at the dif- 
tance of two or three miles, the hills above the Tay, and the 
Earn, feem to unite, forming a vaft theatre, decorated with 
plantations, and corn-fields On the right, at the diftance 
of fifteen miles, the Grampian mountains aflame a fimilar 
form; and in the middle, induftry and flail have given a 
gay and cultivated afpeft, to a very extenfiye trad of 
country. 

The houfe itfelf is in that ftile of archite&amp;ure which pre- 
vailed about a century and a half ago ; which gives it a cer- 
tain noble and venerable air, more pleafing to men of genuine 
tafte than the mod finifhed modern buildings. It is about 70 
yards in length, and 35 in breadth. The gallery which is on 
the eaft fide, is 140 feet long. The ceiling is of timber, and 
arched. On the one fide of it is painted the hunting of a ftag 
in all its different ftages; on the other are reprefented the 
exercife of hawking, the hunting of the wild boar and the wild 
bull. It is faid that king James the fixth appears in every 
fcene ; that the groupes of figures attending him are the no- 
bles of the court ; and that all of them are exaft reprefenta- 
tions of the originals. The fpaces between the different 
fcenes are filled up with the arms of the family, with fruit 
and flower pieces and other ornaments. In the opinion of 
artifts, the defign in thefe paintings is good, and the faces 

animated. 



of Scone, 85 

animated. The colours appear to have been vivid ; but by 
accidents and the wafte of time the whole has fuffered confi- 
c/erable damage. 

In a chamber off the north end of the gallery is the canopy 
of (late, ufed by the prefent Earl of Mansfield, when ambaffa- 
dor at the court of Verfailles, now converted into a bed ; 
p.nd in another off the fouth end, which is called the king's 
room, is a bed of damafk fattin of a light orange colour, and 
feveral antique chairs covered with the fame fort of cloth. 
In a chamber on the weft fide of the houfe, which is called 
the Queen's room, is a bed of flowered, crimfon velvet, faid to 
have been the work of Queen Mary, when a prifoner in the 
caftle of Lochleven. Thefe chambers, as well as the drawing 
room, are decorated with marble chimney pieces, with hang- 
ings of fine tapeftry, with portraits of the anceftors and rela- 
tions of the family, and of other great perfonages who lived in 
former times; and with other forts of painting, fome of 
which, though injured by the hand of time, are {till admired. 
The dining-room is fpacious and elegant. In this room is a 
fuperb marble chimney-piece, on the upper part of which are 
the arms of Britain, and on the lower thofe of the family of 
Stormont ; and at one end of it are two very elegant full 
length portraits of their prefent majefties, drawn in their royal 
robes, and as large as the life. 

About 100 yards due eaft from the fouth eaft corner of the 
houfe are the veftiges of the old abbey church ; but fuch 
changes does time introduce, that, on that fpot where our 
ancient kings were crowned, there now grows a clump of 
trees. 

Between 60 and 70 yards north from this place is what is 
vulgarly called the Boot-hill. It is likewife called Omnis terra, 
or Every man's land. Hume in his hiftory of the Dou- 
glaffcs gives us the origin of this name, « that when Robert 

" Bruce 



86 Statiftical Account 

« Bruce was crowned 27th March 1306, Sir James, the 8th 
" Lord Douglas, affifted, and caft into a heap, as did the o- 
" ther Barons, a quantity of earth of his lands of Douglas; 
" which, making a little hill, is called Omnis terra. This 
" was the cuftora of thofe times, by which homage, they 
" who held the king of Scotland fupreme under God were 
" diftinguifhed from others. It is faid that the Barons of 
" Scotland could receive inveftitureof their lands aslawfully by 
" delivering earth and ftone from this fpor, as from their own 
« lands. We are informed alfo, that anciently the convert* 
" tions of the nobles were held in this place 

The tradition of the people of the parifh concerning the 
Boot-hill is, that at the coronation of a king, every man who 
affifted brought fo much earth in his boors, that every man 
might fee the king crowned, {landing on his own land ; and 
that afterwards, they caft the earth out of their boots on this 
hill, upon which account it obtained the names of Boot-hill 
and Omnis terra. But, perhaps, Boot-hill is a corruption of 
Moot hill or Mute hill ; which is probably the fame with the 
Saxon word, folk-mote, and frray iignuy the hill of meeting. 
The people in the Highlands, it is faid, call the Boot-hill, at 
this day, Tom-a- mhoid, i. e. the lnii where juftice is adminif- 
tered. On the Boot-hill David, ift vifcount of Stormonr, built 
an elegant parifh church about the year 1624, when the old 
abbey church or what remained of it fell. But, a few years 
ago, this church wanting rep-iirs, and being inefficient to 
accommodate the parifhioners, was, except the aifle, thrown 
down, and the prefent parifh church built in the village of 
Scone. 

On the north wall of this aifle is a very (lately marbk- mo- 
nument 



£ Cant's hiflory of Perth. 



of Scone. s 7 

nument ereded to the memory of David, firfl Vifcount of 
Stormont. It feems to have been intended for an altar-piece, 
and to reprefent the infide of a chapel or oratory. In the 
middle, towards the lower part of it, is a ftatue of his Lord- 
fhip as large as the life, clad in armour, kneeling on a cufliion 
at an altar, a book lying open before him, and the palms of 
his hands joined, as if earneftly engaged in devotion. On ei- 
ther fide is a man in armour, fomewhat fmaller than the life ; 
the one faid to be the Marquis of Tullibarcline, the other the 
Earl Marefchall. Above thefe are feveral emblematical fi- 
gures ; towards the top are the arms of the family ; and, 
over all, an angel, who feems to look down with appro- 
bation. 

On the eaft wall is an elegant monument of blue and white 
marble, ereded in honour of Lady Stormont, firft Lady to the 
prefent Earl of Mansfield. On a pedeftal, in a marble nitch 
in the wail, Hands a large urn of white marble, in which is 
inclofed the Lady's heart embalmed ; and below, on the pe- 
deftal, a remarkably elegant and pathetic Latin infeription, 
expreffive of the Lady's great worth, and the regret occafion- 
ed by her death ; which does much honour, not only to 

the genius and erudition, but to the heart, of its noble 

author. 

As we advance by a gravel walk from the houfe to the eaft* 
ward, we are agreeably furprifed to find ourfelves, on entering 
the (hrubery, in the midft of a fmall lawn of a circular form, 
furrounded by flirubs and trees of unequal height, which, to- 
gether with the furface of the earth, exhibit the appearance of 
a crowded amphitheatre. Here, and all along the fhrubery 
and young plantation, luxuriant nature may be feen to wan- 
ton in all the richnefs, variety and gaiety of foliage. So rich 
is the foil, that fome of the trees, though planted within 
thefe nine years, have attained the height of thirty feet.

Ancient Cujom.—Eveij year on Shrove-Tuefday, the bat- 
chelors and married men drew themfelves up at the crofs of 
Scone on oppofite fides. A ball was then thrown up, and 
they played from 2 o'clock till fun fet. The game was this. 
He who, at any time got the ball into his hands, run with it 
till overtaken by one of the oppofite party, and then, if he 
could make himfelf loofe from thofe on the oppofite fide, 
who feized him, he run on : if not, he threw the ball from 
him, unlefs it was wrefted from him by the other party ; but 
no perfon was allowed to kick ita The objecl of the married 
men was to hang it, i. e. to put it three times into a fmall 
hole in the moor, the dool or limit on the one hand ; that of 
the batchelors was to drown it, i. e. to dip it three times into 
a deep place in the river, the limit on the other. The party 



of Scone. 8$ 

who could effect either of thefe objecls, won the game. But, .. 
if neither party won, the ball was cut into two equal parts at 
fun-fet. In the courfe of the play one might always fee fome 
fcene of violence between the parties; but, as the proverb of 
this part of the country expreffes it, all was fair at the ball of 
Scone. 

This cuftom is fuppofed to have had its origin in the days of 
chivalry. An Italian, ' it is faid, came into this part of the 
country, challenging all the pariflhes, under a certain penalty 
in cafe of declining his challenge. All the parilhes declined 
the challenge excepting Scone, which beat the foreigner ; and. 
in commemoration of this gallant action the game was in- 
ftituted. 

Whilft the cuftom continued, every man in the parifh, the 
gentry not excepted, was obliged to turn out and fupport the 
fide to which he belonged ; and the perfon who negle&amp;ed to 
do his part on that occafion was fined ; but the cuftom being 
attended with certain inconveniencies, was aboliflied a few 
years ago.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1013539">GARGUNNOCK</name> 



(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 



By the Rev. Mr James Robertson,</head>


<p>

Situation. 



ARGUNNOCK, or Gargownno (as it is called in fome 



old records), is fituated about fix miles weft of the 
town of Stirling, on the fouth fide of the Forth, by which it 
is feparated from the parifhes of Kilmadock, and Kinkardine. 
It is bounded on the eaft and fouth, by the parifh of St. Ni- 
nians, and on the weft, by Kippen, Balfron, and Fintry. 

Name. — It feems of no great importance, toafcertain thepre- 
cife meaning of the word Gargownno. Different etymologifts 
will give different explanations of the names of places, in which 
there is often more imagination than knowledge. Gargownno 
is probably of Celtic origin ; defcriptive of the particular fpot, 
on the banks of the Forth, where a fmall fort flood, of 
which there is fome account in the Hiflory of Sir William 
Wallace. There we read of the* Peel of Gargownno, in 




which 



* Peel fignifics a fort. 



of Gargunnock, 91 

which an Englifh party was ftationed, to watch the paffage 
of the Frew, in its neighbourhood. Wallace with a few 
followers, took the fort by ftratagem in the night, while 
the Englifh were off their guard. The curious flranger may 
be conducted to the ground which it once occupied ; and 
may perhaps regret, that fcarcely a done is now left to tell 
its {lory. There is fomething fo venerable in the abodes of 
our anceflors (though in ruins), that it is much to be wifhed, 
the frequent practice of carrying them away, for the purpofc 
of making dykes, or fences, was for ever abolifhed. The 
remains of the bridge of Offers, about a quarter of a mile 
weft ward of the Peel, by which Wallace crofTed the Forth, 
on his way to the mofs of Kinkardine, are flill in exiftence ; 
and for feveral years, it has been in agitation to rebuild it, 
which would greatly facilitate the communication betwixt 
the parifhes on both fides of the river, and encourage tenants 
to give an additional rent for their farms. 

Extent.— This parifh extends about three miles and an 
half, from eaft to weft, and from north to fouth it mea- 
fures fix. 

Divifwn of Lands. — All the eftates confift of muir, dry field, 
and carfe farms. On the fouth is the muir, which is part of 
a hilly trad of ground, ftretching out from Stirling to Dum- 
barton. That portion of the muir which belongs to this 
parifh, confifts of about 3000 acres, of which each heritor 
has a divifion, lying in a direft line with his other lands. 

The muir has of late become an object of greater confide- 
ratton, than in former periods. The demand for fuch paf 
ture . 8 much increafed ; and this has naturally led the pro- 
F-etors to fet a higher value on it, than they were ao 
cuftomed to do a few years ago. Every one has his own 

^ 3 proportion 



9 1 Statijlical Account 

proportion accurately meafured; and its worth is now fo 
well underftood, that fometimes it is no eafy matter to fettle 
a difpute about a few acres ; which perhaps, in other times, 
would have gone for nothing. That part of the muir, which 
is connected with the eftate of Gargunnock, was let, laft 
year, at almoft double the former rent ; but the proprietor 
hath this year taken it into his own hands ; and having pe- 
rufed Sir John Sinclair's pamphlet on the fubjeft, hath been 
induced to ftock it with the Cheviot breed of fheep. The 
ihepherd, who has been brought from that country, is hopeful 
the experiment will fucceed to a wifh, although all the fheep 
farmers here are ftrongly prejudifed againft the fcheme ; and 
predict its total failure, during the winter months. The fupe- 
rior quality, and price of the wool, is a fufficient juftification 
of the attempt ; and if the plan is fuccefsful, it will certain- 
ly turn out one of the moft beneficial of all our improvements. 
Men of property alone are qualified to engage in defigns of 
this nature. If they are fuccefsful, they will foon be follow- 
ed by others ; and fociety at large will reap the good fruits of 
iheir labours. Or, fuppofing the undertaking mould prove 
abortive, they are fufficiently able to fuftain the lofs. That 
man is deferving of praife, who employs his fubftance in 
fuch laudable purfuits, as according to his belt judgement 
may be ufeful to the community, as well as to himfelf. 

It would be of great advantage, both to the landlord and te- 
nant, if care was always taken to annex to the muirland farm 
fome low lying fields, of better pafture ; as, where this is not 
the cafe, the farmer is often obliged to fend his flock du- 
ring the winter to a great diftance, which mud be attended 
with inconvenience. Col. Eidingtoun of Gargunnock is 
well provided in this fefpecl ; a circumftance favourable to 
his purpofe of rearing the Cheviot breed. The tenants of 
the muir of Boquhan, in this parifh, are alfo well accommo- 
dated. 



of Gargunnock,

dated. They poflefs fome good pafture ground, immediately 
below the hill, which adds much to the value of their farms, 
both with refpe£l to convenience and profit. They are at 
pains never to overftock thofe fields, in fummer j and the' 
Iheep find abundant provifion in them, in winter. By this 
means, the muir is covered by the flieep which it has bred ; 
and the farmer fays, that fuch as have been thus reared at 
home, turn out much better than thofe which he hath brought, 
at any time, from other parts of the country. 

It is feldom that any part of the muir is cultivated for raif- 
ing grain. Attempts have been made this way, but molt fre- 
quently with little or no fuccefs. A few acres near the houfe of 
the farmer, have been fown with oats or barley, but a good crop 
was never expected. The foil and climate forbid the ufe of the 
plough. There are extenfive meadows ; which, after having 
been covered with water in the winter, and had a little manure 
thrown upon the furface, produce abundance of excellent hay ; 
and hay-making, which is generally in the month of Auguft, 
is the principal harveft. 

The whole of the muir is without inhabitants, two families 
excepted, which poflefs that part of it belonging to General 
Campbell of Boquhan. Gargunnock-muir, as has been dat- 
ed above, is in the hands of its own proprietor ; but the other 
divifions are rented by iheep farmers in neighbouring pa- 
rilhes. To refide at a diftancc from the farm muft always 
be attended with difadvantage. It is impoflible the necefiary 
attention can be given to the flock. Or, if the truft is com- 
mitted to a fliepherd, whofe vifits are only occafional, and who 
cannot be conftantly at hand, efpecially amid the ftorms of 
winter, when much exertion is often requifite to fave the 
animals ; it is eafy to fee the rifque muft be greater^ than 
when the mafter himfelf, or fome fuch interefted perfon, re- 
fides on the fpot. 

The two muirland houfes have nothing in appearance to re- 
commend 



94 Statiftical Account 

commend them; and yet the low roof, the fort of door 
which obliges a perfon for the fake of his head to make a pro- 
found bow as he walks in, and the pitiful window, which 
fcarcely affords him fufficient light to mow him where he is, 
are inconveniencies foon forgotten, when he is placed by the 
fire fide. The inhabitants though dwelling in a defert, have 
a civility of manners which does them honour. An old fol- 
dier who came to their door, was kindly received, and conti- 
nued for years to make their houfe his home. All the return 
they could expert, was a little amufement in the winter even- 
ings, while he rehearfed the ftory of fieges and battles. 

If houfes for the entertainment of the public cannot 
be expeded in a country that is thinly inhabited, this 
difadvantage is fo much the lefs felt, that the people 
are remarkable for hofpitality. There is a kindnefs to the 
ftranger, which is feldom to be met with in larger and more 
polifhed focietiee. If there is little ceremony, there is much 
good will. 

In many places of the muir, there are roots of trees difco- 
vered, of a large fize, from which it appears to have been 
once a foreft ; but now a tree cannot be difcerned. While 
afcending the hill, a little copfe-wood may be perceived upon 
the edge of the rock, which the fheep cannot reach. 

The accefs to the muir is by narrow pafTes called ballochs *. 
General Campbell of Boquhan has, lately, at no fmall expence, 
made an excellent road from the ford of l^rew, to his muir- 
land. This road, fix miles long, has opened up an eafy com- 
munication with the low country. Carts can now approach 
the heights to carry down peats, the fuel in common ufe, or to 
receive the dung that would other wife be thrown into the wa- 
ter.

ter. In forming this road he met with oppofition from the 
tenants of the muir. The many advantages derived 'from it 
have now corrected their miftakes and prejudices, in op- 
pofing what was fo evidently intended for their benefit. 

It is delightful to look down from the hills to the cultivated 
plain below. The profpect is extenfive and beautifully diver- 
fified. The windings of the Forth, the fertile valley, adorned 
on both fides with the feats of the proprietors, and ftretching from 
weft to eaft farther than the eye can reach ; and the range of 
mountainous country on the north and fouth, ferving as a 
wall to {belter it from the dorms, form altogether one of the 
mod pifturefque fcenes in Scotland. The beauty of the 
landfcape is greatly increafed of late, by the very extraordinary 
improvements in the mofs of Kincardine, belonging to Mr 
Drummond; where many families, encouraged by the liberal 
terms held out to them by that gentleman, have fettled and 
live comfortably. As their number is daily increafing, and 
each family is bound to remove a certain portion of the mofs 
yearly ; it is underftood, that the period is at no great diftance, 
when upwards of athoufand acres of carfe land will be added 
to his eftate, while in the mean time thofe who clear the 
ground of the mofs have an ample reward. The plan has 
fucceeded beyond every expectation. There is no object of 
curiofity, in this part of the country, equal to the improve- 
ments in the mofs of Kincardine. 

The inhabitants of this parifh look to the hills for figns of 
the weather, and are feldom difappointed. The fttting fun, 
fliining on the face of the mountain, indicates fair weather ; 
while the fudden falling of mift on the top of it, foon after 
he has arifen bright, is confidered as the fure mark of a rainy 
day. 

Several rivulets flowing from different quarters of the muir, 
and at length uniting, form a fucceflion of cafcades, over

craggy precipices, which after heavy rains, are feen and heard 
at a great diftance. The beft view of them is from the 
nfing ground , at the weft end of ^ . f

Drrfelds-Tht dryfields occupy the intermediate fpace, 
between the muir and the carfe grounds. Their name fup- 
pofes that they are not fubjeft to thofe floods, which frequent- 
ly cover the carfe, a flat low-lying country. Befides their 
being confiderably raifed above the level of the carfe, and their 
gradual afcent to the bottom of the hills, which makes it im- 
poffible for water to remain upon their furface ; they are alfo 
for the molt part of fuch a light fandy foil, as quickly ab- 
forbs the rain, and mews the propriety of the name they 
bear. 

The greateft part of the dryfields, until of late, lay wafte 
and wild, overrun with furze and broom. Few of them were 
fubdividedor inclofed or cultivated in any considerable degree. 
Plantations were not in ufe, and excepting on the fides of the 
glens, fcarcely any thing like a tree was to be feen. But now 
it is quite a new fcene. All the heritors have united in a 
regular plan of inclofing with dykes and hedges. Many of the 
uncultivated fpots are covered with thriving plantations. The 
country is adorned and the farms iheltered. 

In giving fome account of the prefent ftate of the dryfields, 
Boquhan, the property of Lieut. John F. Campbell claims 
particular attention, as his unwearied exertions, in executing 
an extenfive plan of improvements for thirteen years pafl, 
have beautified and enriched his lands, in a high degree. 

The plan has been carried on at an expence, exceeding at 
times the rental of the eftate ; and yet fuch expenditure is not 
loft, if by this means the value of the ground is proportion-

febly increafed, and bread is given to the induftrious poor. 
Fifty or fixty day labourers, and occafionally a greater number, 
are employed in planting, hedging, draining, ditching, root- 
ing out whatever might obftrudr. the plough, making good 
roads from farm to farm, and fencing the young hedges and 
plantations againft injury from cattle. Twenty five pounds 
fterling per week, laid out in this manner, have not only 
fertilized many wafte and barren fields, but havealfo afforded 
the means of fubfiftance to not a few families in the neigh- 
bourhood. Every one muft have fome amufemcnt, and there 
are amufements which pleafe not on reflexion ; but, when, 
agricultural improvements are viewed merely in the light of 
an amufement, (though they were attended with no other 
advantage), it is certainly one of the mod rational that can be 
conceived, and to a generous mind it muft give real pleafure, 
as every ftep taken to cultivate the country, contributes to the 
general advantage of the community. 

A pamphlet lately publifhed by the General himfelf, en- 
titled " Notes refpe&amp;ing the Situation and Improvements of 
" the Lands of Boquhan", defcribes in a lively, entertaining, 
inftru&amp;ive manner, the change produced on the dryfields, 
fince they came into his pofTcffion. 

Thefe improvements may not appear fo finking to thofe 
who faw their commencement, and have been accuflomed to 
obferve their progress from day to day, as they muft to every 
one, who may now return to Boquhan, after an abfence of 
feveral years. Strangers, as they pafs along, are charmed 
with the fcene, and furvey at Icifure that rich variety of 
natural and artificial beauty which furrounds them. 

There is only one thing regretted, by fome of the inhabi- 
tants. It was neceflary, to pull down a confiderable number 
of cottages. Three or four final! farms are thrown into one, 
by which means, the population of the dry fields is diminifh-

ed : but when it is confidered that the lands are now cultivat- 
ed to much better purpofc than formerly, that they are doubly 
fruitful, and that wherever a family is pofleffed of a few 
acres only, even the neceflaries «f life mull be procured 
with difficulty ; when to this it is added, that fuch perfons 
find no worfe fubfiftence as day-labourers, than as tenants of 
what do not merit the name of farms, it rnufl be owned, 
that the method which is now almoft univerfally adopted, of 
having fewer tenants, but larger farms, is of advantage to 
the country, while it is attended with no permanent lofs to 
any individual. 

Better houfes are alfo obtained, than could be expected 
were the farm to confift of little more than twelve or twenty 
acres. And this muft uniformly be the cafe, wherever farms 
are extenfive, and let to fubftantial tenants j as .when one 
farm-houfe only is required, where three or four perhaps 
were formerly neceffary, the farmer will be better accommo- 
dated, in every refpecl, in a ftyle of elegance unknown in 
former times, and with lefs expence to the landlord. 

Dr Moir of Leckie, whofe lands are fituated eaftward of 
Boquhan, has alfo commenced a plan of improvement, in the 
dry fields, by inclofing and planting fuch fpots of ground, as 
are but little adapted to cultivation. When the gentleman, 
whom he lately fucceeded, came to the eftate, it was incum- 
bered with heavy debts. He inflantly refolved, that his in- 
come whatever it might be, fhould exceed his expenditure, 
until he gave every one his own. He lived long enough to 
fee his laudable purpofs: fulfilled. The plan he had laid 
down, however, made him unwilling to engage in any expen- 
five fcheme of improvement ; and when the period at length 
arrived, which brought him the accomplishment of his wifhes, 
he was then fo far advanced in life, as to find no enjoyment 
in purfuits which require all the vigour and activity of youth. 



of Gargunnock.

On this account, it muft be acknowledged, that the lands oT 
Leckie are far behind fome other eftates in the parifh, with 
refpetl to thofe elegant improvements, which ufually diftin- 
guifh the refidence of men of fortune and tafte. 

The prefent proprietor has already done much to remedy 
this defect, and laft year, more than double the ufual num- 
ber of labourers was employed. The place is beginning to 
aflume a new afpect. A garden is to be immediately formedj 
in a field very favourable for foil and expofure ; and when 
the family make the houfe of Leckie their ftated abode, 
which it is expected will foon happen, there is every reafon 
to believe that rapid progrefs will be made in many other 
ufeful and ornamental improvements. 

About a mile to the eaftward of Leckie, the road from 
Stirling to Dumbarton pafles over a rifing ground, and there 
the dryfields of the barony of Gargunnock are viewed to ad- 
vantage. The fpectator is charmed with the profpect. The 
cafcades from the hills, the glens covered on each fide, fome 
with natural wood, and others- with regular plantations, the 
village, the church and manfe, the chimney tops of Gargun- 
nock-houfe juft difcerned above the wood, the well drelTed 
fields, fome for pafture, and others for crops of various kinds, 
and all inclofed with dykes and hedges in excellent repair, 
form altogether a very fine landfcape. The inclofures how- 
ever^ which are immediately under the hill, and have been 
long in pafture, are over-run with furze and broom, which 
are almoft their only produce, when not cultivated for feve- 
ral years. Fields of this nature, it has been faid by fheep- 
farmers, are exceedingly ufeful in the winter, as the fheep 
feed on furze. But as fields in grafs are fuperior in every 
refpea, the proprietor has begun to clear away this kind of 
fhrubbery. Burning or rooting out furze and broom, does 
not anfwer fo well, as cutting them a little above the furface

however can do the bufinefs fo efFedually, as the plough 5 and 
when the grounds are again thrown into pafture, the cattle 
will prevent them from relapfing into their former wild ftate,

Gargunnock-hpufe, new the feat of Col. Eidingtoun, (lands 
on an elevated fituation, near where the dry-fields are united 
to the carfe i and commands an extenfive profped. Though 
of an irregular figure, it contains good accommodation for a 
genteel family. Some parts of it are evidently of ancient 
date. On the eaft wing, there is a fort of tower, which 
gives it a dignified afpecl on that quarter ; and until a few 
years ago, there was a high wail, and ftrong gate in front of 
it, which indicated that it was defigned as a place of ftrength. 
It is probable the Peel, which was at a little diftance, having 
been abandoned, or fallen into decay, it became neceffary 
that the manfion of Gargunnock mould be fo conftru&amp;ed, 
as to become a place of fafety to its inhabitants. 

The barony of Gargunnock, for near a century paft, be- 
longed to the family of Ardkindlas ; and the late Sir James 
Campbell, whofe memory will be long dear to the parifh, 
having refided chiefly here, was at great expence, in making 
improvements both on the houfe, and the adjoining fields. 
The removal of the wall and gate, marked the manners of 
the times. The garden and orchard, which were immediate- 
ly under the windows, were alfo removed ; high grounds were 
levelled ; an addition was made to the houfe, in a modem 
ftyle : A Hoping bank was formed on the eaft and fouth, 
where the garden formerly was, and. where flieep now feed* 
and from the high road, to which he gave a new direction, 
an approach was made to the houfe, far fuperior to any in 
this part of the country. 

The 



of Gargunnock* loi 

The houfe of Gargunnock has acquired an additional gran- 
deur, from the fine front built by Col. Eidingtoun in fummer 
laft. 

There is one general remark to be made, refpe&amp;ing the 
dry fields. No portion of them is now allowed to lie ne- 
glected. They are almoft entirely inclofed throughout their 
whole extent, to the bottom of the mountain ; and the heri- 
tors vie with each other, in decorating and fertilizing this 
part of their property. 

Carfe. — Etymologifts explain this word, as fignifying. rich, 
or fertile. This account is juftified by fact, for fuch lands, 
when properly cultivated, produce luxuriant crops. About 
forty years ago, the carfe grounds lay almoft in a (late of 
nature, unprofitable to the landlord, for it was difficult to 
find men who would venture to poffefs them. Bad roads, 
fields uninclofed, the ftiffhefs of the foil, ignorance of that kind 
of farming which is fuited to the carfe, prefented great difB- 
culties when any attempt was made towards improvement. 
But now it is aftonifliing to obfervc the effects of better huf- 
bandry. The rivulets flowing from the hills, through the 
carfe, have been confined within their proper channel, fo as 
to prevent the overflowing of the fields, excepting upon very 
rare occafions, after exceffive rains ; many of the farms are 
fenced with hedges, in a thriving condition ; the old divifion 
of the lands into outfield, and infield has been abolifhed. 
The praftice of liming is followed, with great fuccefs ; a re- 
gular rotation of crops has been almoft univerfally adopted ; 
and from 4 (hillings fterling per acre, there has been of late 
a rife to upwards of a guinea, and in fome inftances, to 30 
(hillings fterling. 

The whole carfe it is believed, was originally under water. 
Beds of (hells, fimilar to thofe which are now in the Frith of 

Forth, 



102 Statiflical Account 

Forth, have been difcovered In feveral places. This feems to 
jufhfy the opinion, that the carfe has, at fome diftant period, 
been gained from the fea. In later times, it was covered 
Wlfh what has been called the Caledonian foreft ; at leaft it 
is certain, that when the Romans were in this neighbourhood, 
the carfe was filled with trees of a large fize, which they cut 
down, to diflodge the Scottim army that took refuge there. 
. The carfe P^perty of Mr Graham, an heritor of this pa- 
rifli, ftill goes by the name of Micklewoo'd, which evidently re- 
fers to a former period of its hiftory : For although there arc 
fome uncommonly fine trees, chiefly oaks, near his houfe, 
which muft have been there for fome centuries* Micklewood 
undoubtedly fignifies a wood much more extent! ve, than can 
now be difcerned in this country. The probability is, that not 
only the whole carfe of this and the neighbouring parifhes, 
but the dry-fields alfo were a foreft ; as large roots of trees, 
which are manifeftly of very ancient date, are every where 
found, efpecially on the fides of the glens. 

It appears that after the foreft was cut down, what is now 
called carfe, became mofs. Not long ago, about two acres 
ftill remained in this fituation, in the carfe of Boquhan, to 
fhew what the whole once was ; and at the prefent day, there 
are upwards of iooo acres of mofs, in the carfe of Blair- 
drummond, in the parifh of Kinkardine, directly north of 
the lands of Micklewood. This mofs, as has been mentioned 
above, is daily diminifhing. Trees of extraordinary bulk are 
found in it. The trunk feparated from the root, and lying 
at a little diftance, with the marks of the ax upon it, proves 
not only the exigence, but the cutting down of the foreft. 
Upon this the mofs gradually grew ; fcarcely any part of it is 
deeper than another. The cleared grounds are on a level with 
the fields in culture around them, and fo fertile is the land thus 
won from the mofs, that after burning the furface, it bears 

plentiful 



of Gargunnock, iq$ 

plentiful crops of oats, for feveral years, without any fort of 
manure. 

The proprietors of Boquhan and Micklewood are the only 
heritors of diilinclion who refide in the carfe ; and their houfes 
and plantations appear beautiful from the heights. The ve- 
nerable oaks of Micklewood, attract the attention of every vi- 
fitor. Nor can we omit to mention the row of firs, where 
herons, time immemorial, have built their nefts, and brought 
forth their young. Thefe firs of Micklewood are the only 
trees of the kind in the parifh to which they refort, and Mr 
Graham allows thofe trees to remain chiefly on their account. 

All the roads in the carfe (excepting that of Boquhan and 
Micklewood), are fo extremely bad, that during the rainy 
feafons they are almoft impaflible. At fuch times, carts 
cannot be ufed. Every thing muft be carried on horfebaclc, 
and even in this way it is with difficulty that the bufinefs 
is accomplished. When the farmers are fpoken to indivi- 
dually upon the fubjecl, they are conftantly complaining of 
their roads, and feem anxious to affift in repairing them. But 
no one choofes to fet about the work alone. When the time is 
convenient forone, it is inconvenient for another. Fair weather 
comes, the road is dry and firm, and the matter drops. 
In ftiort the proverb holds true ; « What is every body's bufi- 
n nefs is no body's." 

The belt way would be, that the landlord mould make good 
roads to all the farms, and afTefs the tenants for the intereft of 
what money may be expended. This mode would be accept- 
able to them all, and of great advantage to the proprietor ; as 
when leafes expire, eafy accefs to the farm will be always one 
of its molt powerful recommendations. 

The houfes on the carfe farms are not good. There are 
two circumftances which muft always prevent them from be- 
ing fo. The firft is, the farms are fmall, fome twenty, and few 

more 



,0 4 Statyllcal Account 

more than forty acres. Can good hoiifes be everted in fuch 
cafes I The fecond is, the houfe is built by the tenant 
who is only allowed fome timber by the landlord. It is of 
confequence fitted up as fuperficially as poffible. If it ferves 
the pujjpofe of a dwelling during the currency of the 
leafe, nothing more is expefted. For thefe reafons, 
it feems probable, that farm houfes will be mean and un- 
comfortable, wherever they are built at the expence of ten- 
ants of a few acres. Upon the farm of Redhall, in this pa- 
rilh, confifting of 100 acres of carfe and as much of dryfield, 
the property of Mr Seton of Touch, there has been lately 
built an exceeding good houfe of two floors and with a flate, 
roof and handfome offices, at the expence of the proprietor. 
Such houfes, though for the prefent expenfive, laft for ages, 
without the neceflity of thofe repairs, which are incefiantly re- 
quired for thofe thatched cottages of half (tone and half clay, 
which begin to decay almoft as foon as they are reared. It 
is to be acknowledged, however, that poor as the carfe houfes 
Hill are, they are much better than they were twenty years 
ago. They confift at leaft of two apartments, each having 
a chimney and a tolerable window : Nor are the cattle now 
permitted as formerly, to enter at the fame door with the 
family. If the dunghill, which in many inftances is (till in 
front of the houfe, were removed to a proper diftance 
behind it, this would be another flep to cleanlinefs and 
health. 



Soil There are few fields, either dryfield or carfe, uniform- 
ly of the fame foil. In the dryfields the foil is chiefly light 
and fandy, not uufrequently with a red tilly bottom; but in 
fome places it is a rich loam, rtfembling the low or flat 
grounds on the banks of the Forth. In the carfe there is clay 
of all colours, but blue is the moft prevalent, which is alfo 
1 f the

the beft in quality. In a dry fpring feafon, after an open 
winter, the clod is fo hard, that there is great labour and fa- 
tigue before the harrows can make any imprefiion. A good 
deal of froft in winter, and occafional (howers in fpring, are 
favourable to the carfe j but, if there has been little froft, or, 
if there is great drought after it is ploughed, the clay becomes 
impenetrable as the rock, and it is not without much toil 
that the feed is covered. The nearer the banks of the Forth, 
the land becomes fo much the more pliable. The clay mixt 
with gravel and fand, form thofe rich flat fields on the fides 
of the river, which are in high repute both for corn and 
pafture. 

Farming. — The method of farming now generally obferved, 
proves its fuperiority by its effects, while new attempts are 
made from year to year, by thofe of fpirit and enterprize hi 
the way of farther improvement. The ufe of lime to the 
amount of 8 chalders per acre in the carfe, and 5 in the dry- 
fields, and the fyftem of having a regular rotation of crops in 
every field, are the chief circumftancea which have produced 
the very material difference betwixt the prefent and the for- 
mer quantity of grain in the parifh. It is no unufual thing 
now to find 10 bolls of wheat or barley upon an acre, which' 
once produced almoft nothing but thirties. The carfe is fown 
with wheat, beans, barley, and grafs feeds, and after hay has 
been cut for two years, the field is next in oats, but in fome 
places pafturing is preferred, as it contributes much to 
enrich the ground. 

The late Mr Graham of Micklewood, who had a thorough 
knowledge of farming, and who pointed out the way to the im- 
provement of the carfe, fcrupuloufly obferved the following 
rotation of crops, as what he judged the beft, and exprefsly 
appointed a particular farm to be fo cultivated in all time 

Vol. XVIII. O

106 Statiflical Account 

coming ; perfuaded that experience would prove the excel- 
lence of his plan. A farm, faid he, ought to confift of twelve 
inclofures, and be managed as follows. Summer fallow, 
wheat, beans, barley, hay, pafture three years, oats, beans, 
barley, oats, fummer fallow, &amp;c. This order is found to an. 
fwer fo well, that the farm of Woodyett which exactly ob- 
ferves it, has always a better crop than any other in the parifh. 
The three years pafture is the chief thing which diftin- 
guifhes his plan, and probably contributes moft to give it 
full erTea. 

The wheat and barley land for the following year, is be- 
gun to be ploughed about the end of harveft ; and, if the 
weather is at all favourable, the whole of this bufinefs is con- 
cluded before the winter fets in. Wheat is fown about the 
middle of September, thereafter, when the field has been 
ploughed five or fix times, The lee intended for oats, is 
ploughed during the winter months, if the weather permits. 
Beans are fown about the end of February, and beginning of 
March, although in a climate fo inconftant as ours, the feed 
time is uncertain. Beans fown and ploughed down on the 
9th of January produced one of the beft crops perhaps we 
ever faw, and fo wet was the ground a few years ago, that it 
was not till the 6th day of April that any feed was fown in 
this country. The ufual time for fowing oats is from the 
20th of March to the end of April. The barley is fown after 
this, and the laft in order, though not the leaft profitable, is 
the turnip, a fpecies of hufbandry introduced of late by fome 
of the heritors, in which the tenants do not feem difpofed to 
follow their example. 

Beans are not fown in the dryfields, as the foil is not fuf- 
ficiently ftrong to bear a crop of this nature. Peas are fome- 
times tried to advantage, but for the moft part they run to 
itraw, without grain. The rotation of crops in the dryfields 



of Gargunnock. 1 07 

is commonly this ; oats for two years in fucceflion, and barley 
the third year with grafs feeds, hay for two years, and paf- 
ture for three or four. Potatoes are alfo raifed in confidera- 
able quantities, and there is not a crop to which the foil is 
better fuited. The return is very encouraging. A boll and a 
half, and often two bolls are digged where one peck was 
planted. Some lay the fets in drills, which undoubtedly is 
the beft way, as by this means the rows are diftant from each 
other near 2 feet, the plough can be ufed among them, 
throughout the fummer, and while this anfwers every pur- 
pofe of fummer fallow, the earth is raifed about their roots, 
which makes them dry and mealy, and promotes vegetation. 
A held in potatoes is a fine preparation for wheat or barley. 
None of the red kind are here ufe'd, excepting the yam, 
which grows to a very large fize, and affords good food for 
cattle. 

The carfe farmers are careful to procure horfes of fuperior 
fize and flrength. For the mofl part the ploughing, fummer 
fallow excepted, is conducted with two horfes, without a 
driver. Four muft at times be employed in fummer fallow- 
ing. Lefs progrefs perhaps may be made with two horfes 
than with four, but the work is better done, as two pro- 
perly trained, and acquainted with the ploughman's voice, 
will proceed with more fteadinefs, and in a ftraighter direc- 
tion than four, drawing unequally, and injudiciouuy driven 
by an ignorant boy. 

In each farm there is a field in wheat, well drefTed and 
limed. It has been found that dung is more advantageous to 
the wheat than lime, and feveral farmers now give lime to the 
barley fields, and dung to the wheat. One of them this year 
gave the wheat field a part of both, and the return is 
luxuriant.

gkbe, which had been in pafture for three preceding feafons, 
was ploughed only once about the end of Oaober, and fown 
with wheat without lime or manure of any kind, and the crop 
produced L. 20 : 1 i : 6. On boll was fown and fifteen were 
reaped. * 

The hufbandman is at pains to find good feed for his lands. 
If the fame grain is incefiantly ufed it. foon degenerates. This 
defect is remedied fometimes by exchanging that of the carfe, 
for what grew in the dryfield. But the chief improvement 
this way is the introduction lately of the early red oats from 
the fouth, which produces more meal, and ripens almoft a 
month fooner than any other known in this country, This 
promifes to be a great acquifition to thofe whofe crops arc 
frequently in danger from a late and a wet harveft. 

The drill hufbandry is not pra&amp;ifed here. Attempts 
were made to introduce it at Boquhan, and premiums were 
offered by the proprietor to the tenants who fhould ufe it fuc- 
cefsfully. Some had not the fpirit to engage in it, and thofe 
who began had not patience to perfevere. 

Great improvement is made in the art of ploughing. Prizes 
are annually given by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood to 
thofe/ who excel, and the young men eagerly contend for this 
honour. The old Scottifh plough is moft generally in ufe, 
but Small's is beginning to be in great repute. The old 
plough is frequently made by the farmers themfelves, and at 
little expence, which is an almoft irrefiftible argument in its 
favour. 

The threfhing machine which abridges the labour, and en- 
ables the farmer to prepare his grain with great fpeed for the 
market, is now fet up, not only by fome of the heritors, but 
alfo by fuch of the tenants as have large farms. This is 
acknowledged to be one of the moft ufeful inftruments of 
hufbandry, that has ever been invented. It has no other in- 
convenience, 



of Gargunnock. i 109 

convenience, than that when a great quantity is threfhed out 
at once, the ftraw is lefs relifhed by the cattle, than when 
it is frefh from the flail. 

Kilns, with heads made of caft-iron, in which twelve bolls 
of oats can be dried in the courfe of 6 hours, have been built 
laft year, by the chief heritors. Care muft be taken not to 
over-heat them, and to turn the grain often, as in fome m- 
ftances where thefe precautions were neglefted, the whole 
has been loft. 

The farmer juftly complains of the heavy tax, which bears 
the name of multure. It is indeed a real opprefllon, when 
many of the farms are bound to pay the miller the eleventh 
peck of meal, and in fome cafes, a fimilar quantity of beans, 
and barley. The tenants of Leckie are now free from this 
bondage. The miln is in the hands of the proprietor, and 
arable land is affefied at the rate of one milling fterling per 
acre for defraying every necefTary expence, to which the 
tenants have chearfully fubmitted. 

It would be of great benefit to the country, if all that va- 
riety of fervice ufually demanded by heritors, befides the pro- 
per rent, were relinquished. Great inconvenience arifes from 
the obligation to which the tenants are fubje£led ; to pay 
fowls, to drive coals, peats and dung ; and in harveft, to 
cut down the proprietor's grain. By being thus in a ftate of 
requifition, the tenant is often incapable of attending to his 
own affairs. On fome very important occafions, the opportu- 
nity on his own farm is loft, and never returns. 

There is an eftablifhed market in Stirling, for all forts of 
grain, to which the neighbouring farmers refort ; and they 
find a ready fale. The price is ufually regulated by the 
Edinburgh and Haddington markets. 

The whole fecret of farming, feems to ly in preferving the

taking care not to impoverifh the foil, and to be feldom from 
home, efpecially in feed-time and harveft, ready to feize the 
favourable opportunity when it occurs. « The hand of the 
" diligent maketh rich". 

Population.~-.lt appears that there has been little variation in 
the population of the parifh, for many years. The cotton mills 
at Balfron and Down, and the great demand at Glafgow a few 
years ago, for weavers, mafons, and day-labourers, confidera- 
bly diminimed the number of fouls in this parifli. The hope of 
regular employment, and better wages, enticed feveral families 
to fettle in thofe places ; where the young and the old were con- 
ftantly occupied. By the late ftagnation of trade, however, 
many have been obliged to return to their former occupations. 

Additions made to fome farms, and the fpirit of improve- 
ment prevailing among the heritors, which has led them to 
keep a great part of their lands in their own polTeflion, have 
banifhed many inhabitants from the dryfields, where the 
ruins of cottages are frequently to be met with; but in the 
mean time, the village of Gargunnock, which in the memo- 
ry of fome ft ill alive, conGfted only of 3 or 4 houfes, now 
contains about 400 fouls.

Regifter of Deaths — No .correct account can be given of the 
number of deaths, in this partfh ; as not a few of the inhabit- 
ants have their burying ground in other parifhes, and it is only 
when the mort- cloth is required, which only happens when 
the funeral is in the par ifh burying ground, that the death is in- 
ferted in the regifter. The tax on baptifms and deaths was paid 
reluctantly. The one on marriages did not occafion fo much 
alarm, although it was thought fome kind of reward ought 
rather to have been offered by the legiflature, to thofe who 
entered regularly into that connexion. All have agreed, that 
there is wifdom in the repeal of thofe taxes. 

Poor. — The number of poor who receive a ftated monthly 
allowance from the Parochial funds, is fixteen, all of whom, 
one excepted, refide in the village. It is ufual alfo, in the 
Winter feafon, to give occafional fupplies of meal and coals, 

to 



of Gargunnock. 113 

to families who may be in difficult circumftances, but whofe 
names are not on the poor's roll. 

There is now no afleffment for their maintenance. This 
has been unneceflary for fome years pad, as fupplies abun- 
dantly fufficient have been obtained another way. 

George Moir, Efq. of Leckie, now deceafed, generoufly 
added 100 guineas to the poor's ftock in 1788. Being of 
the Scotch Epifcopal communion, he feldom attended the 
Eftablifhed church. He faw however, and he had the hu- 
manity to acknowledge, that the poor of the parim fuffered a 
lofs, by his abfence 5 and when he gave the fum above men- 
tioned, he faid, " he was only paying what he owed them." 
It is to be wifhed, that wealthy heritors who either do not 
teGde upon their eftates, or who are too much in the habit of 
being abfent from church, would imitate him, in this inftance, 
and confider the cafe of the poor, who muft fuftain a lofs, 
when thofe in affluent circumftances withhold their weekly 
collections at the church. The chief refource for fup- 
plying the poor in this parim, and in almoft every parim in 
Scotland, arifes from the collections made at the church on 
the Lord's day. 

At the fame time, there are perhaps few country parifhes 
in Scotland, where there is more ample provifion for the ne- 
ceffities of the poor, than in Gargunnock. The capital ftock; 
belonging to the Kirk Seflion, amounts to L 365 Sterling, 
the intereft of which, together with the collections, mort- 
cloth-money, the fees paid at marriages, baptifms, &amp;c. af- 
ford the widow, and the fatherlefs, the aged and infirm, a 
confiderable portion of the neceffaries of life *.

* An addition was made to the funds of the poor in 1784, by a very 
fmgular circumftance. Two old women, lifters, wko lived in the village of 
Gargunnock, had for many years, every appearance of extreme indigence ;

The care of the poor is laid on the Kirk Seffion. A com- 
mittee is appointed to enquire into the circumftances of thofe 
who petition for fupply ; and more or lefs is granted, accord- 
ing as the cafe feems to require. Few have lefs than half a 
crown per month ; while, four, five, fix, and in fome cafes, 
even ten fhillings are diftributed to thofe, who are abfolutely 
helplefs. A perfon rnuft refide in the parifh, at leaft three 
years, before he can be entitled to the public charity. 

No public begging is allowed. We are often harraffed by 
vagrants from other places but they are not permitted to ac- 
quire a refidence in the parifh. One feldom gives them any 
thing, without having caufe to repent it. They fpend every 
thing they receive at the firft ale-houfe ; and for the reft of 
the day they become a public nuifance. The conftables are 
called, who fee them out of the parifh ; Hut this does not 
r perate as a punifhment, while they are ftill at liberty. It 
would be of great advantage, if in every parifh, there was 
fome place of confinement for people of this defcription, to 
keep them in awe, when they might be inclined to diftuib 
the peace of the town, or of the neighbourhood.

though without making any application for affiftance from the parifh. One 
of them at lad, applied to be received on the poor's lift; and as no doubt 
was entertained of her poverty, (lie received four fhillings per month. She 
tlied about fix months after the commencement of her penfion. On examin- 
ing her bed-cloaths, one purfe (of gold and Giver), was found after another, 
till the fum amounted to upwards of forty pounds fterling. Some old chcfrs 
and barrels were found flored with beef, meal, cheefe, and various other 
kinds of provifion ; and it was evident that the poor ivomen had lived in great 
affluence. The relations of the deceafed, on hearing of the difcovery, can-.r 
from a difrance, to lay claim to her effeas. But according to the fettled 
rule of the parifh, fhe had bequeathed all her effects to the poor, at the 
time flic was received on the poor's lift. One half was allowed to be the 
property of the fiftcr, who had received no penfion from the parifii. The

Church, &amp;c— The church was rebuilt in 1774, is very 
neatly fitted up, and in excellent repair. On the top of the 
eaft gable, there is the figure of a croft, and on the weft, 
that of a crefcent. Thefe were upon the gables of the old 
church, and have been replaced upon the new. This might 
have given offence a century ago ; but the people are now 
wifer than to quarrel with a (tone of any fhape or appear- 
ance. 

The manfe, which was built for a bachelor, is too fmall 
for the accomodation of a family. Few houfes of the kind, 
however, are more pleafantly fituated. There is a good gar- 
den. The foil and expofure are fo favourable, that crops 
and fruits, of various kinds, are reaped from it earlier than 
from any other in the parifh. The ftipend is about L. 80 
fterling, with a glebe of 6 acres. Col. Eidingtoun, the pro- 
prietor of the eftate of Gargunnock, is the patron. 

PanJ]j School. — The fchool-houfe is fituated on a rifing 
ground, at the weft end of the village. It has two floors, 
the firft for the fchool, the fecond for the habitation of the 
fchool-mafter. During the winter feafon, there may be 50 
or 60 fcholars ; and yet the whole income, including falary, 
perquifites as Seffion-clerk, and fchool fees, fcarcely amounts 
annually to L. 16. The reading of Englifh is taught for a 
merk Scots per quarter, writing and arithmetic for 2 (hillings ; 
fees, which are by no means adequate to the troublefome 
talk of the mailer. When a man decently qualified fubmits 
to the drudgery of training up children in feveral important 
branches of education, common fenfe muft revolt at the idea

of his being in a worfe fituation than the day-labourer. It i 9 
hoped fomething will be done for a better provifion to the 
matters of parifh-fchools. 

Village — The village, confiding of about 90 houfes, chiefly 
Of one floor, and thatched, is fituated on the fide of a hill, 
part of the barony of Gargunnock. The military road from 
Stirling to Dumbarton, paffes through it. The beft inn upon 
the road is here, few houfes of that kind are kept in fuch 
good order. It is kept remarkably clean and neat, a circum- 
ftance not very common in houfes of the fame defcription. 

Each inhabitant has a fmall garden. The one half of 
the property belonging to the village was fued out about fifty 
years ago, at the rate of 2o {hillings fteiling per acre, the 0- 
ther half at a later period was fued at 40s. There is no kind 
of trade or manufacture in the village ; • not even a grocery 
ihop that deferves the name. Supplies of all the neceflary 
articles are got from Stirling weekly, or by carriers from 
Edinburgh or GJafgow. There are fome weavers, taylors, 
and fhoemakers, and the other inhabitants are chiefly day 
labourers. 

Much inconvenience arofe from the want of a furgeon, but 
this is now removed. Dr. Moir of Leckie the firft heritor, 
and a gentleman of great eminence in his profeflion, is ever 
ready to give his advice and afiiftance to the villagers without 
a fee. There is no writer or attorney among them. When 
any difpute arifes, which is very feldom, it is either fettled by 
the Minifter, or by Mr Graham of Micklewood, a juflice of 
the peace, in whofe judgement parties acquiefce. 

Antiquities. — A little fouthward of the village, there is a 
conical height called the Kier-hill, which is evidently artifi- 
cial, and feems to have been a military work. There are re- 
mains 



of Gargunnock, 1 1 7 

mains of a ditch or rampart of a circular form, which proves 
that it is not of Roman origin. It is probably of later date, 
and appears to have been the place from which Sir William 
Wallace fallied forth on the night when he took by furprize 
the Peel of Gargunnock. 

In one of the dryfields of Boquhan, fome pieces of brafs 
armour and points of fpears were found a few years ago by 
a tenant, when digging for limeftone. A great quantity of hu- 
man bones were alfo difcovered in the fame fpot, the remains 
probably of the (lain at. the battle of Ballochleam, which was 
fought in the adjoining fields. 

There is no object of natural curiofity in this parilh equal 
to the glen of Boquhan. The road made on the eaft fide 
by the prefent proprietor, leads to a molt romantic view. 
But, if a perfon has leifure and perfeverance to defcend and 
walk along the bottom of the glen, at the field of Old-hall, 
he will be furprized at every ftep, with a fcene perfectly wild, 
as though nature were in ruins. 

Local D'tfadvantages — This parifh is fituated on the north 
fide of the hill. In the higher parts of the dryfields, the fun 
is not feen during the winter months. Coal mult be brought 
from Bannockburn, 10 miles diftant ; for although marks of 
eoal can be obferved in feveral places within the parifh, no at- 
tempts have been made to difcover it. The tenants on the 
banks of the Forth have boats, but thefe in their prefent flate 
are found inconvenient and dangerous for horfes and loaded 
carts. A bridge is much wanted near the lands of Mickle- 
wood. The one at the ford of the Frew, does not fuffi- 
ciently accommodate the inhabitants of a trad of fertile 
country, for many miles on both fides of the river. 



Roads. 



1 1 8 Stutiflical Account 

i^r—The military road from Stirling to Dumbarton, 
made betwixt 30 and 40 years ago, and which paffes through 
the centre of this parifh, is now by Ad of Parliament to have 
a new line of direction, and to be made a turnpike road. It 
13 hoped the truftees will confine the exercife of their power 
to what is immediately ufeful and neceffary. Any alterations 
in order to avoid heights, or to lefTen the diftance, where that 
can be conveniently done, would be readily fubmitted to by 
all, from the evident advantage rcfulting from them. But, 
if new lines of confutable length are propofed, where the 
grounds muft be purchafed and re-inclofed ; or, if the road 
(hall be fo formed as to render plantations and improvements 
ufelefs, which have been carrying on for years in the faith 
that the prefent line of road was to be permanent ; if it fhall 
be fo directed, as to abandon a number of thriving villages, or 
fo unnecefTarily widened as to break in upon many beautiful 
itrips of planting, by which means a debt muft be incurred 
that can only be repaid by a heavy toll on the grain, the coal 
and the lime, it is doubtful, whether the good or the evil of 
fuch alterations would preponderate. The truftees have no 
interdt but to act for the general advantage of the country, 
and there is no reafon to doubt that this will be the object of 
their chief attention. 

Game, ® c. — In this parifh there are the heath-fowl, hares, 
and partridges. 

The commencement of partridge (hooting, as early as the 
beginning of September, is very often a caufe of their fcarcity, 
as the tenants are tempted to deftroy the eggs for the fake of 
the crops, which are fometimes much injured by the fportf- 
mt?n and dogs. r 

The cleft of Ballochleam is ftill remarkable for the hawks,

for which it was in great requeft in former times, when fal- 
conry was in fafhion. 

A crow perfedly white, was found laft fpring on a tree at 

Boquhan. 

The farmer fuffers a real lofs by flocks of pigeons which 
cover his fields in feed time, and make frequent vifits to his 
wheat before it is cut down; and thinks a tax on pigeon houfes 
would be a wife meafure. 

Difeafes.— Rheumatifm, fevers, confumptions, are the chief 
diforders of the more aged inhabitants, and the fmall-pox, the 
meafles, and hooping cough, of the young. Not a few arc 
afflicted with the fcrophula, but the people have little con- 
ception of its effects on their pofterity. There is dill an un- 
lucky prejudice againft innoculating for the fm all pox, while 
the people have a flrong inclination to frequent the houfe 
where the difeafe exifts, not perceiving, that by doing fo they 
communicate the infection to their children as effectually, and 
a thoufand times more fatally than by the lancet. Dr. Moir 
innoculates gratis, and ha$ had confiderable influence in re- 
conciling the common people to a practice, which God in his 
providence hath remarkably bleffed for the prefervation of the 
human race. 

It is difficult to determine whether the carfe or the dryfield, 
be moft favourable to health. Some have lived to a great 
age in both ; but it is certain, that as the tenants of the carfq 
have the greatefl fliare of labour, fo they feem mofl capable 
of enduring it ; and if a greater degree of labour fnpported 
with vigour indicates health, or promotes it, it may be con- 
jectured, that the carfe is fully as healthful as the dryfield. 
It would perhaps be of advantage, if thofe who are molt ex- 
pofed to fatigue, to cold, or to moiflure, would ufe a cotton, 
inflead of a linen fhirt. It might contribute to prevent 

thofe 



120 Statiflical Account 

thofe rheumatic complaints, to which they are fo often 
fubjedt. 

Price of labour, wages, bfc. — A few years ago, a man fer- 
Vant for the farm, who lived with the farmer, could have been 
found for 5 or 6 pounds fterling per year, but now L. to or 12 
are given. Women fervants who lately were engaged at 
L. 2 10s. are now fcarcely fatisfied with L. 4. Their purfe 
is juft as empty as before, but there is a material change in 
the article of drefs. The day labourer who once wrought at 
fix-pence or eight-pence per day, now receives a {hilling, and in 
feed time andharveft, his vi&amp;uals befides. Laft harveft, 1794, 
the wages rofe to fixteen and eighteen-pence per day, befides 
vi&amp;uals, which is by far the higheft rate of wages remembered 
in this country. 

The day-wage-men for the whole parifh refide in the vil- 
lage. They are called forth to their labour in the morning, 
by the found of pipe or drum, and have the fame fignal when 
they retire in the evening. They are a fober induftrious con- 
tented fet of men, and though their food be fimple, and their 
drefs and dwellings mean, it is believed that they have more 
■real enjoyment, than thofe who are in the more elevated 
Ctuations. 

Food and drefs.-— The aged inhabitants are furprized at the 
change in the article of living, and what is evidently a proof 
of the wealth of the country, is unreafonbly the fubje£l of 
their lamentation. It is feldom that any of them live beyond 
their income. The other extreme ought alfo to be avoided. 
More is expe&amp;ed than the pooreft fare, and the meaneft drefs 
from men of opulence. When the farmer is only careful 
how he may lend his money, and add to his (lock, and lives 
at home as penurioufly as when he had nothing, he denies 

himfclf

hlmfelf the proper ufe of the bounty of Providence, and is 
really poor in the midft of his profperiry. There are few fuch 
jn this parifh. They all aiTemble at church, clean, and in de- 
cent attire many of the women in black cloaks and bonnets, 
and the younger fort adorned with ribbons. It gives general 
difguft, however, when the drefs is unfuitable to the ftation. 
There is fometimes a contention for pre-eminence in 
gaudy fhew, which is feverely cenfured, efpecially when 
the maid fervant cannot be diftingutfhed from the miftrefs. 

All the men, with a very few exceptions, wear hats, and 
what may be thought remarkable, there is only one wig in 
the whole parifh. Tea is univerfally ufed. Even the pooreft 
families have it occafionally, and the laft cup is qualified with 
a little whifky, which is fuppofed to correct all the bad effe&amp;s 
of the tea. There are few families without fome butcher 
meat laid up for the winter. All agree, that they are better 
clothed and fed than their forefathers j and feem contented 
with the lot affigned them. 

Price of Provifwns.—Ozt meal is from 15s. to 17s. Sterling 
per boll 5 peas and barley meal about 10s. do ; potatoes, corn 
meafure, 5s. do ; butter 12s per ftone ; common cheefe 4s, 
and a better kind made on Saturday's evening 5s. 6d. per 
ftone ; poultry at a reafonable price. A good fowl may be 
got for is fterling ; eggs at 4d. per dozen. The price of ne- 
cefTaries in this parifh varies according to the demand at 
Stirling on the market days. 

Great fcarcity was apprehended in 1783, through the 
failure of the preceding crop ; but upon the return of peace, 
a large quantity of white peas being commiffioned from 
England by a man of public fpirit, and grinded into meal, 
aflifted the other expedients which were then adopted to 
prevent a famine in this part of the kingdom.

Charafter, Manners, and C^orns.—Tht charter of the 
inhabitants of the pat ifh is fobriety. They profefs to fear God, 
and honour the king. In their deportment they are grave, and 
in their fpeech connderate. They are remarkably attached to 
the initiations of religion, and all of them, (22 perfons ex- 
cepted), worfliip together at the parilh church. During the 
late attempts of defigning men to throw the country into 
confufion, not an individual in this parifh joined the clubs 
of pretended reformers, or /hewed the lead difaffeaion to 
our happy conftitution. The only reform they wifh, is in 
their own perfons and families, where they acknowledge there 
are many things which need to be corrected ; but they leave 
affairs of Hate to thofe who are lawfully appointed to govern. 
There has been no one here charged with any capital crime, 
for a long courfe of years. The minifter's garden is fituated 
near the high road, and might be eafily plundered, and yet 
he cannot fay that he has been robbed of a fingle apple, fince 
he came to the parifh, upwards of 7 years ago. There is 
very feldom occafion for church difcipline ; no caufe has 
been carried from the feffion to the prefbytery for many 
years. 

The facrament of the Lord's Supper is difpenfed twice in 
every year; And as there is no Hated allowance to defray 
the expence of the communion in winter, the parifhioners 
chcarfully contribute for this purpofe. 

'Young and old are diftinguifhed for polite attention to 
ftrangers. Men of fuperior rank have a refpectful bow 
from every one they meet ; for people here have not 
been taught fhe new doctrine of liberty and equality. 

It is feldom there are focial meetings. Marriages, bap- 
tifms, funerals, and the conclufion of the harveft, are al- 
mo(t the only occafions of feafting. At thefe times, there 
is much uuneceffary expence. Marriages ufually happen 



of Gargunnock. 123 

in April and November. The month of May is cauti- 
cuily avoided. A principal tenant's fon or daughter has a 
croud of attendants at marriage, and the entertainment lafts 
for two days at the expence of the parties. The company at 
large pay for the mufic. 

The manner of conducing funerals in the country needs 
much amendment. From the death to the interment, the 
houfe is thronged by night and day, and the converfation is 
often very unsuitable to the occafion. The whole parifli is 
invited at 10 o'clock in the forenoon of the day of the fune- 
ral, but it is foon enough to attend at 3 o'clock afternoon. 
Every one is entertained with a variety of meats and drinks. 
Not a few return to the dirge, and fometimes forget what 
they have been doing, and where they are. Attempts have 
been lately made to provide a remedy for this evil ; but old, 
cuftoms are not eafily abolifhed. 

The dregs of fuperftition are ftill to be found. The lefs 
informed fufpecl fomething like witchcraft about poor old 
women; and are afraid of their evil eye among the cattle. 
If a cow is fuddenly taken ill, it is afcribed to fome extraor- 
dinary caufe. If a perfon, when called to fee one, doe-s not

fome bad defign. It is but juft to fay, that the generality of 
the people are fuperior to thefe vulgar prejudices, though the 
traces of them are ftill to be found. 

There is one prevailing cuftom among our country people ; 
which is fometimes productive of much evil. Every thing is 
bought and fold over a bottle. The people who go to the 
fair, in the full pofleflion of their faculties, do not always 
tranfact their bufmefs, or return to their homes, in the fcme

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q448127">A L V 4</name> 

(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 
By the Rev. Mr John Duncan.</head>

<p>

Name. 

IN the writings of the laft century, and before that time, 
the name of this parifli was generally written Alvath, or 
Alveth i but that mode of fpelling has been difufed almoft a 
complete century. Whether the prefent name, Alva, be 
Gaelic origin, is not altogether certain. Fanciful etymologies 
can never yield fatisfaction to the judicious antiquary ; and 
therefore when nothing rational can be offered, it feems bet- 
ter to acknowledge ignorance, than to offer what can neither 
amufe nor inform. 

Situation. — This parifh and barony is a part of the county 
of Stirling, although it happens to be totally disjoined from 
every part of it. No certain account can now be given, how 
this has happened. It is furrounded by the {hire of Clack- 
mannan on the eaft, fouth, and weft, and on the north, it is 
bounded by a part of the county of Perth. It extends in 
length, from eaft to weft, fomewhat more than two miles 

and

nver Devon, which has its fource in the barony of Alva after 

a long courfe, at firft almofl due ea(l ; and then fouthward 

through Glen-devon, makes a fudden turn we award near 

the church of FoiToway, and paffing through the parifhes of 

Muckhart, Dollar, and Tillicoultry, gently glides along the 

fouth boundary of this parifh, and divides it from the parifhes 

of Alloa and Clackmannan, which are fituated on the fouth*. 

The parifh of Logie is next adjacent on the weft. 

Extent, feV— The lands of Alva extend over a very con- 
futable portion of that long range of hills, diHinguiQied by 
the name of Ochills ; the remaining grounds are extended 
over part of that valley, which lies between the foot of thefe 
hills, and the river Devon. The mean breadth, from the 
banks of the river to the bottom of the hill, may be about 
three fifth parts of a mile. 

That portion of the Ochills now under review, when feen 
from the fouth at the diftance of a mile or two, appear to be 
one continued range, with little variation in height ; but as 
the mountain Hopes towards the fouth, it is interfered by 
exceedingly deep and narrow glens, through each of which, 
ftreams of water run, that difcharge themfelves into the De- 



von. 



* It is impolTible to view this little river of clear water, without admiring 
its beauty, in its wonderful paflage through the rock, at the Rumbling Bridge, 
and Caldron Lin ; and its numberlefs meandrings, after it defccnds into the 
valley, eaft of Dollar; whence it glides generally in a deep bed with little 
fall, till it reaches the Frith of Forth, at the Cambas miln, directly oppofitc 
to where its fource began. When fwellcd by heavy rains, or the melting 
fnow, it overflows its banks, and covers the gicatcit pait of the lovy 
grounds.

von. By means of thefe, the fore ground of this part of the 
Ochills, is divided into three feparate hills, diftinguifhed by 
the names of Wood-hill, Middle-hill, and Weft-hill of Alva. 
On the brow of this laft hill, is a very high perpendicular 
rock, which, for what reafon is rot known, has obtained the 
name of Craig Leith. It has been long beyond memory, re- 
markable for the refidence of that fpecies of hawks, the falcon, 
which is ufed for the diverfion of hunting. One pair, and only 
one pair; it is affirmed by the inhabitants of the place, build a 
fteft on the front of this tremendous rock. Thefe are faid to 
hatch their young annually ; and, when their progeny are of 
a proper age, the parents force them to feek a new habitation, 
till at laft, however long they may be fuppofed to live, the 
parents themfelves muft yield their refidence to their furvi- 
vors. In former times, when that fport was in fafhion, a 
hawk of this breed was thought a valuable acquifition. They 
are (till in great requeft among our own nobility, who love 
that fport ; and very lately, an Englifh gentleman noted for 
his Ikill in that diverfion, fent his fervant all the way from 
Yorklhire, to procure fome of this breed. In order to come 
at the neft, he was let down by a rope faftened round his 
waift, while the end of it was held faft by ten or twelve peo- 
ple, who flood at a convenient diltance from the edge of the 
precipice ; and he was obferved fcrambling on the face of the 
rock, exploring the neft of the bird. 

The houfe of Alva ftands on an eminence, projecting 
from the bafe of the Wood-hill, and near the eaft end 
of the parifli. The height of this projected part of the 
hill, is about 220 feet above the water of Devon, which runs 
in the valley below. The hill rifes immediately behind the 
houfe, to the height of 1400 feet, making the whole height 

1620 



128 Statiflical Account 

1620 feet * From the fummit of this hill, there is a very 
extenfive profped to the north eaft, the fouth, and fouth 
weft. The view to the north weft, is a little interrupted by 
the hill of Dalmiot, a partof the Ochills, lying in the parifh of 
Logie. From the top of the Wood-hill, however, the mouth 
of the Frith of Forth, the Bafs, North Berwick Law, with 
the windings of the Forth, can eafily be defcried, together 
with the coafts of Fife and eaft Lothian, &amp;c. 

The village of Alva is fituated at a fmall diftance from 
the bottom of the Weft hill. A fmall rivulet, which iflues 
from the glen which feparates the Weft from the Middle 
hill, runs along the eaft fide of the village ; and not only 
affords a conftant and plentiful fupply of water, but adds 
very much to the beauty of the village. This receives a far- 
ther addition, from a thriving plantation of foreft trees grow- 
ing on a fteep bank on the eaft fide of the rivulet, and afford- 
ing a comfortable fhelter from the north eaft winds, which, of 
all others, are the rnoft violent in this diftrift. It is not cer- 
tainly known, when this village b'egan to be built. There is 
undoubted evidence, however, of Alva being a pjrilh above 500 
years ago f ; and it is probable that a village, very inconfidera- 
ble perhaps, may then have exifted. Even at prefent the village 
is not extenfive, and does not contain much above 130 fami- 
lies, including a few fingle perfons each of whom occupy a 
part of a houfe. About the end of thelaft, and beginning of 

this 

* The hill continues to rife gradually for about two miles farther north, un- 
til! it reaches the top of Ben-Cloch, which is the highefl point of the Alva 
hills, and the fummit of all the Ochills ; and according to the obfervation 
1 ken by Mr Udney, land furveyor, is about 3440 feet above the level of the 
Devon. The view from the top of Ben-Cloch is the mod extenfive and beau- 
tiful any where to be found, and is vifited by all travellers of curiofity who de- 
light in fine profpecls.

this century, the late Sir John Erflsme, grandfather of the pre- 
fent Sir James Sinclair Erfkine, then proprietor, granted feus 
of a fmall parcel of ground to feveral inhabitants, on which 
they built a cottage and totted a garden ; and a plan appears 
to have been defigned by that gentleman, of building a village 
in the form of a fquare, two fides of which have been adual- 
ly built. The other houfes appear to h kve been fet down, 
without any regular order, and where a convenient fpot for a 
garden could be obtained. About the year 1767, the prefcnt 
Lord Alva, refolving to enlarge the village, granted feus to 
fuch as were willing to build ; in confequence of which, one 
complete row, confiding of about 20 houfes, was erecled in 
one feafon, each houfe having a fmall garden of a few falls, 
equal in breadth to the extent of the front of the houfe. A 
few years after, another row of houfes parallel to the former, 
and with gardens laid out in the fame manner, was completed. 
The rate at which the ground was at that time ftued, was at 
firft 13s. and 4d. per fall, or 36 fquare yards \ it advanced by 
degrees to 15s. and 16s. per fall, as the premium or purehafe 
money, together with four-pence the fall of annual feu duty. 
Taking the medium rate of 15s. it will be found to amount 
to L. 120 ftcrling per acre as the price of the ground, and 
L. 2 : 13 '.4 as the annual rent to the fuperior. What pro- 
prietor would hefitate to grant feus Upon fuch terms as thefe ; 
efpecially, when it is confidered, that the annual duty may 
be converted into fome ftaple commodity. 

The arable foil of this parifh may be properly divided into 
four different kinds. The firft, which extends fouthward 
from the bottom of the hills, confifts of a rich hazel mold in- 
termixed with gravel and fmall ftones ; this is fucceeded by a 
different kind of foil, being a ftratum of mofs over a bed of 
clay, and extending from 50 to ico yards in breadth. In 
fome places, this mofs is found to be 7 feet in depth. Next

to that, is a ftrong rich clay, extending a confiderable way to-' 
wards the river Devon j then follows what is called haughing 
ground, fuch as is ufually found upon the banks of rivers ; 
the banks of Devon being generally overflowed twice or 
thrice every year, great quantities of fand are left on the 
ground as far as the inundation extends. The foil at the bed 
of the river appears to be in many places above 20 feet deep. 
The grounds of this parifh produce the ufual crops of wheat, 
barley, peas, beans, oats, clover, and potatoes. 

The whole arable grounds within the parifh, have been 
inclofed, feveral years ago, with ditches and hedges. Thofe 
fields, which lie immediately below the houfe of Alva, at 
the bottom of the Wood-hill, and extending near to the banks 
of Devon, were inclofed, and planted with rows of oaks, 
afhes, and other foreft trees, by the late Sir John Erfkine, 
about 70 years ago, and were probably among the firft in- 
clofures in this part of the country. Thefe have been chiefly 
in grafs for a great many years, and are let annually to gra- 
ziers, at the rate of from 25 to 30 millings per acre. The 
general ft ate of agriculture, in this, as well as in all the 
neighbouring parifhes, was very rude and wretched, till 
within the laft thirty years. And although the foil muft be 
allowed to be equal at leaft, in quality, to that in the moft 
fertile parts of Scotland ; yet truth requires us to acknowledge, 
that thofe who were employed in cultivating it, were late in 
arriving at any confiderable improvements. Wheat, juftly 
efteemed the moft beneficial of all crops, was not cul- 
tivated in this parifh, till within the laft fifteen years. 
Clean fummer fallow, and proper drefling with lime and dung, 
were rarely, if ever attempted. Good example has at laft 
opened mens eyes; and experience has demonftrated that the 
foil, when properly cultivated, is capable of the bight; ft im- 
provement, and is fit for producing wheat, and all the ftrong- 
1 eft

eft grain. The tenants begin now to perceive the importance 
of fallowing, liming, and cleaning their lands, to obtain good 
returns, and the advantage of having broad clover for fummer 
food for their horfes, and being able to work them conftantly, 
inftead of fending them (as they did formerly), to graze for five- 
months idle on the hills, at a confiderable expence. Any per- 
fon who has been acquainted with the ftate of farming in this 
parifh and its immediate neighbourhood thirty years ago, muft 
have been led to afcribe the flow progrefs of improvement, in 
a confiderable degree, to the very fmall number of acres, of 
which the far greater part of the farms confifted. The (lock of 
the farmer, may be confidered, as in general, proportioned to 
the extent of his farm, which at that time did not commonly ex- 
ceed thirty or forty acres. It was well, if, according to the mode 
of culture practifed at that time, he could pay his rent, and 
provide a mean fubfiftence for himfelf and his family. Ano- 
ther circumftance, which affected in a very particular man- 
ner the ftate of farming in this parifh, and its neighbour- 
hood, was the practice of driving coals from the coal pits on 
the fouth banks of Devon, to the fhore of Alloa. To this 
labour, the farmers on the eftates where the coals were raifed, 
were bound by their leafes ; and without entering more par- 
ticularly into the fubjeft, it mud be obvious, how pernicious 
the effect of this practice muft have been, with refpe£t to the 
proper and neceffary operations upon the farm. Such, how- 
ever, is the contagion of example, that fome of the farmers 
in this parifh, who were under no obligation to be carriers on 
the eftate of another proprietor, and excepting during one 
very fhort period, when coal was worked within the parifh, 
had 'no occafion to be concerned in it, from ignorance and 
unlkilfulnefs refpe£ting their proper employment, and from 
the defire of a little gain, earned at the expence of fevere 
labour to themfclves and horfes, with the tear and wear o£

cart?, rude and fimple as they were at that time, were foolifh 
enough to join the Farmers in their neighbourhood, and em. 
ploy themfclves during a confiderable part of the fummer, in 
carrying the great coal to the port of Alloa. They were at 
Jaft however, wifely prohibited by Lord Alva, the late pro. 
pnetor of this barony, from following this ahfurd and un. 
profitable occupation , indeed when they began to acquire a 
tafte for improving their farms, and to reap the benefit of 
the.r improvements, they were foon convinced of the inu- 
t.hty of their ancient pradice ; and very probably would have 
abandoned it of their own accord. The extent of the farms 
has been, within the Lft twenty years, confiderably enlarged; 
the confluence of which has been, that befides imitating the 
example of the gradual improvements in agriculture, the far- 
mer has been enabled to make a more refpe&amp;able appearance 
than formerly. It is evident from the writings of thofe, who 
have treated of the fubjecl of agriculture, that it has been 
confidered as a difficult problem, to ftate the juft and reason- 
able extent of a farm, or to fix the number of acres, that one 
farm fhould contain ; and from the different opinions which 
have been given, it may be inferred, that perhaps no general 
rule can be laid down. A general obfervation however, may" 
be offered ; that the farrmfhould at leaft be fo extenfive, that 
the profits of the ftock employed in cultivating it, fhould 
enable the farmer to live decently and comfortably, and in a 
manner above the other country tradefmen who furround 
him. In a fmall farm of 40, or even 50 acres, allowing it to 
be as productive as can be fuppofed, and the rent moderate ; 
ftill the profits arifing to the farmer, cannot pofiibly be fo 
great, as to raife his ftate much above that of the lower clafs 
of manufacturers, who inhabit country parifhes. According 
to the divifion of farms that has hitherto taken place in this 
parifh, which has been from 30 to 60, or not more than 70 



acres 



of Ahcu 



acres, they can hardly be deemed fo large, as to place the 
farmer in a pefpt&amp;able fituation. 

From the description already given of the fixation of the 
lands of this parifh, they :ire n iturully divided into arable and 
paflure ground. The threi hills are incomparably the molt 
beautiful in every refpc£ of the whole range of the Ochills, 
from Glen devon o; i the e.Jl, to their termination, near the 
bridge of Alloa on the weft. They are cloathed with the 
richeft verdure, at all ftafons, and produce grafs of the fineft, 
quality, and in the greateft variety. They are not fo fteep, 
fo rugged or inacceflible, as thofe immediately weftward in 
the parifh of Logie ; and they prefent a more regular, nobler, 
and bolder afpe£t, than any of thofe that lie immediately on 
the eaft. They have been now for many years, divided into 
two feparate farms, for fheep ; one comprehending the Weft- 
hill, the other the Middle-hill, together with that part of 
the Wood-hill, which lies behind the fence, or wall, that fur- 
rounds the brow of that part of the hill, immediately above 
the houfe of Alva. 'Tis fuppoftd that the former of thefe 
is capable of maintaining about ioo fcore of fheep, and the 
latter from 90 to 95 fcore. The rent of the Weft- hill, has been 
greatly increafed, fmce the year 1 7 59 *. On the higheft and 
back-lying ground, where the parifh of Alva marches with 
an eftate belonging to Mr Murray of Abercairney, in the 

parifli 

* The rent of the Weft-hill in the year 1759, was very inconfidcrable. 
There was then little demand for butcher-meat in this country; and the pro- 
fits of grazing were very low. When the next lcafe was granted in 1775, 
when the demand for Iheep and wool began to increafe, the tenant was 
taken bound to pay more than twice the former rent. From the rapid pro- 
grefs of manufactures and of luxury, and from the high character of the 
wool and of the (heep fed on the Atva hiils, it is believed that thofe fine 
fiieep-firms are ftill capable of a confutable advance of rent.

parifh of Blackford, the foil is mofly, and produces heath in 
great abundance, together with a ftrong and coarfe grafs. 
This however is reforted to by the ftronger and older part of 
the flocks ; and thefe, 'tis faid by the fhepherds, are feldom 
obferved to quit their wild retreat, or to come forward in 
queft of the tender and more kindly grafs, excepting perhaps 
when compelled by the rigour of the ftorm, to feek fhelter on 
the fore ground, or lower part of the hills. At the fame 
time, it muft be remarked, that fnow never lies for any 
length of time, on the face of thofe hills *. It is remarkable 
however, that at the bottom of a ridge of rock, near to the 
fummit of the high hill called Ben-cloch, where it is (heltered 
from every wind, fnow is frequently feen lying till the month 
of June. What is obferved to refill fo long the fummer's 
heat, from the Angularity of its extended but narrow form 
to the fpe&amp;ator's eye who views it at a diftance, has re- 
ceived the appellation of Lady Alva's web. 

It has never been the practice of the fheep-farmers here, 
to breed young fheep on thefe hills. Although they have 
generally a few fcores of ewes on their farms ; yet their lambs 
are commonly fold to the butcher. Of late years indeed, 
fome attempts have been made to rear a few young fheep, 
but thefe bear no proportion to the number of their ftock. 
The farmers go every year about mid-fummer, to the markets 

at 

* Snow feldom lies here more than two or three days ; and even during 
that time, the fheep bronze on the young furze, and are in as good condition, 
as if they had been fed on hay. The flocks have fo much flielter from the 
fituation of the hills, and from the plantations, that they have never mate- 
rially fuffcred from the heavieft falls of fnow. In January 1794. *° fata l f °

at Linton, and purchafe fheep of a year old. Thefe, according 
to the cuftom of the fheep-farmers in the fouth, have been 
fmeared with tar, but that pradice is not found neceffary in 
this diftria. After they have been (horn three times white, 
as they exprefs it, they are fold about Auguft and September, 
as fit for the butcher's ufe. 

The next thing that is worthy of notice in this parifh, is the 
ftate of the woollen manufactures. Thefe have been carried 
on in the village of Alva, for more than a century at leaft. 
They confift chiefly of Scots blankets and ferges. The former 
are made from yd. to is. the Scots yard, and the latter from 
iod. to I5d. and a few from i6d. to i8d. per yard. It is 
more than probable, that this fpecies of manufacture had 
flourifhed a great many years ago, in the neighbouring village 
of Tillicoultry; as an evidence of this, it is at this day, 
known among the fhopkeepers of the Lawnmarket of Edin- 
burgh, by the name of Tillicoultry ferges. The number of 
looms conftantly employed at prefent in this village is 67. 
The length of each web may be reckoned at 80 yards, and 
taking the average value at iod. or nd. per yard, the grofs 
produce will amount to from L. 7000 to L. 8000 iter, annu- 
ally. The manufacturers make ufe chiefly of Englifh wool in 
their ferges and blankets, and this partly fhort, and partly 
combed wool. That which is produced from the fheep that 
paflure on the Ochills, is commonly manufactured by the 
people of the country for their own private ufe. A very con- 
fiderable fum is annually expended by the weavers in this 
place, in purchafing wool, which it is impoflible to afcertam 
with any degree of precifion. Thefe ferges are fold not only 
in Edinburgh, but likewife in Stirling, Glafgow, Greenock, 
Perth, and Dundee. The fineft kinds of ferges are fome- 
timcs dreffed and dyed by the traders in Stirling, and fold as

have of late years been purchafed by fadlers as a neceiTary 
article in their bufinefs. This trade is at prefent in a very 
flounfliing condition, and from this circumftance the manu, 
fadurers here are able to pay 50s. rem for an acre of land, 
and many of them 40s. for a cow'- graft. It were to be 
wifhed, perhaps, that a fpecies of manicure more valuable 
and more extenfivdy ufeful were introduced, fuchas an imi- 
tation of the flannels manuf .dured in England. But it has 
always been found exceedingly difficult to give a new direc- 
tion to habits long eftablifhed and confirmed ; and until fome

futable ftock fhall arife, an alteration of the prefent mode 
of carrying on the manufa&amp;ures here, cannot reafonably be

The numbers of this parifh have not increafed in any consi- 
derable degree mice the year 1760, as appears from lifts re- 
gularly made up every four or five years from that period. 

Church, Stipend, &amp;rV.— The parifh of Alva was, long before 
the Reformation, in the diocefe of Dunkeld, and under the ec- 
clefiafticaljurifdiaionof thebifhop of that fee. From an extraa 
taken from the Chartularyof Cambulkenrteth, in the neighbour- 
hood of Stirling, it appears that the church of Alva was a menfal 
church, as it is called, belonging to that abbacy, and that the 
monksperformed du ty there, from the Want of a fufficient fund for 
the maintenance of a regular clergyman to refide in the panto. 
In the 1260, Richard, Bifhop of Dunkeld, made a donation 
to the monks of the church of St. Mary at Cambufkenneth, 
of the church of Alva « w ith all its legal pertinents," and dif- 
penfing with their employing a vicar to officiate ftatedly. The 
following reafon is then affigned ; « virorum teligioforum ab. 
I] bat5s et conve ^us de Cambufkenneth, paupertati compa- 

" t.entes, charitatis intuitu, et propter tenuitatem ec-

Virgin Mary, to St. Servanus, and to the church of St. Ser- 
vanus de Alveth, defcribing it particularly as lying near the 
well of St. Servanus, « et inter ipfum fontem et ecclefiam." 
This charter is dated, A. D. 1276. This well is ftill within the 
limits of the minifter's glebe, and although its confecratedname 
has been long forgotten, it continues to fend forth a copious 
ftream of the pureft and fweeteft water. About 20 years af- 
ter the Reformation, and after Stirling, with a few partfhes 
around it, were provided with ftated paftors, the Prefbytery 
of Stirling was erefted on the eight day of Auguft r 5 8i *, in 
confequence of an order from the General Affemblv, to that 
effect. The firfl minifter of this parifti, was Mr Robert 
Mainteith, who was afterwards depofed for incapacity.

From this time and downwards to the year i6"32, this pa- 
rim appears to have been united with the neighbouring one of 
Tillicoultry, the minifter of Alva officiating in both ; the 
livings of each hardly affording a decent fubfiftence ; the 
ftipend of Alya not exceeding 300 merks Scots, orL. 16 : 13 : 4 
fterling. The fabric of the prefent church was built in the 
year 1631, by Alexander Bruce, then proprietor of Alva; 
who, after making a fmall addition to the ftipend, procured a 
disjunction from the parifh of Tillicoultry. Although the 
fabric of the church is ftill good and found, yet it appears 
never to have been completely finiflied within ; the walls 2nd 
roof are not plaiftered, and the feats are in a very ruinous 
condition, ' The windows are too fmall and ill-placed. As 
the ftrudture is fufficienr, it might be repaired at a moderate 
expence ; and, without any enlargement of the area, might be

rendered a very commodious and elegant church. The pre- 
fent manfe, was built in the year 1762, upon a very neat and 
commodious plan. In the year 1765, the prefent Lord Alva, 
then proprietor of this barony, fenfible of the fmallnefs of the 
living, very generoufly, and without any application from the 
incumbent, gave an augmentation in victual to the amount of 
L. 22 fterling, at the ufual converfion ; by which means the 
ftipend now confifts of L. 34 fterling in money, including the 
allowance for communion elements, together with 40 bolls 
of barley, and 32 bolls of meal. But what efpecially deferves 
to be remembered by the prefent incumbent, to whom this aug- 
mention was given, is, that Lord Alva, not only of his own 
accord refolved to give it, but actually executed a fummons 
againfl himfelf, as fole heritor of the parifh, in name of the 
minifter without his knowledge, as the firft ftep towards 
perfecting, what he had fo generoufly refolved on. The 
glebe confifts of nine acres, a fmall part of which is meadow, 
and which, if completely drained, might be very beneficial. 
Had Virgil himfelf vifited the Ochills, and compofed his firft 
paftoral on this fpot, he could not have defcribed it more 
graphically than he has done in the following lines j 

Et tibi magna fatis : quamvis lapis omnia nudus, 
Limofoque pal us obducat pafcua junco.

for the falary of a parifh fchoo!. When it is confidered, that

are allowed to obtain relief for the one half of that fum from 
the tenants, it may be juftly wondered, that fo very few coun- 
try parifhes have availed themfelves of it, and ftill allow their 
fchoolmafters to be fo meanly provided. To this good and 
wife inftitution of parochial fchools, and to the afhduous la- 
bours of that moft ufeful clafs of men, our country ftands in- 
debted for its celebrity in learning and fcience. 

Poor. — The poor in this parifh are not numerous. At pre- 
sent there are not more than fix perfons, who receive relief 
from the public charity. Occafional fupply is at times given 
tp others, as their neceffities demand. They have hitherto 
been maintained by the ordinary collections,, together with 
the intereft arifing from a fmall fund, and the common dues 
of the parifh mort-cloths ; without any afTeflment upon the 
heritor, or inhabitants. There are examples, more than one, 
of perfons, who have declined accepting this charity, choof- 
ing rather to fuftain their hardfhips with patience, than to re- 
ceive it from the public. This ferves to confirm the remark, 
that when the funds of public charity are increafed to any 
great degree, there is generally lefs delicacy in receiving it. 

Minerals. — This parifh has been diftinguifhed by the difco- 
veries which have been made, in this part of the Ochills, of 
various metals, and particularly of filver. In the neighbouring 
parifhes of Logie on the weft, and Tillicoultry and Dollar on 
the eaft, veins of copper and lead have been, at different pe- 
riods, wrought to a confiderable extent ; and though veins of 
thefe metals, and alfo of iron ore, have been found in the hills 
of Alva, yet no experiments of fuch confequence have been 
made, as to afcertain their true value. Some time between 
the years 1710 and 1715, Sir John Erlkine, of whom men- 
tion has be«n already made, by means of fome miners from 

/ Leadhill:, 



of Alva. I4 1 

Leadhills, difcovered a very valuable vein of Giver, in the glen 
that feparates the Middle-hill from the Wood-hill. It made its 
firft appearance in fmall firings of filver ore, which being fol- 
lowed, led to a very large mafs of that precious ore ; part of 
this had the appearance of malleable filver, and was found u- 
pon trial to .be fo exceedingly rich, as to produce 12 ounces 
of filver from 14 ounces of ore. A fum not greater than 
L. 40, or, at the mod L. 50, had been expended when 
this valuable difcovery was made. During the fpace of thir- 
teen or fourteen weeks, it has been credibly affirmed tkafc 
ore was produced to about the value of L. 4000 per week, 
and it has been conjeaured, that Sir John drew from L. 40,000 
to L. 50,000, befides much ore, which was fuppofed to have 
been purloined by the workmen. When this was exhaufted, 
the filver ore began to appear in fmaller quantities •, and Sym- 
ptoms of lead, with other metals, were difcovered. The 
cpnfequence of which was, that all further refearches were at 
that time laid afide. There are (till in the pofleflion of Lord 
Alva, Nephew of the late Sir John Erfkine, fome exceeding- 
ly rich pieces of filver ore, which had been got at that time, 
and which evidently (hew how very valuable that mafs «f 
ore mud have been *. 

Thefe have been examined by many of Lord Alva's friends, 
who have admired, not merely the richnefs of the ore, but its 
beauty ; the pure native virgin filver being obferved to 
adhere in (lender firings to the fpar, in a variety of fanciful and 
irregular forms. 

About

pofleflion, caufed a pair of Communion Cups to he made, for the ufe of the 
Church of Alva ; on thefe, the following infcription is engraved.. Sacris.

■oned had been taken, and a drift carried on, in the direc- 

nof thefi.ver vein, upon that level , but neither did this 

attempt anfwer the expeaation which had been formed of its 

fucceft To facilitate thefe operations however, it had been 

refolved, to drive a level at a confutable diftance, nearer 

.he bottom of the hill , for the purpofe of draining the water 

from the works above. I„ executing this part of their fcheme, 

they had not advanced a great way into the fide of the hill 

when a large mafs of ore was difcovered , at firft, this was 

imagmed to be filver , but upon an accurate trial, made by a 

£ en.leman, diftinguilhed for his chemical knowledge, it waa 

difcovcred to be cobalt. A very confiderable quantity of this 

was brought out, of which a great part was ufed in a manu- 

failure of porcelain, that had been creeled much about that 



of Aha. 143 

time, at Preftonpans in Eaft- Lothian. When ihe cobalt is 
deprived of the arfenic with which it is ftrongly impregnated, 
and in other refpects properly prepared, it produces a pow- 
der of a beautiful deep blue, and with this, a great variety 
both of ufeful and ornamental pieces of china and glafs were 
coloured ; which clearly (hewed that the cobait~found in the 
mines of Alva, was in no refpecl inferior in quality to that 
procured from the mines in Saxony. In confequence of this 
difcovery, the appearances of cobalt being now fully known, 
very confiderable quantities of it were discovered among the 
heaps of rubbifh, that had been taken out of the mines, at 
the time when they were worked by the late Sir John Erlkine. 
This had remained undifturbed, for about fifty years ; when 
Lord Alva caufed a great part of it to be warned, after the 
manner practifed by miners ; and obtained an additional 
quantity to that which had been already procured from the 
level. The work was carried on a great length from the 
place where the mafs of cobalt had been found ; but fpar and 
other vein- (tuff appearing, the further working of the mines 
in this place was, totally abandoned. 

During the time that thefe works were carried on, a very ac- 
curate furvey of all the different veins of metals that had been 
llifcovered in the hills of this parifli, was made by the agent 
for the company, who pofiefled a veVy confiderable degree of 
fkill in the practical part of mining. The feveral appearances 
and fpecimens of the different ores, which were found in con- 
fequence of the trials which were made in the veins; together 
with the precife direftion which thefe take into the hills, with 
a variety of circumftances relating to them, which it would 
be improper to enumerate here, were all accurately taken down 
by their agent, in a regilter or journal, and which is in the 
pofieffion of Mr Johnftone, the prefent proprietor of this ba- 
rony. It is efpecially worthy of being remarked, that the per- 

fon 



f 44 Statijikal Account 

fon employed to make this furvey, and to digefl the obferva- 
tions refultmg from it, was particularly diftinguifhed for his 

mt6 f lty theref ° re the 3CC0Unts of the mines, contained 

in the regifter now mentioned, may with fafety be relied on, 
as juft ,nd accurate, and ftriaiy corresponding to appearances, 
as he had not the fmalleft tendency to exaggerate his defec- 
tions. Although an extenfive knowledge of this fubje£t is al- 
together declaimed, yet there is one obfervation, which pre- 
fentsufelf fo frequently to any, even the moft carelefs, inqui- 
rer, that it may be fairly hazarded : That, were new trials to 
be made, nearer the furface of the veins than thofe made for- 
merly, there is a probability of their being more fuccefsful ; 
as, in fome of thofe veins, maiTes of rich and beautiful fpar at' 
traft the notice of the hafty traveller, and feem to invite him 
to examine them with fome degree of attention. This is hap- 
pily confirmed, by the refult of thofe experiments, an account 
of which has already been given, which were undeniably more 
fuccefsful than any of thofe that fince that time have been 
made. It appears from thofe regifters of the mines, that there 
are not fewer than fourteen or fifteen veins difcovered in the 
hills of Alva, which, from the trials made, are found to con- 
tain fpecimens of filver, lead, copper, iron, and cobalt. 

On the fouth fide of the water of Devon, immediately op- 
pofite to the lands of AK in the eftate belonging to Lord 
Cathcart and Mr Erfkine of Mar, it is well known that the 
fineft coal in all this country is produced. It has now been 
worked during a long period of year?, and has always been 
held in the higheft eftimatiou, on account of its fuperior qua- 
lity. The fame feams of coal have been found on the north 
banks of that river, in the eftate of Alva, and extend from .one 
extremity of the parifh to the other. It was worked by the 
late Sir John Erfkine, about fixty years ago, and a confidera- 
blt quantity of coal was then brought out. The pits and o- 

ther 



of Aha, I4S 

ther veftiges of his works, are ftill to be feen. And fo noble 
a fpirit of enterprife did that gentleman poffcfs, that he cut a 
canal, a confiderable way along the banks of Devon, in order 
to convey his coal to the banks of the Forth, to be exported 
from thence to a proper market. The remains of this canal 
can eafily be traced. More than twenty years ago, accurate 
furveys, of the different levels of the water of Devon, were 
taken as high up as the parifh of Dollar, with a view to faci- 
litate the tranfporting of coal, belonging to the different pro- 
prietors on the banks of the river, by means of a canal intend- 
ed to have been made where it mould have been requifite ; 
as, in many places, the current of the river is fo fmooth and 
gentle, as to render one entire canal altogether unnecefl'ary. 
Although this project was laid afide, yet in fome future 
period it may perhaps be refumed. It is highly proba- 
ble, that the prefent proprietor of this parifh, will judge it 
proper to begin without delay to work the coal upon 
his eftate, for this good reafon, that the demand for that 
article is daily increafing ; and there is every profpect that 
it will continue to increafe, in confequence of the prodi- 
gious confumption of Lord Cathcart's coal, by an iron 
work, lately erected on that Nobleman's eftate, near the 
banks of Devon. No part of it is now fold for the ufe of 
the country. 

In a description of this kind, it would be inexcufable to omit 
taking notice of the beautiful plantations of treef, which fur- 
round the houfe of Alva ; which are planted in the hedge rows 
of the feveral inclofures, and on the brow of that eminence, 
on which the houfe (lands. On this, there is a fmall foreft, 
confifting of many different kinds of trees, fuch as oaks, 
elms, aibes, beeches, larches, and pines of different forts. 
Many of thefe, the oaks in particular, feem to be of confide- 

Vol. XVL1I. T rab lc 



J 4 6 Statijiical Account 

rable age. Some of the afhes too, are remarkable on account 
of their fize ; and one oak, juftly claims the appellation of the 
" Monarch," of this wood, not in refpeft of its age, but on 
account of the tallnefs and ftraightnefs of its trunk, and of the 
regularity with which its boughs are extended on every fide. 
It is extremely probable, that this little foreft had been at 
•firft planted by the hand of fome former proprietor; but far 
beyond the reach of memory. Moft of the trees, which fur- 
round the inclofures below the houfe, were planted by the 
late Sir John Erfkine, and as is fuppofed, fome time before the 
year 1720. The eaft and weft fides of the hill, immediately 
above the houfe, were planted by Lord Alva, more than 20 
years ago, to which very large additions have been made 
every year, by Mr Johnftone, fince he became proprietor. 
It is computed, that not lefs than 98 acres of this hill, are 
planted with trees of various forts ; and that the policy, as it 
is called, and the plantations around the houfe, extend to fifty 
acres. The road from the houfe to the church, which is 
little lefs than a meafured mile, has a row of trees on every 
fide, which renders it a very pleafant and delightful walk. 
It is worthy of obfervation, that the trees on this eftate, have 
this remarkable property of being exceedingly clean and pure, 
in the fkin or bark; and that few or none of thofe mofly ex- 
crefcencies, are to be found on the bodies of the trees here, 
which are ufually feen adhering to trees that grow in low 
and fwampy grounds ; which is an evidence not only of a 
dry and pure atmofphere, but alfo of the happy quality of 
the foil for raifing trees. 'Tis believed, that the fame 
obfervation will hold true with regard to the trees that 
grow on the fame range of hills, having the fame expo- 
fure, and very probably, the foil nearly of the fame qua- 
lity ; while at the fame time, it is but fair to remark, that 
2 few, 



of Alva. 147 

few, if any, of the trees, either in the parifhes on the eaft 
or weft, are equal either in age or fize, to the trees of this 
parifh. 

Few fituations afford more ample fcope for the difplay of 
elegance and tafte, in the way of rural ornament, than this 
place prefents. Nature is feen here in fome of her grandeft, 
as well as rooft pleating forms ; and a coned tafte, by lop- 
ping off fome luxuriancies, and bellowing fome additional 
touches, where thefe are requifite, might contribute great- 
ly to heighten the beauty of the fcenery. A rivulet of the 
pureft water, pours along the middle of that glen where the 
mines were wrought •, when obftruaed in its courfe by op- 
pofing rocks, it forces its way, and falls in three beautiful 
cafcades ; where the ground is foft and flat, it forms a capa- 
cious pool ; it is {haded on both its banks, with an extenfive 
plantation of thriving timber, and forms a convenient recefs 
for the purpofe of bathing. Even Diana herfelf, with all 
her attendant nymphs, might here boldly plunge into the 
cool " tranflucent wave," and not dread the unhallowed -eye 
of any favage or licentious intruder. 

In the eaft end of the church, a monument, plain, and 
without ornament, is erected by Lord Alva, in memory of 
his father, late Lord Juftice Clerk. The following Epitaph 
is inferibed on a marble plate, which, for claflic elegance, 
and purity of ftile, is furpafled perhaps by few modern com- 
pofitions of that kind. It is hoped, that it may not be 
difagreeable to the few furviving friends of that refpedt- 
able and truly amiable man, to recognize a character in 
which they delighted, thus elegantly and juftly delcribed by 
his fon.

(COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Garyie.</head>

<p>

THESE parifhes, the names of j^hich are faid to be 
Gaelic, were united in the year 1618; fince which 
time, Duplin has been confidered only as a part of the parifli 
of Aberdalgy. 

River. — Aberdalgy parilh is wafhed on the fouth by the 
Earn, a river remarkable for its numerous beautiful wind- 
ings, and containing, not only perch, pike, very fine whit- 
ings, and a great variety of other fea and frefh water trout, 
but alfo in feveral parts of its courfe, a confiderable number 
of falmon. There is a falmon fifhery in this part of the river, 
but it is of no great value. The falmon are caught, partly in 
nets, and partly in cruives, and are carried from this to 
Perth j whence they are exported to London, together with 
the falmon caught in the Tay. 

For fome years paft, in confequence of a fuggeftion of 
Mr Dempfter of Dunnichen, the Tay and Earn falmon have 
been exported frehh, and preferred fo well in that ftate, by

teemed equa., if not fuperior to any f a l m on in the London 
A falmon fmack ha s run from Perth to London in 

52 hour?. 



General Appearance of the Panjl,-The ground by the fide 
•f the river is fo nearly upon the fame level, that it is flooded 
after heavy rains, and high wefterly winds | but it foon rifes 
confiderably higher. In moft places, it gets to its greateft 
height at the diftance of fomewhat more than a mile from the 
river. Soon after it begins to fall again, and continues falling 
gently, and gradually, till it 'reaches the parifh of Tibber- 



The foil, in this parifh, as in others, is various. By 
the river's fide, it is fandy. On the lower grounds at a little 
diftance, there are feveral fields of a rich and fharp, and fe- 
veral of a rich clay, foil. On the higher grounds, and on the 
north fide of the parifh, the foil which prevails moft is a ftrong 
deep till* 

A'ir t Dlfeafes. — The inhabitants enjoy the benefit of a 
healthful air, and are fubject to no peculiar difeafes. Little 
more than twenty years ago, the ague was fo common 
and prevalent here, that very few efcaped it; but it has 
not once made its appearance during the laft twelve 
vears. 

Minerals. — The parifh abounds in free-ftone ; but no other " 
mineral has yet been difcovered. Upon one of the farms, 
there is a mineral fpring, the water of which has been lately 
found very ufeful in curing the muir-ill in cattle ; a diftem-

This Table gives the real ftate of the psrifh, in the end of 
the year 1792 ; and, fince that time, there has been but little 
alteration. 

Plantations, &amp; c— The plantations mentioned in the table are 
exceedingly valuable, and add greatly to the beauty of this 
part of the country. All forts of trees planted in Scotland are 
to be feen in them ; and feveral forts in great numbers, and 
in the moft flourifhing ftate. To fay nothing of the more 
common fpecies, the number of fine oak, beech, fpruce fir, and 
fweet chefnut, is very confiderable. There are alfo a few ce- 
dars, two of which are among the largeft that are to be feen in 
Scotland. 

Pennant fays, that the afh does not flourifh here ; but he 
muft have been led to fay this, through inadvertency or mis- 
information ; for there are fuch fine trees of that fpecies, not 
only in the pleafure ground and plantations of Duplin, but 
in various parts of the eftate, that the afh may be looked up- 
on as the indigenous tree of the country. The mention of 
this miftake of Pennant's, naturally leads to the mention of 
another, though it may be thought, perhaps, to be made a 
little out of place. Pennant fays, that fruit will not ripen at 
Duplin; and ytt it is a certain fa£t, that peaches and necta- 
rines come to great perfection there every year, on the com- 
mon wall. 

The plantations in this parifh are of different ages, a great 
many of the trees having been planted in the end of the laft, 
and the beginning of this century, and a great many at diffe- 
rent times fince the year 1762. Duplin caftle, the Earl of

and pleafure ground, give it a manifeft and an acknowledged 
fuperiority to far the greateft part of the feats of our Scottifh 
nobility. The houfe is a very good one. Not the tower only, 
as Pennant fays, but all the fouth part of the houfe, being 
the full half of it, is evidently part of the old caftle. The 
north front and two wings were built by the prefent Earl's 
great grandfather, in the years 1688, 1689, and 1690. This 
front has an elegant appearance. But what perhaps princi- 
pally claims notice, when the houfe is mentioned, is the large 
and well chofen collection of books in the library, and the 
great number of family portraits, and other pictures done 
by the beft hands, which cover the fides of the different 
rooms. 



Agriculture. — The whole lands of the parifh, exclufive o£ 
thofe within Duplin inclofures, are divided into 14 farms. 
By abolifhing that very baneful arrangement of them which 
was commonly termed runrig, by draining, inclofing, liming, 
and fummer-fallowing the ground, by doing equal juftice to 
every part, and obferving a proper rotation of crops, thefe 
farms have, within the laft thirty years, been greatly im- 
proved. Much of the merit of this improvement is juftly 
afcribed to the late Earl of Kinnoul ; who, when he came to 
refide in Scotland, not only took care fo to reftria his tenants 
in the Ieafes he gave them, as to prevent their continuing fuch 
of their old practices as were hurtful to the foil, but alfo 
pointed out to them a better mode of cultivation, and left no 
method untried, that was proper to induce them to follow it. 
At firft, they clifcovered fo great an averfion to any change in 
their old fyftem, that his Lordfhip at times defpaired of be- 
ing able to overcome it ; but, when once they were prevailed 
upon to make trial of the new one, which he wifhed them to 
adopt, it was not long before he had the pleafure to find, not

only that they were perfectly reconciled to it, but that they 
confidered themfelves as under great obligations to him, for 
introducing among them a fyftem of farming fo highly advan- 
tageous. In confequence of this improved ftate of the farms, 
the parifh has now a very different face, from what it had 
when his Lordfhip came to take up his refidence here. At 
that time there were no grafs feeds fown, and no wheat 
excepting a fmall quantity fown by the parifh minifter and 
one of his neighbours ; but now, there are feveral acres an- 
nually fown with grafs feeds, and feveral with wheat by al- 
moft every farmer. Now alfo much good oats is feen grow- 
ing in feveral places, where, at that time, there was not paf- 
ture fufficient for a fingle fheep. Hence the rent has been 
nearly doubled ; and yet, being defignedly kept moderate, it 
is chearfully and punctually paid. The crops raifed, befides 
wheat, clover, and rye-grafs, are oats, barley, peas, beans, 
potatoes, turnips, and lint. Of the three laft, the quantity is 
not great. The rotation of crops which feems to be 
moft approved, but to which few flri£tly adhere, is, the iji 
year after a fummer fallow, wheat id, peafe and beans ; 
3^, barley, with grafs feeds ; qth t clover, and rye-grafs j 
$tb oats. 

Poor The poor at prefent upon the parifh roll, are 7 in 

number. The money arifing from collections at the church, 
fees of mort- cloth, marriages, &amp;c. is not nearly fufficient for 
their maintenance ; but happily for them they have a good 
friend in Lord Kinnoul. His Lordfhip, whether rending in 
the parifh, or abfent from it, not only continues to give the 
fame weekly fum which his uncle the late Lord gave at 
church, but is ever ready, as his uncle was, to beftow 
whatever additional fum is thought necefTary for their com- 
fortable fubfiftance.

Eccleftaftcal The church was built by the late Earl 

in 1773, a" d is one of the beft fma11 churches in Scotland " 
There is a vault under it for the Kinnoul family, in which 
the late Earl and one of his fifters lie interred. The 
manfe, which was built in 1749, is pretty good and in to- 
lerable repair. The ftipend was augmented laft year, 
and is now 32 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of barley, and 
L. 74 : 1 8 : 8t 9 t fler. including L. 3 :6:8fter. for commu- 
nion elements. The Crown and the Earl of Kinnoul are vice- 
patrons, the Biihop of Dunkeld having, before the union of 
the two parifhes, prefented to the church of Aberdalgy, 
which was in his diocefe, and the proprietor of Duplin hav- 
ing prefented to the church of Duplin, which was in the dio- 
cefe of Dunblane. 

School.— The eftablifhed fchool, which is the only one in 
the pariOi, is well attended ; feveral children come to it from 
other parilhes. The fchoolmafler has a houfe, fchool-houfe 
and garden, and L. 10 fter. of a ftated yearly falary. As 
feflion clerk, his falary is L. 1 : 5 fter. For fome years paft, 
Mr Peddie, the prefent fchoolmafler, has been allowed by 
Lord Kinnoul, L. 3 fter. in addition to his falary, for his great- 
er encouragement. He deferves all the encouragement that 
can be given him ; few being better qualified to teach Englilh, 
writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and the firft principles of 
mathematics,, and none more afliduous and diligent in teach- 
ing them than he is. It will not be deemed improper to add, 
that he has acquired without any inftruclor, the rare talent of 
communicating knowledge to the deaf and dumb, and of 
teaching them to fpeak. A boy of this defcription, not twelve 
years of age, who never had another teacher, has made a very 
great proficiency under him. Already he articulates a great 
many words pretty diftinftly, and his articulation appears to

moft of thofe object of fight, which he has had an opportuni- 
tj of examining. He can read, write, and folve any queftion 
m the common rules of arithmetic, as well as moft boys of 
his age, who do not labour under his difadvantages. He 
feems alfo to be in a fair way to underftand what he reads. 

Prefent and former Pryrietorf.-Thc Earl of Kinnoul is 
proprietor of the whole parifh. The whole of it has been 
the property of the Kinnoul family, fi nC e the year 162c, 
when it was purchafed from the Earl of Morton, who poflef- 
ed it only two or three years. For more than three centuries 
at leaft, before it came into, his porTeffion, i t belonged to the 
family of Lord Oliphant. 

At the fiege of Stirling caftle, in 1304, there was in the 
caftle, befides Sir William Oliphant of Aberdalgy, the depu- 
ty governor, a Sir William de Dupplin his coufin ; but be, 
fore 1364, the property of the lands both of Duplin and 
Aberdalgy, was veiled in a Sir Walter Oliphant, who in 
that year, refigned it into the hands of David II. and had a 
charter granted him by that King, by which the lands 
were conveyed to him and his wife, one of that King's 
lifters, to be held in one entire and free barony. 

Antiquities — In the church- yard of Aberdalgy, and on the 
fpot where the old church flood, there is a monument of 
black marble, with this infcription in Saxon capitals : " Hie 
" jacet Dominus Willielmus Olifaunt, dominus de Aberdal- 
" gy qui obiit anno Mill. ccc. vigefimo nono. Orate pro 
" anima ejus." This perhaps was that brave man, the de- 
puty governor of Stirling caftle ; who, when fummoned in 
the name of Edward I. to furrender it, made that noble re- 
ply : « I have never fworn fealty to Edward, but I have fworn 

" to 



of Duplin and Aberdalgy. 157 

« to keep the caftle, and therefore muft wait the orders of 
« m y condiment f and who, when the caftle was befieged 
by Edward in perfon, and his whole army, had the courage 
to defend it for full three months •, though before the com- 
mencement of the fiege, all the reft of the kingdom had been 
forced to fubmit to Edward's power. Douglas, in his peerage, 
fays, I know not upon what authority, that this was the de- 
puty governor's fon •, and Crawford in his, that he was his 
grandfon. Both agree, that it was this Sir William Oliphant, 
who fubferibed along with feveral other Scottifti Barons, the 
famous letter to the Pope, which aflerts with fo much fpirit, 
the independence of Scotland. 

Befides Duplin caftle, the family of Oliphant hadahoufe 
clofe by the church of Aberdalgy, the foundations of which 
may ftill be traced. At a place called Monday, where there is 
a commanding view of all the country around, there are fome 
veftiges of a large building, concerning which tradition has 
handed down nothing but its name, viz. Kemp or Camp caftle. 

Battle. — This parifti was the fcene of that unfortunate bat- 
tle, fought on the 12th Auguft 1332, between Edward Bal- 
liol, and the ScottHh army commanded by the Earl of Mar. 
The fpot where the battle was fought, has not been afcer- 
tained. 

Character of the Inhabitants. — As to the character of the 
people, it may be faid with truth, that they are fober, peace- 
able, and induftrious.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009763">CARMUNNOCK</name> 

(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 
Bv the Rev, Mr Adam Forman'</head>

<p>

Origin of the Name. 

HP H E parifh of Carmunnock, affords but fmall room for 
ftatiftical enquiry. The origin of the name cannot 
now be accurately afcertained. The moft probable account 
is, that it fignifies the camp town founded upon the flope or 
declivity of the hill; and the appearance of the village feems 
to anfwer the defcription. 

Antient State. — It is not eafy to determine, what was the 
condition of the parifli of Carmunnock, prior to the year 
J 5 69, when there was an application from the prefbytery of 
"Glafgow, to the General Affembly ; reprefenting, that the 
prefbytery of Glafgow, confided only of fix kirks ; Glafgow, 
Govan, Ruther-glen, Leinzae or Kirkintulloch, Campfie, 
and Monaburgh or Kilfyth. They reprefent farther, that 
each of the prefbyteries of Paifley and Hamilton confifts of 
fifteen kirks ; and defire, that Monkland, Kilbryde, and 
Faglefham from Hamilton ; and JMearns, Eaftwood, and 

Cathcart 



of Carmunnock. *59 

Cathcart from Paifley, may be added to Glafgow. In this 
application, Carmunnock is not mentioned ; but we find, 
that in the year ! 5 97 Mr James Hamilton, Mimftcr of Car- 
munnock, confents that his kirk (hall belong to the prefbytery 
of Glafgow, according to the will and ordination of the 
General Aflembly. 

Situation, The partfh of Carmunnock, or Carmannock, 
as it is written in ancient records, is Gtuated in the county 
of Lanark, prefbytery of Glafgow, and fynod of Glafgow 
and Ayr. It is bounded by the parifh of Cambuflang on the 
eaft, by Kilbryde on the fouth, by Eaglefham and Mearns on 
the weft, and by Cathcart and Rutherglen on the north. 

The extent of the parifh from eaft to weft, may be aboufc 
four miles, and it is about three miles in breadth from north 
to fouth ; but by including two annexations, the one from the 
parifh of Cathcart, and the other from the parifh of Kilbryde ; 
which, by a decreet of the proper court, were united in the 
year 1725, to the parifh of Carmunnock, quoad Jacra tantum, 
the extent may be fix miles in'length, and four in breadth. 

The greater part of this parifh is pretty elevated, and com- 
mands one of the moft extenfive profpefts any where to be 
found. Towards the north and eaft, the eye is delighted 
with the moft diverfified landfcape. The rich and fertile 
plains of Clyde, from Hamilton to Dumbarton, the wide ex* 
tended country around, which calls forth the exertions and 
induftry of the hufbandman ; the city of Glafgow, and town 
of Paifley, with the villages dependant upon them, and which 
give^energy to the ingenuity of fo many thoufands in the dif- 
ferent branches of elegant manufa&amp;ure, for which thefe ci- 
ties are juftly famed, ftrike the eye of the beholder, and gra- 
tify his mind, when he reflects upon the ufeful purpofe, in 
which the varied, and exertive genius of the inhabitants is 

employfd.

^Ployed The river itfelf, from many parts of the ground, 
of fmall burden from Greenockj p ort . G , a 
ng the r,ch produce of other climes to this happy country. 
But the eye in taking a more diilant range, brings into view 
the lofty htlls of Arran, and different parts of Argylefhire 
towards the weft, Benlomond and the country around towards 
the north, the hills of Pentland within a few miles of Edin- 
burgh on the caft, and Tintoct towards the fouth. The 
profpeft is ft, extenfive, that a part of Cxteen different conn- 
ties is laid to be feen. 

Soil, ^r.-The foil in this parifh is various. A very con- 
fiderable part is of a light quick mould. There are feverai 
farms, part of which confifh of a ftrong deep clay, but which, 
when properly drained, produces excellent crops. There are 
other grounds in the parifh, the foil of which is of a light 
fliallow clay mixed with fand. This kind of foil is very poor, 
and is feldom able to bear a rotation of crops, without be- 
ing every year nourifhed with the moft rich and kindly 
manure. 

There may be about 1500 acres arable, and about 900 or 
icoo acres employed in pafturage. The grounds that lie to 
the weft, and efpecially thofe towards the north and eaft, are 
the moft fertile ; and from their vicinity to Glafgow, where 
manure may be procured, are capable of great improvement. 
Thefe lands produce wheat, barley, peafe and beans; but oats 
are the moft common, and have hitherto proved the fureft 
crop. The other grounds in the parifh, thofe efpecially to- 
wards the fouth, are fo elevated in point of fituation, that 
even in places where confiderable crops might be raifed, it 
would be diflicult to preferve them in any tolerable flate of 
cultivation. Thefe grounds in former times have indeed 

been 



of Carmunnock. l6i 

been frequently ploughed, when the farmer was in ufe to 
turn all his fields into corn. Seldom, however, did the increafe 
repay the labour ; on which account, both from their fituation 9 
and the difficulty of accefs, even though manure could be pro- 
cured, the greater part of thefe grounds is turned into 
pafture. 

A gentleman in the neighbourhood, Walter Ewitig Maclae, 
Efq. of Cathkin, who enjoys a confiderable eftate in this 
parifh, has of late p*id much attention to the melioration of 
his property. He has inclofed at no fmall expence, the whole 
of his higher grounds, with what are called Galloway dykes, 
of five feet and an half high. He has in this manner inclofed 
upwards of 350 acres, fuhdividing the whole into parks of a 
fquare and oblong form, of 30, 40, and 50 acres each, as fuits 
the nature and appearance of the grounds. His exertions 
have already been fo far crowned with fuccefs, that for lands 
which formerly let for 2 (hillings, or 2s. fid. per acre, and 
Were thus rated by thofe who enjoyed the leafe, he now re- 
ceives 15 (hillings per acre. Nor Would he give a leafe of 
19 years at this rate. The reafon, why fuch a rife has taken 
place, is, that thefe grounds not only afford excellent paftu- 
rage, according to the ufe to which they are put, but may be 
confidered as fo many temporary folds for fheep brought from 
a diftance, and intended as a ready fupply for the Glafgow 
market. 

The fame gentleman is alfo engaged in fubdividing, and 
improving his lower grounds. What he holds in his own poffefe 
fion, he is improving at great expence, both by bringing his 
fervants and labourers from thofe parts of the country 
where agriculture is better Underftood, and alfo by driving 
manure from the city of Glafgow^ thefe lands being only a- 
bout 4! miles diftant. For fuch of the grounds as he is about 
to let, he demands fo much per acre, 40s. for fome parts of 

Vol. XVill, X them, 



x ^ 2 Statifiical Account 

them, and 30s. for other fields which are at prefer* Iefs produc- 
tive. There is no doubt, that he will gain his purpofe, as thofe 
who have already lived upon thegrounds, to whomhe isdifpofed 
to let them, are inclined to enter upon a new leafe, though at 
twice the rent which was formerly pa id. The proprietor him- 
felf means to fubdivide and inclofe them, but infills upon a 
rotation of crops, upon fuch grounds as mall be fpecified in 
the contract It muft, however, be a confiderable time be- 
fore his laudable efforts can have their fulle'frea, as feveral of the 
'bid leafes are not yet expired ; but certainly the community at 
large muft wifh, that his labours may be crowned with ample 
ftlccefs, and that others by his exertions may be excited to 
the like fpirited induftry. 

Improvements.— In this parifh there is yet great room for 
many ufeful improvements. Though the breed of horfes is 
excellently adapted for the plough, and for heavy carriage, 
yet fuch is the prevalence of cultom, and an attachment to 
former practices, that the old Scottifh plough is for the moft 
part ufed, and commonly dragged by four of thofe fturdy 
-animals; while, if Small's plough with its late improve- 
ments were introduced, two fuch horfes would be fufficient 
for the draught, without a driver, or plough-boy, who is at 
prefent a necefTary attendant. Several of the more enlighten- 
ed farmers, it is hoped, amidit other reforms t will attend to 
fuch, as will in the end prove really beneficial to themfelves 
aiid to their country. 

Moft of the farms are inclofed, fome with ftone, and the 
greater part with thorn-hedges ; the latter if properly 
cared for, are preferable in a high country, upon ac- 
count of the warmth and fhelter they afford during an in- 
clement feafon. Perhaps it would add both to ornament, and 
utility, were the greater part of the grounds inclofed with 

belts 



of Carmunnock. 163 

belts of planting of confiderable breadth, particularly in fuqh 
fituations as require proteftion from the ftorms, of wind and 
rain, which are here very frequent. 

Rent.— The lands in this panfti do not rent high in compa- 
rifon of the prefent general rate of purchafe. What is remark- 
able, the fon, father, and grandfather, as far as recolled'ton 
goes back, have lived upon the fame grounds, and confider 
themfelves as they exprekit, "naturalized to the foil." They 
are ftill fubjedtedto many burdens, or fervices, which the pro- 
prietor of the land requires, fuch as driving coals, working at 
hay, and other pieces of labour, all which ought to be abo- 
lifhed, becaufe they check the fpirit of improvement, and en- 
croach upon thofe precious hours which the hufbandmari 
{hould employ in reaping the fruits of his own patient 
induftry. 

The lands upon an average, in this parifh, may rate at 15s. 
per acre. The valued rent of the parilh is L. 1650 : 10 Scots j 
the real rent may be between L. 1600 and L. 2000 fterling, 
if we include feu-duty and fuperiorities» 

Horfes, &amp;c— The number of horfes ufed for draught and 
the farm, are about 70, but by including the annexations to 
the parifh, about 120. The number of milk cows, about 215, 
moft of which are reared in the parifli. The cows are of a 
moderate fize, neither fo large as the Englifh, nor fo fmall as 
the Highland cow. During the fummer months they give 8, 
10, 12, 14, and 16, Scotch pints of milk per day. 

The horfes are very heavy and large. They are of the 
large Clydefdale breed, and are every where common in this 
part of the country, being either reared by the care of the 
farmer himfelf, or purchafed at the Rutherglen market. 
Moft of the horfes ufed in this parifli are black, and mea,- 

X 2 fure 



Statijlkal Account 

fare from r 4 to ,6 hands high. They are uncommonly 
well matched, and may rate from L. 24 to L. 4 c per 
head. * 

Management of Farms.-— The whole of the farmers here, 
and efpecially thofe whofe farms lie in the more elevated 
parts of the parifli, incline to plough little, but to let their 
grounds lie in pafturage for 4, 5, and even 6 years, before 
they lay them down a fecond time in corn Thus, what ha 3 
been in crop for the three preceeding years, muft be in pafture 
for the three or four years following ; while thofe proportions 
of the farm that have been in pafture the appointed time, are a- 
gain ploughed up, and appropriated for corn, though fufficient 
care is not had to crop in due rotation. To this mode of 
ceconomy, the farmers are in fome meafure obliged to adhere, 
becaufe of the dearth and fcarcity of proper manure. Lime is 
at hand in the neighbourhood, and fome avail themfelves of 
it ; but from experience it has been found, that lime alone, 
will not anfwer a foil and mould fo light and quick, with- 
out it receives at certain intervals, a more generous and 
un&amp;uous manure. Dunghills confifting of a mixture of 
earth and lime, are the kind of manure which is moft in 
ufe. 

The greater part of the farmers and people in the neighbour- 
hood, fend the produce of the dairy to Glafgow, where at 
times they find a ready market. The cheefe is of an ex- 
cellent quality, being no wife inferior to that mild kind, 
which in many parts of Scotland is known by the name of 
Dunlop. A farmer who pays between L. 70 and L. 80 of 
annual rent, and who converts the greater part of his milk 
into this neceffary article, will fend 130 ftone to the mar- 
ket, at 5s. 6d. or 63. per ftone ; a very confiderable portion 
af his rent. 

The 



of Carmunnoch 1 65 

The farmers here follow the Irifli method, and churn the 
whole of the milk. They are of opinion, that the butter 
is not fo apt to turn rancid, as when the cream, after 
having been long gathered, is only churned. And from 
various experiments in different parts of the country, there 
feems to be fome truth in the affertion. 

The milk of each cow upon an average, will produce 
four pounds of butter per week, from the beginning of May, 
till the middle month of October, which the farmer fells at 
is. and never below iod. per pound. The farmer who has 
12 milk cows, will therefore, during the 6 fummer and har- 
veft months, when the grafs is moft luxuriant, make L. 50 
fterling of his butter, and above L 20 of his butter- milk, 
which is readily fold in Glafgow, and its neighbourhood, at £ 
and never lef§ than a halfpenny the Scotch pint, or twex 
Englifh quarts. 

Though the farmers have a ready market in Glafgow at 
all feafons for fuch neceffiry articles, as milk and butter, 
yet they are not at due pains to keep winter cows in fuch 
order, as to fecure fuch a quantity of milk, as it would 
be an object to bring to market. Feeding with turnip 
is feldom praetifed, though fuch of the farmers as have at- 
tempted this, have found a very good return. It is how- 
ever hoped, that a crop fo beneficial in fituations where 
the milk can be confumed, or the cattle fattened for the 
market^ will even here be brought into more general prac- 
tice. 

Quarries, &amp;c In many parts of the parifh, there is 

coal and lime-ftone, neither of which has been wrought to 
any extent. There is alfo iron-ftone which was once con- 
tracted for by the proprietors of the Clyde iron-works, but 
owing to fome failure in the contrad, the agreement became 

null 



1 66 StatiJIical Account 

null ; fince which period, the ftone, though faid to be of „ 
excellent quality, has been neglefted. 

There are alfo extenfive quarries of excellent free-ftone, 
fome of a foft, and others of a very firm texture. What is 
remarkable, in the whole eftate of Cathkin. which is nearly 
f of the parilh, there is no free-ftone to be found, but all 
below the furface is folid whin of the mod durable kind, ex- 
cept one or two incqnfiderable quarries of rotten rock, ufeful 
only on the highways. I n this diftr.a there are alfo mafljr 
pillars of the ftone called bafaltes ; a description of which has 
more than once been given to the public. 

Water, CsWln every part of the parifti, and particularly 
in the higher grounds, there are many fprings of the moft 
excellent water, thofe efpecially which iflue from the crevices 
of the folid rock. The quality of the water is fo good, that 
feveral gentlemen from the univerfity and neighbourhood of 
Glafgow, well known for their refpeaabiliry, and high at- 
tainment in the different departments of fcience, were at the 
pains to make an accurate furvey of all the different fprings, 
to try whether a quantity fufficient for the fupply of the city 
of Glafgow could be procured.. It was however found, upon 
adlually furvey, that if all the fprings upon the brow of the 
"hill were colle&amp;ed, with the view to be introduced into the 
city, they could only afford 70 Scots pints in the minute* 
■which was T lefs than the quantity required. 

Mineral Spring, Rivers, Roads. — There is alfo a mineral 
fpring, faid to be of confiderable virtue in the cure of various 
difeafts, which many people in the neighbourhood ufed for- 
merly to attend : But for' many years, the fpring has been 
deferted, fea bathing quarters being at prefent the more 
fafliionable refort. 

There 



of Carmunnock. 167 

There are few rivers of any note in the parifh, except the 
Cart which runs along its weftern boundary with great rapidi- 
ty. Its banks in moft parts are covered with wood, which, 
together with its meandrings, and the rapidity of its ftream, 
renders it highly piclurefque and romantic. It has many 
elegible fituations for cotton- mills, and other works of utility, 
which require a great weight, and quantity of water. And 
it is furprizing, that, in a neighbourhood, where fpirit, and 
induflry have fo long been exerted, fuch fituations, intended 
by nature to call forth the ingenuity of man, fhould not have 
been long ago converted into many valuable purpofes. The 
only cotton-mill erected in this quarter, upon the Mearns fide 
of the river, belongs to a company in Manchefter. 

The great road, leading from Glafgow to England by 
Kilbryde, Muirkirk,. Dumfries, C:\rlifle, &amp;c. paffes through 
the eaftern part of this parifh. There is another road that 
joins with the former, near to Kilbryde, intended as a 
thorough fare to Paifley, and the neighbourhood, which paf- 
fes through the annexed part of the parifh ; and there is a 
third already contracted for, which joins the Paifley road to- 
wards the fouth-weft, and is to pafs through the village of 
Carmunnock, to lead to Glafgow. 

Population. — The ftate of population, as far as can be 
traced back by feffional record, appears for the laft 150 years, 
to have been nearly the fame. Before the year 1640, a regi- 
ftration of marriages and births began to be kept ; but feve- 
ral parts of the regifter, from decay, and other accidental cau- 
fes, cannot now be read. What was the condition of -the 
parifh 100 years ago, with rofpea to population, may in 
fome meafure, be collected from the following ftatement.

In the parifti, there aTe 1 5 weavers, 8 Mafons, who a£ 
the fame time are employed as wtights ; thefe occupations 
being in this place confidered as connected. Thefe are 6 
fhoemakers, 2 taylors, 10 day-labourers, 3 millers, 1 carrier, 
1 cooper, 3 gardiners, 1 fmith, 36 men-fervants, 42 women- 
fervants. 

Price of Labour, and Provifions. — Of late years, the price 
of labour is very high. The wages of a man-fervant, are 
feldom beloW L. 10 iterling yearly. The wages of a woman- 
fervant, are feldom lefs ttian L. 4 fterling, and frequently 
L. 4 : io. The wages of a labourer in hay-time, and harveft, 
are commonly is 6d, and frequently, 2 fliillings. A day-la- 
bourer 



of C&amp;rtfiunnoch 1 69 

bourer in winter, commonly earns per day, 1 {hilling, and is 
6d in fummer. A taylor uniformly receives 1 (hilling, and 
a mafon is 8d, and frequently, efpecially in fummer, 2 (hil- 
lings. 

The price of provifions has of late alfo rifen very high. 
Meal is in general, about is id per p~ck ; cheefe, qd^ per 
lib.; butter, icd, and often 1 milling per lib; ; hens, is 8d 
to 2 (hillings, or 3s ^d to 4 (hillings the pair ; eggs, 6d, 8d, 
and fometimes, lod per dozen. The two laft articles are 
here frequently higher than in the city of Glafgow ; becaufe 
the feller, or retailer, will rather choofe to carry fuch articles 
to market, and fell them at a reduced price, than accept of 
a higher price at home ; beef and mutton, are commOnly 
about 6d or 7d, per lib. being the fame as in Glafgow, bc- 
fides the additional expence of carriage. 

Heritors. — There are only two confiderable heritors in this 
parilh, all the reft, in number 14, including feuars, mod. of 
whom, at different times, have purchafed a piece of ground 
from the family of Caftlemilk, being under L. 150 fterling of 
annual rent. 

Sir John Stuart of Caftlemilk, is patron of this parifh. 
The church was rebuilt in the year (767. It is a fmall edi- 
fice, built of fine and free-Rone, and is very commodioufly 
fitted up for the parifh, who are in general conftant in their 
attendance upon divine worfhip. 

Themanfe and offices are alfo in excellent repair, and were 
equal attention paid to the melioration of the benefice, the 
charge would be both eafy and comfortable. But, although 
there are two annexations, (quoad facra), which pay temporalia 
to the extent of near 7obollsof meal, befides vicarage to other 
parifhes, the ftipend of Carmunnock, with all the additional 
labour occafioned by this circumftauce, for which nothing j s

1 1 bolls of bear, or rough barley, with L. 9 : 5 : o : f of vica- 
rage, and L. 2:0:2!, for communion elements; though, 
owing to the vaft concourfe of people from Glafgow, and 
the neighbouring parifhes, the expence incurred when the Sa- 
crament is difpenfed, amounts to four times the fum * 

The glebe, including the fite of manfe, offices, and what

Pwr.-*Evcry part of the parifh being remarkably healthy, 
the poor are not numerous. Such however, as are upon the 
roll, are well cared for ; and there is no remembrance when 
an individual, either man or woman, was permitted to beg. 
The parifh have a comfortable fupply for all the purpofcs of in- 
digence, which arifes from the intereft of a (lock of upwards 
of L. 400 fterling. This fund has been raifcd by donations at 
different times from the family of Caftlemilk, and principal- 
ly, by the weekly colleftions, which have always been confi- 
derable, owing to the uniform attention which this family 
has ever paid to the parifh in the choice of their parlors. 
The parifh has always been kept together, fo that there are 
very few diflenters ; notwithstanding the rage for mock liber- 
ty. There are 8 at an average upon the roll. There are 
only 16 diflenters of all denominations ; and while the people 
have been fatisfied, the Patron, by prudent addrefs, has ever 
pleafed himfelf, and got the man of his choice. 

School. — There is only one fchool in the parifh. The 
fchoolmafter has a teaching room, and dwelling houfe, with 
100 merks of falary. The number of fcholars, is ufually be- 
tween 40 and 50. The wages or fees are fo very low, that 
the whole living, including the office of Seffion Clerk, and 
Precentor, will fcarcely amount to L. 25 per annum. 

Antiquities: — The whole of this parifh has been in former 
times the fcene of a£live exploits, efpecially the grounds which 
lie towards the fouth-eaft. Various tumuli yet remain ; and 
in thofe which have been opened, urns, formed of clay, and 

Y 2 rudely 



*7 2 Statijlical Account 

rudely carved, were found ; in which the aflies of the dead 
feem to have been depofited. Their contents within confift- 
ed chiefly of a dry un&amp;uous earth, mixed with human bones; 
and a fort of reedy fubftance, which, perhaps it is impoffible 
for us now to explain. We can form no credible conjefture 
about the time when thefe urns were fir ft depofited in the 
earth ; and few things have been found, fo as to afcertain, 
whether they are Roman, or Celtic ; but it is moft probable, 
that they are the latter and that the tumuli in which they 
are placed, have been raifed in the time of the druids, before 
the chriftian aera. Commonly in the midft of the mound, 
fquare ftones are placed, which form a kind of cheft, or 
ftone-coffin, in which the bones of the warrior, or of fome 
perfon of fuperiorrank and authority, have been configned to 
the earth. It is remarkable, that all thefe chefts are formed 
of fine free-ftone, which muft have been brought from a dis- 
tance, as there is nothing of the kind to be found in this part 
of the parifh. 

In the eftate of Cafllemilk, are found the remains of a 
Roman caufeway, or military road ; and in an adjoining field, 
feveral pieces of ancient armour, with camp utenfils, were 
lately dug up. The helmet and neckpiece are of an uncom- 
mon fize, and though they are much corroded, and muft 
have lain long in the earth, they {till weigh near 18 lib. 
Avoirdupois. 

In the houfe of Cafllemilk, which is noted for its fine fi- 
tuation, the unfortunate Mary is faid to have lodged the 
night before the battle of Langfide. Many different fpots are 
pointed out in the neighbourhood, where, the following day, 
flie viewed the difcomfiture of her army, which was the ruin 
of all her fortunes. The moft probable place, is upon the 
brow of the eminence above Cafllemilk, where a fpring 
iflaes from the rock, and moiftens the root of a thorn-tree, 
2 now

now grown venerable with age, under which (he fat; and 
which is preferved as a lading memorial of that melancholy 
difafter. 

Difeafes.— 'Many of the people from the healthful fituation 
of the parifh, attain to a good old age. Some carry on the 
labours of the field, efpecially in time of harveft, at the age 
of 85. Fevers, are in general the difeafe which proves mod 
fatal to old people. There cannot be finer, nor more healthy 
children, than in this parifh; but from inattention, they 
often fuffer from colds, which when neglected, bring on 
other difeafes. On which account, many children fuffer by 
quinfeys, and efpecially from a difeafe which in Scotland, 
goes by the name of the croup, This difeafe for the mod 
part, proves fatal ; if the immediate affiftance of a phyfician 
be not procured. 

The fmall pox returns very often, and the diflemper is 
never alleviated, as the people from a fort of blind fatality, 
will not hear of inoculation, though attempts have often 
been made to remove their fcruples on this fubje£l ; but 
every fuch effort has hitherto proved unfuccefsful. It is a 
circumftance however, worthy of being related, that in the 
whole diftri£t. of .Cathkin, where there have always been 80 
individuals ; there has not been an inftance of a death by 
the fmall pox, for thefe laft 24 years ; though the difeafe 
has, in that period, at leafl appeared fix times, and uniformly 
vifited every family. 

Manners, &amp;c— The whole of this parifh is connected by 
inter-marriages; and this, for many ages paft, as appears 
from the public regifter, which has uniformly been kept. 
From accurate enquiry, it has been found, that there are riot 
above 15 perfons, and thefe chiefly fervants, who have nor 

fixed

fixed refidence, who cannot claim alliance with the whole 
parifh ; fo that when an individual conn eels himfelf by mar- 
riage, he may confider himfelf as having gained above 500 
relations at once, by fuch affinity. Whether he lives happier 
on this account, or whether, from this extenfive relationfhip, 
fraternal kindnefs is more ftrongly called forth, we choofe at 
prefent to leave undetermined. Ceitain it is, if people are fo 
inclined, no fituation can be more favourable for giving force 
to fuch kind exertion. It is the more remarkable, that in the 
vicinity of a large and populous city, this parifh mould 
main, like the Hebrews of old, a diftinft people, and p 
elude, as it were, the whole world from their alliance. 

It is but juft to fay, that the greater part of this parifh, 
are decent in their morals; fober, honeft, and induftri- 
ous; and that there is no mftance of any perfon having 
fuffered any capital punifhment. Perhaps it would be fay- 
ing too much, to affirm, that they are in any refpecls, 
better than their neighbours ; but one thing is certain, that 
for near three years, in which their prefent paftor has lived 
. among them, he has never feen an individual overtaken by 
intemperance. They are alfo in general, uniform in their 
attendance upon divine worfhip ; and what few paftors can fay, 
there is fcarcely a family in the parifh, however unfafhion- 
able the practice is, who do not aflemble, and confider it as 
their duty both evening, and morning, to bow the knee in 
acknowledgement to the great Creator. But while we wifb 
not to withhold juft praife, we muft alfo mention a culiom 
which ftill prevails, and which certainly ought to be abolifhed. 
It is ufual in this parifh, as in many other parts of Scotland, 
when a death has taken place, to invite on fuch occafions, 
the greater part of the country around ; and though called to 
attend at an early hour in the forenoon, yet it is generally 
towards evening, before they think of carrying forth the 

corpfe 



of Carmimnoch. 1 75 

corpfe to the church-yard for interment. While, on thefe 
occafions, the good folks are affembled, though they never 
run into excefs, yet no fmall expence is incurred by the fa- 
mily; who often vie with thofe around them, in giving, as 
they call it, an honourable burial to their deceafed friend. 
Such a cuftom is attended with many evils, and frequently 
involves in debt, or reduces to poverty, many families other- 
wife frugal and induftrious, by this piece of ufelefs parade, 
and ill judged expence. 

We are however happy to add, that notwithftanding the 
prefent defire after innovation, and a love of change, the 
contagion has not hitherto fprcad among the people in this 
parifh. Means have indeed been employed to corrupt them, 
and to draw the unwary into the neftilent vortex, but by 
watchful attention, the malignant efforts of defigning men 
have hitherto been rendered ineffectual. There are indeed 
fome, who have got the hackneyed phrafes of the day, " Li- 
berty," " Reform," &amp;c. but there are none who have openly 
pretended to countenance meafures, and practices, which 
by every good Chriftian, and every loyal fubje£t, will ever 
be abhorred. Happy in our monarch* in our conftitution, 
in our religion, and in our laws, our defire and earned 
prayer is, That our fovereign, and his augufl family may 
long be preferved by the good providence of God, and con- 
tinue to fway the fceptre of equity and peace over a happy 
people ; and that the ineflimable conftitution they maintain, 
and the invaluable rights, civil and facred, which we enjoy, 
may remain until that hour fhall come, that fhall diflblve the 
univerfe. 

Fortunati ! ftmper, fua ft bona norint.

(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 
By the Rev. Mr James Finlayson*</head>

<p>

Situation, Name. 

* ■''•HE pariflh of Carftairs is fituated in the county of La« 
nark, fynod of Glafgow and Ayr, and prefbytery of 
Lanark; at the diftance of 27 miles weft from Edinburgh, 
and 25 miles eaft from Glafgow. 

It is fuppofed that the parifli derives its name from the 
form of the ground, which, on the north fide of the village, 
nrifes gradually in feveral long ridges like fteps or ftairs, and 
running parallel to one another; fome of thefe along the 
Lanark road feem to have been artificially formed into earthen 
mounds fimilar to baftions in fortification. 

Others with more probability, think that the name is taken 
from an old caftle which flood at the eaft end of the village, 
and had been either a repofitory of ftores or provifion for the 
inhabitants, at the time that the Romans remained in their 
encampment here, or a place of ftrength to fecure them from 
the depredations of their enemies at a later period. Hence 
Carftairs may be derived from carr, which fignifies town or 

city, 



of Carftairs* 177 

city, and yjlor, provifion, the town or caftle of provi- 
Corii 

Extent, l&amp;c— The length of the parifh from S. to N. is 
fix miles, and it is three in breadth from E. to W. It is fur- 
rounded by the parifhes of Lanark, Pettinain, Carnwath, and 
Carluke. The rifing ground, already mentioned, divides it in- 
to moor and dale lands, differing confiderably in foil and 
climate. The upper or moor land part is a mixture of 
clay and black earthy the date or low land is a lharp fandy 
foil. Both divifions are of a good quality, and capable of 
producing excellent cropsj were farming more ftudied, and 
the land properly cleaned and cultivated. The great ob- 
ftruclion to improvement is the abfufd cuftom of ufing turf 
for fuel, which is altogether iinnecefiary here, as there is 
great abundance of good coal to be had at a moderate dif- 
tance. Some of the tenants begin to open their eyes, and 
to be fenfible that the precious time confumed in digging* 
winning, and leading home peats, would be much better 
employed in improving the fields. There is every reafon 
to think, that agriculture will foon be brought to a high 
ftate of perfection, as there is no parifh in Scotland where 
the farmer has greater encouragement or more local advan- 
tages* the leafes in general being granted for the fpace o£ 
fifty feven years, at a reafonable rate, and a ready market at 
hand for every commodity. 

Patron, Church, bV.— Mr Fullerton of Carftatrs is patron, 
and principal heritor of the parifh. There are five other- 
heritors, two of whom befides the patron refide. The va- 
lued rent is L. 2150 Scots 5 what the real rent is, the prefent 
incumbent has not had accefs to know, as he only became 
minifter of this parifh on the 14th of Auguft 1704. He 
XVIII. % ~ has 



*73 Statiflical Account 

has been told, that the rental is confiderably above L. 200® 
fter. and that the {lipend is about L. 50 in money, and three 
chalders of victual. 

A new and elegant church has been built this feafon, 5 1 
feet by 32 within walls, with an ayfle and gallery, the fide 
wall 20 feet in height, and the fteeple 53 ; and it is all to be 
finifhed in a proper ftyle. 

Poor. — The provifion for the poor Confifts of L. 230 fter. 
of capital ftock ; the intereft of the principal fum, with the 
yearly collections of the church, which, at an average, is 
L. 16 : 9 fter. are fufiicient funds for the purpofe.

A correct parifli regifter has been kept for many years, and 
the feflion records extend as far back as the year 1672, in 
which there is nothing interefting or curious, excepting 
fome fevere inftances of church difcipline, efpecially during 
the miniftry of Mr John M'Laren, who was afterwards fo 
well known and fo much efteemed at Edinburgh. This 
famous man was tranflated from Kippen in Perthfhire, to the 
parifli of Carftairs, in 1 699, and for twelve years had ruled the 
people with a rod of iron ; fince his time the authority of the 
kirk feflion has been on the decline. 

Gardening — This branch of improvement is carried on 
with great fpirit, and to as high a pitch of perfection as the 
nature of the climate will admit. In the gardens of Carftairs 
houfe which are extenfive, not only the fruits that are com- 
mon, but grapes, pine apples, melons, and every thing which 
the country can produce in that way, are raifed in great abun- 
dance. The tea, coffee, and other foreign plants have been 
tried, and thrive beyond expeftation. The plantations around 

Z 2 the 



Statijlical Account 

the houfe, which is beautifully fituated on the banks of the 
nver Clyde, occupy 500 acres of rich land, and have been 
laid out with great tafte. 

Antiquities. — The only Roman camp in this part of the 
country had been on the fouth fide of this parifh, on a riling 
ground near the Clyde. The camp itfelf is an exact fquare of 
fix acres, and notwithstanding the attempts of the plough and 
fpade to deftroy the works of that great people, the prseto- 
rium is ftill vifible, and the walls of circumvallation pretty 
entire. The caufeway leading to the camp and from it, is in 
a direct line, and can be traced feveral miles. Pots and difhes 
of different fizes, and inftruments of war and facrifice, have 
been lately difcovered. Coins of various kinds and of differ- 
ent value have been digged up, bearing the infeription of 
M. Aurelius, M. Antoninus, &amp;c Some of thefe coins have 
fceen fent by Mr Fullerton, to the Antiquarian Society, and 
to the UniverGty of Glafgow. 

« 

Character. — As the writer of this account has refided in this 
parifh only for a very fhort time, he is by no means qualified to 
draw the character of the people. He can fay with truth, that 
they are regular in attending divine worfhip j and is told, that 
they all adhere to the church of Scotland, a few perfons in 
the extremity of the parifh excepted, who find it convenient to 
attend a burgher meeting at Davie's Dykes.

<p>

Situation and Extent. 

THIS parifti is fjtuated in the Ifland of Sky, and county 
of Invernefs : It belongs to the prefbytery of Sky, and 
fynod of Glenelg. 

The extent of this parifh is confiderable, being between 1 1 
and 12 computed miles from fouth to north, and in fome 
parts, no lefs than fix from eaft to weft ; but the form of it 
is irregular; the weft part being interfered by an arm of 
the fea, called Loch Snizort, This loch ftretches at leaft four 
miles inland, in a direction nearly fouth-eaft •, it is narrow 
and (hallow, and forms bays, and curves, as it goes along. 

The parifh of Snizort, is bounded by that of Portree on 
the fouth •, by that of Bracadale on the fouth- weft ; by that 
of Diurinifh on the weft ; by that of Kilmuir on the north ; 
and by the channel between Trotornifh and the Ifland of Ra- 
fay, (a part of the parifh of Portree), on the eaft. 

Soil, &amp;c. — The general appearance of this diftri£t is rather 
hilly and mountainous 5 the furface is unequal, and forms

feveral valleys, or, as we call them, glens-, yet there are feme 
fields pretty extenfive, level and arable. The land as well as 
the foil u various. The land for the moft part is thin and 
dry, with fome hanging and fpouty ground; and the foil 
poor, light, and gravelly; and yields no produce, unlefs it is 
laid over with a thick coat of manure. In the north part, 
and in a few fpots in the weft, the land is deeper, and the 
foil more fertile; and in the eaft fide of the parifh, the land 
is in general deep, and clay. The quantity of arable ground 
has never been afcertained ; but by far the greater part of 
this diftricl confifts of uncultivated lands, overgrown with 
heath and heather; of moor and mofs ; of hills and moun- 
tains, a few of which, are green and dry to the top ; the 
greater number however, are wet and heathy. There is a 
ridge of very high mountains, deep and rocky on that fide 
facing the eaft, running from fouth to north, and feparating 
the eaft part of this diftricl: of the harony ef Trotomifh from 
the weft. 

The principal crops in the parifh, are oats and potatoes. 
When the feafons are favourable, fuch a quantity of each, as 
is neceffary for the maintenance of its inhabitants, is raifed 
within the bounds of the parifh ; but when unfavourable, 
which more frequently happens to be the cafe, there is a ge- 
neral demand for imported meal, The feed time is from 
about the 2oth of March, to near the middle of May. The 
harveft feldom begins before the middle of September, and 
often not till October ; and the crop is rarely got totally into 
the barn-yards, before the beginning of November, and fre- 
quently much later; the late harvefts are generally bad, and 
always precarious in this country ; from the latenefs as well 
as from the uncertainty of the feafons, this diftrid, and in- 
deed moft of the ifland, feems calculated by nature* more 
for grazing and green pafturc, than for railing corn. 

The 



of Snizort. 183 

The middle part of this parifh, is let to principal tackfmen; 
and both the ends are poffefled by a fet of fmall tenantry. 
The tackfmen till the ground with a home-made plough, 
drawn by four horfes ; thefe ploughs, befides the ploughman 
and driver, always require the attendance of one, and fre- 
quently two men to lay over and drefs the ground properly. 
About two years ago, Mr M'Donald of Lindle introduced 
Small's ploughs from the fouth country ; their utility in the 
great faving of labour in men and horfes being foon obferv- 
ed, they were readily adopted by the principal farmers, not 
only of this diftri£t, but alfo of the neighbouring ones ; fome 
of the fmalleft tenants too ufe the common plough, for their 
weak ground, in the latter end of fpring ; yet the chief in- 
ftrument they ufe in cultivating the ground, is the crooked 
fpade. 

Population, bfc. — Although there have formerly been fome 
emigrations from this, as well as from the adjacent parifhes ; 
and although that diftricl of it, that is fituated to the weft of 
the water of Snizort, and Loch Snizort, which was formerly 
let to fmall tenants, is now in the hands of its different pro- 
prietors ; yet the population feems rather on the increafe : 
This I think, muft be attributed chiefly to the introduction 
of Inoculation, which of late years, is pra£tifed with great 
fuccefs. When that malignant dileafe, in times paft, vifited 
this country, which it then did not very frequently, its de- 
predations were vifibly felt, in fweeping away almoft whole 
families, leaving not above one, two, or fometimes three to- 
gether in a houfe ; but fince inoculation, to which the lower 
clafs of people have for fome time been reconciled, became 
general, it feldom proves mortal, and has really been fo in 
very few inftances. The number of fouls at prefent in the 
parjfh, is about 894 males, and 914 females; making 180S 
3 fouls 



Statiftical Account 

fouls in all. Population in ,755 was ,627. The increafe 
therefore, is 1S1. The feffion funds of this patifh are ft 
poor, (being only the Sundays colledions, which are exceed- 
ingly fmall, and a few trifling articles befides), that they do 
not admit of having a feffion clerk, confequently no regifter 
is kept of either births, marriages, or deaths ; fo chat no" cer- 
tain conclufion can be formed upon thefe articles. The funds 
of the parifh are distributed yearly, or once in the two years, a- 
mong its poor, who depend for their mantainance chiefly on 
the generofity of the benevolent tenant. 

The number of black cattle, horfes, and fheep in the parifh, 
is not eafily afcertained ; from the beft information and ftria- 
eft enquiry, it is concluded there are no fewer than 2537 
cows, including all at and above a year old. A certain num- 
ber of thefe, the different farmers and tenants drive to Portree, 
where two public fairs are held in the year, the firft always 
on the laft Wednefday of May, and the fecond on the fame 
day of July following ; and there difpofe of them to the beft 
advantage. From the money got for their cattle (which is 
the chief, and I may fay the only export of the place), they 
pay their rents to the different landlords, and furnifh the requi- 
sites for themfelves and families. There are no fewer than 
597 horfes, all of which are reared and bred for private ufe; 
It is believed the number of fheep are nearly about 1952, 
chiefly of the fmall highland breed ; the wool of thefe fheep, 
fome of which is of a pretty fine texture, the different fa- 
milies get manufactured into cloaths, fluffs, and blanketing of 
various forts for their private ufe. A few goats are kept 
by the principal farmers. 

Red foxes, notwithstanding, a handfome premium is given 
for every one that is killed, are ftill numerous and very des- 
tructive to fheep and lambs*

The eagle, kite, hawk, and black raven, are to be feen 
here, the moorfowl, partridge, and fuch other birds as are 
natives of the weft country, ^the black cock and his mate 
excepted) inhabit this diftria, and a few tarmagans are to 
be met with on the fummits of the higheft hills. The mi- 
gratory birds are the cuckow and fwailow •, the wood-cock 
arrives in the winter, and takes his leave in fpring. The 
fea gulls, cormorants, fearts, and other aquatic fowls, fre- 
quent the coaft : The otter and feal, alio vifit the 
Chores. 

ManufaHures, E*rV. Public manufactures hsve not yet 

found their way into this parifh. The regular tradefmen are 
weavers, taylors, millers, blackfmiths, houfe and boat car- 
penters. The generality of the inhabitants are their own 
mafons and fhoemakers. 

There are three mills in this diftri£t, two upon that 
part of the property belonging to Lord M'Donald, and the 
third upon M'Leod of Rafay's property. 

Rivers, Antiquities, Natural Curiofiiies, cjrV. — There are feven 
large and rapid waters, in the greater part of which, fome 
falmon are caught from May till Auguft. The chief of 
thefe, is the water or river of Snizort, which takes its rife in 
the parilh of Bracadale, and running in a direction nearly 
north weft, discharges itfelf in the lea, at the end of the 
loch of that name. At about a quarter of a mile's diiUnce 
from the more, this water forms an ifland of nearly an acre 
and a half, formerly the habitation of monks and priefts, 
but now the burying place of many families, in this as well 
as the adjacent dittritls. In this fraall ifland are the ruins 
of an old large cathedral, which in all probability has once 

Vol. XVIII. A a been 



'86 Statljlical Account 

been the metropolitan church of the whole ifland of 
Sky. 

Several veftiges of druidical temples are to be met with, 
and fome of them pretty entire. There are alfo duins, all of 
a circular form, and built without either lime or mortar. 
Thefe duins or towers are thought to be Danifh, and were 
ufed as garrifons, or rather watch towers, or perhaps both ; 
what makes the latter probable, is, that from each of thefe 
towers, another is feen from either hand ; and when any one 
was alarmed at the approach of a hoftile train, a fignal could 
be immediately made, (perhaps by fire or fmoke), which 
being foon difcovered by thofe who were next in fight, they 
could inftantly repeat the fignal ; and thus the whole inha- 
bitants of the country capable of bearing arms, might in a 
l'ery fhort time be collected and armed to repel the common 
enemy. 

Many cairns or heaps of fmall ftones thrown together are 
to be feen. In thefe cairns are contained urns, wherein the 
afhes of fome renowned chiefs who fell in the field of battle, 
are depofited •, in one of thefe lately dug up, was found a 
large ftone cheft or coffin, made of four ftones, its dimen- 
fions were about five feet long, by four and a half broad ; up- 
on the layer, which is a large fingle ftone of nearly fix feet 
by five, and a foot and a half thick, was found the handle of 
fome weapon, refembling much the hilt of a fmall f word, but 
quite corroded with ruft ; and a pin which feemed to be com- 
pound metal, about feven inches long, fomewhat rounder 
than' a pretty large probe, at the one end flat and broad, and 
the other round and fharp pointed. Within the coilin was an 
urn of burnt clay, nicely carved, yet without any inscription; 
the urn being broke by the tools employed in removing the 
layer, none of the contents were difcovered. Other urns of a 
ftmilar kind have been formerly dug up in this diftrict. 

At 



of Snizort. 187 

At the bottom of one of thofe high rocks, and at a fmall 
diftance from it, on the eaft fide, is a huge perpendicular (tone, 
or natural obeliflc of uncommon height and magnitude, which, 
when feen from a diftance, very much refembles a large 
fteeple. This {tone is about 360 feet in circumference at the 
bafe ; a little below the middle it is a good deal rounder, and 
thence lelTening upwards, feems to end nearly in a ftiarp 
point ; its height is thought to exceed three hundred feet. 

There is alfo in the fame fide of the parifti, in the march be- . 
tween it and the pariih of Portree, a tieautifu; fall of water, or 
cataract, the perpendicular height of which maybe aboutninety 
feet ; what is moft remarkable relative to this fall, is, that 
nearly oppofite to the middle of it, there is an 2rched hollow 
path acrofs the rock, along which five or fix people may walk 
abreaft with the greateft fafety, quite fecure from and unmo- 
lefted by the body of water that rolls over them, and which 
in this fituation they might miftake for a thick pillar of clofe 
fmoke, did they not fee it dam upon the rocks below. 

Difeafesy cifY. — No local fickncfs or diftempers of any kind 
are prevalent in the paritri. In a wet open feafon, rheuma- 
tifm, coughs, and colds, a*e frequent ; fome epidemical fevera 
appear too, and are at times mortal. The winter and fprings 
are generally damp, cold, and piercing. The air, however, 
on the whole, is not thought unfalubrious, and fome inftances 
of longevity tend to confirm the opinion ; five or fix people 
have died within the laft two years, whofe refpeftive ages 
were from eighty-four to ninety, and many are now living iu 
this diftridt above eighty years of age. 

Rents, iifc— There are fix proprietors, four of whom have 
become proprietors in the year 1779, at which, time they feued 
that diftrift of the parifh that was formerly the fole property 

A a 2 of

of the Laird of M'Leod, of which he has retained the fuperi- 
ty, and a handfome annual feu- duty. 

The divifion of the parifh belonging to Lord M'Donald, 
rents at above L. 800. That belonging to M'Leod of Rafay, 
at about L. 120 ; and that diftric~t, the property of the above 
mentioned feuers, rented when purchafed by them for about 
L. 200 fter. but would now undoubtedly bring them as 
much more, were they to let their refpe&amp;ive properties. 

Schools, Church, tsfc. — There are no public fchools in this 
diftri£t. The places of worfhip are four, at a confiderable 
diflance from each other. The veftiges of a parifh kirk only 
remain ; an eftimate of one has been taken lafl year, with a 
view of building early this feafon, but no farther fleps 
have hitherto been taken. There is no manfe, the pre- 
fent incumbent, Mr Malcolm M'Leod, lives on a fmall farm 
which he rents from Lord M'Donald ; he became rni- 
nifter of Snizort in the year 1788. His predeceflbrs in the 
parifh were Meffrs Archibald, Donald, Archibald, and Wil- 
liam M'Queens, all in lineal defcent, the fon uniformly fuc- 
ceeding the father for four generations. The prefent minifter 
is married, and has four fons and three daughters. 

The value of the living, including the glebe, is about L. 75 
fter. The patronage is claimed by the crown and the Laird of 
M'Leod, but both concurring in the fettlement of the prefent 
incumbent, who had a regular prefentation from each, the 
queftion of right was left to be difcufled before the court 
competent, at fome future period. 

The name of the parifh, as well as the names of mod places 
in it, are Danifh ; fome indeed are of Celtic origin ; and in 
fome inftances, the places take their names from their local 
filiation.

Ke [p -The quantity of kelp manufaaured here is not con- 
fiderabie, being only about fifty tons yearly and this on the 
weft fhores alone; thofc on. the eaft are bold, deep, and 
of difficult accefs, and yield no ware for making kelp. 

There are fome frefh water lochs, a few of which abound 
in fine large red trout. 

Herring F^.— Confidence quantities of herring have 
vifiied Loch Snizort for fome years paft, commonly in themonth 
of Auguft, where many of the herring bufles have been pret- 
ty fuccefsful, but the country people, from the difficulty of 
procuring fait, have not reaped from it the advantages they 
might receive, were the fait laws fuch as to allow them to fur- 
- nifli themfelves at an eafier and cheaper rate. 

The fuel ufed through this whole diftria is peats j they 
are cut from the mofs, chiefly in the month of May, and 
when the fummer is wet, the inhabitants are commonly very 
iji fupplied,

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011751">WEST-C ALDER</name> 

(COUNTY OF MID-LOTHIAN.) 
By the Rev. Mr Muckersie.</head>

<p>

Situation and Extent. 
*JpHE parifli of Weft-Calder lies in the county of Mid- 
Lothian, in the prefbytery of Linlithgow, and in the 
fynod of Lothian and lweedale. The average breadth of 
this parifli, is about s i miles, and the length IO miles. It 
is bounded on the fouth, by the Cairn hills, and on the north, 
by the Briech water, which falls into the Almond, at the 
north-eaft point of this parifn. The fouthern part, which 
lies contiguous to the pariflies of Dunfyre and Carnwath, 
confifts of high and moorifti grounds, interfperfed with mo- 
rafles of confiderable extent. Thefe grounds, for the mod 
part, incapable of cultivation, are parcelled out in (beep 
farms. The arable parts of this parifli vary confiderably in 
their value, either from the degree of improvement, or their 
local fituation ; but the foil of the whole parifli is of a 
black mofly earth, or a wet clay, both on a till bottom. 

The height above the level of the fea, is from 450 to 700 
feet ; and from this circum (lance joined to the neighbourhood 

of 



of VVeft-Calder. 191 

of the Cairn hills, this parifh is expofed to confutable de- 
grees of cold and moifture. The chief ftorms of wind and 
rain are from the fouth and fouth-weft. 

Agriculture and Produce.— The modes of agriculture mofc 
generally pradifed, in all probability have been nearly the 
fame, fmce any part of the parifh was cultivated. Hence 
agriculture, except in thofe inftances when the common me- 
thods are departed from, is in its fimpleft and rudeft ftate. 
The whole procefs confifts of foreading dung on lee ; allowing 
it to lie for fome time on the furface, and then taking three 
or four crops of oats. After this, the field lies three or four 
years in grafs, and the procefs begins again. In place of 
dung, the middle of a high ridge, is fometimes opened with 
the plough, and the furrow mixed with lime, and fpread 
over the furface. It is fomewhat aftonifhing, that notwith- 
ftanding this mode of agriculture, the farmer frequently 
reaps apparently luxuriant crops ; and perhaps the only pro- 
bable way of accounting for jt is, that in many inftances, the 
crop is not fufficiently ripe to exhauft the manure. The 
farmers here have difcovered, that lime a£ts as a powerful 
folvent on all kinds of mofly earth ; and they have applied 
the difcovery, with great fuccefs to the purpofes of agricul- 
ture. The fpirit of improvement has now begun to reach 
this place. The foil in many cafes, has been by fome of the 
intelligent proprietors ameliorated, by enclofing with double 
rows of hedges and ditches, leaving a confiderable fpace be- 
tween, to be filled up with young trees, adapted to the cli- 
mate. This has ferved the double purpofe of enriching the 
foil, and rendering the appearance of the country more beau- 
tiful. One proprietor in particular, has improved his grounds 
on the beft principles of agriculture ; and he has fucceeded 
in raifing turnips, and in a proper rotation of crops. 

Oats, 



Statijlical Account 

Oats, potatoes, flax, barley, peas, and turnips, are: raifed 
in tins panfh. The grain molt generally attended to, is 
oats ; the average produce of which may be from 4 * to 5 
bolls an acre. When the ground happens to he laid down 
with grafs feeds, the prevailing crop is rye graft. Of this, 
there arc two kinds, an annual and a perennial. The former 
gives a double quantity of grafs the firft year, which is 
thought in moa cafes, to compenfate the continuance of the 
other. A confiderable quantity of rye grafs feed is preferved ; 
and befides what is fufficient for next year's fowing, there are 
frequently in good years, from 300 to 400 bolls fold out of 
the parifh. 

There are confidcrably more horfes reared than fupply the 
wants of agriculture ; and the rent is mod commonly paid 
from the fale of cattle. The high grounds in the fouth and 
weft parts of the parifh, are divided into 15 fheep farms; 
and it is conjectured, that the whole lands employed in this 
manner, may maintain about 6000 fheep. 

The ploughing is now mod frequently carried on by two 
horfes, and Small's plough has been introduced ; while, at the 
fame time, a great many of the old farmers regret the defue- 
tude of the old Scots plough, and a greater number of horfes ; 
and affirm that their foil requires a deep and large furrow. 
It is fcarcely poffible to make any conjecture, with refpect 
to the rent of arable ground; becaufe the greater number of 
farms have fome outfield or mofs, or moor, connected with 
them. Were it otherwife, perhaps the ordinary rate of ara- 
ble ground would be from 12s. to 20s. an acre. The fize of 
farms is fcarcely in any inftance greater than what is necef- 
fary to fupport a family ; and almoft every attempt to accu- 
mulate this kind of property in this parifh, has brought ruin 
on the projector. , 

Character 



of Wejl-Calder. 193 

CharaStr and Manners of the People.— In almoft every in- 
ftance, the local fituatioris of men form their charaders. 
The inhabitants of this parifh are much excluded from the 
commerce of the world, and nearly on the fame level with 
regard to each other ; their attention is direded to few ob- 
jects, and hence they are fimple and unaffeded in their man- 
ners ; while they polTefs a wonderful degree of fagacity and 
acutenefs, in every thing connected with the circle of their 
purfuits. From the great number of fmall farms, every in- 
dividual may look forward to an eftablifhment in life ; and 
hence his attention to bufinefs and induftry is excited. 
In this ftate of fociety, it muft be confefled, there is little 
fcope for that ambition, which impels a man to rife above 
his humble fphere •, but this fituation fuppofes contentment 
and happinefs. From this circumftance too, it may be men- 
tioned, as a character of this people, that the advantages 
which they cannot fecure to themfelves, they with to convey 
to their children ; and it has been obferved, that a greater 
number of this parifh have been defigned for the church, 
than, perhaps, of any ten parifhes of eq'.nl extent in a 
highly cultivated country, and in a given time. The great 
bulk of the inhabitants of this parifh have a confiderable 
{hare of religious knowledge, and a becoming fervency in 
their devotion. It is hoped, that they will not be charged 
with Angularity of manners, when we mention, that there 
aire not perhaps fix families in this parilh, who do not daily, 
and in a family capacity, afiemble together to acknowledge 
the Author of their mercies. Altogether detached from the 
capital, they are unacquainted with its vices. Drunkennefs, 
and debauchery of all forts are fcarcely known ; and there 
are very few inftances of men continuing unmarried, who 
have the means of fupporting a family. This parifh has been 
particularly blamed with difaffettion to the prefent conftitu- 

Vol. XVIIJ, B b tion, 



*94 Statiflical Account 

tion. From the ftate of fociety in which they are placed, the 
reprefentation of any kind of oppreffion, whether real or 
imaginary, is apt to afccl their minds. This, however, is 
but a momentary impulfe ; for, when they find that the chief 
articles of life, by which they are fupported, are not the fub- 
jeft of taxation ; and that what they bring to the market, is 
raited in its value, by the very fyftem of which they are 
taught to compiain, the good fenfe of the parifh is foon 
brought to prevail over the defigns of thofe who would mif- 
lead them.

From 



of Wejl-Calder. 195 

From the above table of population, it appears, that the 
average number to a family, is 4 and near fa and that the 
males and females, are as 16 to 17. In the account of Sece- 
ders, none are reckoned below 9 years of age*. Of thofe Se- 
ceders, i 4 i are Antiburghers, 169 Burghers, 7 are conneft- 
ed with the prefbytery of Relief, and 3 are Cameronians. 

The caufes of feparation from the eftablifhed church have 
been extremely various in this parifh. In confequence of the 
laft fettlement, from 40 to 50 perfons, have joined the Se- 
ceffion. Of thofe feparated from the church for the laft 10 
years before this period, the ftriftnefs of the church difci- 
pline feems to have been the chief caufe. 

Eccleftajlical State of the Parifh.— This parifh, previous to 
the year 1646, was a part of the parifh of Mid Calder, and 
had a chapel belonging to it, at a place which ftill retains the 
name of Chapelton ; about a mile eaft from the village of 
Weft-Calder. The prefent proprietor, (Mr Gloag), has now 
in his poffeffion a large hollow ftone, which feems to have 
been the font of the chapel. 

In the year 1647, the commiffioners for the plantation of 
kirks, and valuation of teinds, valued the teinds of the parifh 
of Calder Comitis, which included the parifhes of Mid and 
Weft-Calders ; and allocated the whole teinds as ftipend to 
the minifters of the two parifhes. The minifter's ftipend is 
paid in money, and amounts to 8po merks ; together with 
50 merks for communion elements, and 30 merks for grafs. 
In addition to this, the glebe confifts of twenty Scots acres. 

B b a Schools. 

* The numbers dated of this parifh in 1755, were 2396 ; no more than 
1289, are now mentioned. But as none are here reckoned among the Seceders 
below 9 years of age, the diminution muft in fome degree, be attributed to 
this circumftance. 



r S6 Statical Account ' 

Schools.^-The parifh fchool has generally attending it 
from 50 to 7 o fcholars. Of thefe, from 6 to 10 are receiv- 
ing the rudiments of a claffical education. The fchool fees,

have lately agreed to augment the falary, by a voluntary con- 
tribution, to continue during their pleafure. Befides the

One of thefe has been lately erected, by one or two of the 
fmall heritors, in oppofition to the parifh fchool. The reft

a dozen or more parents in the fame neighbourhood ; who, 
on account of their diftance from the public fchool, are com-

Antiquities.— Towards the fouthern extremity of this parifh, 
there is an old caftle, which is reported to have been fortified 
by Cromwell, to reprefs the depredations of the mofs troop- 
ers. On the weft part of Hayfield eftate, there was, a few 
years ago, the remains of an old camp, known by the name 
of Cromwell-wit. This is now converted into a corn field ; 
and it remains altogether uncertain, whether the name was 
given as a mark of Cromwell's underftanding in the choice of 
the fituation, or as a proof of his folly j although the laft ap- 
pears more probable. 

About two miles due fouth, there is on the top of a rifing 
ground called Caftle Graig, the remains of a fmall Roman 
camp, in a pretty entire ftate. Within a few years, feveral 
Roman coins have been dug up from the environs of this 
encampment, on which ti e Roman eagle was fufliciently ap-

parent, but the circumftances which could lead to the period 
at which they were coined, where completely effaced. Ex- 
cepting this circumftance there are no proofs of ancient po- 
pulation within this diftri£t. 

There are a few names of places, as Briech, Cobberfhaw, 
and Polbeth, which feem to be of Gaelic derivation. But 
in every inftance where a Gaelic name is employed, there is 
a river, or a morafs, or a wood, to which the name might 
have been given before the country was inhabited. In all 
other inftances, the names of places, farm houfes, &amp;c are 
in the old Scottifh dialeft, and indicate a recent date. The 
following names may be mentioned as examples ■, Blackmire, 
Heugh-head, Slate- heugh, Birny-hill, Mofs-end, Rafhie- 
hill, Back-i-the-mofs, Stank- head, Whitefykes, and Turni- 
moon. 

Coaly &amp;c The greater part of this parifh moft probably 

ftands on coal. It has been dug for in various places, but 
never to much advantage, except at Longford, on the eftate 
of Mr Douglas of Baads. The working of th% coal has been 
difcontinued for many years. But we underftand, that 
the proprietor has now piven a leafe ; and fome attempts 
have been already made to find out the beft place for erecting 
an engine. 

Limeftone is alfo found here in great abundance. One 
great lime-work at Limefield is now nearly exhaufted. 
The ftratum of limeftone feems to have been in thicknefs 
about nine or ten feet, with a free-ftone roof, and a dip of 
one foot in three. Great pillars have been left to fupport the 
roof, and the limeftone has been every where wrought down 
to the level. By this means an excavation has been 
formed worthy of the attention of the curious obferver.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q211925">EASTWOOD</name> 

(COUNTY OF RENFREW.) 
By the Rev. Mr Stevenson M'GilI*</head>

<p>

Situation, Extent, ?5*r. 

THE parifh of Eaftwood lies about three miles S. Wo 
from the town of Glafgow, furrounded by the pa- 
rifhes of Cathcart, Mearns, Nielfton, Paifley, and Govan. 
The greateft length of it may be about four miles, the 
breadth of it about three ; but its form is very irregular, fo 
that its dimenfions in different quarters greatly vary. 

A very populous village, named Pollock-fhaws, lies in that 
part of the parifh which approaches* Glafgow. It is fituated 
in a fine valley, interfperfed with trees, and watered by the 
river Cart and Auldhoufe burn. On the one fide, it is 
fkirted with neat bleachfields in conftant verdure ; on the o- 
ther, with well cultivated inclofures ; and affords from the 
furrounding eminence, a delightful profpect of a manufactur- 
ing yet rural village. 

In its general appearance, the parifh of Eaftwood prefents 
all that fine variety for which this part of the county of Ren- 
frew is diftinguifhed. The little hills rejoicing on every fide, 

have 



2 oo Statiflical Account 

have their brows adorned with plantations or natural wood*, 
A number of fmall rivers wander among the vallies ; but 
chiefly the Cart, fwelled with a variety of rivulets, purfues 
among them its courfe, till pafling with many windings by 
the houfe of Pollock, it enters near the bottom of Crockfton 
the Abbe? parifh of Paifley. 

So/7, Agriculture, &amp;c. — The foil is various ; in fome parts 
light, in others heavy; but excepting a trad on the fouth fide, 
which is tilly and barren, it is in general fertile. The lands are 
well inclofed ; and the face of the fields affords ample proofs 
that the knowledge and the induftry of the farmer have, during 
the lad twenty years, greatly increafed. 

The mode of farming is fimilar to that which has been 
described in the accounts of neighbouring parifhes. Pota- 
toe farming feems to be particularly cultivated here, and to be 
well underftood. Horfe-hoeing is the method moft com- 
monly followed, and where the grounds are light and dry 
is followed with great fuccefs. Sir John Maxwell fold in 
1793 fome fields of potatoes at L. 12 : 10 per acre, yet the 
perfons in the village who purchafcd them, after all expences 
were deducted, had them at 4I per peck of the Renfrew 
meafure. Dr Smith in his Wealth of Nations, ftrongly re- 
commends the cultivation of potatoes as a cheap and health- 
ful food. The porters of London, he obferves, are among 
the ftrongeft men in the world, and they being almoft all of 
the Irilh nation, have been chiefly fed upon potatoes. He 
infifis too, that they are equally conducive to good looks, 
and as examples, mentions the women of the fame nation. It 
might be added, that no food is more univerfally acceptable 
to the tafte ? or is capable of being ufed in a greater variety of 
forms. Might not the improvement of it be confiderably 
affifted by attending more to the kinds which mould be culti- 
vated,

lot 



vated, ascertaining more clearly than has yet been done, 
their different qualities, and appropriating each kind to its 
proper foil. 

The neighbourhood of large manufacturing towns renders 
the market to the farmers of this parifti ready and certain. 
But the price of meal not having increafed in the fame pro- 
portion with that of the other articles of life, and with the 
price of labour, fome intelligent perfons have begun to lay- 
down their farms chiefly in grafs. In general, about one 
third is in tillage, and two thirds in pafture. There are kept 
about 80 horfes, and 350 cows, but feldom any fheep. 

"Whether the introdu&amp;ion of manufactures into the parifh 
has contributed to the improvement of its agriculture, it is 
not eafy precifely to afcertain. The probability is, that it 
has contributed to it, though not perhaps in that degree which 
the theories of philofophers would lead us to exped. The 
addition made to the number of inhabitants, rauft increafe 
the demand for feveral of the articles of living. This leads 
to induftry arid the defire of improvement. The wealth of 
the farmer increafes ; and, he has both fufficient means and 
inducements to cultivate his grounds to the utmoft. This 
mode of arguing is natural ; but by fixing our attention upon 
one view of an objea, other views equally natural and juft 
are apt to be forgotten. Circumftances frequently exift of 
an oppofite tendency ; which, if they do not counterbalance, 
at leaR conGderably counteraft the beneficial effeas of ma- 
nufadures upon hufbandry. By their neighbourhood the 
price of labour is increafed. In order to procure labourers, 
the farmer muft render the wages of his fervants equal to 
thofe given by the manufa£turer. A more expenfive ftyle of 
drefs and living generally prevails where the price of la- 
bour is high. And the landlord finding his expences in.

creating from the fame caufcs, naturally thinks of railing the 
rent of his land. Thefe circumftances diminifh the furplds 
of profit which remains to the farmer, and confequently 
leffen his ability for extenfive improvement. It is far- 
ther to be remarked, that the value of many articles of 
life does rot actually rife with the neighbourhood of 
manufactures and with the population of a parifh. The 
price of meal is not higher in Renfrewfhire at prefent 
than it was thirty years ago, when manufactures were 
in their infancy. To give advantage to the farmer, much - 
depends alfo on the kind of food for which the people 
have a taftc. If they fhall chufe to live chiefly on but- 
cher meat, the advantage of their neighbourhood muft be 
greatly diminifhed, becaufe fuch food can be as eafily 
afforded from a confiderable diflance, as from the imme- 
diate vicinage. To this muft be added, that manufactures, 
by affording a greater and quicker profit, tempt men to 
employ their money, genius, and chief attention in thofe 
more alluring branches of induftry, while the flower and 
fmaller profits of agriculture are apt to be undervalued. 
Thefe are fome of' the difadvantages to the farmers at- 
tending the neighbourhood of manufadures ; though it 
is not^afferted, that they are fufficient to counterbalance 
their good effects. They are difadvantages, too, whjch 
it fhould be remembered, are not always attached to the 
neighbourhood of manufactures. Manufactures may be 
flourifhing, when the manufadurer is fully fupphed with 
hands, and when his manufacture will not admit of more 
attive capital, than he has already employed. In tins 
Nation, the gerfons who cannot find employment from 
him, . will offer themfelves at a moderate pnee to the 
femer, the wealth which the manufactures have pro- 
duced, but cannot employ, will be expended on the nnprove-

went of land ; and the manufafturer himfelf will carry in- 
to this new line of bufinefs, that fpirit of enterprize, and 
thofc adive habits, which duliriguifh him W his own pro- 
feffion. 

Thefe obfervations might be extended to the general ef- 
fects of manufacturers upon a nation. Writers have com- 
monly confidered it as a fettled point, that population muft al- 
ways increafe with the increafe of wealth, and that improve- 
ment in agriculture muft always correfpond with the increafe 
of population. But both thefe principles require great li- 
mitation. The population of a country does not ne- 
ceffarily increafe with the increafe of wealth. Abundance 
of provifion, is without doubt a neceffary requifite in or- 
der to an increafe of population. But it is equally necef- 
fary, that this abundance mould be properly applied. With- 
out attention to this, no furplus may remain for an in- 
creafe of inhabitants ; nay the abundance may prove the 
mean of decreafe and imbecillity. A nation may in this 
refpect be in the fame ftate as an individual. A perfon 
who is accuftomed to a certain ftyle of life, though he may 
have abundance in the abftra£l, yet from his habits he may 
confume upon himfeif what would have provided for a nu- 
merous offspring. He is therefore in the fame fituation 
as if he were really in a ftate of poverty. If he (hall 
marry, his habits and mode of life may be unfavour- 
able both to the number and the health of his offspring. 
While the labouring man rears ten or twelve healthy 
children, the children of the luxurious, fewer in number, 
are often reared with difficulty, and are at laft both 
weak and unhealthy. This may certainly be the ftate of a 
nation. If from any circumftances, the body of the people 
acquire a tafte for luxurious living and diffipated pleafurer, 
or fpend their days in unhealthy occupations, the nation may 

C c 2 be 



*°4 Statifikal Account 

be in poverty in the midft of abundance, and rear both rW- 
er and more weakly children than when it nurfed them in a 
more hardy and fteril foil, and under a more inclement and 
unfettled fky. 

Neither will improvement in agriculture always corref- 
pond with an increafe of population. If from fterility of 
foil and the high price of labour, the merchant can import 
grain from foreign countries cheaper than the farmer can 
raife it ; or if the genius and induftry of the country pur- 
fue with a ftrong bent a tra&amp; different from agriculture, 
may not the cultivation of our own fields be neglected, and 
the nation be reduced to depend on other countries for its 
fuftenance ? This is an evil which may in time remedy it- 
felf. Yet inconveniences may arife in the interval ; and, it 
is ftill an object of attention, that the general aflertion, that 
agriculture muft always improve with the increafe of popu- 
lation and manufactures, is too unqualified, and ought not 
always to be confidered as indifputable by philofophers and 
legiflators. 

The average of land is about L. i per acre. Grounds 
in the neighbourhood of Pollock which had been for fome 
time in lee, have frequently been let for two years at 
L. 6: io per acre. The valued rent of the parifh, is about 
L. 3300 Scots money; the real rent, it is believed, about 
L. 3400 fterling. This is divided among five landed pro- 
prietors ; among whom this parifh has the happinefs of 
numbering the two aunts of the prefent patron, Mrs Mont- 
gomery of Auldhoufe, and her filler Mifs Maxwell ; whofe re- 
fidence difFufes bleflings on their neighbourhood, and who 
#re the diftinguiflied, though unaffected examples of every 
virtue and of every duty. 



Natural 



%f Eqftwoocl. 1 

' Natural Hijory. — The natural hiftorian will find, in fe\ . 
parts of this parifh, obje&amp;s meriting his attention. In the 
neighbourhood of Thornlie-bank, a fmall village, there is a 
ftratum of fchiftus, which has particularly attracted notice. 
It i9 a good many yards in thicknefs, and contains a great va- 
riety of marine productions, in a petrified (late. Specimens 
of feveral genera of fliells are found in fine prefervation. 
The orthoceratites both plane and fulcated, retain the origi- 
nal {hell ; a circumftance which rarely occurs in natural hif- 
tory. The fpecimens of fliells, &amp;c. are filled with iron ftone, 
containing a proportion of lime. Many nodules of iron ftone 
of different fhapes and dimenfions, are imbedded in the ftra- 
tum of fchiftus *. 

ManufaBures. — The manufactures carried on, are chiefly 
the weaving of muflins, bleaching, printing of calicoes, and 
cotton fpinning. In the weaving branches, there were em- 
ployed, in 1793, about 470 looms: In printing, bleaching, 
and the occupations connected with them, about 226 men 
and boys, and 174 women. There are alfo two cotton mills 
in the parifh, which at the fame period, employed above 
600 perfons of different ages. The principal print-field here 
is among the oldeft in Scotland. The parifh feems well 
adapted to manufactures; and in general, the people are 
more healthy than thofe ufually are who follow fuch occu- 
pations. This may be owing in part, to the frefh currents 
of air, which blow frequently with confiderable ftrength be- 
twixt the furrounding heights ; and very much to the tradef- 
man mingling fometimes with his fedentary employment, the 
exhilarating and healthful exercifes of the garden and the 
field. 

Population. 

* Mr David Urc. 



x/lical Account 

ulat'ton — The population of this parifli, in 1793, *&amp;3$n 
o numbers were taken, amounted to 2642 young and old 
perfons, divided into 558 families* Of this number 1349 
are males, 1293 females. Below 10 years of age, 361 are 
males, 351 females; below 20, 352 are males, 304 females ; 
below 50, 505 are males, 480 females; below 70, 106 are 
males, 136 females ; below 100, 25 are males, and 22 are fe- 
males. The average number of perfons to each family is 
fomewhat more than 4 j-. During ten years preceeding 1 704, 
it appears by the regifter of the parifli, there were 219 bap- 
tifrris, and 8 1 marriages. During the fame period, preced- 
ing *793 tnere we *e 795 baptifms, and 234 marriages. The 
average of births in a year, during the firft period, is about 
22; during the laft period, 79. Suppofing the proportion 
betwixt births, and the whole population, to have been the 
fame in each period, the numbers will have been tripled in 
the courfe of one hundred years. In the births of the firft 
ten years, there are 121 males, and 98 females. Jn the 
births of the laft ten years, there are 402 males, 393 females. 
The births of laft year were 94 ; the proportion between 
the births and the whole population in that year, was near as 
One to 28f . 

Church School, &amp;c. — The patronage of the parifli belongs 
. to the family of Nether- pollok. The ftipend is 5 chalders of 
meal, I chalder of bear, 300 merks of money, 100 merks 
for communion elements. The glebe, including the. ground 
occupied by the manfe, offices and garden, is believed to con- 
fid of about 5 acres. There is no land allotted for pafture. 
The manfe has been lately re-built. It is a commodious 
handfome houfe, and is very pleafantly fituated. The manfes 
which have been lately built in this neighbourhood, have, m 
general, (hewn the heritors of the country to be actuated by 

fentiments 



of Eq/iwood. 207 

fentiments at once fuited to the liberal fpirlt of gentlemen 
and refpcftful to the office and chafer of the mimftcrs of 
religion. The church was a few years ago alfo re-built. At 
that time it was removed from the neighbourhood of the 
manfe, to a fituation nearer to Pollok-maws. It is now 
beautifully Glutted upon a riling ground above the village, 
and is one of the neateft country churches within the di ft rift. 
The fchool-houfe too was lately re-built, and equally with 
the other public buildings, does honour to the heritors of the 
parilh. The number of fcholars is 105 : Of this number, 
36 are taught reading of Englilh, 23 writing, 18 arithmetic, 
4 book-keeping, 2 mathematicks, and 22 Latin. Among 
thefe 17 boarders are included. There is an annual exami- 
nation of the fchool, which is attended by the principal per- 
fons of the parifh, and a number of the minifters and gentle- 
men of the neighbourhood. On this occafion, prizes of ufe- 
ful books are diftributed among the young people. Occafion- 
al examinations when the fcholars have no previous informa- 
tion alfo take place. Thefe methods feem well calculated to 
excite emulation, and vigorous exertion •, and the appearance 
of the fcholarsjhas hitherto done credit to their teacher. 
The falary of the mafter, is L. 100 Scots, with a free houfe 
and garden. He enjoys alfo the emoluments arifing from 
being clerk to the Seffion. The fees of the fchool are, for 
Latin 4s, Arithmetic 3s, Mathematicks 5s, writing 2s 6d, 
Englilh 2s per quarter, for perfecting in book-keeping, L. 1 : 1. 
The terms for boarding, warning and education, are L. 20 
per annum. 

Pojr. — The number of enrolled poor is 24. But about 
10 neceffitous pcrfons befides thefe, are occafionally fup- 
plied every month. The funds for fupplying the poor are 
the weekly collections at the church, the product of mort-

The average of difburfements during the laft ten years, \

an0US charita ble focieties are alfo inftituted throughout the 
panfh. The object of thefe is to affift f uch perfons in dif- 
trefs, or their widows and children, as have contributed when 
in health, a certain annual f um to the funds of that fociety 
to which they belong. They feem calculated to do much 
good, and annually difburfe confiderable fums. No beggars 
belong to this parifh ; but this want is abundantly fupplied 
from the fuburbs of Glafgow. Were the laws againft va- 
grants put in execution, and were every parifh obliged to 
maintain its own poor, the real objeds of charity would be 
much better provided than they are, and much idlenefs and 
worthleffnefs would be prevented. The money given to va- 
grants is often not a relief to the poor, but an encourage- 
ment to vice ; whereas, when the poor are confined to their 
ewn parifh, which is obliged by law to maintain them, our 
charity is beftowed only upon proper objeas, with whofe 
cafe we are acquainted, and in whom we are more in- 
tereftcd. The money given to vagrants diminifhes, befides, 
our ability to relieve the truly necefiitous^ If a perfon can 
fpare ten pounds each year to the indigent, and gives one 
half of this to vagrants, he takes five pounds from the funds 
of the miferable ; and by means of it perhaps encourages 
idlenefs, drunkenefs, and debauchery. 

The Seffion meets regularly on the firft monday of every 
month. The whole difburfements are examined annually, 
at a meeting compofed jointly of the heritors and the Seffion ; 
a practice which is fatisfactory to the minds of all parties, 
and by which any fubject which feems to be of importance 
to the interefts of the parifh, can be confidered with advan- 
tage and effect.

Parijlj Records.— The ftcords of Seflion extend back to- the 
year 1689. They contain, frequently, cireumftances which 
mark the peculiar manners of former times. In the earlier 
periods, the meetings of Seflion were feldom held. The 
good morals which prevailed, it is prefumed, rendered fre- 
quent meetings unneceflary. This is the more remarkable, 
when it is confidered that every fpecies of vice, and even of 
impropriety, were fubjedts of cognizance. Sometimes too, 
we find their attention directed to objects which will appear 
to the pre fen t age, of a lingular kind. A woman is delated 
for ufing charms at Hallow-even •, who, to ufe the words of 
the record, confefles, " That at the inftigation of an old 
" woman from Ireland, fhe brought in a pint of water from 
" a well which brides and burials pafs over, and dipt her 
" fhirt into it, and hung it before the Are ; that {he either 
" dreamed, or elfe there came fomething and turned about 
" the chair on which her fhirt was, but {he could not well fee 
" what it was." Upon this, fhe was ordered to be rebuked 
before the congregation. Let not the wifdom of our fathers 
however be treated on fuch accounts lightly. The innocence 
or guilt of all actions depends much upon the views which 
governed the aclor. What may be now mere amufement, 
when it was performed under the belief of incantation, and 
with a view to the agency of evil fpirits, was a proper fub- 
ject of animadverfion to thofe whofe duty it was to watch 
over the moral and religious conduct of the people. In dif- 
ferent meetings of Seflion, and among the elders, are to be 
found the names of Lord Pollok, one of the Senators of the 
College of Juflice, and his nephew and heir Sir John Max- 
well ; and, it is related of them, that they conceived it to be 
their honour, as well as their duty, to l'upport in that fiatifh 
over which they had influence, the paufe of religion, ?nd her 
conftant attendants, decency, order, and true happinefs. 

Vol. XVIII. D d ' The 



210 Statiflical Account 

The ancient family of Nether-pollok has been long the prin- 
cipal family in this parifli. It has in its poffeffion feveral origi- 
nal papers of confiderable antiquity, which deferve attention. 
Among thefe, the chief which the writer of this account has had 
an opportunity of obferving, are the following: A precept from 
the Lords of Council of King James V. to meet his Queen 
when (he came firft to Scotland, dated 1527; a letter 
from Q^Mary Regent, 1559; a letter from Morton and 
others, anent the murder of the King, 1567; a letter from 
Q^Mary, before the battle of Langfide ; a letter from King 
James for an hackney to the Queen, 1590; another for pro- 
vifion to the Prince's baptifm, in 1594; and the original, 
with the fubferiptions of the firft folemn league, figned by 
the King and Council, 1587. The letter from King James, 
for provifion to the Prince's baptifm, is a great curiofity, and 
deferves to be made public, as affording a lingular picture of 
the times. The original of the folemn league, is written 
with great diftinctnefs and beauty, in a character refembling 
Italic print ; and can be read with as much facility, as the 
molt modern writing. The folemn league was at firft a 
deed dictated by wifdom, and a juft zeal for our deareft in- 
terefts ; but the peculiarities of a party which were after- 
wards affociated with it, and which by many, are confidered 
as having belonged to the original tranfaction, have brought 
it into difrepute. 

There have been five minifters in this parifh, befides the 
prefent incumbent, fince the Revolution. It is lingular that 
two of thefe, namely, Mr Crawford, and Mr Wodrow, 
have written hiftories of the Church of Scotland. The hif-

the antiquities of Scotland. He had made a large collection 
of pamphlets and manufcripts. He wrote a great deal ; and 
particularly employed himfelf during the laft years of his life, 
in writing the lives of the principal learned men of Scotland, 
whether gentlemen, minifters, or bifhops 5 who lived before 
the period at which his hiftory commences. Some of his 
manufcripts with the materials relating to them, are now in 
the library of the faculty of Advocates. Some of them arc 
in the repofitories of the Church ; and fome part of them, 
his biography in particular, is ftill in the hands of his defcen- 
dants. He was among the firft who attended to natural hif- 
tory in this country; and he left behind him a fmall mufeum 
of foffils, chiefly collected from his own parifh, and alfo a 
collection of medals. The church hiftory of Mr Crawford 
has never been publifhed, and therefore the writer of this 
account has been at pains to procure fome information re- 
fpecling it. The manufcript is in the poffeffion of the 
church. It confifts of two volumes folio, containing up- 
wards of 1400 pages. Prefixed to the hiftory is a fhort life 
of the author. From this life it appears, that he was a native 
of Greenock ; that he obtained the degree of A. M. in the 
College of Edinburgh, and that by the patronage of Mr John 
Carftairs, one of the minifters of Glafgow, he was fent to 
Utrecht. There he ftudied two years, wrote feveral treatifes, 
chiefly controverfial, and maintained fome public difputations. 
In the year 1671, he was licenfed at Glafgow, to preach the 
Gofpel, by a meeting of Clergymen, held for the pur- 
pofe in a fecret manner, in order to avoid the penalties de- 
nounced at that time againft the prefhyterian non-confor- 
mifts. In 1 67 1 he was, with the confent of Sir John Max-

to aflemble in the lioufe of his patron. Though frequently 
fearched for, he had the good fortune to efcape falling into 
the hands of his perfecutors; but his patron was fubjected to 
fevere diftreffes, on account of the protection which he afford- 
ed him. After the acceffion of King William j he bore a 
principal part in arranging and fettling the affairs of the 
church. His hiftory commences with the introduction of 
Chriftianity into Scotland, and ends at the year 1680. He 
appears to defcribe at great length, the occurrences both civil 
and ecclefiaftical, which took plaqe in the reigns of Charles I. 
and II. The wars which the fir ft carried on again ft his par- 
liament, and the perfecution with which the laft fo long 
haraffed the Prefbyterians, compofe a great part of the fecond 
volume. I mail take the liberty of tranfcribing the two 
following paffages from his book. c About the end of

" a great time ; after which enfued the plague, and the Dutch

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010328">KILSYTH</name> 

(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 

X 

By the Rev. Mr Robert Rennie.</head>

<p>

rip HIS parifh confifts of two baronies, the eaft and the 
-■- weft. The former for many ages has been called 
Monaebrugh. The latter Kilfyth ; but till the year 1649, lt 
belonged to the parifh of Campfie. 

Origin of the Names. — The etymology of the names is un- 
certain. It feems even dubious whether they are of Latin or 
Gaelic original. If the name Kilfyth be derived from the La- 
tin, it may perhaps have been a compound of ce/Ia, a church, 
chapel, or burying ground, and Ceta, a Romifh faint. And 
it was certain that there was a chapel in that diftrict ; for 
though it is now rafed to the foundation, the place ft III bears 
the name of Chape Igreen, being the fite of a fchool. 

If the name be of Gaelic original, it is moft probably de-. 
rived from cuil a cell or burying ground, and fcoth, peace. 
This derivation is equally plaufible as the other. For near 
Chapelgrcen, which is almoft in the centre of the weft baro-

ny, there was formerly a tumulus or cairn of ftones. That 
this tumulus was a burying ground or funeral pile, is certain j 
for an urn and afhes were fome time ago found in it. And 
there is a faint tradition, that it was erected over the dead, 
flain in a memorable battle, fought between the natives and 
the Romans ; which was the forerunner of a peace. It is but 
jufl-ice to fay, however, that the fame tradition bears, that 
the natives were furprized unarmed, and therefore, had re- 
courfe to the firft offenfive weapon that offered, which was 
their fcyths or ftckles. And from this circumftance, it is faid, 
the diftri£t derived its name. 

The etymology of Monaebrugh, is as uncertain. Gentle- 
men acquainted with the Gaelic fuppofe it to be a compound 
of monaugh, hilly, and ebroch, a place full of rivulets. And it 
mull be acknowledged, that this is defcriptive of the general 
appearance of that diftridT:. For it con fids of an endlefs fuc- 
ceflion of hill and dale, from one end to the other, and it is 
interfered by a great variety of rills. 

Others have fuppofed it to be of Latin original. If fo, it is 
perhaps a compound of mono, a monk, and Ebroch, the name 
of a fmall rivulet which runs through this diftrict. And in 
confirmation of this, there is a tradition in this parifh, that a 
certain faint, whofe name is not recorded, had a hermitage in 
a fequeftered glen upon this very rivulet. 

Situation. — The whole parifh is fituated in the county of 
Stirling. But it is the fouthermqit extremity of it. The 
form of it is an irregular oblong fquare, running in length 
along the great high way, leading from Edinburgh to Glaf^ 
gowj 7 miles. The breadth is nearly one half of its length. 
Of^ourfe, it contains nearly 24 miles fquare, or about 15000 
acres. The rivers Carron on the north, and Kelvin on the 
fouth, Inchwood burn on the weft, and the Bulh burn on the 

eait,

eaft, form the natural boundaries of the parifli ; and it Ii 
contiguous to Denny on the eaft, and Campfie on the weft, 
to Fintry and St. Ninians on the north, and Kirkintulloch 
and Cumbernauld on the fouth. I never faw a feparate map 
of the whole/ But there is a very elegant beautiful and cor- 
rea plan of the eftate of Kilfyth, in the poffeffion of the pro- 
prietor. And in the map of Stirlingfhire, in Atlas Blaviana, 
there is a very minute and pretty accurate delineation of this 
pnrifii. 

The general appearance of the whole to a ftranger is ra- 
ther bare and bleak. A child may number the trees ; but 
there are a few fraall copfe woods. The eaft barony has 
very much the appearance of a highland diftricl: or ftrath. 
Even the weft is very uneven in its furface, and much in 
want of planting and proper inclofures. There is not a 
flrip of planting in the parifli. It forms altogether an ex- 1 
tended ftrath between two lines of hills ; in fo much, that 
at one point, it feems to be part of a great ditch, interfering 
the kingdom, terminating at the Frith of Forth on the eaft, 
and Clyde on the weft ; being at nearly equal diftances 
from either. It fends feveral ftreams to both. For near 
the centre of the parifli is the fummit or higheft part of 
the whole ftrath, from whence ifTues the Kelvin, running weft, 
and A.uchencloch burn running eaft. The Dullatur bog, 
through which they both run, is almoft on a level with the 
water in the great canal, which cuts it into almoft equal parts. 
And the canal is at that place 160 feet above the level of 
the Forth, at Grangemouth. 

Though the furface of this parifli is rough, broken, and 
uneven, being almoft an uninterrupted fucceffion of hill and 
dale, yet we have no mountains of any note. The higheft 
form a part of that ridge which rifes at Greenock, runs 
through Kilpatrick, Baldernock, Campfie, Kilfyth, and 
2 Denny, 



of Kilfyth.

Denny, and thus interfe&amp;s the whole kingdom. To us they 
feem to rife to a confiderable heighth, and to form a natural 
fhelter from the northern blaft ; but none of them are more 
than 1200 feet above the level of the valley, or 1368 above 
the fea. From the fummit of the higheft there is one of 
the mod extenfive, beautiful, and variegated views in Scot- 
land. 

The firft thing that arrefts the attention, is the amazing ex- 
tent of profpecl that opens all around. At leaft part of 14, 
if not 16 counties, and perhaps one half of Scotland, is un- 
der the eye at one glance. Though not nearly fo beautiful 
and variegated as that from the top of Benlomond, the view 
is richer, and more extenfive. For, being nearly at equal 
diftances from the Atlantic and the German oceans, the 
whole extent of the Ifland from eaft to weft is viewed at once. 
Towards the fouth and north, the profpeft is ftill more ex- 
tenfive. At a moderate calculation, the area of the whole 
may be 12000 miles. 

The ftriking contrail between the Highlands and Lowlands 
is the next thing that attracts the attention. If you turn your 
eye fouthward from the Frith of Forth to Clyde, and from 
Pentland and Galloway to the Ochils and Kilpatrick hills, the 
whole feems one extended fertile plain ; or rather, like a 
beautiful garden fheltered on all hands by the furrounding 
mountains, and divided into numberlefs beautiful inclofures, 
like the compaftments of a flower garden. 

Nothing can poffibly be a more ftriking contrail to this, 
than the profpeft to the north. For 70 or 80 miles, it ap- 
pears to be an endlefs fucceflion of hill upon hill, overtopping 
one another till they are loft in the diftance of the profpeft, 
and blended with the blue clouds or azure Iky. In a foggy 
day, or frofty morning, the profpea is truly piclurefque. 
Befog raife.d entirely above the fog, the whole plain to the

21 8 Statljlical Account 

fouth appears like the fea in a calm ; while the hills on the 
north feem to raife like iflands out of the main, or like the 
tumultuous waves of the ocean in a ftorm. 

Though there is fcarcely a peep between any of the hills to 
the north, yet there is an infinite variety of fcenery of every 
kind to the fouth. The friths of Forth and Clyde, with the 
iflands they contain ; a vaft variety of lakes and rivers, woods 
and wilds, with innumerable rich corn fields and inclofures ; 
the great canal, and villages, towns, cities, and (hires, add 
beauty, variety, and grandeur to the whole. 

So/7. — Where there is fuch an uneven furface, there mufl 
of courfe be a great variety of i foil. In general a light fandy 
or gravelly bottom is moft prevalent ; excepting in the rich, 
beautiful, and extenfive valley weft of the town. It confifts 
of a rich loamy fertile foil, from 2 to 2f feet thick ; and con- 
tains upwards of 600 acres. The weft barony is upon the 
whole the richeft; approaching often to clay : the eaft is more 
gravelly. In fome places the furface is almoft entirely covered 
with fmall ftones, from the quarter of a pound to two or three 
pounds weight. Thefe, however, are not fuppofed to be inju- 
rious, but rather an advantage to the foil. They are faid to pre- 
vent the ground from heaving and calling the feed in fpring, — 
to ihelter the tender blade in fummer. They are fuppofed like- 
wife to prevent the fcorching rays of the fun from withering 
the corns,— to retain the moifture in great drought ; and, by 
retaining alfo the heat all the fummer night, to promote ve- 
getation. Perhaps the principal advantage is generally over- 
looked ; which is, that they throw off a kind of laminous 
rind or fliell, like the coats of an onion, which, being mixed 
with calcareous earth, moulders down and meliorates the 
grounds. The fandy foil which prevails here, though light 
and fhaUow, is generally produdive ; alw.-ys eafily cultivated, 
~ and

and-fufceptible of much improvement at a moderate expence. 
Being naturally dry, it fuits beft with a wet fummer ; and 
would almoft require a fhower every day. 

Climate.— Oi courfe, it is very well adapted to our climate, 
which is rather watery. As we lie along that line of hills 
which reaches the Atlantic on the weft, we are expofed to 
frequent heavy fhowers from that quarter ; efpecially when 
the wind is wefterly, which it generally is for nine months in 
the year. The hills at Greenock attract the clouds that rife 
from the Weftern Ocean. And, if the wind is high, it con- 
veys them along the whole line of hills. If there is only a 
gentle breeze, which veers a little to the N. W. the clouds 
follow the line of the Clyde, and leave that of the hills at 
Dumbarton or Kilpatrick. This, of courfe, is the point to 
which the hufbandman, in hay time and harveft, looks with 
eager fufpence : And it is a kind of barometer which feldom 
fails. For, if the clouds leave the hills at Kilpatrick, and fol- 
low the line of the Clyde, we may reft allured, that we {hall 
efcape the fhower; but we can fcldom efcape, when the clouds 
follow the direction of the hills. 

But though the climate is in a certain degree moid, it is far 
from being unhealthy. The^air is in general pure and falu- 
brious •, perhaps more fo than either near the eaft or weft coaft. 
For as we lie at an equal diftance from both, we are of courfe 
free from the peculiar inconveniences of either. We are feldom 
vifited with the fogs which prevail in the eaft ; and are not 
expofed to the almoft inceffant rains, which predominate in 
the weft. The fogs feldom rife fo high ; and the clouds are 
often expended before they reach us. Hence, in fummer and 
harveft the fky with us is often clear and ferene ; when at 
Greenock it is cloudy, dark, and lowring, and on the frith of 
Forth thick and foggy ; as may be feen at a diftance fro.m our 

hills 



220 Statiftical Account 



hills ; and this too not for a day or two occafionally, or in a 
fcwinftances, but frequently, and for confiderable periods of 



Rivers.-Thz rivers in this diflria are not very remark- 
able. The Carron, both for fize and claffic fame, claims our 
firft attention. It is, as its name denotes, a winding Jlream ; 
efpecially in as far as it is the boundary of this parifh. The 
bonny links of Carron -water are well known, and well deferve 
the appellation. For upwards of 3 Englifh miles, that- river 
runs, in a flow ferpentine courfe, through one of the fined, 
richeft, and mod extenfive meadows perhaps in Great Bri- 
tain. I fuppofe it may contain near a thoufand ScottHb acres. 
In fummer, during the hay-making, it prefents one of the 
gayeft and grandeft fcenes of the kind to be feen any where. 

The next in order is the Kelvin. It takes its rife near the 
centre of this parifh ; and it runs weftward through the val- 
ley, in a flow, oozing, ferpentine courfe, upwards of four 
Englifh miles within this parifh. Hence, it was formerly al- 
ways gorged up at every turn the river took, and overgrown 
with flags, rufhes, and water-lillies ; fo that it frequently 
overflowed the adjacent valley, giving it the appearance of a 
great lake, or confiderable arm of the fea. By this means, 
the hay in fummer, and the corn in harveft, were often 
flooded ; and all the lands that lay within water mark were 
greatly injured. 

About three years ago, Sir Archibald Edmonftone, Bart, of 
Duntreath, who is proprietor of the lands on the north of the 
river for upwards of 4 miles, propofed to the heritors on the 
fouth, to have a new cut made, as wide and deep as to con- 
tain all the waters ; and as nearly in a ftraight line as the fitua- 
tion of the grounds, and the courfe of the river, would allow. 
Fully fenfible of the advantages of this undertaking, and eager 



to

to promote and encourage it, he generoufly offered to be at 
two thirds of the whole expence; although, in juftice, it 
could only have been expected that the one half fhould have 
fallen to him. Yet, at firft, only a few of the numerous heri- 
tors on the fouth, accepted even of thefe advantageous terms ; 
fo that, for the firft fummer after the contract was made, there 
was only a mile and three quarters of the new cut formed. 

The advantages even of this partial improvement were 
foon experienced. The river, in place of oozing through a 
muddy crooked courfe, at the rate of a quarter of a mile in 
the hour, runs within the fame time, with a fteady equable 
and full current of two miles ; and eafily difcharges all the 
water, without the leaft danger of overflowing its banks. 

Even though this had been the advantage, it would have 
been more than fufficient to compenfate the proprietors for 
the expence of the work. But this, though a great is one of 
the leaft of the advantages they now reap. Formerly the val- 
ley on both fides, being nearly on a level with the furface of 
the river, even when there was no flood, was of courfe, 
gorged with water ; fo that the meadows were almoft impaf- 
fable for cattle at any time. Even part of the arable lands 
was often almoft in the fame Hate ; and was of confequence 
unproductive, unlefs in very dry feafons. At all times, the 
crops of hay and corn, before they could be prepared for the 
ftack or the barn, were dragged from the fields to a dryer 
fituation, with prodigious labour, and confiderable expence ; 
and what was of as much confequence, with great lofs of 
time. Now it is otherwife, the cattle have accefs to the 
meadows at all times. Even in winter, when they were for- 
merly like one continued lake, they are now fit for pafture. 
And in fummer, the hay may be made where it grows, and 
waggons drive along the grounds which were formerly a 
mom/si As there is a fall of about iS feet in the courfe of 

the

the whole new cut, and as it is generally four, though in 
many places fix feet below the furface of the adjacent grounds, 
it ferves as a general drain to the whole valley. So that every 
furrow which was formerly a little water ditch, and. every 
ditch which was formerly gorged up to the brink, is, or may 
be eafily drained ; by this means, 300 acres of meadow may 
be turned into arable land ; 60 acres of mofs into meadow, 
and 500 acres of the fined arable land in the parifh, may be 
rendered of double value, in the courfe of a few years; and 
that too, at very little expence. 

Thefe advantages were feen by all the moment the^ firfl 
part of the cut was finilhed. So that it was an eafy matter 
to procure the concurrence of all the heritors of the fouth, 
for extending it nearly two miles farther, the following fum- 
mer ; and that too, upon more equal terms. Of courfe, the 
advantages arrifing from the work were extended in pro- 
portion. , 

The plan was formed, and executed under the inflection 
of Mr Robert Whkworth Engineer. And like all his other 
undertakings in this country, gave great and general fitisfac- 
tion. To prevent all difputes, and if poffible any law fuit, 
two arbiters were mutually chofen by the heritors on the 
fouth and north, to mark out the line of the new cut, in 
confiftency with the plan propofed, to judge of and determine 
any difference, and to afcertain the comparative value of any 
little parcel of ground that fell to be exchanged, or to be 
fold. 

The dimenflon* of the cut are various, in proportion to 
the quantity of water it receives. For a mile at the top, 
where there is only a Email river, it is only from 18 to 20 
feet wide at the furface, by ic or 12 at the bottom. But as 
it receives new acce ffions of water, it was proportionally en- 
larged. So that t,he fecond mile, it is 22 or 24 at the top, 

* bv 



of Kilfylh 22 3 

U | i or 1 6 at the bottom. And the loweft and remaining 
part of it, is 28 by 16 or 18. Of courfe, the whole cat is 
of a regular form, floping gradually on each fide, and happi- 
ly proportioned to the quantity of water it is meant to dis- 
charge. 

The expence of the whole was not above L. 6oo Iterling; 
a fum which is indeed very inconfiderable, when compared 
with the advantages of the work. The fame contraftor un- 
dertook both parts of the cut, but at different prices. The 
firft'part he engaged to cut for 2d a cubic yard. But ill 
that cafe, he was not bound to form the banks into a regular 
floping ridge, but only to lay down the earth regularly, at 
leaft a yard diftant from the edge of the cut. And it was 
underftood, that each tenant or proprietor, would at his 
leifure, and at very fmall expence-, form it into a regular 
bank. As this was negleded by many, it was therefore 
judged moft advifeable, to contrad not only for cutting the 
remaining part, but for forming the banks. Of courfe, ftff 
the cubic yard was offered, and accepted : and as the 
whole courfe was either a fine rich folid mould, from two to 
three feet deep, or a 11 iff clay mixed with rriofs, it was found 
to be a reafonable allowance. The bank on either fide is 
three feet from the edge of the cut, and for the moft part 
upwards of .three feet high. And as they Hope equally both 
ways like a ridge, they may be ploughed at pleafure, or 
fown with grafs-feeds. If at any future period it Ihould be 
neceffary, they may eafily be railed a foot or two feet higher 
at the fummit; leaving a water courfe, of from 30 to 40 feet 
wide, from bank to bank, fo as to contain double the quan- 
tity of wacer. For one foot at top would nearly contain as 
much as four at bottom. 

It may be worthy of obfervation, that as foon as I he work 
was contracted for, numbers from England and Ireland, as 

well

224 Statijlical Account 

well as Scotland, flocked to it. So that it was fi„; med „ 
the courfe of a few months. The Scotch and Irifh for the 
molt part, ufed the fpade and wheel-barrow 5 and by their 
amazmg perf.verance, working from fun rife, till fun fet 
they made great wages, and greatly expedited the work! 
But in wet weather they were much retarded. The planks 
became fhppery, their fpades and wheel-barrows were all clot- 
ted over with mud and clay, fo as to become very cumber- 
fome. Though they excelled the Englifh at other times, by 
their perfeverance, they were in wet weather far behind. 
For the Englifh feldom or never ufed the barrow; but only 
a light narrow fpade, about 18 inches long, and 6 inches 
wide ; and fcooped or hollowed out in the mouth. With 
this they threw out wedges of earth and clay, from the 
deepeft part of the cut, over their fhoulder, with the greateft 
eafe and expedition, to the diftance of 6 or io yards. This 
appeared to me a fimple, fafe, and very expeditious method ; 
and peculiarly adapted to fuch a work, in fuch a foil. 

The whole cut has now the appearance of a fmall canal. 
And if the banks were planted with willows, or even one 
hedge row of them, they would foon adorn the whole plain ; 
and become a valuable article to the proprietors. 

Excepting thefe two rivers, there are none elfe in this 
parifh ; though there is a variety of rills, rivulets and burns. 
The moft remarkable of the/e is the Garrel burn. This, as 
its name denotes, is a rough, rapid, turbulent Jtream. Its 
whole courfe is in this parifh, and does not exceed 4 miles. 
Yet in a mile and a half, it falls nearly icoo feet. So that 
there is a great number of cataracts, and water falls in its 
courfe. But though very romantic, and even awful in 
times of a great flood, yet as none of them are above 50 feet 
perpendicular, they are not very Jiltinguiflied. 

This 



of Kilfyth. *H 

This burn formerly poured all its dream into the Kelvin ; 
after running clofe by the north fide of the town. But about 
2 c years ago, it was carried off by the canal company, by a 
frnall canal, about a quarter of a mile above the town, into a 
large refervoir about a mile to the eaft. 

The remaining burns are frnall in comparifon with this. 
And they are only diftinguifhed by the great number and va- 
riety of water falls, and milns ereded upon them. 

The Inchwood burn is the boundary of this parifh on the 
weft. Next to that, is the Quinzie burn, on which there is 
a lint and a corn aula. On the Garrel burn, there is a ful- 
lers miln, a lint and a buffing, a meal and a barley miln. 

In the eaft barony there is Shaw-end burn; on which 
there is a threfhing miln near its fource, and a lint and buf- 
fing, a barley, a corn, and a fnuff miln farther down, and 
below the great refervoir. Near the eaftern extremity of the 
parifh, is Auchincloch burn ; on which there is in the courfe 
of 60 yards, three lint milns, three buffing milns, and a 
corn miln ; and all of them, are well fupplied with water. 

Bridges.— It is almoft unneceffary to fay, that along the 
courfe of the great high road to Glafgow, there are bridges 
acrofs all thofe rivulets. On Inchwood-burn, at Inchwood ; 
on Quinzie burn, at a farm houfe of that name on Garrei 
burn, at the town of Kilfyth; on Shaw-end-burn, at Shaw-

thrown over the feveral rivulets that crofs it ; which fcarcely 
deferve to be mentioned. But the bridge of Carron over that 
river ; and of Auchinftenie over the Kelvin, are the largeft, 
and by much the moft remarkable within the parifh. The

and it has fomething of the air of antiquity about it. Per- 
haps it is not unlike fome of the Roman aqueducts. 

For this reafon, feveral diftinguilhed antiquarians of rank 
and literature have fuppofed it to be a Roman bridge. As 
far as I could learn, they have been difpofed to be of this 
opinion, principally, becaufe it is within half a mile of the 
great Roman wall, precifely at an equal diftance from the 
call and weft end of it, acrofs the valley, which was the 
boundary of their dominions; and at the only narrow place 
over which a bridge could conveniently be thrown; at lead 
if that valley, as was fuppofed, was at that time either an 
extended lake or impaflable morafs. 

Befides thefe extrinfic circumftances, the bridge was fup- 
pofed to bear in itfelf evident marks of its being a Roman 
antique. It was narrow, being only about 9 feet wide ; it 
had no edges, at leaft, none above 4 inches high ; and above 
all, it had a femita or foot path, of hewn ftone, about 10 
inches wide on either fide. 

But all thefe circumftances put together, though in the 
eyes of an antiquarian they may feem to amount nearly to 
demonftration, mull give way to ftubborn facts. 

In cutting the courfe of the Kelvin, not 20 yards below 
this bridge, there was found the remains of a paved ford or 
caufeway, built together with wood, which was ftill entire ; 
a few horfes fhoes, and pieces of iron were found in it. 
This revived the general fufpicion, that the bridge was not fo 
old as was fuppofed; and a tradition that about 100 years 
ago a man and horfe perilhed in pafiing this ford. But 
what put the matter beyond the poflibility of a doubt, and 
confirms the above tradition is, that among the late Lord 
Kilfyth's old papers, of which I {hall have occafion to fpeak 
afterwards, I find that his Lordfhip made application to the 
quarter Sefiions at Stirling, in the year 1670, for money to

crea a bridge ac'rofs the Kelvin, at Auchinfterrie. In thefe 
papers the precife fum is ftated, the name of the mafon who 
built the bridge, is likewife mentioned ; and there are people 
alive, who recolleft to have feen a (tone on the weft edge of 
the bridge, with the above date upon it. 

Lakes, feV.— There are no natural lakes in this parifh. 
But the great refervoir above mentioned, is perhaps one of 
the largeft and moft beautiful artificial meets of water in the 
kingdom. It is of an oval form, fully three quarters of a 
mile long, and fomewhat lefs than half a mile in breadth ; and 
it covers upwards of 70 acres. The country around it is 
rugged and uneven, and gives the whole a romantic air. A 
few firs are planted at the eaft end, and in an ifland near 
the weft end of the lake. They thrive very well, and add 
variety and beauty to the whole. The expence of this work 
was very inconfiderable, in comparifon of the furface and 
quantity of water it contains. It was originally an extenfive 
hollow, as if fcooped out for the purpofe, by the hand of 
nature. At one place only, there was a deep opening, 
about 100 feet wide at the bottom, and 200 yards at the 
top. By filling this up to the heighth of about 25 feet, the 
work was at once completed. And by leaving a fluice in 
the centre, it can be filled or emptied at pleafure. The 
whole is finifhed in a mafterly and ingenious manner. 

This lake abounds with fifh : and, if it were not occafion- 
ally let out in the drought of fummer to fupply the great ca- 
nal, it would furnifh abundance of perch and trout at all 
times, and of the very beft quality. The lade that runs from 
it, and communicates with the canal, is one of the beft 
Itreams for trouting in the parifh : but it is only a ftream ; 
and therefore not to be compared with the river Carron. 
This, in its whole extent, from its rife till it reaches the. 

F f 2 Forth, 



22 ^ Statijlical Account 

Forth, is one of the fined rivers in Scotland, The quantity 
quahtv, and fi 2e of the trout,~the endlefs variety of pools' 
and ftream S ,- a nd the opennefs of its banks, all concur in 
rendering it the favourite retreat of the angler : In fo much, 
that people of all ranks, and from a confidcrable diftance, re- 
fort to it in the fitting feafon , and there is fcarcely a peafant 
or (hepherd on its banks, who is not eager in purfuit of this 
amufement, and eminent in the art. Where the river is 
rap.d and turbulent, and of a dear channelly bottom, the fifces 
are fmaller and whiter after being drefled : but in the larger 
and deeper pools, efpecially as far as it is the boundary of 
this panfh, where it is for the moft part a large, deep, wind- 
ing river, they are redder when drefled, and darker when 
caught, and much larger in fize. ] have feen them two, three, 
and even four pounds weight ; and from 1 8 to 24 inches long, 
and full grown '*.

* There is a tradition, that fifli were ranch, more abundant 50 or 100 years 
ago than now. It is even faid, that before the Partick miln-dam was eretted 
over the Kelvin, falmon in fpawning time came up as far as Kilfjth, and 
were to be found in every pool. It is certain that none have been found 
fince. 

The reafons why the fmall fifh are lefs abundant, may be, 

ifl, That there is much more lime ufed as manure than formerly : And 

it is allowed that the lees of lime are defhuctive both to the fifh and their 

/pawn. 

adly, There is much more flax raifed. Being watered in the rills and 
rivulets, it pollutes the ftreams, and renders the water noxious to all, and fatal 
to many. 

3My, Drag-nets and pock-nets, i. e. nets in the form of a bag, are often 
ufed, though contrary to law : all the larger fifh are by that means des- 
troyed.

vras cut and {heightened, furnifhed a confiderable quantity 
of fine trout. The pools were numerous and large. But, 
being a muddy flow running river, it became a harbour for 
pikes : This voracious animal preyed upon the fmall fifh. 
But now, that the courfe of the river is open and clear, and 
free of pools, the trout muft in time become more abundant ; 
whereas the pike can find little or no harbour. 

The great canal, in all likelihood, will prove a very ample 
fource of fupply for all kinds of fifh that delight in a ftagnant 
muddy water. Perch, pike, and brozes, already abound. 
The fit ft, though numberlefs, and caught even by children 
with the greateft eafe, are as yet for the rnoft part very fmall. 
They feldom exceed 6 inches, though I have feen them a foot 
long. The pike aTe both abundant and fully grown : fome- 
times they are from 10 to 20 lib. weight ; but for the moft 
part from one to four. They are generally caught by lines 
baited ; feldom or never with the rod and fly : and it is 
only the amufement of children to catch them, the true 
angler feldom thinks it worthy of his attention. 

Springs.— There is perhaps no diflricl: where there is 
a greater variety and abundance of fprings. Along the whole 
brow of the hills they abound ; and they are equally remark- 
able for the quantity and quality of the water they fend forih. 
There is one or two fo copious, that during the heat of fum- 
mer they will each fill a pipe of 3, perhaps 4 inches diameter-; 
and the water of almoft all of them is as pure as cryftal. Twa 
have been confecrated to their tutelar faints, and ftill bear 
their refpedive names; the one is called St. Tartan's, per-' 
haps a contraftion of St. Tallertan's ; the other, which fetms 
to have attracted the attention of our forefathers for many 
generations, is called St Mirron's. There is a third that goes 
by the name of Kittyfrift well. There is no fuperftitions ve-

neration paid, nor any virtue afcribed to the waters of any of 
them. The laft mentioned is rather regarded as noxious ; 
And the waters of it are faid to have proved fatal to the un- 
wary traveller : But this feems to be a vulgar prejudice. 
The water appears pure and falubrious ; but as it lies upon 
the hilly road to Stirling, and near the very fummit of the 
hill, perhaps fome traveller, in the fervid noon of a fum- 
mer's day, overheated with the fatigue of climbing, may 
have rafhly tailed or drunk liberally of the cooling fpring. 
This, at all events, mult have been dangerous. Perhaps, at 
one time or another, it may have proved fatal. 

There is one mineral fpring in this parifh, about a quarter 
of a mile above the town, and near the old manfion-houfe of 
Kiifyth. It feems to be a ftrong chalybeate ; and is faid to 
have been much reforted to in former times, and deemed 
medicinal in certain nervous affections of the ftomach. It is 
now fo totally neglected, that it is not eafy for a ftranger to 
diftinguifh the place where it was. I know of no chemical 
analyfis having been made of the water ; but, as it taftes and 
fmells fomewhat like rotten eggs, or the fcourings of a foul 
gun, as it makes filver black, and wood of a reddifh yellow, 
I am difpofed to think it is impregnated with a ccnfiderabls 

quantity of fulphur. In one of our lime quarries there are 

evidently fpme fprings of a petrifying quality, but none of 
any note. 

Minerals The mineralogy of the parim would fill a vo- 
lume ; and might engage the attention of the natural hiftori- 
an for a life time. As I do not pretend to be an adept in that 
icience, I fliall only give a general glance at the fubjecl. 

The firft article I fliall mention, is the iron-ftone. In 
both extremities, and near the centre of the parilh, this has 
been found ; and there are favourable appearances in a van.-

ty of other places : excepting at Banton, in the eafl: barony, 
it has not been wrought to any confiderable extent ; but ic is 
upwards of 25 years fince ic was firft wrought there by the 
Carron Company ; and it continues to be wrought to a con- 
fiderable extent, ftill furnilhing generally about 5000 tons 
every year. The number of miners has been various, but in 
general from 50 to 60 ; and as there is ftill a great field re- 
maining, it may employ as many hands, and furniih as great 
a quantity for many years to come. It confifts in general of 
feveral ftrata, from 4 to 14 inches thick ; feparated from each 
other by their feams of clay or dalk, and fubdivided by per- 
pendicular fiflures into fmall fquare wedges, from fix inches 
to two feet. 

Thefe feams are principally the property of William Cadell, 
Efq. of Carron-park ; though fome part of them belongs to 
the Carron Company. 

In the weft barony belonging to Sir Archibald Edmonfton, 
there is a very uncommon collection of ball iron ftones ; 
ihefe are of a beautiful form, and^exquifite richnefs and qua- 
lity. They are uniformly of one fliape ; refembling a round 
flat topped loaf of bread, or an apple pudding ; but they are 
of all fizes from a quarter of an inch to 12 inches dia- 
meter. 

When broken or cut afunder, they exhibit within a great 
variety of fquare partitions ; thefe are generally filled with 
white fpar, which the old foffilifts call feptaria. But I have 
feen them quite empty ; and beautifully excavated like a 
honeycomb. Being pretty hard, they receive a fine polifh ; 
and they have been wrought up by marble cutters into orna- 
ments, in-laid work, or cabinets. Some of then; are truly 
beautiful ; but their intrinfic value confifts in the fine quality 
and great quantity of iron which they contain ; they are fup- 
pofed to be the ridieft that have ever been found. The Car- 
ron

ron Company, who buy up all the iron-ftone to this parifh, 
and in almoft all this county, pay for this at the rate of 9s per 
ton delivered at their works, or on the banks of the great ca- 
nal. But this is generally allowed to be a price very inade- 
quate to its value, which is comparatively great. For the moft 
part thefe balls are found in a deep bank of blaes. They lie 
in regular ftrata, at unequal and irregular diftances. But the 
balls of each ftratum are generally of the fame fize ; towards 
the top of the bank, they aie fmaller, and larger be- 
low. Though the balls, when collected, are valuable, yet 
the quantity of blaes is fo great, in comparifon with the 
quantity of iron-ftone, and the ftrata are at fuch a diftance, 
that it never can be wrought to a great extent with much ad- 
vantage. Yet, as it lies on the courfe of a rapid burn, and 
as the blaes is foft and friable, there are confiderable quanti- 
ties of it warned down daily, but efpecially at every flood ; 
while the balls are left behind. It is in this way chiefly that 
they have been hitherto collected. 

Immediately under the bank of blaes in which this ball 
iron (lone is lodged, there is a very fine poll of lime-ftone. In 
fome places it is only 3 or 4, but for the moft part 7 or 8 feet 
thick. It is a conglomeration of fmall {hells, of all fizes, from 
an inch diameter, till they become fo fmall as to be invifible 
to the naked eye. Their form is as various as their fize : 
but for the moft part, they are long and cylindrical, and 
fomewhat like a fcrew. I believe the technical name for 
fuch is orthoceratitae. They are generally fuppofed to be 
an extraneous foffil ; for the original fhell has not yet been 
difcovered in any of the frequented feas. The greateft part 
of thefe are very fmall ; though I have feen fome an inch in 
diameter ; and 3 or 4 inches long. 

At one time, I had occafion to pick up a petrifaction 
rather of an uncommon ihape, fize, and colour. It was lod- 
ged

ged in the clay above the lime and it refembled much an 
elephant's tooth, at leaft it was of the colour of ivory, and as 
fmooth. It was precifely of the form of a large tooth or 
fmall crooked horn, about an inch and a half diameter at the 
bafe, and tapering till it terminated in a (harp point. The wa- 
ter that oozes through the fiflures of this poft of lime is clearly 
of a petrifying quality. And all thefe apertures are filled 
with clay and petrified {hells. Where this poft is thickeft, 
which is at a place called Weftfide, it has been wrought for 
fome years by mining, and has been burnt in draw kilns* 
As the roof is good, the poll generally 7 or 8 feet thick, and 
divided into fquare cubes by horizontal and perpendicular fif- 
fures, it is wrought to much advantage, at a very moderate 
expence. It may be wrought for ages, for the poft feems 
inexhauftible. And it is nearly 700 feet above the level o£ 
the valley, and muft therefore always be level free. 

As it confifts almoft entirely of fhells, it is of courfe, of 
the beft quality; and contains the greateft quantity of calca- 
reous earth, and the leaft proportion of fand of any lime per- 
haps in Scotland. Therefore the demand for it is great, and: 
increafes every year. Confiderable quantities of it have been 
fent to Glafgow, by the great canal. But the greateft part 
is employed in this parifh, and in the patifhes of KirkintuI- 
loch, Cumbernauld, and Cadder. Upwards of 1000 chal- 
ders have been fold this fummer ; though the work is proper- 
ly fpeaking, in its infancy. It is fold at fo low a rate as 8s 
the chalder, or 6d per boll, and is the cheapeft lime in this 
neighbourhood, though it is the beft. The boll is equal to 
three firlots of corn meafure. 

Below this, about a quarter of a mile, and in the courfe of 
the fame burn, there is another poft of lime. It is of a very 
free grain ; and of a dufky marble colour, capable of a fine 
polilh. But as the poft is thin, not exceeding 45 inches, 

Vol. XVIII. Gg and 



2 3 4 S tatijlical Account 

and is covered with a deep bank of blaes, from io to 30 
feet thick, and without a proper roof, it can never be min- 
ed, nor even removed without confiderable expence. 

In a variety of other places, there are favourable appear- 
ances of lime ; efpecially in the eaft barony. Near the cen- 
tre of it, at a farm called Berry-hill, there are feveral ftrata 
of lime, which have been wrought to advantage. But it is 
much more fandy, and contains lefs calcareous earth ; and is 
in every refpeft, of a coarfer quality. Yet, as there is a 
good roof, and, as it may at all times be wrought level free ; 
as it confifts of feveral ftrata, of above 6 or 8 inches thick, 
with interftices of clay about the fame thicknefs; and as it is 
divided into fmall fquare wedges by perpendicular fiffures, it 
is wrought with eafe and little expence ; feldom or never re- 
quiring the force of powder. But the road to it is fteep, 
and in bad repair ; therefore the demand for it has not been 
great, except from the immediate neighbourhood. 

I fuppofe however, that there may be at leaft 1500, if not 
1800 chalders annually thrown out from the three pofts put 
together. 

Befides thefe, which have all been turned to account, there 
is about a quarter of a mile above Weft-fide, a vein of copper, 
which was wrought about 60 or 70 years ago, by order of 
the York building company. Of this, I could not have given 
any diftin£t account ; unlefs it had been examined by the in- 
genious Mr Rafpe, in the year 1 791. As his report is very 
accurate, and now before me, I fhall ftate it in his own 
words, in the note below *'.

" as it would appear of preventing or difcouraging any further trial. For as

« it opened for me, juft wide enough for me to creep in, on all fours. ^ I

' which is north and fouth. At the forehead a (hort crofs drift appeared eaft

» the thicknefs of which remains as yet undetermined. The heavy fpar vein 

« feems here to be interrupted by it; though it may probably con- 

" tinue a good way beyond it. For it appears clearly, in the face of 

« the brae, many fathoms fouth and fouth weft, the other way : fo that there 

« is no doubt of its being a regular fpar vein of a confiderable length and 

« width. In the drift, it is about 2 feet, and in the above mentioned fouth 

« or fouth weft end, rather more than that even at the grafs."

V tendant of metals of all the veins and works which I have feen and ex- 

« amined in the Ochil hills and Highlands ;— that the vein is favourably 

" fituated in high ground, on the very edge of the. hill ; that confequently, it 

" may be undercut very deep by fhort flanking levels ; and chiefly, that 

«' in fome parts, it is thinly fprinkled with copper ore, I think it my duty, to 

«' recommend a flight trial of it, by a couple of trial pits of 3 or 4 fathoms, as 

" alfo by a couple of cofteening pits or trenches, upon and beyond the crofs 

" gofTan, or clay vein in the forehead of the old drift."

The above report is fo accurate and important-, that I truft it will not bjp

valley alfo, there are favourable appearances of a clay marie. 
But as no trial has been made of it, I cannot fpeak with cer- 
tainty, either of its quantity or qualities. 

About a quarter of a mile fouth of the town, within 30 
yards of Auchenfterrie bridge, and 100 of the great canal, 
there is a valuable and inexhauftible quarry of bafaltes. 

The whin- ftone rock is from 20 to 30 feet high ; and as 
there is very little furface upon it, it may be wrought at a 
fmall expence 5 more efpecially, as it is in many places in- 
terfered by horizontal and perpendicular fiffares, whereby 
it is cut into blocks of all different fizes. It is peculiarly 
adapted for caufeways, or paving the ftreets of any populous 
city. The ftone is folid, compaa, and durable ; yet though 
extremely hard, and therefore capable of receiving a very fine 
polifh, it is very free, andeafily formed into almoftany Grape. 
The prevailing colour of it is a Hate blue, beautifully freckled 
with little white nodules. 

The demand for this ftone has been confiderable. Several 
thoufand tons have been annually conveyed up the great ca- 
nal to Glafgow, and the neighbourhood ; and it is faid to 
be equal in quality to any ftone that has been found. Though 
at the diftance of 14 miles, as it is conveyed by water, it 
can be furnifhed at as cheap a rate, as if it were within 3 or 
4 miles of that city. 

I may add, that near the centre of this parifii, in the Gar- 
rel glen, about half a mile above the town, there is one of 
the richeft, fineft, and molt beautiful pods cf fiee-ftone in

Great Britain ; and happily it is inexhauftible. The colour 
of it is exquifite 3 for the moft part, it is a beautiful white, 
with a tinge of yellow. But fome of it is finely variegated 
with brown and yellow veins, like marble. Other parts of 
it are decorated with the moft delicate vegetable impreffions, 
as black as coal. Some of thefe are as fmall as a hair, and 
when the (tone is finely polifhed, they are a beautiful contrail 
to the reft of the mafs. I believe no free- ft one is capable 
of a finer polifh. For though it is foft and eafily wrought 
when firft brought from the quarry, it becomes daily whit- 
er and harder when expofed to the weather. It becomes 
hard, white, and of a fine confidence ; and fo durable, as to 
ftand all weather, and fuit every climate. Of courfe, it is 
equally calculated for building above or below the furface of 
the earth or water ; and for the fineft ornaments, and ftrong- 
eft and coarfeft pieces of architecture. In the erection of 
bridges, where it is expofed to the conftant attrition of the 
water, and in paving ftreets, it is particularly ufeful. Of 
courfe, it is much efteemed in Glafgow, and wherever it is 
known. Many ftreets in the New Town of Glafgow are 
paved with it ; and it has been formed into fome of the 
fineft ornaments, fuch as vafes, columns, and fretted work. 
The demand for it is great, and it is fold at a reason- 
able price. Even when delivered at Glafgow in blocks, 
it is only 2s the yard for pavement •, and there are upwards 
of 1000 tons conveyed to Glafgow by the great canal evcry 
year *. 

I am convinced if its value were known, there would be 
a greater demand for it than there is from many places of Scot- 
land,

land, but efpeeiaily from England. For if freeflows 
conveyed to London from the country north of Aberdeen 
the eaft coaft, and from Stevenfton in the county of Ayr v 
the weft, they certainly might be conveyed with equal advan 
tage from Kilfyth. The great canal palTes within lefs than a 
mile of this quarry ; and I am perfuaded, that a load of Kil- 
fyth free-ftone either roughly formed or in the block, would 
be a valuable commodity of the kind. For if fold in Lon- 
don at L. 1 : 12s. the ton, as free-ftone of inferior quality is, 
it might furnilh a very liberal freight, or as ballaft prove a 
profitable branch of trade. 

The poft is generally from 10 to 15 feet, and lies upon a 
feam of coal about as many inches thick. There are a great 
variety of coal ftalks, rifing from this feam, like trees from 
the furface of the earth. Some of them are 6, ic, or 20 fees 
long in proportion to the depth of the free-ftone j and they 
differ as much in diameter as in length, being of all fizes 
from an inch to 2 feet. Thefe are juftly efteemed by philo- 
sophers obje&amp;s of great cuiiofity. And they have fur- 
nifhed matter for much fpeculation ; they refemble exceed- 
Jy a petrifaction : and yet the fubftance is not calcarious earth, 
but folid free-ftone of fimilar texture with the circumjacent 
rock. I have in my poffeflion, one the largeft and moll beau- 
tiful that has hitherto been found. It is nearlv 16 inches in 
diameter, and 6 feet 9 inches in length, of a compact folid

folid, and mouldered down or was eafily broken when ex-

it precifely refembles the trunk of a thorn tree ; in fo much, 
that every ftranger at firfl view fuppofes it to be one. It (gems

much like the furface of a fir top. Befides thefe, there-are 
likewife longitudinal feams from end to end, refembling the 
trunk of an old yew, or thorn tree. It is unneceffary to fay, 
that the circumjacent cafe bears a fimilar impreffion, only 
reverfed. But it deferves to be mentioned, that within the 
fame trunk, and at different angles, there lie a variety of 
fmaller ones, from two to three inches diameter. Thefe are 
feldom parallel to one another, and cannot be extrafted 
without deftroying the large trunk; but when extraded, they 
{hew beautiful impreffions ; finer by much than the larger 
trunk. Thefe fometimes branch out into regular ramifica- 
tions at top, as they almoft always do at bottom ; and the 
fmaller the branch the finer and more delicate the impref- 
fions upon its furface; in fo much, that the fmalleft will 
bear and almoft require to be examined by the microfcope. 
I gave one of them lately to a gendeman, who promifed to 
fend it to Weir's mufeum. 

It is unneceffary to add, fori believe it is a common thing, 
that there are uniformly vegetable impreffions along the bafe 
of the coal and furface of the dalk or blaes. Thefe are fo 
endlefsly varied, that I cannot pretend, nor would it be pro- 
per to attempt an enumeration of them. 

Coal. — The only article that remains to be mentioned, is the 
coal. This has been wrought for ages ; and is Mill abundant, I 
trufl inexhauflible. The feams are various, and of very different 
quality. The coal in the weft barony, is one of the beft I 
ever faw. It burns clear, lafts long, gives a good heat, and 
cakes, fo that the very drofs of it is valuable ; and makes a 
better fire than moft other*coals. Happily for us this feam is 
now wrought to a confidence extent, and promifes to be a 
lafting benefit to this parifh and the neighbourhood. Robert 
.Dunmore, Efq. of Ballakiurain,. is at prsfent the tackfman

ft* he \* f M!eman of a !il ™ «** public fpirit, 
no doubt that he wi„ carry on ebe work with ZcJs 
and ,o a great extent. This fame fcam has been wrought for 
generates in different places of the weft barony , but it 
was g.ven up for many years, till lately the work was re- 
vived. 

The coal in the eaft barony, efpecially at Banton and Glen 
Oarrd 1S of an inferior quality. But for that reafon, it is 
ttfeful for a variety of purpofes which the other could not fo 
well ferve. It gives an uncommon heat, but upon being ex- 
pofed to the air, it moulders down into drofs. And when 
thrown into a chimney, it is fo brittle, that whenever it is 
touched, it turns into a powder or mere gum. But in an 
oven, or furnace, or fmith's forge, it is of great fervice : and 
is one of the beft coals for thefe purpofes in the kingdom. Of 
ccurfe, there is a great demand for it from printfields, 
and other public works, and from fmiths, for 6, 10, or 12 
miles round. 

None of thofe coals are far below the furface. Of courfe, 
they are eafily kept level free. In the weft barony, the feam 
is generally from 4 to 12, and in the eaft from 12 to 16 fathom 
deep. The ftrata in Glen Garrel, where coal has been 
wrought for 50 years without interruption, lie generally in the 
following order : 

1 ft, Soil and rubble. 

2d, A thin bed of blaes, or fometimes channel. 
3d, A poft of free-ftone, from 10 to 20 feet thick. 
4th, Indurated fhivers, blaes, or fometimes in its place 
a thin feam of conl 1 1 inchts thick. 

In the eaft end of the parifh,»at a place called Bufli, 
is the richeft and beft feam of coal ; but it is not level free, 
and therefore would require a fire engine. It has been 
■wrought to a considerable extent. I find that Lord Kilfyth, 

ordained 



vf Kiljyth. 24* 

ordered it to be opened in the year 167c. There are near- 
ly 100 coal pits that have been wrought. 

In general, the dip of all the coals is to the fouth eaft. 
But when it meets with what are called hitches, the dip alters 
in every direction. In one place at Balcaftle, the coal was found 
in the form of a trough, rifmg up in all directions. 

The manner in which they are wrought is by pick and 
wedge ; boys, and fometimes girls are employed to draw the 
ficiffies, below ground. The men enter about 4 in the 
morning, and their day's work is generally over by 2 in the 
afternoon. 

Each load may be about 2420 cubic inches. It is fold at 
7dl at the hill. Four of thefe make a tolerable cart ; if* is faid, 
they will weigh upwards of 1200 weight. 

There are generally from 8 to 12 conftantly employed as 
colliers ; each of thefe at an average, will put out 10 or 12 
loads per day : though fome can put out more. For each 
load they have 3 pence, fo that in general, they can earn 
from 2s. 6d. to 3s. a day. There may be about 120 loads, 
that is 30 carts put out daily, or about 180 carts every week. 
Allowing 50 weeks in the year, there will 'be 9900 carts, 
or 36,000 loads, annually put out. This is equal to 1 0,800,000 
hundred weight, or 871,200,000 cubic inches. At half a 
crown the cart, the fale in a year may be equal to L. 1 1 25 
lterling. But the expences attending the work are very 
confiderable ; fometimes 9 or 10 men are conftantly em- 
ployed, befides colliers : fo that the weekly expences are ge- 
nerally from L. 9 to L. 16. 

It is to be hoped, that a great deal of this will be faved. 
For there is a fmall fteam engine immediately to be fct up. 
This will eafily do the work of a number of men, and fave an 
enormous expence.

If fo, it may be expected, that the prices may fall feme- 
what; at prefent the poor find them to be very high. And 
what is furprifing, for ,00 years, that is, from 1670, 
till 1770, the coals kept nearly at the fame price, from 
3d. to 4 d. the load. Since that period, they have become 
too much an article of commerce. Speculation has run 
fo high, that they are now double the price they were 20 
years ago. It were to be wifhed, that gentlemen would con- 
fider this. 

It is fuppofed that there are many feams below the 
one that has been wrought. It feems only the cropt 
coal. But as it abounds, no attempt has been made to fearch 
deeper. 



Vegetdhlesi — The vegetables of this parifh are not very 
remarkable. Yet our fequeftered glens furnifh abundance 
of amufement for the botanift. Thofe who are verfant in 
that fcience inform me, that there are not a few of the 
rarer indigenous plants. Broom and furze abound in e- 
very inclofure. There are a few plants of the black berry 
tree. The floe tree is in almolt every glen. The haw- 
thorn, hip thorn, the wild rafp, and elder, with all the 
varieties of the bramble, are frequently to be feen. In 
every glen and copfe wood, the hazel prevails. There 
are a few crab apples to be found, fcattered up and down : 
but chiefly in the neighbourhood of the decayed and ruinous 
old orchards of the family of Kilfyth. Perhaps they may be 
the produce of feed dropt from thofe gardens, or carried by 
wild birds. There is a variety of the willow tribe, though 
no great quantity any where. The birch is one of our molt 
beautiful plants. The mountain afh, and fmall cherry tree, 
either in blo.Tom or full bearing, are both a beautiful ornament 
to our glens. The largeft tr;es arc the afh, the elm, the 
o alder,

alder, the fycamore, and oak : but they are very thinly fes- 
tered. 

The few fruit trees which we have are fometimes very 
prolific, but the produce is always precarious. There is a 
fcreat variety and very confiderable quantities of goofeberries, 
rafps, and currans. And few, if any country parifhes can 
boaa of as many flower gardens, or a more curious and com- 
plete collection of flowers. 

Animals.— The animals of this parifh are fuch as are com- 
mon over all the neighbourhood. 

Foxes, badgers, polecats, weafels, and hedgehogs, a- 
bound. A few otters and rabbits may be found alfo j and 
the hare is frequently to be feen. 

The birds of prey, are in no refpect lingular or remarkable- 
The moft common are the kite, and the hawk, and the raven- 
crow. The owl is alfo to be found. But the moft deftruc- 
tive of all, is the grey glade, or kite, as it is commonly cal- 
led. The eagle once frequented our rocks and hills, while 
paftured with fheep. But fince black cattle have come in 
their place, the eagle is never feen. Even the foxes and 
ravens, on the fame account, are not fo numerous as here- 
tofore. The moor fowl and wild duck, the partridge and 
wild pidgeon, the heron, the magpie and fkylark, are 
all to be found in their feafon. The fnipe, the fpar- 
row, the redbreaft and wood-pecker, the bat, the com- 
mon green moor, and red breafted or rofe linnet, the black- 
bird, the thrufh, the goldfinch, the chaffinch, the wren, 
&amp;c. with all the varieties of fmall birds, are common 
here. 

In winter, wild geefe in amazing flocks, to the number of 
300 or 300 at a t^me, appear in the valley. The northcock

that time, Mr Alexander Livingfrone, a near relation of the 
family of Callendar, was parfon of this parilh. The fuccef-

church, are inferted in a note ; which was chiefly taken fro

him to get a helper. It would appear, however, that he was unwilling to take

a helper to Mr LivingOone. What was the confequence of this application 
we are not told. But in the year 1597 MiLivingrtonewas depofed for inbabiiity

confertes 



of Kilfyth. $45 

Mr James Robe was admitted minifter, 24th April 1713. 
He had received a prefentation from the Vifcount of Kilfyth. 

And 

eonfeffes the charge. Perhaps he was the more ready to do fo, becaufe the 
Frefbytery at the fame meeting took Mr William LivingQone his fon on tri- 
als for the living. The reafon afligned for their doing fo, was, that he per- 
ceived himfelf to be inwardly called to the miniflry. 

' Accordingly in the year 1599, having on July 3. received a prefentation 
from Lord Livingrtone, (1 fuppofe the Earl of Callendar), he received in- 
auguration, on the i 7 th,impofition of hands, collation and confirmation. At 
this time he was a confiderable heritor in the parifh ; being proprietor of the 
lands of Monaeburgh. The boundaries of that eft ate are not well known, but 
it is certain that thegrounds upon which the village (lands were -a patt of them. 
For Sir William Livingftone of Kilfyth, one of the Lords of Seffion, piirchafed 
them from the parfon for the exprefs purpofe of extending the village, which 
flood at that time on the banks of the Ebrocb, Thofe new feus were granted 
along the Garrel Burn, which meets the Ebroch nearly oppofite the centre of 
the village; and of courfe the new town was called Burnfide. The parfon 
feems to have been a man of confiderable influence at that time, and in the year 
1604 he ufed all that influence with the greateft zeal in oppofing the reftora- 
tion of the bilhops. For which caufe, and for his nonfubmifllon to the canons 
and ceremonies, he was depofed, and by his Majefty's authority, deprived of 
his miniftry both at Monaeburgh, and alfo at Lanark. 

After this period there feems to have been a vacancy for fame years. At 
Iaft, in the £ ,year 1615, Mr Archibald Graham was admitted minuter. Soon 
after his admifllon he difpofed of a part of the glebe, though it appears that 
he did not pocket the money ; but in all likelihood allowed it to go to repair 
the church. At all events, we find that he expended a confiderable fum in 
repairing the eafter gabel, building a belfry, and purchafing a bell. This 
bell was only taken clown this fummer, and had a date upon it correfpondhg 
to this, viz. 1626. All that Mr Graham required in acknowledgement of this 
donation, was, that his name might be cut upon the vane of the belfry, and 
A- G. the initials of his name ftill remain as a memorial of his liberality. 
Mr Graham feems to have breathed much of the fpirit of his predeceflor. 
Fpr eve* in the year 1636 he had not practifed the canons and conftitutions. 
And therefore he was called before the high Commiflion Court to anfwer 
fyr his conduct, That court feems to have been much incenfed, for though 



Statifilcal Account 
And fo tenacious was his Lordfldp of his right, that neither 
n0r h,S Ui 1 w °" d a call to be moderated in his 

favour. 

a very favourabJc teflimonial was given him by the pari .doners, and even by 
the Prefbytery, he was depofed. 

The following year Mr Gabriel Cunningham was admitted. He feems 
to have been lefs fcrupulous. Taking warning from the fate of his two im- 
medrate predeceflbrs, he eonformed to epifcopacy, after the reflation. At 
the tune of Ins admiflion the ftipend of Monaeburgh was only 5 chalders of 
Tiflual.meal and barley 100 lb. Scots, and i6ftone weight of cheefe. In the 
year l6 6j the money ftipend was, however, augmented to 3 Jomerks. At the 
fame twit the manfe was confiderabiy repaired But principally at the par, 
ion's own expenre. This was the more remarkable, as he had paid 500 
merks for it to his predeceflbr. After thefe repairs, it was valued by tradef. 
men as worth 11 60 merks. His glebe, after the fale his predeceflbr had 
made of a part oi it, confided only of 7 acres or little more. In all likelihood, 
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not adminiflered in this parifh, till 
about this period. For it is recorded, that in the year 1665, communion 
table cloths, cups, and tickets, were obtained, and a bafonfor baptifm, but n» 
flaggons, nor even a church bible. The people repeated the creed, faid the 
■Lord's prayer, and fung the doxology after the pfalms. 

About this period, the village was confiderabJy increafed. A new town 
was built, not along the banks of the Ebroch or GarrelBurn as formerly, but 
on a riling ground about aco yards fouth of thofe ltreams, which at that time 
was called Moat Hill, as the Lord of the manor had been accuftomedto hold' 
courts of juflice in that place. This new town of courfe was called by the 
title of the proprietor, Kilfyth. And from that period the whole village ob- 
tained that name. Though the parifh for upwards of 40 years retained dill 
the old name Mcnaebrugh. The village about the time that this new addition 
was made, or at leaf! foon after it, being removed at fomc diftance from the 
fmall rivers, and in all likelihood ill fupplied with water, that precious article 
was brought in earthen pipes, from a neighbouring fpring about a quarter of a 
C'.ile from the town ; And a well or ciftern was made near the centre of the 
new town, which (lill bears date 1676. Since that period, other ciflerns fup- 
plied by the fame fpring, have been en died in different parts of the town, e- 
fpecially in the year 1716. 

It would appear that Mr Cunningham d'ed miniflcr of this parifh. For 
in the year 1666 Mr James Gartlhoie was, admitted to the charge. But he

favour. The prefbytery, being aiTured that the prefentee 
was acceptable to the parilh, difpenfed with that form,' and 

ordained 

did not continue in that office long. For he was tranflated to Cardrofs in the 
vsar 1673. 

' Two years after this, Mr Walter M'Gul, the laft epifcopal clergyman that 
officiated here, was admitted minifter, being tranflated from Wigton. He was 
a man of uncommon meekrefs and moderation ; and a great favourite of 
all ranks and denominations of people in the parilh ; infomuch, that when 
it was declared vacant by the Prefbytery in the year 1690, an uproar enfued. 
The patron and his lady, and a great and powerful party in the parifh efpouf- 
ed his caufe ; and when the Prefbytery met at the church, the patron fen£ 
down the chamberlain to refufe them admittance, and lock up the doors. 
The populace even offered violence to the Prefbyterian clergyman who was to 
officiate. The friends of the Prefbytery were exafperated by this ; and a fcuf- 
fle enfued, in which many were wounded, and one killed. Mr M' Gill's 
partizans at laft prevailed. And the Prefbytery themfelves feem to have 
been at a lofs what fteps next to take ; infomuch, that they defifted 
from farther procedure, and even declared that they could not take any other 
meafures. They were faon refcued from this dilemma. For in Feb. 1691 Mr 
M'Gill formally gave in hisdemifflon of the charge. When the Prefbytery 
met at this time, they called for all the books of difcipline, and regifters of 
baptifm. The latter were delivered up ; and are on the whole regular 
and diftinft from the year 1620 till that period, They are ft ill in good 
prefervation, as will appear from the extracts I make from them. When the 
clerk was ordered to deliver up the books of difcipline, he faid, they were in 
the hands of Mr M'Gill. When he was interrogated, he faid, he had left them 
in the manfe; the beadle who had charge of the manfe, being called, faid, that 
fomc perfon or other had deftroyed them. S&amp; that it would appear all the three 
were willing to have prevented them from falling into the hands of the 
Prefbytery. All the bills, bonds, and papers refpefting the poors funds 
were neverthelefs recovered, as well as the utenfils and vclTcls belonging to the 
church. 

A vacancy enfued for fome time, during winch period the Prefbytery vifited 
and ordered repairs upon the church, m.-infc, and offices, to the amount of 
L. ziz : 1 : 4 Scots. 

On the 29th of Dec. 1682, Mr James Hay, the firft pfefbyterian 
niinifter, was tranflated frum Kilmakomb, and admitted to this charge. Dur- 
ing 



■ 2 4 8 Statijlical Account 

ordained him without a call. The principal occurrences during 
his incumbency, are recorded by himfelf in his own narrative, 
and by other contemporary writers ; and it would be both un- 
ncceffary, and improper for me to enumerate them. At the 
fame time, I cannot altogether pafs in Glence, what has been 
termed, the extraordinary work at Kilfyth, Cambuflang, and 
feme other parifhes, in the year 1742 ; efpecially as there were 
even then fome who called themfelves Chriftians, fo blinded by 
prejudice, or by party zeal, as to affirm that it was a work of 
the Devil. Had they been fatisfied with reviling the honoured 
inftruments of that work, even though they did call them limbs 
of Satan, or ambafadors of hell, I fhould have only pitied rhem, 
•and been willing to bury their railing in oblivion : But they 
were fo deftitute of that charity, « which thinketh no evil, 
" which rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth 
as to perfift in afcribing to diabolical influence, the efFeds pro- 
duced among the people. I think myfelf therefore obliged to 
make fome remarks on their conduct. And therefore I cannot 
pafs their conduct in filence. 1 If there are men of the prefent 
time, who can view the fubjecl: in the fame light, I reply to 
both, in the fpirit of meeknefs, " that a kingdom divided a- 
gainft itfelf cannot Hand j" and that if their reprefentations 
, have 

ing his incumbency the church received confiderable repairs. The whole roof 
was renewed, the north aifle and the vault or burying ground under it, was like- 
wife repaired in the year 1697. And the parifh was aflelTed in the film of 
JL. 1266 113:4 Scots for that purpofe. Mr Hay being confiderably advanced 
in years before he was admitted, foon became unable to officiate. Infomuch, 
that on the ifl of July 1710, he teftified to the feflion his defire of having an 
affiftant. And in the fame day Mr James Stewart was elecled by unanimous 
confent of the minifler, feflion, and congregation to be affilrant, and that as 
long as he was pleafed to cont nue among them. In that capacity he officiated 
till the death of Mr Hay in July following. 

A coufiderable vacancy again enftied. So that for nearly three years the 
Prefbytery regularly fupplicd the charge once in the fortnight.

have beenjuftifiedby the farts, it is certain that at lead, in 
this parifh, " Satan was divided againft himfelf." 

Others, with more candour and charity, have confidered 
the remarkable circumftances to which I allude, as more the 
effca of enthuflafm, than of delufion. A great part of the 
eftablifhed church, who were not eye witneffes of what really 
happened, were of this opinion at the time \ and it is perhaps 
a common opinion ftill.. 

They have endeavoured to account for the unufual agita- 
tion and religious concern which then appeared among the 
people, by the influence of natural caufes alone. They have 
afcribed them to the influence of paffion, of hope, and fear, and 
fympathy, and example, or to all thefe caufes united. They 
have told us, that the inftruments of that work addrefled 
the paflions of men, more than their underftandings •, that 
thofe on whom the chief impreffjon was made, were almofl all 
affe&amp;ed in the fame way, and exprefled themfelves in fimilar 
language ; that the agitation of one was communicated to the 
multitude, and afted like a charm on their fympathetic 
feelings. 

This reprefentation is plaufible, but it is only plaufible. 
With the candour of a Chriftian, and the affection of a bro- 
ther, I would afk thofe who have urged it : 

1 ft, Is it poflible to preach the gofpel in its native fimplicity 
and purity, without addrefling the hopes and the fears of 
mankind ? Where thefe paflions have been addrefled, has the 
effe£t, been uniformly the fame, as at Kilfyth in 1742 ? The 
reverfe is certainly the truth, though we are all men of like 
paflions with our fathers. Why are men who are addrefled 
in the fame manner, fo much more cold, and carelefs, and 
lukewarm, than the people who were diflinguifhed at that 
time ? And why was it that under the fame minijlry and the 
fame means, the fame effects were not produced, even in 1742, 
Vol. XVIII. 1 i and 



2 5° Statijlical Account 

and the following years ? We can adopt no conclufion with 
candour or confidency, but that the remarkable circumftances 
of that time, are not to be afcribed to thofe who were the 
mftruments of producing them, or to any peculiarity in the 
means which they employed } but to the real efficacy of the 
doflnnes of Chrift, and to the power of God which accom- 
panied them. 

2dly, Let it be allowed, that all were affected in the fame 
way, and that they expreffed themfclves in the fame, or in fimi- 
lar words ; let it be granted that all fighed, and groaned, and 
cried ; though Mr Robe in his narrative, laft edition, page 
128, fays, that thofe who difcovered fuch appearances, were 
by far the feweft in number, being not one out of fix, of 
thofe who felt this religious concern. But, may not an ho- 
ned mind reafonably conclude, that the fame caufe mould 
produce fimilar effeCts ; and that the fimilarity indifferent 
perfons, indicated the operations of the fame fpirit in them all. 

3dly, The power of fympathy is undoubtedly great; no 
man denies it to be fo, who knows any thing of the human 
frame. It is not improbable that its influence was conside- 
rable on the people of that time. But he, " who has the 
* ( hearts of all men in his hands, and who turns them as the ri- 
c vers of waters whitherfoever he will," who makes the very 
" wrath of men to praife him," might or did employ, even 
this as the means of " turning many to righteoufnefs.'. But 
■whatever energy we afcribe to $ie mean?, let us not forget 
the hand which directs them to their end, or f the power 
" which worketh all in all !" without the agency of God, the 
influence of the mod powerful means is ineffectual. Nei- 
ther is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but 
God who giveth the increafe. I have no doubt that there 
were both enthufiads and hypocrites diflinguifhed in 1742. 
&amp;Ir Robe acknowledges this in his narrative, page 27 1. But

I am happy to have it in my power to fay, that there are per- 
ions yet alive in this place vho have proved by the uniform 
tenor of their lives, that they were not of the number, 
though their religious impreflions were received at that period. 
By their fruits they may ftill be known, and the efFeas of 
converfionon men*s practice is the only true tefl; and criteri- 
on by which we ought to judge. Whatever were the means, 
whether hope, or fear, or fympathy, or example, they expe- 
rienced at that period a great and important change, which 
has formed and decided their characters through life. And 
if the fabbathof the Lord, which was formerly defpifed, was 
" then held honourable ; if the ordinances of religion^ which 
" were formerly neglected, were then ftriclly obferved; if the 
" old and the young became fervent and frequent in family 
" and private prayers; if drunkennefs and licentioufnefs were

On the 2I ft March 1754, Mr John Tel fer was ordained 
minifter, he died on the 29th of March 1789. And on the 
3d of September following, the prefent incumbent was ad- 
mitted. The crown is patron ; and what is perhaps remark- 
able,therehas not been a minifter inttoducedintothepariihfince

the people. The living was augmented about three years ago, 
and now confifts of 67 bolls 3 firlots of meal, 1 1 bolls 3 firlots

ftffed by the minifter time immemorial; and is allowed to 

belong to the church. The glebe is at prefent in a 

variety of lots, of courfe not inclofed. But an excambion 
will foon take place, by which it will be thrown into one lot, 
?.nd all inclofed of courfe. The manfe was built about 8 years

and though it has lately been on the decline, it is to be hoped, 
that it will foon be equal to what it has ever been. At leaft 
the heritors of the parifh have contributed all in their power 
to make it refpeclable. They have afTefled themfelves in a 
handfome fum for building an elegant dwelling-houfe and 
ichool for the teacher ; it is nearly finilhcd. And as they

A common tradefman, if fober and attentive, is much more 
independent, and may in general earn a better livelihood than 
the loft part of parifh fchoolmafters. While this continues 
to be the cafe, few men of abilities or charader will afpire to 
the office, or rather doom themfelves to the drudgery to 
which it requires them to fubmit, with the affurance of pover- 
ty attached. If they are driven to the office by neceffity, 
they muft foon dwindle into infignificance, and by becoming 
defpicable in the eyes of the ignorant and worthlefs becaule 
poor, mud lofe their influence and their ufefumefs of confe-

ture will fee ihe impending evil, and fpeedily interpofe their 
authority to ward it off. If the falary of each parochial teacher 
were doubled, it would be only a trifle to the landed intereit, 
and a mutual benefit to the teacher and the taught. Or, if

As our burying ground is j„ much rcqueft by ftrangcrs 



as 



of Kilfyth. 255 

as well as the Inhabitants of the parifh ; that fum becomes 
often a confiderable and very feafonable fupply. 

By aa of parliament, 1597, thofe funds are entrufted to 
the Kirk Seffion ; and they never can be committed to better 
hands. Though the management is entirely a labour of love, 
and a great labour too, often attended with much obloquy, 
and feldom or never rewarded even by the grateful acknow- 
ledgement of the heritors ; yet, as it involves the intereft of 
the poor, it is regarded by every elder as a facred depofit. 
With diligence and difcretion theyconfider the cafe of the 
needy. By affociating with every clafs of people, they be- 
come acquainted with the real wants and difpofitions of the 
widow, the orphan, and the fatherlefs, the feeble, the aged 
and infirm, and fpeedily adminifter relief. Upwards of 
L. ioo.coo fter. atleaft, isentrufted to the eldersof the church 
of Scotland ; and by them diftributed with a degree of fide- 
lity and public fpirit, which reflects the higheft honour upon 
their office. Yet though the landed intereft are relieved of a 
burden, which they themfelves could not fubmit to, and 
from a duty which men of high rank could fcarcely difcharge, 
it is feldom that they will allow a Seffion houfe, or even a 
fhade for collecting for the poor; or if it be granted, it is 
often with reluctance. And yet I fuppofe, that the greateft 
part of them would fooner erect fuch a fhade at his own ex- 
pence, than fubmit to the danger and drudgery of (landing a 
whole hour, even one funday of the year, in a cold bleak 
winter day in the open air, to collect the mite which every 
worfhipper offers. 

That the funds of this parifh have been collected with 
fuch trouble, managed with fuch fidelity, and diftributed 
with fuch difcretion, as I have now hinted, will appear from 
{he following particulars. 

At 



Statijlical Account 

At the Revolution, the whole funds delivered over to the 
Seffion, amounted only to L. 19:10, fterling. The weekly 
collection at that time never exceeded isandSd; yet there 
is now in land and heritable bonds and cam, a fund near 
L. 300 fterling, for the fupport of the poor; and that too 
raifed, not by a pfcrfimonious hoarding up of the poor's funds, 
pot by withholding what was meet, or granting the needy 
only a penurious pittance, but by a prudent faithful difcharge 
of their duty, in collefting and diaributing. That the Sef- 
fion of Kilfyth, was not in life to deny the relief which was 
neceffary; and that thefe funds have been managed with 
fuch prudence and care, will appear from the following 
table.

For the la ft ten years, the average of receivings, is annu- 
ally L. 70, difburfements, L. 65. 

The table is only given as a fpecimen. In all of thofe 
years, the trcafurer gave in a dillinft account, for the precife 
term of a year. And therefore his receivings and dif- 
3 burfeir.cms, 



of Kilfyth. 257 

burfements are clearly ttated for that precife term In the 
interveenihg periods, the account was fometimes taken in 6, 
o or I? months, fo that the annual rate cannot be fo very 
accurately afcertained. But the fame proportion between the- 
receipt and difburfements holds, and therefore it is unne. 
ceffary to be more particular. But in a parifh like this, where 
moft of the heritors do not refide, and fome have feceded 
from the church, and where none of them interfere with the 
poor's funds, the above fads ought to be made known to all. 
Efpecially when it is confidered, that the above furns have 
been corded literally from the poor* or from the lower or- 
ders of the people, that is, from farmers and tradefmen, and 
the few rending heritors who attend divine fervice in the efta- 
blifhed church. Of courfe, the weekly coition has been ne- 
ceffarily fmall, though great in proportion to the circum- 
ftances of the inhabitants : And had it not been for the fe- 
ceffion, it might have been one fifth more • for in the year 
1736, and after that period, when the feceffion had firft 
commenced, there is a great defalcation j and there was a 
greater (till, about the year 1770, when the lociety of relief 
was eftablifhed in this place. For it cannot be concealed, 
though it is with fincere regret I mention it, that when the 
people of that communion withdrew themfelves from the ef- 
tablifhed church, they feem to have fhutup their bowels of com- 
panion from their poor brethren ; at leaft they have witheld 
their hand from relieving them. But it is to be hoped, at leaft 
it is devoutly to be wifhed, that they may fpeedily fee it to be 
their duty to affift, if not altogether to fupply the poor of their 
own perfuafion, and not caft them off when helplefs. They 
will certainly lofe nothing by doing fo, either in.their character 
as men, or as chriftians. On the contrary, they will have the 
approbation of the pious and the pure of every perfuafion, and 
the bleffing of the poor who are attached to their communion.

To the honour of all denominations of ehriftians In this 
panfh, they are always ready to contribute in a private capa- 
city, when the circumftances of the poor require them to do fo. 
During the inclement winter 1795, when every labourer, was 
entirely idle, and almoft every clafs of tradefmen, a fubfcrip- 
tion was opened for the feeble, the aged, and the infirm, and 
for the honeft and induftrious, who could not find employ- 
ment, but were unwilling to come upon the parifh. Tn the 
courfe of a few days, upwards of L. 1 1 were colled from 
the common orders of the inhabitants of every different com- 
munion ; and by the concurrence of the heritors, it was 
raifed at laft above L. 30. The non-rending heritors not 
only concurred in this defign, but have agreed to give a, 
handfome fum yearly, for the fupport of the poor; an. 
example truly laudable and worthy of imitation. 

The ordinary poor which are not very numerous, are 
chiefly fupported by the weekly collections at the church. 
But there are feldom above 10, and never above 15 
upon the weekly lift ; thefe receive from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. 
monthly, each according to their feveral neceflities. But by 
far the greater! fum goes to the fupply of the occafional poor. 
And that none may be overlooked, the feflion meets weekly 
all the year round ; and in winter they meet always twice, 
fometimes thrice, for the purpofe of giving more liberal 
fupplies than can be afforded weekly. At Martinmafs, 
New- years day, and Candlemafs, they diftribute from 
L. 3 to L. 4 fter. either in money or in coals, or cloaths, 
to all without diftin£tion who {land in need of them. Some- 
times this occafional fupply amounts to L. 20 fter. in the 
winter ; befides what is expended in the education of fome 
orphans and many poor children. 

Yet our funds have hitherto been fufficient ; fo that there 
has not been an aiTeflment in this parifh for a century paft, 

excepcing 



of Kilfyth. 2 59 

excepting in the year , 74 o, as tha^vas a year not only of 
want approaching to a famine, but of great ficknefs and dif 
trefs the feffion very judicioufly took advantage of the aft of 
parliament 1672. In the terms of that ad, they called a 
Leting of the heritors, gave up a lift of all the poor withm 
the parifh, and a ftate of the funds for their fupply : calling 
upon them to affefs themfelves to make up the deficiency. 
Yet after all, the fum exaded was only L. 5 on each 100 lib. 
Scots valuation, which was certainly very trifling : and little 
felt either by heritor or tenant, as it was equally paid by 
both, 

The above, however, is only an account of our parochial 
fund. Befides thcfe, the weavers and mafons have each a 
friendly fociety, and a common fund for the fupport of their 
brethren. Thefe focieties have given confutable relief to 
multitudes; infomuch, that without them or fomething fimi- 
lar to them, this parifh muft have been affiled long before 
this time to a confiderable amount *'. 

K k 2 Population. 

* The fociety of weavers was inftituted in the year 1760. At that time the 
manufacturing bufinefs was only in its infancy. And of courfe, the operative 
weavers were not numerous ; yet their numbers every year increafed, and 
multitudes joined the fociety, "ho knew nothing of the craft ; fo that there 
are now upwards of 350 belonging to it. Each member either pays 7 s. 6d. up- 
on admiflion, and one milling yearly ; or one pound two millings Iter, at once, 
and he is for ever exempted from any future contribution, except a voluntary 
one, and entitled to all the privileges of the fociety. Thefe privileges are con- 
fiderable : if confined to bed by ficknefs, every member receives 3s. weekly ; 
if only unable to work, though walking about, he receives as. befides At his 
death, there are L. % ftetling allowed his widow or family, or friends, for fu- 
neral expences. Thefe and ail their other regulatious, feem to be wifely and 
well calculated to promote the common intereft of the fociety : efpccially 
as every member has an honeft pride in fupporting himfelf and his 
family, and a great averfion to come upon the funds, unlefs when 
neceffity urges him. The funds though fmall at firft, have by proper

Population.— The population of this parifh may be veryaccu- 
rately itated. For in the year 1790, an exaft lift was taken of 
every individual in it : at that time it contained precifely 2450 
fouls, but the three following tables will give the moft con- 
cife view of this fubjecl. 

2 • The 

and prudent management, increafed to what is to them a confiderable fum. 
In houfes, bills, and bonds, their property may amount to upwards of L. 300 
fterling. 

They meet annually upon the ift Friday of Auguft to chufe their deacon, 
and other office bearers, who meet regularly every quarter, or as often as 
occafion requires, to receive petitions, fupply the poor brethren, and fettle 
the private affairs of the lociety. 

The mafon lodge was inftituted about the fame time : they hold of the 
grand lodge of Edinburgh; every member at entry, pays 7s. 6d. if the fon of 
a member, if a ftranger 10s. 6d. and all pay quarterly thereafter. Their 
number is likewife on the increafe, and may amount to about 120, their funds 
"will of courfebe enlarged ; at prefentthey exceed L. 100 fler. in houfes, bills, 
and bonds. They have a very convenient lodge well fitted up ; they are able 
in fome meafure to contribute to the fupport of their poor brethren : if una- 
ble to work, they allow each member as. 6d. ; if confined to bed, he receives 
5s. weekly. And a guinea is likewife allowed for funeral charges; fo that when 
a poor man is connected with the fociety both of mafons and weavers, which 
is often the cafe, he has a very liberal allowance. 

The miners of this parifh propofe likewife to eftabiiih a friendly fociety j 
but it have not yet taken place, though I hope it will very foon. 

Of all charitable inftitutions, thofe friendly focieties feem to be the befl : for 
they are not only happily calculated to relieve the poor, but to maintain that 
honeft fpirit of independence, which is the fure mark of an honeft: and inge- 
nuous mind. They therefore deferve encouragement from all ranks and deno- 
minations ; but efpecially from the landed intereft, who have it in their 
power to be liberal. It would be for the intereft of every heritor to encourage 
them; perhaps it is not unworthy of the legiflature itfelf to interpofc in their 
bi.half. Their funds might be exempted from all duty on bills and receipts : 
or in 'cafes when they come in competition with other creditors, they might 
be allowed a preferable claim to all ; except the crown and the land- 
lard. 

But

b Jof houfes, families, heads of families, w.dows vadowers, 
children farmers, and male and female fervants, m each d,f- 

Hcl f plra tely. For I think it more consent w.th the oh- 
% i SSL account, to give a detail of the proportton 
of inhabitants in each diftria apart , than merely *ft* 
the number of the whole parilh. By tins means .t wdl be an 
lafy matter to fay in any future period, whither the town or 
country part of the parilh is increafmg or decreafing : and 

in what proportion and denomination of inhabitants.

The third reprefents the number of each denomination,

But a part, if not a principal part of thefe funds ought to be eftabkihed by 
kvv as a fupport for the widows and children of the refpertive members of 
each fociety. Or, if the funds already colleQed are found infufficient for 
that purpofe, why, might not each member become bound to pay a final 
additional fum for the purpofe of eftablifhing a widows fund ? A trifling 
fum annually from each would ferve the purpofe. But perhaps the wifeft 
meafure that could be adopted, would be to unite the friendly focieties into 
larger bodies, and the tradefmenof the fame craft throughout the kingdom 
into one fociety. The common flock, if allowed to accumulate for a few 
years, would foon be fuffkient to anfwer all the purpofes of their widows and 
their' poor, and mpre effeduaUy than the funds of fmall and feparate focic 
ties.

There may be about an hundred families or houfeholders, 
that have no children. And upon the whole, there are not 
quite 3 children alive to each family. 



2 *4 Statijlical Account 

In moll places, there are more children to a family in the 
country than in the towns. But upon an examination of the 
2d table, it will appear that the reverie is the fad with us : this 
Is undoubtedly rather fingular, but it may perhaps be eafily ac- 
counted for. The manufafturing clafs of people, generally 
marry younger than farmers and labourers ; becaufe they are 
much fooner upon an independent footing. A weaver, the 
moment his apprenticed^ is over, can earn a decent liveli- 
hood, and after ferving as a journeyman for a fhort time, ge- 
nerally marries or begins houfe-keeping. Whereas a fervant, 
or even the fon of a refpeftable farmer, unlefs he turns to 
fome other profeffion, is not fo foon independent : the fon, 
if his father is alive, is dependent on him, and in fome mea« 
fure his fervant ; and the fervant as he changes his matter 
and his rtfidence often, cannot fo conveniently marry. As 
this is the cafe, and as the farmers and labourers are the moft 
numerous clafs in the country, as the manufacturers are in 
the town, it is natural to fuppofe, that the latter fhould marry 
fooner, and of courfe, mould fooner become the fathers of 
families. 

I fhall not prefume to fay pofitively, whither the population 
of this parifh has been on the increafe or decreafe : it feems 
to have been always on the increafe. If Dr Webfter's account 
be accurate, the increafe is very confiderable indeed, fince 
the period in which he enumerated them. At that time, 
there were only according to his account 13465 fo that in the 
courfe of 40 years, there are no lefs than 1104 fouls added to 
this parifh. 

The chief caufes of this increafe are doubtlefs the follow- 
ing : 1 ft, That manufactures have been, efpecially fince that 
period, in a flourifhing condition : 2d, That of courfe, many 
from the remote highlands, and fome from almoft every quar- 
ter, 



of Kilfyth. * 6 5 

ter have reforted to this diftrid : $ That the greateft part 
of 'the farmers younger fons have become tradefmen or 
manufaaurers : of courfe, they do not leave the panfli, but 
refort to the village j and, by marrying, foon add to the 
number of fouls. It corroborates this opinion much, that 
there are upwards of 900 fouls in the old, and 300 in the 
new town: whereas the country part of the parifh is not 
much more populous than it was laft century : fo that alL 
the increafe of population is in the town. Indeed it is cer- 
tain, that it contains 300 fouls more than it did even 10 years 
ago ; that is, before the new town was begun. And as the 
fituation is highly advantageous-and the encouragement to 
new fettlers liberal, it muft in all likelihood continue to in- 
creafe. Efpecially, if a cotton miln, ableachfield, printneld, 
or any public work be eftablifhed among us ; in that cafe, the 
increafe muft be rapid, and the population doubled in a very 
fhort time. 

But in a ftatiftical account, as little as poffible fhould be left 
to conjeaure. Therefore, without entering upon uncertain 
ground, 1 {hall give as full a table of births, or rather baptifms, 
as I can. And fortunately I have been enabled to colled the 
materials for upwards of a century.

70 Statijlical Account 

The average was nearly from 28 to 26 during the above 
period ; fo that the number of males born has always been 
greater than the number of females. 

At an average of 100 years, there are twins twice 
every three years: At prefent, there have been twins in four 
different families, within the courfe of a few months. 

N. B. The following Table mows the number of children 



born in every month.

of Kilfyth. -zyt 

I have been more particular in the above extract, be- 
came I think it one of the mod important articles in a ftatif- 
tical account ; and becaufe the regifters of this parifh have 
been kept with uncommon care. 

Therefore, as it may be depended upon as correct, it may 
ferve many ufeful purpofes in time to come : and at prefent 
may furnifh a very plaufible if not a certain ftatement of the 
proportional increafe or decreafe of the population of this 
parifh during all the above periods. 

A few remarks upon this fubject, may tend to fet it in a 
clearer light. It is generally fuppofed, that if we multiply 
the annual births in a parifh by 26, the product will give the 
number of inhabitants. But in this parilh at leaft, this will 
not hold at prefent : and 1 think, I can affign very fufficient 
reafons for this. 

1 ft, The {till born children, and thofe who die before bap- 
tifm are not regiftrated. 

2dly, Since the feceffion at firft took place, a number, if not 
the greater part of feceders, neglect to regiflrate their children. 

3dly, Since the duty was impofed upon baptifms, a Hill 
greater number have neglected to do fo, in order to evade the tax* 

4thly, In a manufacturing village like this, there are a 
great many ftrangers who come to refide : and in proportion to 
the encouragement they meet with, the number mull increafe. 
For thefe or other reafons, we muft multiply the number of 
baptifms at prefent by 38, to give the number of inhabitants : 
, and the reafon is, that upon an average, there are at lead 8, if 
not 10 children born annually, who for one or other of the 
above reafons, are not regiftrated. 

Yet, if we multiply the births for every period by 38, I 
fear this rule may be fallacious. For before the feceffion took 
place, and manufactures were introduced into this parilh, or a 
duty impofed on the parifh regifter, the record was unqueilion- 
ably more complete. 

a I 



2 7 2 Statiftical Account 

I (hall therefore endeavour to make an allowance for this 
in the following calculation. 

^ For the firft 10 years after the Revolution, the average of 
births annually, was about 40. 

Multiply this N°. 40 by 30 the N°. of inhabts. 1 200

Here it will appear, that I have made an allowance for ftill 
born and unbaptifed infants, even at the earlieft period. In 
place of 26, I have taken 30, allowing 4 annually. After the 
feceffion, I have allowed 5 more annually, which I think 
may be a reafonable allowance for thofe of that perfuafion, 
who neglected to regiltrate their children. After the relief fo- 
ciety was eftablilhed here, a few more would neglect to do fo : 
efpecially confidering the duty on baptifms ; therefore, lhave 
from that period allowed 3 more. 

After much minute inveftigation, I fuppofe the above 
may give a pretty accurate idea of the progreflive increafe of 
population. 

Mr Robe mentions in his narrative, that there were 
in the year 1742, 200 comaiunicants in this parifli. At pre- 
fent there are no lefs than 515 in full communion with the 
church.

of Kilfyth. *75 

The following remarks will in fome meafure explain the a- 
bove tables, and they are neceffary to prevent mrftakes. 

Although the firft table is an aceurate ftatement of the 
nu lrs enrolled in the morteloth keeper, books yet there 
L a few annually die, who are not enrolled. All who are 
ftill born, and even a few infants have not the ule of the 
morteloth ; but to counterbalance this on the other hand, fuch 
children as are ftill born or not baptifed, are not included in 
the foregoing regifter of ba^tifms. 

Froni the firft of thefi tables, fuppoGng them to be accu- 
rate, it will appear, that on an average of 10 years, about 51 
die annually : and that January, February, March, April, 
and May, are the moft fatal months ; next to them is June, 
November, and December ; and on the other hand, July, 
Auguft, and September, are in general the moft healthy 
months. 

From the fecond table, it will appear, that in the fame pe- 
riod, two thirds of the mortality bill confifts of children : and 
two thirds of the remainder of old men and women : and 
that there is a very fmall proportion of young men and 
young women that die, that is between the age of 15 
and 30. 

From the third table, it will appear, that the fmall pox are 
by much the moft fatal of all the difeafes to which we are lia- 
ble. When this difeafe prevails, the mortality bill rifes for 
that year, and vice verfa. 

Heritors, &amp;c. — The heritors of this parifh are not very 
numerous, and few of them have property in it to a great ex- 
tent. Sir Archibald Edmonftone, of Duntreath, Bart, is pro- 
prietor of five fixths of the parifti, and fuperior of the whole, 
except a valuation of L. 80 Scots. He is alfo titular of the 
tiends.

Farmers.—Tht farmers in this diftrift are in general a fo- 
ber, virtuous, and refpeaable clafs of men : they are equally 
free from the licentioufnefs of the proud and wealthy, and 
from the growling and difcontented temper of the lefs fober 
and lefs induftrious poor. It muft be acknowledged, how- 
ever, that they do not in general much excel their neighbours 
in the art of farming; : like the tenants of mod of the for- 
feited eftates in Scotland, they are perhaps rather indolent, 
becaufe they are independent ; and they make but few 
fpirited exertions, becaufe their rents are fmall and their 
leafes long. Perhaps the principal caufe why they are be- 
hind in fome improvements, is, that their farms are in gene- 
ral very injudicioufly laid out. They confift of a long nar- 
row ftrip, beginning in the valley and rifing to the fummit of 
the hill ; fometimes one, two, or three miles long, and not a 
quarter of a mile broad. At the time when the leafes were 
granted, that is, about the beginning of this century, this 
might be attended with many conveniences. The great ob- 
je£t at that time for every farmer, was to have every thing he 
needed within his own farm : and by this divifion, he had his 
proportion of mofs, and meadow, pafture, and arable ground. 
"Whereas, had the farms been regularly laid out, this could 
not have been the cafe. This, however, is now a great bar to 
improvement. For the rich low grounds in the valley and its 
vicinity, by being interfered, and every farm by being inter- 
mixed with another in this irregular manner, cannot beinclofed 
to advantage ; of courfe, cannot be improved, from circum- 
ftances which are rather the misfortune than the fault of the 
tenants. For unlcfs a general excambion were taking place, 
and every farm were ne'w modelled, Y \vhich is next to impcili- 

ble, 



\ 



2 ? 8 Statijlical Account 

ble while the prefent leafes laft, the valley muft lie open, 
and umnclofed ; and, therefore, continue to be poached all 
tne w inter: f 0r this caufe it is, that the worft, that is the 
J»gb lymg cold ground, which is allotted for pafture, is all 
inclofed : while the low, warm, rich valley, lies open ; a 
circurmWe this, which is furely very uncommon in the pre- 
lent period. 

It is chiefly owing to this circumftance, that every farmer 
is m fome meafure a grazier, though there are but few who 
follow that line to any great extent ; at the fame time, it is 
much more attended to, than it was 40 or 50 years ago. Be- 
fore the rebellion i m a great proportion, perhaps one tenth 
of the arable part of the parifh, was cultivated. From the 
valley to the very brow of th e hills, upwards of 800 feet a- 
bove the level of the fea, almoft every inclofure was ploughed 
m regular rotation. Whereas now, it is very uncommon to 
fee one acre in 20 of thofe high grounds cuhivattd. The 
reafon is obvious, and every one who looks at the grounds 
muft fee it. The fields are fteep, and of courfe, very expen r 
five in the culture : every plough requires 4, in fome 
places would require 6 horfes, and never lefs than two 
men. After all this labour and expence, the produce muft 
be fcanty, and the harvefi late ; in fome cafes fo late, as to 
endanger the crop, if not ruin it altogether. Befides, as 
lime is at a confiderable diftance, and the roads bad, and as 
dung cannot be conveyed from the valley, where the farm 
lioufes in general now ftand, there is little probability of im- 
proving them to much advantage. For the expence of feed, 
labour, and. manure, it is feared, would exceed the produce ; 
the high wages of men fervants, the advanced price of horfes, 
and of every utenfil that is necefLry, and the amazing ex- 
pence of carrying manure in fufficient quantities to thofe high 
fields, are circumllances fufficient to difcourage the farmer 

from 



of Kilfyth. 279 

from making the attempt, or at leaft to account for his un- 
willingnefs to hazard it. But let it not be fuppofed that the 
high fields are ufclefs, or of little value : on the contrafy, 
they are rich and produce to the farmers ; they are perhaps 
more produftive than a great part of the ploughed land. 
They yield great abundance of the richeft and earlieft pafture 
in the weft of Scotland ; and being of a fouth expofure and 
uneven furface, they afford every variety of foil and fhelter, 
either for fummer or winter. The beautiful green hills, are 
covered with the fweeteft pafture; the valleys, or rather in- 
terveening marfhes, which are likewife numerous, produce 
abundance of coarfe hay : and every little hill or inclofure, 
has its little rivulet. The demand for fat cattle has increafed, 
and feems to be increafing,and the high grounds have for many 
years been entirely employed to feed cattle. It is generally 
allowed, that there is no ftrath in the weft of Scotland more 
favourable for the purpofe than the ftrath which lies weftward 
from Kilfyth, through Campfie, and Strathblain *. 



* The graziers in this parilli are an adYive mduftrious and refpeftablc clafs 
«f farmers : they feem to know their bufinefs well ; and pufh it with confide- 
rable fpirit. If they are liable to any errors, it may perhaps be the fol- 
lowing : 

ifr, That they rather overftock their grounds, fo that the cattle have not 
fufficient choice of the beft pafture : and befides the coarfe hay is thus greatly 
injured. 

ad, In purchafing their cattle, they are not always at due pains to pick the 
beft out of the flock ; whereas, if they were to exclude all the fhots, it would 
be ultimately for their intereft, though the cattle were dearer in the mean 
time, 

3dly, They run too much upon highland cattle : doubtlcfs,|they take on 
the beef fafl, and feed very quickly, and when fed, are fweeter than larger 
cattle, But, perhaps, it would be the intereft of the graaier, to buy up 

large 



2 S o Statiftical Account 

Horfes, Sheep, — From the circumftances which have 
been mentioned, the number of plough horks muft be great- 
ly diminifiied, more efpecially as the two horfe plough upon 
Small's conftruc~Uon, is generally ufed in the low grounds* 
The number of milk cows, but efpecially of fat cattle, muft 
be in proportion increafed ; how much I cannot fay. The 
following table, however, will exhibit a correct view of the 
whole live flock of the parilh, and its fuppofed value, eftima- 
ted by a proper judge.

But bcfides the above, there is a great number of young 
eattle and horfes, and likewife a few fwine, which will at leaft 
raife the general value of the flock to L. 1 1000 fter. A milk 
cow yields from 8 to 12 pints of milk daily.

large country cows for the richeft of his pafture ; and refervc the hilly grounds 
for the highland cattle. 

Thefe things, however, are more attended to now than heretofore. 

The profits are of courfe greater. Each cow for fummer grafs meal, is al- 
lowed to yield from 20s. to 30?. at an average : when fed both in winter and 
fummer, each yields from 35s. to 45s. 

But in this account, I make no allowance for the lofs of cattle, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
which is fometimes confiderable.

Produce, — The produce of the arable lands confifls 
principally in oats, though partly in barky, potatoes, beans, 
rye grafs, and hay. It is difficult to fay, what proportion of acres 
there may be in each kind ; there are not 2 acres in fallow, 
nor 3 in wheat and turnip, in the whole parifh. But the 
following will be found to be a general eftimate of the 
produce.

Our oats yield from 12 to 16 pecks of meal in the boll. 
And it is univerfally underftood, that a warm fummer makes 
the crop yield well, and vice verfa, though the fodder be 
plenty. 

The table is not taken from an accurate meafurement : but 
the produce per acre may be depended on. It is but feldom 
that the average rifes above it, though in feme fields it is e- 
qual to the laft column. 

Rye is feldom fown, at lead in any quantity. I have never 
feen above an acre in one field : but the little that is, raifed, 
is uncommonly good. Wheat has been attempted, but we have 
not acquired the art of cultivating that precious grain to ad- 
vantage : though our rich valley is peculiarly adapted to the 

Vol. XVIII. N 11 ' purpofe, 



282 Statiftical Account 

purpofe, yet as it is not inclofed or fubdivided, it cannot be 
fown with wheat to any advantage : for the winter poaching 
would ruin the crop. Much of the rifing .round, if inclofed, 
fummer fallowed, and properly manured, might likewife 
produce abundant crops of wheat. Flax is raifed in fmall 
quantities, but chiefly for private ufe, and feldom for fale • 
and the quality of it is at all times more remarkable than the 
quantity. It is generally allowed to be of the fineft grain 
and colour, of any in Scirlingfhire * Rye grafs and clover 
have been introduced about ,o years ; and as they have turn- 
ed out to great advantage, they are much run upon, at leaft 
by all who have proper inclofures for the purpofe : though 
they are fometimes fown even for pafture in open 
fields. 

But potatoes are the favourite produce of this parifh, and it 
has been juftly and long famous on this account :-I fay jufh'y 
and long ; for it not only gave birth to the gentleman who 
firft introduced the culture of potatoes into the fields, by 
dibbling and hand-hoeing, but it was the fcene of his earlieft 
experiments : and, if the name of any man deferves to be 
handed down to fucceeding ages, with honour and gratitude, 
it is that of Robert Graham, Efq ; of Tamrawer. He, with 
a fpirit truly patriotic, and a mind aftive and indefatigable, 
fet vigoroufly to work in the cultivation of potatoes in the 
year 1739. Before that period, he and others had raifed 
them in gardens : but there was a vulgar and a common 

prejudice, 

* Thislaftfeafon, I knew so fione weight of flax raifed from 4 pecks, and 
fold at 14s. the flone : as eight pecks are allowed to fow an acre, this was a 
produce equal to L. 28 iter, per acre. Befides that, 18 pecks of feed were lav- 
ed off the above half acre, and fold at half price. 

It was confidercd as a rerharkably good, though not an uncomnJeu 
crop. 



of Kilfyth. 28 3 

• jv, that they could be raifed no where elfe to ad- 
m ' M 7 Graham, to (how the abfurdlty of this opinion, 
TZZ St%c of ground in the croft of Neilftone, 
t he then refided. This excited the attenuon of the 
le bourhood, and the report of it was foon fpread far and 
wide: infomuch, that people of all denom— , and 
fome noblemen of the higheft rank, (among whom was the 
unfortunate Earl of Perth), came to witnefs the plantatum. 
And had they known the amazing benefit that was to accrue 
to the nation, from this fortunate attempt, they would have 
doubtlefs hailed the aufpicious event, and ereaed a monu- 
ment to Mr Graham on the fpot, Rcgardlcf. of the ignorant 
ndiculeto whichhis firft eX perimentsexpofedhim,heprofecuted 
his favourite purfuit, with increafing ardour and fuccefs : and 
by his perfevering induftry, and uncommonly happy talent 
for profecuting every fpecies of improvement, he ratfed the 
cultivation of potatoes in the neighbourhood of Kilfyth, to 
a pitch fcarcely yet, if at all furpaffed any where ; and to 
promote the fame fpirit, and fpread the bleffing far and wide, 
he rented lands in the vicinity of Renfrew, and Perth, Dun- 
dee, and Glafgow, Leith, and Edinburgh ; and for many 
years obtained the premium for cultivating potatoes, till at 
laft no competitor was found ; all were compelled to yield 

the palm to him. 

This will not perhaps appear fo furprifmg, if the following 

facls are attended to. 

After anendlefs variety of experiments, which he very pro- 
perly recorded, but the record of which is unfortunately loft, 
he, in the year 1762, planted one peck of potatoes with the 
dibble, and in O£tober following, raifed from the fame peck, 
10 bolls and | boll, or 264 pecks. 

As this may appear furprifmg, if not incredible to fome,

If the man who makes a (ingle pile of grafs or corn to 
grow, where there was none before, in the eyes of Dean 
Swift, deferved more of his country than all the politicians 
that ever lived, we leave it to the learned to weave a laurel 
crown for Mr Graham. 

The method in which his operations were carried on, 
were ingenious and lingular, and might have been defcribed. 

There is no branch of hufbandry more attended to, nor 
profecuted with more ingenuity and fuccefs by all clafle?, 
than the cultivation of potatoes. Every year there is fome 
real, or imaginary improvement introduced ; and it is eager- 
ly adopted and profecuted with much care and perfeverance. 
I have known many try 8 or to fpecies of feed in one feafon. 
This fpirit they partly have imbibed from Mr Graham ; but 
the fuccefs is principally owing to local circumffcances. The 
foil is not only highly favourable, but every feuer has, ".nd 
almoft every inhabitant lays his account with taking, a fmall 
lot of ground, for the exprefs purpofe of raifing potatoes. 
They have befides time and inclination to beftow great care, 
and attention, in planting, weeding, and dreffing them. 
And their endeavours are generally crowned with fuccefs*. 

Our 

* The following feems to be the refult of endlefs experiments. 

ift, That the kidney potatoe is the bed feed, mod productive, and pleafant 
to the tafte at the fame time. 

adly, That ground which has never been broken up before, or at lead, 
never produced potatoes, is by much the mod productive; though not better 
manured than other ground. 

3dly, That potatoes ought to be planted each fet at the diflance of 1 foot 
6 inches, from each other; at leaft in the ridge, even when they are no*t 
drilled. 

N. B. It is univcrfally agreed, that potatoes when frequently repeated, or 
even oftener than once in 7 years on the fame ground, arc a very fcourging 
crop ; if once in two years, they fpcedily reduce the foil to a caput mortuum. 

4thly, That 



ft 



286 Statifiical Account 

Our feed time Is rather late in general. In the laft week of 
March, or firft of April, the oats are fq| the moft part fown ; 
though fometimes fown confiderably later. Potatoes are 

planted, 

4thly, That each plant fhould be carefully boxed up with the hoe, if not 
drilled, or otherwife with the plough ; as in that cafe, it becomes greatly 
more produftive. For every time the earth is thrown up, the plant ftrikes 
out new fibres : and a fucceflion of crop may thus be obtained. The lowed 
tire may be ripe and ready for eating, while the high eft are fcarcely formed. 
But where this is attempted, as it was often by Mr Graham, the plants 
ought to be 3 feet diftant from each other, in all directions. 

jfthly, It is allowed that if the ground be lea or grafs, the dung ought in 
that cafe, to be fpread in harveft preceding; or at leaft, early in the fpring; 
that it may in fome meafure be incorporated with the foil ; before it be 
ploughed. Even in ftubble it is deemed advantageous. 

6thly, It is generally allowed that lime is very unfavourable for the cultiva- 
tion of potatoes. It is even faid, that the bad effects of it are experienced for 
io or ao years. One of thefe is, that the crop of potatoes though large, is 
almoft always fcabbed or foul. 

7thly, The feed is generally cut in pretty large fets, and kept a week or 
two if poflrble, before it be fet. This is faid to be a great advantage, par- 
ticularly in wet grounds. It is faid to make the potatoe fpring fooner, and 
to prevent the feed from rotting. For being (hrivelled and dryed, and co- 
vered with a kind of tough rind, it is more capable of refilling the moifturc, 
and at the fame time, has an equal tendency to vegetate quickly. 

8thly, A moft productive crop may be raifed of early potatoes, before the 
middle of July And either turnips, greens, or grafs-feeds, may be raifed 
as a fecond crop. Yet the potatoes may yield of clear profit per acre, fidm 
L. IO to XI. 

othly, In gardens and fmall plots, the ftocks of greens and cabbage, are one 
of the heft manures for potatoes. If dug in drills, and the ftocks be laid in 
regularly, they both enrich the ground, and keep the foil open; and thereby 
give room for the (hoots to fpread. 

Laflly, Great crops have been raifed out of the young fhoots, in place of 
fets.

planted, and the barley fown in the laft week of April, and 

firft of May. . . 

The old people make a general remark, that the fpnng is 
much later, and the fummers a great deal colder, than they 
were 40 or 50 years ago. Of courfe, that the harveR is. not 
only later, but much more precarious. 

One remarkable fummer is mentioned about 40 years ago, 
in which the heat was fo great at feed time, that the labourer 
could not endure it at noon. So that it was a common thing 
to Deep the greateft part of the day, and labour in the night. 
From barley feed-time, till barley harveft, there was not a 
fhower, but copious dews •, yet the crop was the moft pro- 
dudive of any fi'nce that period i though the ftraw was 
fhort, and the (heaves few, and fcarcely a Hack to be feen 
in a barn-yard, the barns containing almoft all the grain and 
fodder. 

Price of 'Provifions As to the price of provifions, it is ge- 
nerally low. Beef, mutton and veal, are at leaft a penny 
per pound lower than in Glafgow •, fometimes even two 
pence ; lamb and butter always two pence. Eggs and poul- 
try of all kinds are lower in proportion \ fo that it is necdlefs 
to be more particular. It will doubtlefs ferve the purpofe of 
a ftatiftical account better, to point out the comparative va- 
lue of as many articles as poffible, at different periods. And 
as 1 had occafion to confult an old memorandum book, be- 
longing to Mr Cornwall of Banton, who was chamberlain to 
Lord Kilfyth in the year 1670, I find the precife price of the 
following articles, dated at that period ; and in another 
manufcript of a private gentleman belonging to this parifh, 
I find the fame articles rated in the year 1745. I fhall there- 
fore ftate the account.

^eldfomuch upon a leafe of i 9 years. Tn general the 
rents are very low in this parifh, as the leafes were many of 
them granted about the beginning of this century. An acre 
in potatoes or flax, if prepared for the crop, lets at L. 6 
fterling. 

The wages of fervants have rifen in a ftill greater pro- 
portion. They are nearly triple to what they were even 40 
years ago. Independent of his food, a ploughman expeds 
from L. 10 to L. 12; a maid fervant from L. 3 to L. 4- A 
hay cutter charges as. 6d. a day, a reaper in harveft 2s. a 
female do* is. 6d. When engaged by the week and finding 
his own provifions, a man receives ps- and a female 7 s 

weekly. A weaver can earn from is. fed. to 2s. 6d. a day at 

an average* 

Antiquities, The antiquities in this parifh are 

not very remarkable : yet a few deferve a place in this ac- 
count. 

This diftria muft have been the fcene of contention, and 
the field of blood for many generations ■, perhaps from the 
days of Agricola, till the civil war in 1646. It feems to 
have been without the fixed limits of the Roman empire. 
For the fouth boundary of the parifh runs nearly parallel to 
Graham's Dyke for upwards of 6 miles. In that diftria of 
the wall, it is never more than half, nor lefs than a quar- 
ter of a mile fouth of this parifh. At Wefterwood, and 
Bar-hill, there are two diftina Roman Forts j and o£ 
courfe, two Piaifh forts in this paiiih correfponding to 
thefe : Cunny park to the former, and Balcaitle to the 
latter. The laft mentioned is by much the moft remark- 
able. It is perhaps the moft beautiful, regular, and entire 
of any Piaifh fort in Scotland. It is placed in the angle 
of two fmall rills, near a farm houfe called Caftle town, 

O o 7, ox 



2 9 2 Statijlical Account 

or Balearic, on that account ; and, it rifes regularly on all 
fides at an angle of 45 degrees, fo that the form of it re- 
lembles the top of a hat , but it is not equally high all a- 
round. On the fouth it is about 40 feet, on the north only 
20 perpendicular : and it has been furrounded on all fides by 
a fofs, which might eafily be filled with water by the 
nvulets on either fide. At the bafe it is nearly too yards 
m diameter ; at the fummit, which is flat, it is fcarcely 50, 
and « quite circular. There is a tradition that it is hollow 
Within; and fome pretend to have feen the mouth of 
the m,ne open, which leads to the cavity. But, if there 
ever was fuch a mine, it is now entirely {hut up, and 
there is not the fmalleft veftige of any fubterraneous pafiage 
at pre fen t. 

The floping fides of this mound are covered with broom 
and brufhwood. The top, though once overgrown alfo, is 
now cleared, and often cultivated, and produces excellent 
potatoes and oats. 

The other fort at Cunny park feems not to have been fo re- 
gular or large. At leaft it is not now fo entire : and fcarcely 
deftrves to be mentioned. 

Befides thefe, there have been other Roman antiquities 
found in this parifh and neighbourhood. For an account of 
thefe, I refer the reader to Horfeley's Britannia, and 
Henry's hiftory. They arc moftly lodged in the univerfity of 
Glafgow. That learned fociety have thrown off copper- 
plate impreflioiis of all the Roman antiques in their pof- 
feflion. 

There are feveral circular fortifications, called chefters, 
which bear evident m.irks of great antiquity. The moft re- 
markable are at Auchlnclbch, Auchinvillie, and Townhead. 
They are all fimilar to each other, and much about the fame 

fize ;

fize ; being nearly 40 or 50 yards diameter. The outer wall 
or inclofure, for fome of them have evident marks of fmaller, 
but irregular inclofures within, confifts of a rude rriafs, of 
large and fmall tumbling (tones, built without any regularity 
or order; and without mortar of any kind. In times of ig- 
norance and barbarifm, they may however have been places 
of confiderable ftrength. Though it feems very uncertain 
for what purpofe they were at firft erected. 

That they were ftrong holds, or places of defence, or fhel- 
ter, feems unqueftionable. Indeed the name they bear, feems 
to indicate this much ; for chefter in Gaelic, fignifies a camp. 
And as the name is of Gaelic original, for this as well as 
other reafons, 1 am difpofed to think they are of greater an- 
tiquity, than even Agricola's wall, or Graham's dyke. Per- 
haps they are coeval with the Roman forts ; and it is general- 
ly allowed, that thefe were formed before the wall. 

If this be the cafe, in all probability, thefe chefters may 
have been intended as places of refuge, for the women and 
children, and the defencelefs and unarmed inhabitants of 
this diftrict. To them they would naturally fly for fhelter, 
in cafe of an unexpected defeat, or fudden incurfion of the 
Roman invaders. The fituation and ftru&amp;ure of thefe forti- 
fications, feem both to favour this conjecture. They are fi- 
tuated at no great diftance from the Roman wall ; lying along 
the north fide of the valley, which was the boundary of that 
empire. Befides this, they contain a number of fmall fubdi- 
vifions, like the ruins of rude huts, which might have ferved 
for fhelter from the ftorm ; as the great outer wall was for 
fafety from the invader. 

This at leaft feems a more plaufible conjecture, than that 
they were intended as a place of fecurity for cattle, and the 
other ftock and moveables of the natives. They are too fmall 
to contain any confiderable number of cattle. And befides 

the 



2 94 Statijlical Account 

the neighbouring mountains, furnift in a thoufand differed 
Places, protection, as well as pafture for cattle, to much 
better purpofe. Nor is it likely, that they were intended as 
a defence from the wolves, and ravenous beafts. The 
wall that furrounds them, feems to be a work of much great- 
er labour and ftrength, than was neceffary for this purpofe. 

. But lf we fu PP° fe  as is ^rely very likely, that the Caledo- 
nians had a (landing army always along the line of the Ro 
man wall, they, though fearlefs of danger, and difdaining all 
fhelter, but the ftrength of their own arm, muft neceflarily 
have been attended with a number of women, and defence- 
lefs followers. Thefe needed, and naturally fought for a 
place of refuge. And fuch a refuge, the chefters might af- 
ford * 2 

But 

* Nature feems to have marked out this ftrath, as the boundary of the 
Roman Empire. Whether it was pitched upon from necefllty or choice, I 
cannot fay. But the following particulars will make it appear, that it was 
the raoft eligible place for raifing up a barrier againfl the native Caledonians, 

ift, It is by much the narroweft place in the whole Ifiand. The Frith of 
Forth and Clyde interfedt the kingdom for many miles on either fide. 

adly, It is befides the north boundary of the lowlands. The whole coun- 
try to the north, appears to a ftranger, to be an endlefs fucceffion of bleak 
and barren monntains. 

3dly, The whole ftrath of Kelvin, feems to have been an impa/fible mo- 
Fafs. In fome places, I fuppofe the whole valley was covered with water : 
From this wettward to the Clyde, it was therefore a natural barrier of itfelf. 
From the Dullatur bog eaftward, it feems to have been entirely under water. 
Camelodunum feems to have been a fea-port town. If it was fo, the whole 
valley to Kilfyth parifh, muft have been an arm of the fea, though not navi- 
gable, yet next to impartible. Had it not been for thefe natural advantages 
of fiuiation, the Roman wall muft have been a feeble defence againfl the 
hardy, brave, and free fons of Caledonia. 

In more than- one place, theie feems tp have been artificial mounds raifed 
in the valley, to throw it under water. 

Th? 



of KUfyth. 295 

But this is given merely as a conjeaure. For though ma- 
ny of the ftones have been removed, there never has been 
found the fmalleft veftige of any infcription, nor even of any 
character whatever upon them. 

The tumuli in this parifh are probably of equal antiquity 
with the chefters. Thefe however, have never been nume- 
rous, or confiderable ; and they have all been rafed to the 
foundation, for many years. The larger ftones have been 
ufed for building inclofures, the fmaller for the highways. 
I have been able only to trace the fite of two of thefe tumuli. 
The one at a field near Auchincloch, which I am told in 
Gallic, fignifies a field of ftones. The other about 600 yards 
eaft from Chapel green. That they were erected as monu- 
ments over the dead is generally allowed, as urns contain- 
ing the afhes of the dead, have been found in moft, if not in 
all that have been examined. 

But the queftion ftill remains, by what nation were they 
ere&amp;ed ? If by the native Caledonians, why have urns been 
found in them, with evident marks of the bodies having been 
burnt ? If by other nations, whence came they ? For though 
lbme may be fuppofed to be Roman, they cannot all be fo, 
as the greateft part of them are beyond the Roman boundary. 
And yet there is a very ftriking fimilarity in the ftru£lure of 
them, which would argue they were the work of one nation. 
But for what end were fuch mighty piles huddled together, « 
in fuch a rude confufed mafs, and with fuch immenfe labour 
and drudgery, upon the fummit of very high hills too, where 

fcarcely 

The Ban-hill, feems to me to have been the moft important fort. It is 
nearly centrical ; and commands a view of the wall for neaily half its length ; 
and it overlooks the whole ftrath to the north. Befides, it is nearly oppofite 
to the only narrow place of the valley ; where a paflage could be forced with 
the greateft expedition. 



2 9° Statiftical Account 

Scarcely a ftone was to be found?" If it was merely to 
commemorate the at hievements of the dead, or as a 
monument to his praife ; how comes it that there never 
has been found any infcription, or even hieroglyphic, to 
point out the names, defignation, character, or country of 
the deceafed ? If it was merely to defend the body from the 
ravenous wolves, and wild beafts, one tenth, in many cafes, 
one hundredth part of the pile might have fumced. And 
befides, the body feems to have been burned; fo that there 
was no danger from that quarter. It feems, however, certain, 
that thefe were the works not of any individual, or family ; 
but of a whole clan, or tribe, or nation. Perhaps they were 
the work of ages. All nations pay veneration to the afhes 
of the dead ; and I believe there are none fo rude and uncivi- 
lized, as to have no monuments. In early ages, the natives 
of this ifland, might fall upon this method of diftinguifhing 
the graves of great heroes, and eminent faints. As a tribute 
of efteem, every traveller as he paffed, would naturally add 
his (tone to the heap ; fo that although fmall at fir ft, it would 
increafe from year to year, in proportion to the veneration 
that was paid to the deceafed. In evidence of this, it is faid, 
that a fimilar cuftom ft ill prevails in the highlands of Scot- 
land ; and almoft every cairn or tumulus, has its refpe&amp;ive 
name, as Angus-cairn, &amp;c. 

One of the cairns in this parifh, likewife records the name 
of fome faint or hero. It is near a place called Kelvin-head. 
Now, as ke/, or cull, or cella fignifies a cell, or burying 
ground ; fo vean, or bean, which in Gallic are the fame, is 
the name of a Culdee faint; or, according to fome, of Fin- 
gal, the Caledonian hero. At all events, this tumulus feems 
to have been the burying place of Venn. And hence the ori- 
gin ojf the names in the neighbourhood of it, as Bean-ton, or, 
as it is now contracted, Baritbn ; Beanemyre ; 'Tom-vean, 



or 



of Kilfytb. 297 

or bean; and Kelvin is the name of the river, which rife s 
very nearly where the cairn flood. 

There are both in the eaft and weft barony a few monu- 
ments of feudal tyranny. In the Bar- wood, (from whence it 
doubtlefs derived its name,) there is an eminence ftill called 
the Court hill, where the haughty Barons were wont to fit in 
judgement. Andnear Qmrtzie-bfurn in the weft barony, there 
is an eminence called the Gallow-hill, where the fentence was 
put in execution. The very place where the gallows flood, is 
ftill pointed out. Thefe ferve only to recall to mind the 
days of cruel defpotifm, when, at the call of a lawlefs tyrant, 
the defencelefs, perhaps innocent vicYtm, was dragged from, 
his peaceful lowly cot, and in one fingle day, without evi- 
dence of his guilt, or an opportunity of acquittal, was ar- 
raigned, tried, condemned, and executed ! And while we 
heave a figh over the forrows of our fathers, the very recol- 
lection of that flavery under which they groaned and bled, 
makes us lift up our eyes in grateful homage, and blefs in- 
dulgent heaven, that we are happy and free ! 

At different periods, and in a variety of places in this pa- 
rifh, there have been a number of ancient coins found. 
But the greatefl part, by far has been concealed from the 
public. Of thofe that have been feen, part have been of gold, 
part of copper, but the greatefl number of fdver, and of all 
fizes, from a three penny piece, to that of a crown. A few 
may ftill be recovered, and at a very trilling expence, for 
they are regarded only as bullion ; and as far as I have feen, 
would not be much efteemed by the antiquarian. 

The greatefl part have been found along the field, where 
the battle of Kilfyth was fought. It belongs not to me to 
give any detail of that engagement in this place. Suffice it 
only to fay, that every little hill and valley, bears the name, 
or records the deeds of that day. So that the Gtuation of

each army can be diftkaiy traced. Such as the Bullet and 
Baggage-know, the Drum burn, the Slaughter-how or hollow, 
Kill e many butts, &amp; c . &amp;c. In the Bullet know and neighbour- 
hood, bullers are found every year ; and in fome places fo 
thick, that you may lift 3 or 4 without moving a ftep. In 
the Slaughter how, and a variety of other places, bones and 
fkeletons, may be dug up every where ; and in every little 
bog or marfh for three miles, efpecially in the Dullatur bog, 
they have been difcovered in almoft every ditch. The places 
where the bodies lie in any number, may be eafily known ; 
as the grafs is always of a more luxuriant growth in fummer, 
and of a yellowifh tinge in fpring and harveft. The hilt of a 
fword, and part of a faddle, with a variety of coins, have been 
found in different places ; and at one time, a gold ring with 
an efcutcheon was difcovered ; but it is now loft, or in the 
poffeffion of fome perfon unknown to me. 

The little hill where the gallant Graham encamped the" 
night before the engagement, is fomewhat remarkable. The 
tents have been raifed with fod, and it is eafy at this day, to 
diftinguifh the place where they flood, and the form and fize 
of each. The ftation was extremely well chofen, and gave 
him every advantage over the enemy, perhaps in a great 
meafure enabled him to decide the combat. 

The carnage muft have been dreadful. And the confe- 
quences were fatal, and long felt by the defencelefs inhabi- 
tants. Like every other civil war, it was carried on with 
the keeneft contention, and unrelenting cruelty. Many of 
the peafantry were butchered, and many more plundered. 
To this day, numberlefs fcenes of blood and cruelty are re- 
corded. One in particular is mentioned. A poor country 
man having fled with his four fons, was overtaken by a flying 
party. Being fufpe&amp;ed by them, they inftantly fell upon the 
old man, though feeble and unarmed. The generous youths

him. In this pofture it is faid, they were all cut to pieces, 
and now lie in one tomb. 

On this article I may mtntion, that there is a very fine arch- 
e d vault, or burying ground, under the ehurch. Tins was 
originally ereaed by the family of Kilfyth ; and it has been 
their burying ground for many generations. As the eaate 
was forfeited, and the title became extinft in the year 171 5, 
it has never been ufed as a burying ground fince that period. 
The unfortunate Vifcount himfelf fled to Flanders } and though 
he returned more than once, incog, in the habit of a com- 
mon beggar, and as fuch, lodged with feveral of his tenants, 
and fecured a confiderable quantity, if not the whole of his 
filver plate, yet it is certain, he was not buried in Kilfyth. 
The tradition is, and it is faid to be confirmed by a variety 
of people, and even by fome papers and letters lately found, 
that he and a number of the unfortunate Nobleffe, were 
either murdered, or died by a fudden accident in Holland, 

about the year 17 17. 

The laft that was buried in this place, was his lady. She

Lady Kilfyth with her infant fon, was fmothered or killed in Holland, or 
Flanders, by the falling of a roof, along with her hufband. It has been fup- 
pofed that the thing happened not by accident, but defign ; that feveral con- 
fiderable perfons who hud been concerned in the Rebellion 1715, were in- 
volved in it, as well as the family of Kilfyth ; and that only two of the whole

teing embalmed, was fent over to Scotland foon after, and 
buried in great pomp, at Kilfyth. It was inclofed, firft in a 
ieaden coffin, nicely cemented ; that again with a very ftrong 
wooden coffin. The fpace between the two coffins, was 
tiled up with a white matter, fomewhat of the confiftency 
and colour of putty; but of a rich and delicious aromatic 
flavour. It is but a few years ago, fince this matter was 
laid open, by the decay of the wooden coffin. And a few 
weeks ago, the lead coffin was perfedly entire. But fome 
rude thoughtlefs people, having gone to vifit the tomb, with 
facrilegious hands tore up the lead covering. To their great 
furprife, they found under it a board of fir, as clean and 
frefh, as if it had been formed yefterday. This being loofened, 
by the removal of the lead, they, to their utmoft aftonifh- 
ment, found the body of Lady Kilfyth, and her child, as 
entire as the hour they were entombed. 

Every feature, and every limb, is as full, nay the very 
fhroud is as clear and frefh, and the ribbans as bright, as 
the very day they were lodged in the tomb. What renders 
the fcene truly uiterefting as well as ftriking, is, that the 
body of her fon and only child, the natural heir of the titles 
and eltates of Kilfyth, lies at her knee. His features are as 
compofed, as if he were only afleep. His colour is as frefh, 
and his flefh as full, as if in the perfect glow of health. He 
feems to have been an infant of the age of 3 months. 

The body of Lady Kilfyth, is equally well preferved : and 
it would not be eafy for a ftranger to diftinguilh with his 
eye, whether Ihe is dead or alive. For, with the elegant

thercd in the arms of its mother.

For my part, it excited in my mind a thoufand melancholy 
refledions. But above all, the deepeft regret, that fuch vio- 
lence had been offered to her afhes, as to lay them open to view. 

Happily there is not one fold of her fhroud difcompofed, 
nor a fingle feature or member yet impaired. But I fear, 
that being now expofed to the open air, and the fine aromatic 
fluids within the coffin daily evaporating, the body muft foon 
rnoulder into dull. To prevent this, the coffin has been 
clofed with as great care as poffible, and the accefs to the 
tomb is {hut. 

The liquid in which the body has been preferved (and the 
coffin feems to have been full it, for the whole fhroud is fa- 
turated with it), feems to be a pure ardent fpirit, of the 
colour and confiftency of brandy, or rather fpirit of wine. 
But though perfeaiy pure, it has entirely loft all its pun- 
gent qualities, and feems now quite vapid. 

The tomb is an arched vault 16 feet fquare and quite {hut 
up •, but, from what it contained, the air of it is as fweet, 
pure, and odoriferous as a ball room. 

I have only to add, that there is in my pofieffion an old ma- 
nufcript, much mutilated, which feems to be a chronicle of 
Scotland. Much of it is yet legible. It takes up the hif- 
tory of Scotland at the chriftian zera ; and contains a regu» 
lar feries of all the remarkable events in every king's reign, 
with the name of the kings, down to the year 1565. I have 
compared it with many memoirs, hiftories, and annals of 
Scotland, but as far as I can yet learn, it is an original, and 
not a copy. I think it may be valuable.

This pan'fli has in common with others experienced yean 
of fcarcity, on which a few remarks are fubjoined in a note *. 

Mifcellancous 

Great fcarcity approaching to a famine. The moft remarkable was during 
the 7 !aft years of the laft century. And for that realon, they are called the 
7 dear years. There may perhaps have been one, or even two years fu'cceffivcly 
of as great fcarcity fince that period : but there neverhas been more. Of courfe 
the evil was more Iafting and more generally felt at that time, than ever fine 
and in all probability accumulated every year; tillat laft the abfolute neceffan, 
of life could fcarcely be got for any money. The price of provifions was exorbi- 
tant. Barley meal, though very inferior in quality, was fold at a merk the peck; 
oats rofe to the enormous fum of L. 30 Scots the load, while oat meal was not 
to be purchafed. For though feveral of the more opulent inhabitants went to 
FaUcirk, the richeft corn country within 30 miles, they could procure no fup- 
ply at any price. . Greens boiled with fait, became a common food. Fodder 
was as fcarce as grain. Many of the cattle perilhed at the ftall, and many of 
them who were driven out to feek a fcanty pittance expired in the field. Mo- 
thcrs fell down dead with their infants at their breafts. Even many of the peo- 
ple who furvived, were feeble and emaciated, and became a prey to numbe, left 
and fatal difeafes. The mortality was fo great, that a peftilence ferns to have 
fucceeded the famine. 

The caufes of this fcarcityare not known. But it is faid.that the harvefls were 
late, and the winters early ; fo that the froft and fnow blafted the growing corns. 

Various fhifts not known fince, were tried in order to ward off" the evil. A- 
mong the reft it is mentioned, that fnails were collected in fummer with 
great care, and falted for the winter's ftore. 

Indulgent Heaven has been mere liberal to ns. So that this generation has 
never known want, like that which our fathers experienced. The year 1 740, 
was a year of fcarcity, perhaps equal to any one of the 7 dear years. Oat meal 
rofe to the exorbitant price of is. the peck : and at one time could fcarcely be 
procured for money. Every other ncceflary of life was in proportion dear : 
yet few, if any, died of abfolute want. As money, however, was fcarce, and 
manufactures almoft unknown among us, numbers whofe fituationsgave them 
no reafon toexpeflit, were through want of employment reduced to the hu- 
miliating necefiity of craving a fcanty pittance from door to doer. Others 
wercfupplied from the poors funds, in a more private manner. The num- 
ber of Faupers was thus greatly incrcafed ; and their neceffities and demands 
increaftd in proportion. Of courfe, the parilh funds were deemed infufficient 
and an afleflment became neceftary. Yet this is the only year fince the Re- 
volution, that the fefiion were driven to this expedient.

It is almoft unneceffary to mention, that there was a conf.derable fcaraty m 
the year r,8». I believe it was generally felt ; and in other didridts more fen- 
fible than here. The potatoes though a mod luxuriant cropt were rather late, 
and they were totally loft. The corn harved was alfo late. The winter was 
early ; Co that a great part of the oats were never ripened. And no fmall part 
was rotted in the field after it was reaped. Even that part which was preferved, 
was not produdive. The following year added to the calamity, for the feed be- 
ing generally bad, and equally fcarce, the produce of courfe was fmall. The 
poorhadlefstofow, and what was fown u as much lefs productive ; fo that 
upon the whole, that year was not much more abundant than the former. 
And, had it not been for a very feafonable fupply of white peafe, both the 
poor and the rich mud have been in a deplorable condition. Even the refpec- 
table farmers, who have generally meal enough and to fpare, were reduced to 
the neceflity of buying one peck of meal after another. Yet the price never 
much exceeded is. 6d. 

The inhabitants of the village, efpecially the fociety of weavers, very wifely 
laid out a part of their funds, for purchafing that ncceflary article, at the 
lowed wholefale prices : and retailed it at prime cod. This proved a great le- 
lief to multitudes. For meal was thus almod always to be had here, and at a 
lower price than could naturally have been expected. The fociety lod little 
or nothing ; at the utmod only the intered of their money for a few months, 
In the year 1793, and 1794, the great dagnation of trade, and the almod 
total want of employment, bore hard on the manufacturing clafs of inhabi- 
tants. And had the fame circumdanccs operated in fame degree for a fingle 
year more, all ranks and denominations mud have felt the confequences.

The cloud that overcaft the fky, arofe in the fouth weft. At firft it appeared 
very fmall : but as it approached, it became darker and larger, and 
gleamed with lightning. And as the darknefs increafed, the flalhes became 
more vived. 

^ About one o'clock, this cloud reached our hills. The lightening flamed 
mceflant : the thunder roared tremendous, and the mountains feemed to 
ihake. At firft, a few droppiug fragments of broken ice of great f.ze fell. 
This was a happy warning to all who were in the fields to fly for /helter. Had 
they remained without, they muft have been greatly hurt, for fome of the hail 
meafured 3 inches in circumference 5 fome fay a great deal larger. And ic fell 
in fuch quantities, as to cover the furface fome inches deep. It was nooa 
next day before it melted away. 

The damage done by the hail was very confiderable ; and by the flood from 
the hills ftill'more fo. The barley which was beginning to ihoot, the flax, which 
was then in the bloom, and the peafe and beans, which had -begun to blofiom, 
were almoft irrecoverably loft, being cut and dallied to the ground, by the hail. 
The corns in the vallies were greatly injured by the rapidity of the flood, 
though it was only of a few hours duration. As if a water fpout had fallen, 
and fome fuppofe this was the cafe, the face of the hills, which an hour before 
were parched, was covered with numberlefs torrents, fo as to have the ap- 
pearance of a great collection of catarafls. Every rill became a river, fweep- 
inghoufes, bridges, corn, and cattle, all before it, with irrcfiflible fury. The 
confequences of this flood were felt for years, and the devaluation itoccafioned 
may yet partly be feen. Several acres in the vallies, were overlaid with Hones 
of all fizes, from ftones of 20 tons, to the fmalleft gravel. In fome places this 
layer was 4 or 6 feet deep ; and a part of them ft ill remain. At a moderate 
calculation, the damage done in this parifli, though fortunately it extended 
only to this, was upwards of L. 1000 fterling. See beginning of Mr Robe's 
narrative.

" Mr

own fire, while a cat was killed at their feet. Some women who were 
bleaching clothes in the valley, narrowly efcaped the rapidity of the torrent, 
by climbing up a thorn tree which was hard by. This thorn ftill (lands 
in the. valley. Many cattle weie fweptaway, along with the houfes in which 
they flood. It is faid, that fome of thefe were left alive, when the flood 
fubfided. It is even faid, that an infant in a cradle was carried feveral hun- 
dred yards along the ftream, and yet was found fafe. 

In the years 1769 and 70, when the great canal was cut through the Dulla- 
tur bog, there appeared a very Angular phenomenon. Myriads of fmall toads, 
eachaboutthe fize ofanut, orfmall turkey bean, were feenhopping over all the; 
adjacent fields, to the extent of feveral miles fquare. Ten, fometimes twen- 
ty or thirty, might be collected in one fquare yard. So that when you looked 
along the furface of the ground, they appeared bopping like hail ftones. 
What was very fingular, they were all going in one direction, directly 
north ; yet they were never feen beyond the fiammit of the hill ; nor 
any where in any quantity the enfuing fpring. 

It is fuppofed they came originally from the Dullatur bog, which is a large 
and very deep morafs ; and in all likelihood it has once been a lake. For at 
prefent, it is only covered with a thin matted turf, or fward. Under that, 
there is in moft places, a great body of water, though in fome, of flow mofs. 
And near the wefl end of it, there is a fmall dry rifing ground covered with 
wood, which is called the ealan, or in Englifh the ifland. From all which I am 
difpofcd to think, that in the time of the Romans, perhaps fince that periodj 
it was one deep extcnfive lake. Yet it never fent forth at any other period in 
the memory of man, any fuch fwarm of reptiles. Thefe, though innumerable, 
were all of one! age and fizc. If it were to feud forth fuch a fwaim annually, 
the whole country would loon be overrun.

Mode 



of Kilfyth. 3°7 

Mods of Living, fcfr A great variety of changes in 

the external appearance and mode of living of the inhabi- 
ants, have taken place within the laft 50 years. The 
moft' obvious and remarkable of thefe may be men- 
tioned. 

In their drefs, there is a very vifible change. Former- 
ly, the moft refpedable farmers, ufed to wear nothing but 
Scotch cloth, generally of their own making, plaiding hofe, 
and blue bonnets. Now, the fervant men on holidays 
wear nothing elfe than Englifh cloth, cotton and thread 
{lockings, and hats. The females formerly, wore nothing 
but a linen head drefs, and tartan worfted plaids, which 
covered the head, or at belt red fcarlet cloaks. Whereas 
now, every maid fervant wears a filk bonnet and cloak, 
and generally muflin or printed gowns, and thread {lock- 
ing. So that the men and women fervants, are now much 
more gay ly drefled, than their mailers and rniftreflcs were 
formerly. 

In their mode of living, fimilar if not greater changes have 
taken place. Formerly no wheat bread was ufed, excepting 
by the family of Kilfyth, or on extraordinary occafions, fuch as 
marriages, funerals, or perhapsonafair or market day. Where- 
as now, it is almoft univerfally ufed, by all denominations, 
at leaft to breakfaft. Oat meal, milk, cheefe, and butter, 
were the principal food of all, and of many the only fare. 
Little or no beef, mutton, or veal, was ufed. Even opu- 
lent farmers thought it extravagant to fait the carcafe of a 
whole cow, for winter. And the moft refpe£lable tradef- 
men never ufed more than a leg of beef, in the year. So 
that in the whole village, there were not 1 2 cows killed; 
and probably not twenty-four in the whole pnrifh. Where- 
as now, every tradefman has his mart; and every farmer 
ufes one, many two or three, in the year. So that, at an a- 

Qjl 2, verage, 



3°8 Statiftical Account 

verage, there are 160 killed in the village, and 280 i» 
the parifli every year, befides a very confiderable num- 
ber of fheep, calves, and lambs in their feafon. 

Tea was not known in this parifh 40 years ago. Whereas 
now, it is almoft univerfally ufed, and by a great many both 
in the morning and afternoon. 

The employments of the inhabitants are very different 
from what they were. The females formerly devoted by 
much the greateft part of their time to fpining flax ; the 
reft was fpent in preparing the flax and tow, and work- 
ing in the fields in fpring, hay time, and harveft. Now, 
fpinning is much difufed, efpecially by the young. Their 
are feveral hundreds of young girls from 8 to 14, who 
never fpin at all. Perhaps the greater part of them, have 
never learned that ufeful art. Tambouring is now the 
chief employment. Every fpecies of needle work occupies 
the reft ; excepting a few mothers and younger children of 
manufacturers, who are employed in preparing the yarn 
for the loom. Only a few of the farmers wives and 
fervants are employed in fpinning linen yarn. 

The males in the town for the moft part were labourers ; 
though there were a few tradefmen. Now there are a very 
few labourers, but a great proportion of tradefmen of all de- 
nominations, efpecially of weavers ; and every perfon may 
now find employment. 

This may account for a ftriking change that has taken 
place, and been much obfervcd by the older clafs, that this 
generation marries in general much younger than the for- 
mer; efpecially the tradefmen. Many of the males marry 
below 20, and the greateft part below 25 ; whereas former- 
ly they feldom married below 30. The moft part of the 
females marry below lo ; whereas formerly 25 or 30 was the 

ordinary 



of-Kilfytb. 3?9

whereas now every child, male or female, above 6 years of 
ag e, can find employment, and a numerous thnvmg family 
is a great fupport to a fober induftrious tradefman 

The common utenfils of a family are very Afferent from 
what they were 50 years ago. At that period, there were 
no tea kettles, tea dimes, bellows, nor watches, and very 
few clocks. Now, every family can furnifh thefe armies. 
There were few fpinning wheels, Hill fewer check reels ; m 
place of thefe, the rock and hand reel were ufed. There 
were no lint nor barley milns ; of courfe, the lint was dreffed 
at home, in each family ; and the barley bruifed in a ftone 
mortar. Every farmer had his own kiln for drying his corns. 
A common kiln is now erected near each miln, where every 
farmer gets his grain dried at 6d per boll. There were no 
carts nor wheel carriages of any kind. All the grain was 
carried on horfeback, or in harveft, upon Hedges or cars. 

Indeed the roads were at that time fo deep, narrow, and 
rugged, that wheel carriages muft have been almoft ufelefs. 
The line of the roads was generally ftraight, or nearly fo* 
over hill and dale; or if they deviated from this courfe at 
any time, it was only to avoid fome marfh, or to find a firm 
bottom. They feem to have thought of little elfe, at leaft 
they never dreamed of a level road. Now the roads are 
good, and carts and wheel carriages of all kinds abound. 

But the mod remarkable changes have taken place in the 
courfe of 25 years. The introduction of manufaftures, and 
the great canal, have been the principal caufes of them. 

The fpecies of manufactures mod run upon is the muflin. 
Some of thefe are only a 1000, others 1700, and even 2coo 
reed; and of every fpecies. There are at leaft 350 hands 
thus employed. Suppofing each hand to work 3 yards per

day that will amount to upwards of 300,000 yards annually. 
At 6d per yard, which may be the average, that will amount 
to L. 75 co, as the total earning of that craft yearly. By 
this account, every weaver is fuppofed to earn about L. 21 : 8s 
at an average. And it is an undoubted fa£r, that an ordinary 
tradefman can eafily earn at leaft is a-day all thenar round, 
making allowance for ordinary avocations. It is faid, that a

4s a-day, or at an average all the year round, is 5d, mak- 
ing reafonable allowances for avocations. 

N. B. The fly fhuttle is commonly ufed, and allowed to be 
a great improvement. 

Allowing him to have 3 or 4 fons working with him, 
though each fon earn but half the wages of his father, the 
amount is very confiderable, and may enable a tradefman to 
live well ; and at the fame time, provide liberally for his fa- 
mily. If he has daughters, their earnings at tambouring, 
may be very nearly at an average, 4d each day; though 
it is faid, when this branch was firft introduced, they 
could make from is to 2s a-day. Even now, they fometimes 
can earn a {billing. Suppofmg the tambourers to be 280, 
their joint earnings at 4d daily, will amount to upwards of 
L. 1200 fterling ; or nearly L. 5 annually each. But this is 
doubtlefs a very low eftimate. I fuppofe at an average of old 
and young, and making every allowance, they earn at leaft 
L. 6 each *.

* About 3 years a^o, Titus Harris from London began the cotton manu- 
factory in this parifli. From very fmall beginnings, and fome fay with no 
capital, he, in the courfe of IJ months, railed the bufincfs to a confiderable 
heighth, and employed many hands. At one time, he had 10 or ia fpinning 
jennies employed. But either owing to great mifmanagement or misfortune, 
or perhaps to Loth, he inflantly gave way ; by %vhich means, a few families ia

Various other branches of manufactures have been intro- 
duced here. But excepting the making of fickles, they have 
generally failed. At prefent, there are about 5 or 6 hands 
conftantly employed in this branch. Their earnings are not 
known , and in the fituation they are at prefent, xt would 
be improper to make them public. They furnifh generally 
about 1600 dozen of fickles every year ; and fend them all 
over Scotland, efpecially to the north. 

The making of files was alfo attempted. And it might 
have fucceeded, had it not been owing to accidental circum- 
ftances, which made it be removed elfewhere. The greateft 
number that ever were employed in this branch, was 8 or 9. 

And they furnifhed about 3000 dozen yearly. 

The ftarch manufactory was at one time begun, and there 

was a fair profped of fuccefs. But by mifmanagement or 

misfortune, it was given up. 

At prefent, there is only one who tans hides in the parifh. 

But 30 years ago, there were feverals. About that period, 

there were two breweries likewife employed •, but they are 

both given up. 

It is faid, that there are fome marks of the truth of the 
tradition, that, in Roman Catholic times, the parfon carried 

on 

this parifh, and many elfewhere, were deeply involved. It may afford fome 
pifture of the times, and of the credulity of this nation, or at leaft neigh- 
bourhood, to narrate his hiftory. With his ftaff in one hand, and his bund'.c 
in another, he arrived at Kilfyth altogether a flranger. At firft he feemed 
to have little or no command of cafh ; and of courfe little credit. Even for 
fome months, he was looked upon with a jealous eye. 

But having got fome how or other credit, or a cafh account on fome com- 
pany in London, and his bills being honoured in a few inflances at firft, he 
rapidly rofe in credit, and by addiefs and application to bufinefs, feemed to 
be in a very flourifhing way. But alas ! it was at the expence of many, and 
to the ruin of a few. The amount of his debts, was L. 4000.

on an extenfive brewery. The Gte of it, and of his (lack 
yard which was very large, were only lately dug up. 

iW.-It is not above two years fince the new line of road 
between Glafgow and Edinburgh by Cumbernauld was firft 
opened. Before that period, the principal road was by 
Kirkintilloch and Kiffyth ; and it was very much frequented 
Our little village, by being a general thorough fare, was always 
crowded, and had much the air of a bufy thriving place. 
There is now much Icfs buftle and noife, and more of the ap- 
pearance of duUnefs and defertion ; yet trade is as brifk, and 
the inhabitants except a few publicans, are as thriving as at 
any former period. Two flys, and perhaps 10 or 12 poft 
chaifes, and double the number of poft horfes, ufed to pafs 
daily. Now there is not a fingle fly, feldom a poft chaife in 
a week, and perhaps not a poft horfe in a day. The chief inn 
in Kilfyth, though almoft never clean or commodious, was 
much frequented. The publican ufed to keep one, two, or 
fometimes four poft chaifes, and from 6 to 12 poft horfes. 
Now there is neither chaife, nor almoft a poft horfe, to be 
found. Of courfe, the turnpike gate, which was formerly 
rented at L. 145, is now fo low as L. 51, and yet the profit 
to the keeper is but fmall. 

The poft-ofEce, befides affording a falary of L. 15 fter. ge- 
nerally produced between L. 36 and L. 40 yearly. Atp~re- 
fent, it yields from L. 38 to L. 40, allowing a falary of 
L. 12 annually to the poftmafter. So that in trade, there is no 
falling off. 

Advantages It remains for me to mention the peculiar 

advantages this parifh enjoys. And happily thefe are many 
and great. - The village in point of fituation, will yield to 
none. It ftands upon a gently rifing ground, a fine dry fandy 

foil, 



ofKilfyth. 313 

foil, in the middle of a rich ftrath, and it is acceflible at all 
times, as it is upon the old north road from Glafgow to Edin- 
burgh ; and what is highly favourable, it is at equal distances 
from Falkirk and Glafgow on the eaft and weft, and from 
Hamilton and Stirling on the fouth and north. The air is 
pure and falubrious. There is abundance of fpring and run- 
ning water, with both of which the town is copioufly fupplied: 
And there are in the immediate vicinity, a variety of fitua- 
tions very favourable for a bleachfield or printtield, and a- 
bundance of water-falls for machinery of almofl: any fize. In 
one place efpecially,a fall may be obtained of nearly 30 feet per- 
pendicular, within 300 yards of a good coal, near abundance of 
fine lime, and upon a beautiful pod of free ftone, where the 
ftoncs for the building might be dug out of the foundation. 
This is within a quarter of a mile of the village, and what is 
more, within lefs than an Englifh mile of the great canal. So 
that there is an open eafy accets to the German and Atlantic 
oceans, and by them to the whole world. This confideratiou 
is of great confequence to a manufacturing village. It gives 
us at once, all the advantages of an inland and fea port town 
combined. For we can export our manufactures to any port, 
and import grain or other commodities from any quarter of 
the globe, with equal eafe as at Greenock, or Grangemouth. 
The rich abundance of the carfes of Falkirk, Stirling, and 
Cowry, and of the fertile lands of Lothian, Carrick, and 
Ireland, is brought to our doors, at as eafy and cheap a rate, 
as if they were our neighbouring parilhes, within 6 or 10 
miles. 

Thefe advantages have induced a great many new fettlers to 
come among us. And Sir Archibald Edmonftone, Bart, of 
Dunbreath, and proprietor of the eftate of Kilfyth, with a 
fpirit truly liberal and generous, has given them every en- 

Yol. XVIII. R r couragement,

couragement, and has within thefe 8 years feued a complete 
new town. 

Difadvantages.—UxLt while we enjoy many advantages, and 
are abundantly fenlible of it, we labour under a few peculiar dis- 
advantages, though ltruftwe are grateful to heaven that they 
are fo few and fmall. A few of thefe difadvantages I {hall 
fhortly enumerate. 

lft, It is doubtl-rfs a confiderable lofs, that none of the 
principal heritors refide in the parifh. All claffes and denomi- 
nations, but efpecially the poor, muft feci this. The tender 
nurfing hand of a liberal landlord, is to them, a mighty bleffing. 

2d, But it is not only thofe who feel the lofs. The parifh at 
large, but efpecially the town, have caufe to regret, that there 
is not within the parifh a fingle jultice of the peace, commif- 
fioner of fupply, or magistrate, nor even a baron bailiff : fo 
that the fmallefl petty offence, or outrage, cannot be redref- 
fed without applying to fome juftice of fome neighbouring 
parifh. 

And what is ftill worfe, every idle, worthlefs vagrant, 
who can find fhelter no where elfe, is apt to refort to this 
as a place of refuge, where he may fkulk about and pilfer w ith 
mpunity. Amazing crouds of fturdy beggars infeft u^ at all 
tin es, efpecially in harveft, when all the males are at work 
in the field. At that time they not only crave a rea- 
fonable alms, but often enforce their unreafonable de- 
mand, by frightening the peaceable and indultrious inhabi- 
tants. If there be any evil which calls for redrefs in this 
place, this is one ; and to redrefs it is furely not impoflible. 

3d, It is likewife a lofs to this pariih, that we have no week- 
ly market. The peafant and manufafturer, whether in the 
town or country muft feel this. 

4th, The farmers labour under a few inconveniences. But 

they 



of Kilfytb. . 3 ! 5 

they are only few, and much more than counterbalanced, by 
the many peculiar advantages they enjoy. 

CharaBers of the Inhabitants,— The chafers of the inha- 
bitants of this parifti, are as various as their countenances ; 
as in every mixed fociety, the good and the bad are blended 
together. 

To fpeak in general terms, however, they are punctual in 
their attendance on religious ordinances, decent and devout in 
their external appearance, and regular in their manners. They 
are fober, active, and induftrious open, candid, and evea 
generous in their dealings ; loyal to their fovereign, obedient 
to all lawful authoriries ; and they ftudy to live peaceable and 
quiet lives, in all godlinefs and honefty. 

Though divided into various feels, they are to a man fteady 
friends to the proteftant perfuafion, and live together in the 
unity of the fpirit, and the bond of peace. 

Upwards of one half of the inhabitants can trace back their 
parentage, for many generations, all natives of this parifh. 
Independent in their circumftances, and of a more indepen- 
dent fpirit, they have a high fenfe of honour, and a great re- 
gard to character. 

The above will by many be deemed a nattering picture ; and 
I dare fay, I may be accufed of partiality. My only plea 
is, that I have been born and bred among them ; upwards of 
500 of them are my blood relations. For this caufe, 1 am 
perhaps better acquainted with their feelings and fentiments 
than any man, and though partial, I trull I am too upright to 
flatter them, On the contrary, Imuft acknowledge, that a- 
mong the rifing generation, there are many lefs regular in 
their manners than their fathers. 

I have many rcafons to be attached to this parifh. Where- 

R r 2 ever 



S 1 ^ Statiflical ^Account 

ever I turn my eye, I meet with the friends or companions of 
my youth. Tenderly alive to all they feel, and ajj they fear, 
I cannot but have a deep concern, and ardent defire, for their 
temporal and eternal interefts. Happy (hall I be, if living or 
dying, I can be the humble inftrument of turning even one 
of them to righteoufnefs *, 



* There is a very curious collection of old parchments in this parife. Some 
of them go nearly as far back as the Reformation. They principally refer to 
the affairs of the church, being charters or grants of lands and privileges, 
from certain abbeys to certain livings. Among the reft are fome from Cam- 
buflcenneth near Stirling. 

They might afford matter of much euriofity, perhaps furnifli fome important 
information.

By the Rev. Mr John Campbell.</head> 

<p>

Name. 

THOUGH many names of places in tins country are un- 
doubtedly of Gaelic origin, yet it is difficult to procure 
any etymology of the name of the parilh, that may be con- 
fidered as perfeaiy fatisfaftory. Ceap in Gaelic, is nearly of 
the fame import with the Englifh word cape, or promontory, 
and refembles it in found. From this the word Kippen is faid 
to be derived ; and the name is fuppofed to be defcriptive of 
the fituation of the village, which ftands on an eminence, 
near the point of the hill, which terminates at Boquhan. 
The village has exactly this appearance, when viewed from 
the north weft, as from Cardrofs, or the cppofite braes of 
Monteath. 

Situation and Limits. — The parifh of Kippen lies within 
the counties of Perth and Stirling under the ecclefiaflical 
iurifdicYion of the Prefbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of 
Perth and Stirling. It is bounded on the north by the river 

Forth,

Forth, Which feparates it f rom the pati%fi of ^ ^

barton pailes through this parifh for 7 miles , it is more, 
however, than 8 miles in length, between the diftant extre- 
mities. Its breadth is unequal ; generally from 2 to 3 miles - 
at the middle of the parifh, it is nearly 4 miles broad. ' 

■ Boundaries of Stirling and Perth &amp;W-One might have 
expected that the river Forth, which forms a natural limit 
this panfh for feveral miles, mould have alfo ferved as 
boundary to the fhire 0 f Perth. This county however, i„ 
two or three places, paffes over this natural limit, and be- 
comes indented in the county of Stirling 5 fo that about one 
third part of the parifh of Kippen, lies in Perthfhire, the 
other two thirds in Stirlingfhire. Such an irregularity feems 
now furprifing. But it is well known, that ancient proprie- 
tors had influence to get fuch portions of their eftates as they 
ehofe, disjoined from thofe counties within which they were 
locally fituated, and conneded with fuch other counties, as 
better fuited their convenience. Other inftances of this kind, 
and more remarkable than in the cafe before us, might eahly 
be adduced in fupport of this obfervacion *„

the home of Cartmore, commanding &amp; view of fcHe whole 
„lain below, which extends eaftward for 20 or 30 mdes. 
The houfe and policy of Cardrofs, a few miles farther down 
the country, greatly enliven the landfcape. The carfe, a 
rich and beautiful valley, exhibits an inclofed and well cul- 
tivated country, embellifhed with numberlefs farms, and 
gentlemen's feats ; and in fummer and autumn, often loaded 
with luxuriant crops. So rich and extenfive a fcenery is 
rarely to be feen. The dufky fpots which are covered with 
mofs, pleafe by contrail ; and the imagination is gratified by 
anticipating the period, when the mofs mail be cleared away, 
and its room occupied by the ufeful produdions of the earth, 
and the habitations of men. Stirling caftle, and the rocks of 
Craig-forth and Abbeys-craig, appear on the eaft, like iflands 
emerging out of the carfe. The braes of Monteath rife on 
the northern fide, like an amphitheatre. And a rugged range 
of the Grampian mountains, ftretching from Benlomond to 
the OchUls, eucompaffes the whole. Thus the eye is at 
once gratified, with a profpeft of rude and cultivated nature, 
and with a furvey of the noble effe&amp;s of human induftry 
and art. 

Carfe.— The parifh of Kippen is divided by nature into the 
carfe and dryfield. The former confifts of the level ground 
that lies on the fouth fide of the Forth, between that river 
and the rifing grounds. It is of unequal breadth, from half 
a mile to a mile, and in fome places more ; and forms a part 
of that extenfive plain, which reaches from Gartmore on 
both fides of the river, as far eaftward as Borrowftounnefs. 
In different places in this parifh, it is covered with mofs to 
the extent of 300 or 400 acres. 



Mofs* — There feems reafon to believe, that the greater p:irt

both feparate and colleaed into beds, are found throughout 
Ibe carfe ; and * „ not long fmce fi&amp; bones of a confident 
Cze, have been met with in the neighbourhood of Stirling. 
The mafs ox clay would naturally be accumulated and levelled 
by the operation of d» cides. The period in which this part 
of the country was under water, mult be very remote, as on 
this fubjecl both hiftory and tradition are equally filent. 
After the receffion of the water,, the fame fpace muft have 
been occupied with trees and fhrubs. Thefe would be pro- 
duced by the fame caufes, which, in procefs of time, cover 
ground that is left without culture, with various vegetable 
productions. A foreft would at laft appear; and by the fall 
and putrefadion of tins foreft, the mofs, in its prefent ftate, 
has unqueftionably been formed. Oaks of a great fize, are 
flail found on the fubjacent earth, where the mofs has been 
cleared away. Many of thefe are in good prefervation ; 
when expofed to the air for fome time, they become hard ; 
and when put to ufe, prove very durable. They are rarely 
fcrviceable for furniture ; but fuit very well for roof timber, 
ftobs, and bridges over mofs ditches. Other trees, fuch as 
birch, alder, black-faugh, rowan, hawthorn, and hazle, are 
alfo found ,- hazle nuts are frequently met with. The trunks 
or bodies of thefe trees, are generally confumed ; but the - 
roots remain. It is natural to enquire, how this great foreft 
fhould happen to be overthrown. A hurricane of wind oc- 
curs at firlt, as a poflible caufe of this great effeft. But in 
this cafe it is obvious, that the trees muft either have been 
broken about the middle, or torn up by the roots, and would 

be

be found uniformly lying in the direaion of the current. 
But the roots are generally found (landing in the clay ; the 
trunks fcparated from them a little above the ground, lying 
in all direftions ; and fometimes, on the oaks particularly, the 
marks of an ax or hatchet have been traced. The teftimony 
of feveral hiftorians of credit, as well as other authentic mo- 
numents, lead us to a difcovery of the authors of this grtat 
cataftrophe. When the Romans pufhed their conquefts into 
Britain, our anceftors, the Britons and Caledonians, were for- 
ced by the victorious legions to retire to their hills, or fecure 
themfelves in thofe extenfive forefts, with which the ifland 
then abounded. From thefe ftrong holds they fallied forth as 
opportunity offered, and by their frequent incurfions, not 
only annoyed the armies of their conquerors, but enriched 
themfelves with booty. From the fpeech of Galgacus, given 
by Tacitus in his life of Agricola, it appears that the Romans 
had been much employed in cutting down forefts and draining 
morafTes, with a view to fecure themfelves againft fuch pre- 
datory attacks from the natives. But to put an effectual ftop 
to thefe depredations, in the laft expedition of the Emperor 
Severus, general orders were iffued to cut down all the forefts 
throughout this part of the ifland. This fervice was per- 
formed by the Roman legions, aflifted by thofe natives whom 
they had been able to fubjugate. Herodian * concifely mentions 
this fact. Dion Cafllus f, whofe account is mere particular, 
Vol. XVIII. S s informs 

* * Lib. III. c. 48. 

f Xiphilin. ex Dione, lib. 39. The paflage relative to this fubjedt in the 
abrklger of Dion, is curious and interefting. " Quam Severus, quum vellet om «

informs us, that in this expedition, the Romans loft no lefs 
than 50,000 men. We need not wonder then at the fpeed 
and fuccefs, with which this great undertaking was accom- 
plifhed * In the mofs of Kincardine, a Roman way, 12 feet 
wide, and regularly formed by trees or logs of wood laid a- 
crofs each other, is ftill to be traced \. And a Roman camp 
kettle was found in the year 1768, in the lands of Mr Ram- 
fay of Ochtertyre, which has been prefented by him to the 
Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh. Such are the grounds 
on which it is believed that the foreft in this part of the coun- 
try was cut down by the Romans ; moft probably in the ex- 
pedition of Severus, A. D. 207, whilft Donald I. reigned in 
Caledonia. He was the firft Scottifh prince (according to 
Buchanan %) who embraced Chriftianity. The overthrow 
of this foreft would naturally interrupt the courfe of thofe va- 
rious ftreams which formerly ran through the valley. This

f In Mofs Logan in this parifh, a way has lately been difcovered, which from 
all accounts, in refpeft of breadth and conftruftion, exactly refembles that in the 
mofs of Kincardine. But as the information concerning it was received only 
fince this account was drawn up, no opportunity has yet offered of examining 
it fo particularly, as to authorize a more decided opinion refpedling its origin.

body of ftagnant water, fwelled from time to time by rains, 
and melted fnow, and rivulets defcending from the heights, 
would continue to increafe till it became fo confiderable as to 
open a paflage for itfelf to the eaft. And thus the valley, at 
that period, muft have exhibited the appearance of a vaft mo- 
rafs. The wood and leaves, and other vegetable fubftances, 
all rotting together, would in time accumulate, and form the 
great body of the mofs. The confolidation of this mafs of 
corrupted vegetables would leave room for the water above 
it, to run off by fuch channels as it could find or form. By 
fuch a procefs in a feriesof ages, it is natural to imagine, that 
this mofs has been brought into the (late in which it now 
appears. 

Cafting of Peats.— -The foil underneath the mofs is a ftrong 
rich clay. The mofs is generally from 8 to 10 feet in depth, 
and confifts of different fubftances, regularly difpofed in ftrata, 
as follows. Immediately above the clay is a flratum of fat 
brown earth, from 9 to 12 inches in depth, fuppofed to have 
been formed by the incorporation of the clay with the conti- 
guous mofs, and which feems to have been the vegetable mold, 
covering the clay when the foreft was cut down. The next 
bed lying immediately above the former, is the great body of 
the mofs, which confifts of various vegetable fubftances, cor- 
rupted, compared, and matured by age. This is annually 
cut for peats, and fupplies mod families in this country with 
fuel through the year. The upper ftratum is a light and fpon- 
gy fubftance, much paler in the colour than the bed of peat 
mofs. It feems to be formed chiefly of decayed leaves and 
(talks of heath, bent grafs, and other plants with which the 
furface of the mofs is overgrown, but not yet fufHciently cor- 
rupted fo as to be formed into mofs. Of this upper ftratum, 
3 or 4 feet muft always be pared away, which is generally done

in winter, and thrown by the fpade into the pit out of which 
the peats were taken in the preceding year. It then forms 
the fpreadfield, or ground upon which the new peats are laid 
out to be dried. As the whole of it cannot be thus difpofed 
of, the remainder is by means of little canals formed for the 
purpofe, floated down into the Forth. The peats are always 
caft as foon as poflible after feed- time, and are carried home 
in the courfe of the fummer 0 r harveft. It was a remarkable 
proof of the uncommon wetnefs of the feafon 1 792, that few 
peats were got home that year, but remained on the fpreadr 
field till next fummer. This circumftance had not happened, 
before in the memory of man, and neceflarily fubje£ted poorer 
families to very great inconvenience. 

Clearing away of Mofs. — As the carfe foil is fo valuable, it 
muft be an object of importance to the proprietors, to have the 
fuperjacent mofs cleared away *. Thofe portions of land, 
which in this parifh are recovered from the mofs, are fuch as 
lie under old fpreadfields, from which the peats have formerly 
been taken. This operation is generally performed in winter. 
The water which comes down from the higher grounds in burns, 
or rivulets contiguous to the mofs, is by means of fmall duels 
or canals introduced into the fpreadfield which is intended to 
be put away. The fpreadfield having been previoufly inter- 
fered with thefe canals, of a proper depth and width, its fub- 
ftance is, by many hands, thrown into thefe when water can 
be had in plenty, and thus carried down into the river. Much 
yet remains to be done, before the arable land is procured.

roots, fome fmall, many very large, muft be digged up. Ia 
ome places this operation muft be repeated oftener than once. 
Such of thefe fragments as are unfit for any ufeful purpofe, 
are burnt when dry, generally in the months of May and June 
The afhes, with what remains of the mofs, and brown earth 
formerly mentioned, when judicioufly mixt with the clay, 
form together one of the beft foils. Some pains are alfo re- 
cuifite to level the inequalities, which is beft done at firft, to 
to prevent the water from (landing in the hollows. The clear- 
ing away of the fpreadfield was formerly done for L. 40 Scots, 
or L. 3:6:8 fter. per acre ; but fince wages have increafed 
it will coft from L. 5 to L. 6 fter. In this manner in a courfe 
of years, a confiderable quantity of land has been gained from 
the mofs, worth from 15s- to 20s. fter. per acre. The carfe 
foil, in favourable feafons, produces rich crops of every kmd 
of grain common in this country ; particularly wheat, beans 
and peafe, and oats ; barley is not fo certain a crop. 

Hfl^.-Befides the mofs, and the land recovered from it, 
there is along the banks of the Forth, a narrow ftrip of haugh 
or holm, which is very fertile, and equally adapted to tillage, 
or pafture. 

Drrfeld. —From the carfe, the lands rife at firft abruptly, 
and then very gradually for about a mile, or more in fome. 
places ; continuing flat for a confiderable fpace, they again 
decline towards the fouth. This elevated part of the paiifh, 
is called the dryfield; a term which is by no means defcriptive 
of the nature of the foil, but is ufed merely to diftinguifh it 
from the lower grounds or carfe. Where it firft fprings from 
the carfe, it is marked by all thofe appearances which the 
banks of rivers that have been deferted by them exhibit. 
The interjacent valley between this parifti, and the green

hills of Boquhan and Glinns, is very narrow % t the eaftern 
extr^y Towards the weft, the country is more open " 
From the fouthern boundary, moft of the baronies in this 
Pjrift are laid off, parallel to each other, down to the fides 
of the Forth. The dryfield of Kippen forms the greater part 
of that hill, which, commencing at the bridge of Boquhan 
and extending through the whole of this parifh, and part of 
the parifhes of Balfron and Drymen, terminates about a mile 
weftward from the village of Balfron. The land which lies 
on its northern declivity, forms the main body of the parifh 
of Kippen, and exhibits a pleafing view of fruitful fields, 
generally well inclofed, and occafionally interred with glens 
and rivulets. 



Moor of Kippen.—Towards the fummit and fouthern decli- 
vity of the hill, on which it hath been obferved, that the 
greater part of this parifh is fituated, there is an extenfive 
moor, called the moor of Kippen, which runs the whole 
length of the parifh, and comprehends alfo part of Balfron. 
On the fouth fide, the ground which is lighter, and not fo 
good as that on the north fide of the hill, Hopes gradually for 
half a mile or more, and is terminated by a fmall rivulet cal- 
led the Pow of the Glinns, which divides Kippen from Bal- 
fron. This water runs eaftward, till it falls into the burn of 
Boquhan, which again forms the boundary between Kippen 
and Gargunnock, and empties itfelf into the Forth, at the 
bridge of Frew. Another fmall ftream, weft from the for- 
mer, takes a different courfe, and runs weftward into, the 
water of Endrick, which finally goes into the Clyde. Under 
the moffes in the moor of Kippen, are found fome oaks and 
other trees, though not fo large as thofe in the low mofs on 
the fides of the Forth. It is probable that the whole dryfield 
has been covered with wood, moftly oak ; for on the fides of 
2 the 



of Kippen. 3 2 7 

the glens, through which the water collected in the moor 
runs down into the Forth, the trees grow thick, and within 
thefe 50 years, ftocks of oaks with young (hoots growing 
from them have been feen in different places : thefe however, 
are now rooted out, and the fields cleared for the plough. 

Stones.— The moor abounds with red and white free-ftone. 
On the fouthern boundary lime-ftone is alfo found. This 
lime-ftone, containing a confiderable portion of fand, fuits 
the carfe well, but is not thought fo proper for the dry- 
field. 

Lake.— In the moor, there is a fmall lake or refervoir of 
water called Loch-leggan about a mile in circumference. 
A fmall dream iffues from it, which turns feveral mills. In 
the middle of the loch, there is a cairne, or heap of ftones, 
fuppofed to be the ruins of an old houfe, of which however, 
no authentic accounts can now be obtained. There are no 
fifh in the loch, but a few perches of a fmall fize. Trouts 
are to be, had in the feveral rivulets which run into the Forth : 
the burn of Boquhan affords them in greateft plenty. 

River Forth. — The river Forth has but a mean appearance 
in this part of the country. It is confined within narrow and 
deep banks, and except in a few places, its current is fo very 
flow, as hardly to be perceptible. From Gartmore to Stir- 
ling, a line of 20 miles, the fall of the river is faid not to 
exceed, on an average, a foot in the mile. The banks of the 
Forth, are from 10 to 20 feet j and in fome places more from 
the furface of the bank, to the bottom of the river. Many 
large trees are {till found in the bottom ; and fome appear 
with their ends projecting from the banks, as the water wafh- 
es away the clay. They are found at different depths, from 

6 



3 28 Statiflical Account 

6 to 20 feet below the furface of the bank ; and in all direc- 
tions, fome lying horizontally, others {landing almoft upright. 
The river contains both pike and perch. In former times, 
falmon ufed to come up in abundance, but fince the moffes 
began to be cleared away, they have not been taken in any 
confiderable quantity. ■ There are two bridges over the Forth 
in this parifh ; one near Cardrofs built in 1772, the other at 
Frew, built in 1783 ; both at prefer* are in good repair.

Natural Curioftties.—" The burn of Boquhan, which, de- 
fending from the rock of Ballochleam, makes little im- 
" predion on the ftrata of lime-ftone or iron, meets at laft 
" with the red fand-ftone, through which it has opened a 
" paflage, and wrought its foft materials into a number of 
" curious {hapes, fuch as the wells and caldrons of the De- 
von. It is yet remembered, when it burft through a large 
projection of the rock, and threw the mill with all its ap- 
pendages, on the other fide of the bank * " — In the garden 
of Broich, there is a yew tree, of a regular conical form, 
whofe branches (hooting regularly from the trunk, with their 
extremities falling down to the ground, exhibits the appear- 
ance of a large umbrella to thofe who (land under its fhade. 
The circumference of the trunk about 2 feet above the ground, 
is 10 feet j height of the trunk to the lowcft row of branches, 
9 feet ; height of the tree, about 50 feet j circumference of 
the circle overfpread by the lower branches, 140 feet. It is 
fuppofed to be 200 or 300 years old ; and though it may not 
vie with the yew of Fortingal, muft ftill be allowed to be a 
beautiful object.

rnve been places of ftrength. Thus the caftle of Arnfindlay, 
of which no veftiges now remain ; the tower of Garden, part 
of which, was (landing 20 or 30 years ago ; the remains of 
the houfe and caftle of Arnprior, may ftill be traced. The 
houfe of Broich too, feems to have been furrounded with a 
rampart and fofle. A frnall green mound on the eaftern con- 
fines of the lands of Buchlyvie, appears to have been a tumu- 
lus. Some human bones, inclofed in flags of ftone, were 
lately found in it ; but there is no tradition which gives any 
account of its origin.— Some years ago, an urn containing 
afhes and bones, was found in the Caftle-hill of Dafher. 
There are feveral fmall heights in this parifh, to which the 
name Keir* is applied, which bear the marks of fome ancient 
military work, viz. Keir-hill of Glentirran, Keir-hill of Da- 
fher, Keir-brae of Drum, Keir-know of Am more, and 
Keir-brae of Garden. On the fummit of each of thefe, there 
is a plain of an oval figure, furrounded with a rampart, 
■which in moft of them ftill remains entire. The Peel of Gar- 
deny (on which there is a work of the fame kind,) is lefs ele- 
vated in point of fituation ; it rifes but a little above the 
carfe. The inclofure however is confiderably larger than that 
of the Keirs ; and the rampart and ditch, in refpeft of form 
and appearance, have fuffered lefs from the injuries of time. 
None of thefe are of fufficient extent to have ever admitted 
of a regular encampment. The circumference of the rampart 
on the Keir-hill of Dafher, (which is neither the largeft nor 
the fmalltft, and the only 'one that has been mcafur d,) does 
not exceed 130 yards. Various opinions have been entertain- 
ed concerning thefe works. The country people fay that 
they were PicYifh forts. A different conjecture fuppofes 
Vol. XV'UI. T t them

them to have been temporary forts, or fhtions erefted by 
he Romans, for giving finals, depofiting provifions and 
"ores, and proving their pioneers from the attacks of the 
Caledonians, whilft employed in cutting down the great 
foreft m the plain below. This conjecture, it is imagined, 
rece.ve, fome fupport from the confideration, that places of 
a fimilar form are found in other parts of the country, into 
Which the Romans are known to have penetrated. Others 
unwilhng to admit their pretenfions to fo high antiquity,' 
believe them to have been formed by the feudal proprietors; 
for fome purpofes of fecurity or convenience, which it may 
be difficult now to difcover. It is furely matter both of fur- 
prife and regret, that no certain account can now be obtain- 
ed of the origin and ufe of thefe works; which apparently 
have formed a part of fome extenfive fyftem, the develope- 
ment of which might ferve to illuftrate the ancient ftate 
and hiRory of our country * — A difpute having arifen be-

* There feems to be a confiderable refemblance between thefe forts, and 
the forts of the Firbolgs, of which an account is given in Grofe- S Antiquities 
of Ireland The paffage alluded to, is extracted from that work in the 
Monthly Review, for December 1794, page 394 • and was not feen by the 
writer of this account, till after it was prepared for the prefs. The infer- 
tion of the paffage may perhaps be gratifyng to fome readers. " The forts 
" common in this peiiod, will be feen to be perfectly confident with the rude 
" (late of the military art among the Firbolgs ; though very fupcrior to thofe 
" of the Celtes. The Irilh, who retained the cuftoms of the latter, Cam- 
" brenfis tells us, had no catties ; their woods ferved them for camps, and 
" their marines for ditches. However, they learned from the Firbolgs, to 
" take refuge on hills, as Ca:far fays the Britons did. Thefe were conical 
" r 'f |n g grounds, which were encircled with a fingle, double, or triple en- 
*' trenchmcnt, and which afforded ample protedion ; fuch were the infinite

tween the inhabitants of the baronies of Glentirran and Arn- 
prior, refpeaing the courfe of the dream that iflues from 
Loch-Ieggan, the parties met at a place near the loch, deter- 
mined to decide the conteft by arms. In this affray, feveral 
perfons were killed ; from which circumftance, the place 
bears the name of Bloody mires. King James V. who then 
rcfided at Stirling, having taken cognifance of this matter, 
ordered the ftream to be taken from both, and turned into 
the channel, which it ftill retains. He likewife ordered the 
neiv mill to be built, which, being confidered as a royal mill, 
pays a feparate cefs to this day — During the arbitrary reigns 
of Charles II. and James II, the inhabitants of this parifh 
fuffered greatly from the perfecution and tyranny which then 
prevailed. Mr Ure of Shirgarton, a gentleman of diftinguilh- 
ed piety and zeal, underwent various hardfhips, the memo- 
ry of which is ftill preferved by tradition in the neighbour- 
hood*, — In the year 1676, the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup- 
per was difpenfed in the night, to a very numerous meeting 
at Arnbeg-}-. The minifters who aflifted in difpenfing that 
ordinance, were Meflrs. John Law, after the Revolution 
minifter at Edinburgh, Mr Hugh Smith at Eaftwood, and 
Mr Matthew Crawford. — A chapel formerly flood near the 
eaftern boundary of the parifh, befide the old manfion-houfe 
of Glentirran. The remains of it were feen within thefe 
few years. It is faid to have been built for the accommodation 
of the parifhes of Gargunnock and Kippen, in confequence 
of the indulgence granted by King James. A Mr Barclay 
then officiated as minifter. — In former times, the highland

clans, which were fituated on the borders of the low country 
were accuftomed to fubfift in a great meafure, by rapine and 
plunder. In the year 1691, a party of thefe free-booters 
vifited this parifh, to the great terror and lofs of the country. 
They were commanded by old Rob Roy, a robber by profef- 
fion, who pretended to have a commiffion from King James 
« to plunder the rebel whigs." The peaceable inhabitants 
were obliged to flee for their fafety, and leave their property 
to the rapacity of this banditti, who feized upon cattle, vic- 
tual, furniture, Sec. and carried away as much as they were 
able. Only one man, fervant to Sir James Livingfton, was 
killed upon that occafion. This aft of depredation was re- 
membered by the fathers of feveral perfons ftill living, and is 
known by the name of the herrifjip * of Kippen.— In the year 
1745, the rebel army paffed the Forth by the ford of Frew 
on their way to Stirling. The inhabitants were obliged to 
furnifh provifions for the fupply of their immediate necefii- 
ties ; but their march was not marked by any other acts of 
violence. 

Population.— It is probable, that the pariih of Kippen was 
more populous in former times, than it is at prefent. The 
enlargement of the farms, neceffarily occafioned the fall of 
the cotteries, which afforded fubfiftence to many families. 
In confequence of the encouragement offered by the manu- 
facturing companies, lately eftablimed at Baifron, many fa- 
milies as well as individuals have removed to that village. 
A considerable decreafe has taken place within thefe laft 1 o 
years. 

In 1755, the number of inhabitants, according to Dr 
Webfter's account, amounted to

Pari/h Regifter, — There are no records extant previous to 
the commencement of the prefent century. From 1700 to 
1745, the regifter of marriages and baptifms appears to have 
been kept with confiderable accuracy. For the 12 following 
years, the regifter of marriages feems to have been entirely 
neglected. From that period too, many parents who had 
joined the feceflion, neglected to get their children's names 
enrolled in the parifh regifter. For this reafon, the regifter, 
efpecially of baptifms, cannot be confidered as exhibiting a 
complete enumeration of the children born in the parifh from 
that time downward *. It may alfo be obferved, that as the 
names of parties enrolled with a view to proclamation of 
banns, when they happen to refide in different parifhes, are 
regiftered in both the parifhes to which they feverally belong ; 
this circumftance muft make the number of marriages appear 
greater than it is in reality. And therefore in calculating 
the whole population of Scotland, fo far as regard is had to 
the authority of parochial regifters, it may be laid down as a 
maxim, that the number of marriages will upon the whole 
exceed, and that of baptifms fall fhort of the truth. In this, 
as well as in moil country parifhes, no account of burials was 
kept till within thefe few years ; nor can the regifter of thefe 
be confidered as perfectly accurate. 

Climate, Health, Djfeafes.—The climate is wet, on account, 
probably, of the vicinity of the hills, and the prevalence of 
wefterly winds. A regifter of the weather was kept for many 

years 

* Of late years, care has been taken to render the regfflcr of baptifms 
more complete than formerly.

changes, mcapable of being daffed orconneded, fo as to 
. form any ufefuJ rule, or any obfervations on the weather 
or feafons that can be depended upon in this country." 
The chmate though wet, does not appear to be unhealthy, 
winch may be attributed perhaps to the frequency of hi/h 
wmds, which prevent the vapours from becoming ftagnant. 
The number of aged perfons at prefent in the parifh appears 
from the preceding tables ; within the few laft years, two 
perfons have dted near the age of xoo - A pleafant and un- 
common fpe&amp;acle of health and induftry is feen in this village; 
an old man, his fon, and grandfon, all fmiths, of one name, 
dwelling in the houfe in which they were born, and continu- 
ing to follow their occupation in the fame Ihop from d„y to 
day. The inhabitants of this part of county are not fubjeft 
to any difeafe that can be confidered as peculiar to the climate. 
The ague is faid in former times to have prevailed in the 
carfe. it is now extremely rare, at leaft in the parifh of 
Kippen. Epidemical difeafes are not frequent. In the fpring 
months of years 1785 and 1787, a pleuretic fever prevailed, 
which carried off a number of people. The year 1788 was 
fatal to fome old people and children. Of the uncommon 
mortality in thefe years, the opennefs of the preceding win- 
ters cannot properly be affigned as the caufe ; for they were 
not more open, perhaps lefs fo, than feveral fucceeding fea- 
fons which were accompanied with no fuch confcquences. 
The fmall-pox and meafles are fometimes fatal to children. 
Inoculation is rather gaining ground, though flowly. It is fur- 
prifing that any prejudice fhould remain againft a practice, 
which experience hath proved to be fo falatary. Dr Leckie, 
(whofe pra&amp;ice both in this country and the Weft Indies, has 
been very extenfive,) declares, «* that only two of all thofe

« ing inoculated ; the other in lefs than 3 days. He has re- 
« fided above 40 years in Kippen, and inoculated above 20 
" yearly at an average". 

Remarkable Medical Cafe.— It may not be improper in this 
place to mention the remarkable cafe of a boy who loft a 
confiderable portion of brain, and yet recovered, without 
detriment to any faculty mental or corporeal. On the ift of 
July 1792, William Stewart, a fervant boy, about 14 years 
of age, was by a blow from the foot of a horfe knocked to the 
ground, and left in a (late of infenfibility. From a large 
wound on the right fide of his fore-head, blood ilTued in con- 
fiderable quantities, as well as at different times, a confidera- 
ble portion of the fubftance of the brain. The boy not o ily 
furvived the accident, but recovered, and was feen perfectly 
well, by the writer of this account in the month of November 
following. A di(tinc~r. account of this cafe, and of the whole 
procefs of the cure, was publifhed by Mr Robert Leny, a 
young gentleman, practitioner in phyfic, which deferves the 
attention of thofe who are curious in phyfiology. It is inferted 
in the Medical Commentaries, publifhed by Dr Duncan of 
Edinburgh, for 1793, p. 301. 

Church, Manfe, &amp;c. — The church is faid to have been 
built or rebuilt in 1691. The eaftsr part of it was rebuilt in 
1 737. It was completely repaired in 1 779, and is now a very 
decent and commodious place of worfhip — William Leckie 
of Dafher made a prefcnt of a very good bell to the parifli.— - 
The prefcnt manfe was built in 1706. The ftipend by the 
lad decreet of augmentation in 1763 is nearly 89 bolls of 
meal, together with L. 34 : 3 '.4 fter. which fum includes the

ordinary allowances for communion elements, and grafs mail 
-James Erfkine Efq. of Cardrofs is patron. Were all pa- 
trons, in the difpofal of vacant benefices, to fhew the fame 
regard to the wifhes of the parifhioners which this gentleman 
has uniformly done, the practical evils which have often been 
complained of as refulting from the exercife of patronage, 
would not be felt. 

Meeting-houfi* — A meeting-houfe in connexion with the 
Antiburgher feceders was built at Buchlyvie in 1751. The 
minifter has L. 50 fter. as ftipend, arifing from the feat 
rents, with a houfe and garden. The congregation is gather- 
ed from the feveral contiguous parifhes. The members of 
the feceflion have laid afide much of that morofenefs and 
acrimony which diftinguifhed their prcdeceflbrs, and in gene- 
ral maintain good neighbourhood with their brethren of the 
eftablifhed church. There is a burying place connected with 
the meeting-houfe. 

School.f-lt muft be obvious that one parochial fchool is 
entirely inadequate to the extent and populoufnefs of this pa- 
nfh. To remedy this inconvenience, various plans have been 
at different times propofed. It has long been found abfolute- 
ly neceffary to have another fchool at the weft end of the 
parifh. But the heritors felt reluctance to impofe upon 
themfelves the burden of two parochial fchools. A fchool- 
mafter who was admitted in 1752 was taken bound to pro- 
vide at his own charge two teachers, the one at Buchlyvie, 
the other at the burn of Arnprior, for fix months in the year; 
or to have 50 merks retained from his falarly, which was then 
L. 100 Scots. It was afterwards propofed to remove the 
parochial fchool to a convenient fituation in the center of the 
parifhj and to have only one teacher. Ar hft it was deter- 
mined 



of Kippen. 339 

mined in 1 763 to have two eftablifhed fchools ; the falary was 
advanced to L. 115 Scots, of which L. 75 M Plotted to the 
fchoolmafter at Kippen, the remaining L. 40 to the other 
teacher. In the year 1782 a fchoolhoufe, including a 
dwelling-houfe for the mafter, was built at Claymires. It is in 
fufficient repair and tolerably commodious. The fchool- 
mafter at Kippen is but indifferently accommodated. In for- 
mer times, a houfe was occafionally rented for the fchool, 
and the mafter was feldom accommodated with a dwelling- 
houfe. The fchool was held in the church for fome time 
previous to its reparation in 1779. Since that time a houfe 
has been rented, on a long leafe, for a fchool-houfe, and dwell- 
ing-houfe for the mafter ; neither of which, however, are 

very commodious In the fchool at Kippen, are taught 

reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latin, and 
church mufic. The whole emoluments of the fchoolmafter, 
including his falary and fees as feffion clerk, may amount an- 
nually to L. 25 or L. 30 fterling *. As the diftance from the 
two eftablifhed fchools is more than 4 miles, the inhabitants 
of the intermediate diftrift find it convenient to employ a 
teacher during the winter months to inftru£t younger children 
in the elements of reading and writing. The number of 
fcholars laft winter, when the fchools were mo.ft frequent, 
was at Kippen 60, at Arnprior 36, at Claymires 64. 

Poor. — The funds for fupply of the poor in this parifh arife, 
from the weekly collections, dues from marriages, from the 
mortcloth, occafional fines from delinquents, together with 
L. 13 : 10, the intercft at 4f per cent of L. 300 fter. which at

different periods has been mortified by individuals for behoof 
of the poor of the parifh. Of this fum" 2000 merks, or 
L. 1 11 : 2 : 2 A fter. was mortified by the late Walter M'Lach- 
lan of Wefter Colbowie, the intereft of which in terms of his 
will muft be diftributed among the poor in Buchlyvie. The 
half of this fum was left to the difpofal of the affociate feffion 
at Buchlyvie, whofe intromiffions were to be fubjea to the 
review of the kirk -feffion of Kippen ; but they declining to 
accept of the management on thefe conditions, the whole was 
given to the kirk feffion of Kippen. On this account a fepa- 
rate book is kept for recording the diftributions that are made 

to the poor in the barony of Buchlyvie. The annual a- 

mount of the funds muft neceffarily vary. From L. 40 to 
L. 50 is diftributed every year. The number of the poor 
is alfo variable. In 1792 the number of ordinary penfioners 
on the lift was generally 22, who received in different fums, 
according to their neceffities, the higheft L. 2 : 7, the loweft 
9s. or (os. in the courfe of the year. Befides the ftated dif- 
tributions, occafional fupply is alfo granted to perfons who 
fuffer from temporary diftrefs — In 1782 the heritors bought, 
and diftributed a quantity of oatmeal to the moft neceffitous, 
below the market price. With a view to prevent improper 
applications, it has fometimes been required that thofe who 
receive fupply, fhould affign to the feffion for behoof of the 
poor all the property they may die poffeffed of, after the 
houfe rent and funeral charges are paid. But the neceffity of 
this meafure is not very urgent, whilft the poor in general 
difcover fo much reluctance to accept of public charity. — The 
funds are managed by the kirk- feffion, who keep regular ac- 
counts of their intromiffions ; thefe are occafionally revifed and 

homologated by the heritors Objections have fometimes 

been made to the payment of the fafaries of the prefbytery 
eltrk and officer, and of the fynod clerk, which altogether a-

r / U r d -ided for payment of thefefala.es, the altera-

R iven to the liberality of thofe who brought it forward But 
on what principle of juftice, it fhould be attempted to devolve 
this burden on the clergy, it is furely difficult to d.fcove, 

On the whole, it is believed that no better plan can be 

devifed for taking care of the poor, than that which is gene- 
tally praaifed throughout Scotland. And whilft the mem- 
bers of kirk-feffions continue to aft with fidelity and prudence, 
their gratuitous performance of a fervice, which is accom- 
panied with confiderable trouble, undoubtedly entitles them 
to the gratitude and fupport of their country. 

Fillages.-The village of Kippen ftands about a mile dif- 
tant from the eaftern boundary of the parifh, and contains 
7 6 families. Buchlyvie, which is 5 miles farther weft, is a 
larger village, and contains 102 families. The greater part 
, of the inhabitar's of both thefe villages confifts of labourers 
' and trades people of different defections. There are feveral 
merchants alfo, who fupply us not only with rye grafs, clover, 
lint feed, and wool, but with molt articles of perfonal and 
domeftic confumpt. 

Fairs and Markets. — Five fairs are held in the village of 
Kippen, and as many in Buchlyvie in the courfe of the year. 
Befides which, there is a weekly market in Kippen, in each 
Wednefday, for 3 or 4 weeks, in the month of December.

Prices of Labour, feWt muft be of ufe to record the 
price of labour, and of the provifions and various commodi- 
ties u-h,ch are produced and confumed in a country, as no 
circumftance tends more to afcertain its relative fituation 
with refpeft to other countries, and to itfelf, both in former 
and fubfequent times.— About 40 years ago the wages of 
men-fervants were about L. 2, of women from 153 to 16s 8d 
a-year, with bounties. Thofe who were careful faved moft 
of their wages, as the bounties were fufficient to furnifh them 
with cloaths. About 30 years ago, wages had gradually ad- 
vanced, men's to L. 5 or L. 6, women's to L, 1 : 1 5 or L. 2 : 5. 
Bounties are now generally aboliihed, and in 1793, from 
L. 7 to L. 9, were given to men, from L. 2 : 10 to L. 3 : 10, 
to women.— In harveft, as there is no weekly market, reap- 
ers are generally hired by the feafon. Before 1760 men re- 
ceived it'om 13s 4d to 16s 8d, women from 10s to 13s 4d ; 
and in 1793 men received 30s, women 2cs.— Before 1760, 
the wages of taylors and day-labourers, was 4d a-day, with 
victuals; 6d was given in 1783, and icd in 1793. Carpen- 
ters and mafons about 30 years ago, got 6d a-day, with vic- 
tuals; in 1793, tne y received is 2d. Formerly, fmiths were 
paid by the farmers with grain, for ferving them in work

at certain fixed rates. Within thefe 10 or 12 years, a con- 
T.derable rife has taken place, on moft of the articles of living.

common articles at different periods.

Mutton, veal and lamb, were formerly fold without being 
weighed at fo much per quarter ; they are now fold by weight, 
and regulated by the Stirling market, which is generally 3d 
or ^di per lib. Dutch weight. Beef is feldom killed except 
about Martinmafs, and is fold for 4s or 4s 6d per ftone. It 
is hardly neceflary to take notice of the prices of grain, which 
are perpetually varying. It may fufiice to mention oat-meal, 
which in fummer 1783 fold at 22s per boll; it had not 
reached near that price, fi nee the year 1757; in 1785, it fell 
fo low as 13s 4d or 12s 6d; but 15s or 165, may be confi- 
dered as its price on an average. 

Manufactures. — This parifh does not admit of any eftablifh- 
ments in the cotton- manufactory, as no fituation could be 
found, commanding at all times a plentiful fupply of water. 
Yet fome branches of manufacture in fome degree reach 
even to us. In the village of Kippen 25 or 30 young girls, 
under the infpe&amp;ion of a miilrefs, are employed by a compa- 
ny in Glafgow in tambouring mullins. In Buchlyvie, fome 
of the newly invented jennies for fpinning cotton have been

fet up by a company in Balfron. And in both villages, as well 
as through the parifh, a confiderable number of weavers has 
been employed by feveral companies in weaving muflins* — 
Such initiations not only give bread at prefent to many in- 
dividuals and families, but mult in time excite a general 
fpirit of induftry and enterprize amongft our people.— In 
Buchlyvie there is a tan- work, confifting of 16 or 20 pools ; 
and in another place fheep fkins are tanned to a fmall extent.— 
Before the commencement of the prefent diftillery aQ in 
1793, there were 4 diftillers of whilky in the pari fh, who 
carried on an advantageous trade, as they flood on the north 
fide of the line fixed by the former aa, to' feparate the 
highlands from the low country. By the prefent ad a 
change of line has taken place, by which this parifh is thrown 
on the fouth fide, and thus cut off from the benefits of the 
highland diftrift. Since December 1793, there is but one 
diftillery of the fize required by law, which furnifhes the 
country with whilky, and produces a very confiderable re- 
venue to government. Including the licence and duty on 
malt, the proprietor pays about L. 1200 fterhng annually to 
the excife. 



Heritors, Rent, £sV. — There are in all 24 heritors. Of thefe 
5 are feuars or portioners, not including the fmallfeuars in the 
villages. Robert Graham Efq. of Gartmore is the principal 
heritor; there are 9 who refide in the parifh. Excepting two 
or three eftates, the whole property in the parifh has been 
changed within thefe 50 or 60 years. The valued rent 
amounts to £.5185:8:8, Scots. The prefent real rent,

may be eftimated at L. 4000 fterling. The rents are generally 
paid partly in money and partly in victual. Mod of the 
landlords require alfo kain of fowls, certain carriages of vic- 
tual or coal ; and thofe who re fide in the parifh, a certain 
number of days labour in the mofs when cafting peats ; all 
which it would be better to abolifh, and take the value in 
grain or money at a reafonable converfion. Thirlage is ge- 
nerally aboliflied ; in fome inftances however it ftill remains. 
This inftitution marks a remote period of fociety, and the re- 
mains of it greatly retard improvement. 

Land and Produce. — The quantity of land in this parifh 
cannot eafily be afcertained. According to the mod probable 
conjecture, the carfe may be fuppofed to contain 1200 acres 
of arable land, and about 300 of mofs ; the dry field about 
5000 acres of arable and pafture land, and about 1500 or 
2000 of moor. Land in the carfe is worth from 15s to 20s ; 
in the dryfield, from 5s to 25s per acre. Oats, and barley 
or bear, form the ftaple produce of this parifh. Oatmeal in 
confiderable quantities is exported to the weft highlands, the 
printfields on the water of Leven, the Dumbarton, and the 
Glafgow markets. The barley is purchafed by the diftiller 
and the malt men in the parifti ; by the latter, malt in confi- 
derable quantities is exported to the highlands. Much more 
barley than grows in the panfh, perhaps double the quantity, 
is purchafed by them. Some wheat is fown in the carfes, 
very little in the dryfield ; the wetnefs and latenefs of our 
climate is peculiarly unfavourable to the cultivation of this 
kind of grain. Peafe are fown in the dryfield, and beans in 
the carfe. Moft farmers raife as much flax as fupplies their 
own families with that ufeful article, but none for the mar- 
ket. The fame thing may be affirmed with refpecl to pota- 
toes. Very few turnips are fown.— In the carfe, a kind of

34 6 Statijlical Account 

white faugh grows to a confiderable fize. It will grow to the 
thicknefs of a foot in diameter in the fpace of 20 years, and 
is peculiarly ufeful for farming utenfils and machinery. 

Cattle and Carriages. — The number of horfes is fuppofed 
to be about 360, of which the greater part has been reared in 
the parifh. — The number of cows is about 1600; about 180 
or 200 are annually bought and fold ; the remainder confifts 
of milk cows and young Mock. — Formerly every farmer 
kept a number of fheep, but fince the farms have been inclo- 
fed this practice has been difcontinued. The number at 
prefent in the parifh will not exceed 8 or 10 fcore. — 
There are about 165 ploughs, 285 carts, and 3 two-wheeled 
chaifes. 

Agriculture. — The ancient mode of hufbandry which pre- 
vailed throughout Scotland, was alfo praclifed in this parifh. 
No attempts to improve it feem to have taken place before 
the middle of the prefent century. A few inclofures were 
made about 40 years ago. But any improvements of confe- 
quence, have all been introduced fince the military road from 
Stirling to Dunbarton was completed. Since that period a 
very confiderable change has taken place. Mofl of the lands 
in the parifh are inclofed with ftone dykes or thorn hedges. 
A good deal of lime is every year laid upon the fields. And 
a general fpirit of induflry has been excited, which promifes 
in time greatly to improve the agriculture of the country. 

The wetnefs of the climate is a great difadvantage. This 
not only injures the crops, but renders our feafons generally 
late. We are upon the whole three weeks later than Eaft- 
Lothian, and often a fortnight later than our neighbours in 
the vicinity of Stirling. Seldom does the feed labour begin 
before the middle of March, and not unfrequently the end of 

that 



of Kippen. 347 

that month approaches, before the fields are dry enough for 
the plough. In the year 1789, the bear-feed was not fimfh- 
ed before the 8th June. So late a feafon however was ra- 
ther uncommon. Harveft is feldom over before the rmddle 
or end of Odober, and corn is feen fometimes ftanding out 
even when the month of November is advanced. On account 
of the frequent rains, it is but feldom that any labour can be 
got forward after harveft, or during the winter. The fame 
circumftance is alfo unfavourable to the pradice of fallowing, 
which however is negleaed in this country, more than is 
proper. It is indeed feldom or never attempted in the dry- 

field, and in the carfe but fometimes, as a preparation for 

fowing wheat. 

The foil of the carfe has been already defcribed. In the' 
carfe farms, the infield or crofting grounds were formerly 
kept in a conftant rotation of barley, oats, and beans. A 
great part of the infield carfe lands has been laboured in this 
way for time immemorial, without ever being paftured or 
fummer fallowed. The outfield was fown with three crops 
of oats fucceffively, and then paftured. Carting clay from 
the ditches and ends of ridges, and mixing it with dung and 
mofs, was thought to make excellent manure, though pro- 
cured with great labour. This compoft however is lefs 
ufed, and more lime is laid upon the grounds, fince the prac- 
tice of fummer- fallowing and fowing grafs-feeds was intro- 
duced. This is found to poffefs great advantages over the 
former mode of culture. 

The whole dry field of this parifh lies upon a rock, which 
is immediately covered with a bed of till, and above this is 
the foil, which is of unequal depth, though generally fhallow. 
Hence it is generally wet, as the water is not allowed to fub- 
fide. The foil immediately contiguous to the moor is molly 
and poor, but it becomes richer farther clown the hill. The 

X x 2 crops* 



348 Statijlical Account 

crops on thefe high grounds are feldom adequate to the la- 
bour and expence bellowed upon them. What ftall we 
think of the fituation of that land, and of thofe who labour 
*' IOm Which an in the proportion of 3 to . is 

reckoned an excellent crop-? The inferiority of the oats and 
barley produced on fuch grounds, is alfo experienced both 
at the m.ll and market. It would certainly be better if 
more of the higher part of the dryfield were thrown into 
grafs. If the tillage indeed were altogether abandoned, thefe 
lands an a fhort time would be overgrown with heath or 
broom. But this might cafily be prevented by occasional 
cropping. 

It would be a great improvement to drain thofe fields 
which are moll injured by water. In fome places indeed 
the rock comes fo near the furface, that fuch a meafure is 
ineradicable. But in many places it might be adopted 
with great advantage. So extenfive an undertaking however 
could hardly be carried on by ordinary tenants on a 19 years 
leafe. It would therefore be the intereft of the proprietors 
to give them fome -proper encouragement. A laudable ex- 
ample of this kind is fet by Mr Stirling of Garden, who 
agrees to be at the expence of calling the ditches, and the 
tenants are bound to fill them up with ftones. Wherever 
this improvement is attempted, care fhould be taken that the 
ditches be of fufficient depth. They ought to be 3 feet deep, 
and filled with Hones as near the furface as that the plough 
cannot touch them. 

Too little attention is paid in general, to a proper rotation 
of crops. The dryfield cannot well bear more than two white 
crops fucceflively. Thofe therefore who go on to take three 
or four, certainly impoverifli their grounds. A greater pro- 
portion of the farm fhould be laid down in grafs, and other 
green crops occafionally interpofed. This will be more at- 
tended 



of Kippen. 349 

tended to, as improvements in hufbandry advance amongft us. 
Some of 'the more judicious farmers have begun to adopt 
this plan, and find their account in the change of their prac- 
tice. 

Turnips are but little cultivated in this part of the country. 
Experience however has {hewn their utility in cleaning the 
ground, keeping it in good condition, and furnifhing ma- 
nure; an objea of great importance, where dung cannot be 
purchafed. There can be no doubt that in many places of 
our dryfield, turnips might be cultivated with fuccefs. 

As our feafons are generally late, the ufe of earlier forts of 
feed muft appear an obvious advantage. The Eflex oats and 
fome other kinds have been tried. But the tendency of thefe 
to be fhaken with the harveft winds, has hitherto difcouraged 
our farmers from making much ufe of them. 

Several of the implements ufed in hufbandry would admit 
of improvement. The Scottifh plough is generally ufed, but 
little attention is paid to its conftruclion. As thofe prejudices 
againft all innovations however proper, which diftinguifhed 
the ancient farmers of Scotland, are now wearing away, it is 
to be hoped that all fuch alterations as reafon and experience 
prove to be ufeful, will in time be introduced. It is agree- 
able to obferve that fome ploughs- of a better conftruclion have 
lately been procured ; and within thefe two years, no lefs than 
8 threfting mills have been ejected in the parifh. Every corn 
mill has now a kiln contiguous to it ; the kiln-heads are of 
caft iron, which occafion a confiderable faving in refpe£fc of 
ftraw and fuel. The oats are dried in much lefs time, and the 
meal produced is equally good as by the ancient method. For- 
merly almoft every farmer was accuftomed to have a kiln of 
his own, which not only required frequent reparations, but 
was extremely liable to accidents by fire. 

A better method of ploughing, than that which the old far- 
2 mers 



35° Statijlical Account 

mers praftifed is now generally adopted ; fewer horfes are em- 
ployed, and in fome inftances without a goadman. 

The ploughing matches that have been inftituted in diffe- 
rent parts of the country, have been accompanied with very 
good effeds. A plan of this kind has once and again been at- 
tempted here. Under the patronage of a number of gentle- 
men in the neighbourhood, a ploughing match took place on 
the 22d March 1794, at which ,7 ploughs ftarted, and about 
L. 12 fter. was diftributed in different fums to the 7 beft 
ploughmen, and a fmall gratuity to the reft. Such well-jud- 
ged encouragement mull ftimulate our farming fervants to ex- 
cel in this important part of praaical hufbandry. 

D //advantages ; and ProjeBed Improvements. —The want of 
coal is one principal difadvantage under which this parifh 
labours. We have none nearer than Bannockburn and 
Auchenbowie, either of which is at leaft 12 miles from the 
village of Kippen. There feems reafon to believe that coal 
may be found in the lands of Glinns and Balgair in this 
neighbourhood. Attempts for that purpofe have repeatedly 
been made in thefe places, as well as in the lands of Buchly- 
vie, but hitherto without the fuccefs that might be defired. 
The acquifition of coal fo near would be of vaft importance 
to this part of the country. 

"We have lime at no great diftance, and even within the 
parifh. As the limeftone however contains a confiderable 
portion of fand, it is thought not to fuit the dryfield fo well, 
though proper for the carfe lands. But as the coal neceffary 
to burn it cannot be procured but at great expencc and trouble, 
ruoft farmers, efpecially in the middle, and eaft end of the 
parifh, find it more for their advantage to drive lime from 
Stirling fhore, to which it is brought up the Forth from the 
Earl of Elgin's lime works , or from the eftates of bauchie and

The parifh of Kippen raifes much more grain than is necef- 
fary for its own confumpt, but lies far from a good market. 
Stirling is abundantly fupplied from its own immediate vicini- 
ty and both Glafgow and Dunbarton are 24 miles from the 
village. This difadvantage might be alleviated by making 
good 3 roads. The road from Kippen to Glafgow by Campfie 
rnoor, was formerly extremely bad, and often impaffable in 

winter. In i 7 9* " ™ made turn P ike  and thc C0Urfe ° , 
in feveral places altered with advantage. A bill has lately 
received the fandion of parliament for making the military 
road turnpike likewife. As thefe two great roads interfeft 
each other at the village of Kippen, the efFefts of this under- 
laking muft be extremely favourable to this neighbourhood, 
as well as convenient for the public in general, by opening 
the communication between the northern and fouthern parts 
of the country. 

It is the opinion of many of the graziers and dealers in cat- 
tle, that Kippen is one of the moll convenient places, per- 
haps, in Scotland for a cattle market ; and that in the late 
fluttering ftate of the tryfts, it might not have been difficult 
to transfer to it a great part of the fpring and autumn markets. 
There is a fpacious moor near the village which lies very 
convenient for that purpofe. With a view to encourage 
their refort to it, Mr Graham of Gartmore, the pro- 
prietor, offered it to the dealers in cattle free of cuftom for 
19 years. 

It is alfo believed that the eflablifhment of a corn mar- 
ket once a week at Kippen might prove very benefi- 
cial ; as alfo a weekly market in the time of harvelt for 
, hiring

Snrhng, and then croffing over by the bog of Bolatt into

thence by the river Leven into the Clyde at Dunbarton f.» 
Though this plan was rej^ed, yet it deferves the confidera- 
«on of all the proprietors on both fides of the Forth, whether 
it might be proper to have that river rendered navigable as 
far up as Gartmore. It appears from Mr Smeaton's report, 
that this is not only a practicable undertaking, but might be 
executed at no great expence. « Two locks and one dam 
" would make an open navigation from Gartmore to the 
" Frith of Forth, at ail feafons of the year ; and was there 
" any trade of confequence up this extenfive valley, would 
« be worth the while, independent of a navigable commu- 
" nication between the two feas. One lock ought to be placed 
" oppofite Craigforth mill, and the lock and dam at the ford

The moor on the fummit of the hill might better be dfpo- 
fed of in planting. A quantity of wafte and barren land m 
Glentirran moor, has within thefe few years been divided 
into fmall lots, and feued off to a number of people, each of 
whom builds a houfe on his feu and improves the ground. 
This land till lately was of very little value •, it now brings 
aos. per acre to the proprietor, Mr Graham of Gartmore. It 
is not everv fituation however that admits of this improve- 
ment. Part of the fame moor has lately been cultivated by 
General Campbell, whofe extenfive improvements on the 
eftate of Boquhan are highly beneficial and ornamental to the 
country. 

CharaBer of the P«^.— The great body of the people in 
this parifh is entitled to the praife of fobriety. There are few 
inftances amongft us of notorious profligacy. By means of 
induftry and ©economy, they in general obtain a comfortable 
fubfiftence, and fome individuals have raifed themfelves to 

opulence The fame changes with refpeft to drefs and 

manner of living, are obferved here of late years as in other 
places. 

General Reflexions on the State of Society. — It feems not un- 
reafonable to apprehend, that fuch a ftate of fociety as ap- 
pears at prefent in the parifh of Kippen, and other places whofe 
circumftances are fimilar, is as favourable to happinefs as the 
courfe of human affairs can ordinarily admit. In a country 
where improvements are altogether unknown, much happi- 
nefs cannot be enjoyed ; for there the neceffaries of life are 
procured with difficulty, or, if they are eafily procured, little

fcope Is afforded for adive exertion. On the other hand, 
where improvements in agriculture and the arts have been 
brought to a high degree of perfection, luxury and other evils 
accompany them, which are no lefs unfriendly than poverty 
and mdolence to the happinefs of man. It is in fome inter- 
mediate ftate, where improvements have begun, and are ftill 
advancing, that the circumftances of fociety appear mod cal- 
culated to promote the comfort of human life. Such, it is 
conceived, is the cafe with refped to this neighbourhood, 
and many other places in Scotland whofe fituation is the fame 
with ours. The truth of this affertion will be manifeft, 
if we take a comparative view of feveral Hates of focie- 
ty, which are known to have exifted, or do ftill exift in 
Scotland. 

It is unneceffary to dwell on thofe remote periods, when a 
fpirit of ferocity and warlike manners prevailed. Surely 
there could be little happinefs where there was little proper- 
ty, and that which men poflefled was infecure. 

If we look back only to a generation or two, and reflecl: on 
the ftate of the country in the former part of the prefent cen- 
tury, or furvey thofe places, where the recent improvements 
in hufbandry have not yet been introduced, a ftate of fociety 
is exhibited that cannot be gratifying to a lover of mankind. 
The lands, fterile from want of culture, requite their penu- 
rious pofleflors with penury. Life is indeed protraded, 
though few of its comforts are enjoyed. Men feem patient 
in enduring hardfhip, but averfe from labour. Strangers to 
enterprize, the powers of their minds rult through mere dif- 
ufe. A harmlefs, torpid race, who might be faid to fleep 
rather than to live. The farms generally fmall, jufl: enabled 
them to maintain their families and pay the landlord, but 
held out few inducements to Simulate exertion. 

In the fouthern parts of Scotland as well as in England, 

where 



of Kippen. 355 

where agriculture feems to be brought to the higheft ftate of 
improvement, we fee extenfive farms in the pofleffion of 
tenants who appear as gentlemen, and are able to live in afflu- 
ence and fplendour. Experience however undeniably proves 
that thofe fituations in life which admit of luxury, are un- 
favourable to happinefs. And in thefe places the diftance be- 
tween mafter and fervant is fo very great, that though the lat- 
ter may enjoy a prefent fubfiftence, yet he can have little or no 
hope of bettering his circumftances to fuch a degree, as to rife 
to independence, and obtain pofleffion of a farm himfelf. 
Such extenfive farms are alfo unfavourable to the population 
of the country. 

Let us next attend to thofe places where manufactures have 
been introduced. There the neceflaries and conveniences of 
life are procured with facility. Abundant fcope is given to 
exertion. And riches pour on all who are willing to labour. 
But thefe difproportioned rewards of labour generally tend to 
enervate the finews of induftry, fofter idlenefs, introduce a 
total relaxation of morals, and confequently lead to poverty 
and wretchednefs *. Population indeed appears to increafe 
with rapidity ; but its progrefs is arretted by difeafe, which 
feems to fix its abode in thofe extenfive work-houfes that are 
employed in manufactures. In the cotton- works particularly, 
children become able to fupport themfelves almoft as foon as 
they are able to fpeak or walk. But their wan and fickly af- 
pecl, occafioned by conftant confinement ; and their unac- 
quaintance with the femiments of religion and morality, arif- 
ing from the want of proper education, and the early infeaion

of evil company, do much more than counterbalance the pro- 
fits of infant labour. If fuch children live till they become 
parents, what hopes do they afford refpecting the next gene- 
ration ? By the wife and humane exertions of fome benevolent 
individuals, thefe evils may be partially prevented or allevi- 
ated ; but a general care to guard againft them is more than 
can reasonably be expected. To all which it may be added, 
that the facility with which money is procured by the lower 
ranks, tends to generate a fpirit unfuited to their condition in 
life, unfriendly to fubordination, and menacing eventually 
the order and peace of fociety. 

Now if we direct our view to fuch a date of fociety as takes 
place at prefent in this parifh, and in other places which have 
reached the fame degree of improvement, a variety of circum- 
itances will appear which combine to promote the felicity of 
human life. The farms are not too extenfive, and yet fuffi- 
ciently large to offer abundant fcope to exertion. A comfort* 
able fubfiftence is within the reach of every perfon who is able, 
and who choofes to labour. Perfevering induftry and enter- 
prise are crowned with liberal rewards. Not a few of our 
mod refpe£table farmers were once fervants, and are now e- 
qual, perhaps fuperior in fortune, to the matters whom they 
ferved. One man might be mentioned, who began the world 
with nothing, and, by farming only, reared a numerous fa- 
mily, and lately purchafed an eftate in the parifh for which he 
paid 1500 guineas. The trades people in the villages live 
more comfortably than thofe of the fame rank in great towns. 
Almoft every family of this defcription" h%s a kail-yard, and 
keeps a cow ; and thofe who are able to get a few acres of land 
find this a great advantage. Occafional attention to their land 
forms an agreeable and ufeful relaxation from the fedentary 
life of a handicraft, and fupplies the family with meal and po- 
tatoes, and winter provifion for the cow. Though our fixa- 
tion

faauring focieties, have it in their power to prevent or to 
correct abufes, to a degree that is altogether impracticable m 
great towns, or larger eftablimments of this kind. 

Such are fome of the advantages enjoyed by a country winch 
hath emerged from the unprofitable indolence of former times, 
and in which improvements are ftill advancing, though they 
have not yet arrived at that ultimate point of perfeaion to 
which they naturally tend. 

The difadvantages which accompany an advanced ftate of 
fociety, feem to render it no lefs unfriendly to human happi- 
nefs, than thofe earlier Mages in which improvements are but 
little known. To prevent or to correa thefe evils, is furely 
one of the nobleft objeas which can employ the exertions of 
politicians and philanthropifts. To this definable end, the 
prefent ftatiftical inveftigation of the kingdom, when com- 
pleted, may be expeaed in a high degree to contribute. And 
the writer of this account will think himfelf happy, if thefe re- 
marks fhall lead the people in this part of the country, and o- 
thers placed in fimilar fituations, to contentment with the lor 
that Divine Providence hath affigned to them, and animate 
them to a becoming ufe of thofe advantages which they at 
prefent enjoy.

Name, Situation and Extent. 
T}U DINGSTON is faid to be a name of Gaelic origin, 
^ and to fignify the houfe on the funny fide of the hill, 
however fanciful fuch etymologies in general may be, the 
fituation of the church correfponds in fome fenfe with this 
delcription. It ftands under the fouth cope of Arthur's Seat, 
raifed upon an eminence, which is embraced on the weft 
and fouth by the lake bearing the fame name, and protected 
on the north by the mountain. The moft beautiful and pic- 
turefque fcenery expands before it, and on every fide. The 
Views which it commands include every object which the 
painter would feled to compofe a rich or a finifhed landfcape. 
Magnificent villas, towering caftles, rich vallies, cultivated 
fields, woods, groves, ruins ; the lake below, the bold preci- 
pices of Arthur's Seat behind ; the hills of Pentland, Moor- 
foot, and Lammermoor, bounding the profpe£l upon the 
weft and fouth ; and the fca. finking in the diitant horizon,

upon the eaft. The diftance of the village from the city of 
Edinburgh is little more than a mile ; and the path that leads 
to it through the fteep acclivities and chafms of the hill, 
though formerly difficult to pafs, has yet proved fufficiently 
alluring to induce many of its opulent citizens to refort 
thither, in the fummer months, to folace themfelves over one 
qf the ancient homely dimes of Scotland*, for which the 
place has been long celebrated ; and, in winter, to attract 
crouds to witnefs or to partake of the amufements of fkating 
upon its lake. The parifh itfelf is of an irregular form, 
which fancy might imagine to refetnble a wedge ; and inju- 
dicioufly, and very inconveniently, the church has been 
pitched near its fharpeft apex. It extends from weft to eaft 
four miles, and from north to fouth from lefs than half a 
mile to more than two. Upon the fouth it is bounded by 
part of the parifhes of Invercflc and Liberton, upon the weft 
and north by thofe of St. Cuthbert's, Canongate, and South 
Leith, and upon the eaft by the Frith of Forth. 

HiJIory, Villages, &amp;c The original foundation of the 

church and erection of the parifh cannot be traced. In the 
regifter of aflignations for the minifters ftipends in the year 
1574, MSS. prefented by Bifhop Keith to the Advocates li- 
brary, Dudingfton is faid to have been a joint dependance 
with the cattle of Edinburgh upon the Abbey of Holyrood- 
houfe. The oldeft records of the feflion are only of the 
year 163 1 . In 1630 the lands of Preftonfield were disjoined 
from the kirk and paiilh of St. Cuthbert's, of which they had 

formed

and leaving the head, &amp;c. to be confumed in the place.

formed a part, and annexed to the parifli of Dudingfton/ 
By an ac"t of the prefbytery of Edinburgh, dated May 18th 
163 1, an ayfle was appointed to be added to the kirk of 
Dudingfton, for accommodation of the then proprietor of 
Preftonfield and his tenants, to be built and fupported at his 
expence. The barony of Dudingfton which comprehends 
the greateft part of the whole parifli, for a confiderable pe- 
riod continued in the poffeffion of the family of Thomfon'?, 
of whom Sir Thomas was created a Baronet by Charles I. 
1637. It appears that the eftate had fallen into the hands of 
the Duke of Lauderdale in 1674. It puffed with a daughter 
of his firft Duchefs, under the name of pin-money to the 
family of Argyle, to the firft Duke of which fhe was mar- 
ried. In 1745 it was fold by Archibald Duke of Argyle to 
the late Earl of Abercorn, uncle and predeceffor to the Mar- 
quis, the prefent proprietor. 

Wefter Dudingfton was once a large and populous village. 
Moft of the tenants upon the barony refided in it prior to the 
year 1 75 1. Before the fame period it furnifhed 36 horfes to 
carry coals in facks or creels to Edinburgh. About 40 years 
ago it fupplied above 30 weavers looms. Thefe were chiefly 
employed in manufacturing a very coarfe flaxen ftuff, then, 
known by the name of Dudingfton hardings, which general- 
ly fold for 3^d. to 4d. per yard. But the trade has declined ; 
and there now remain but five weavers in the village. No 
place could be better adapted for fome fuch manufactory as 
this, from its accefs to water, fuel, and the neceffaries of 
life, as well as from its vicinity to Edinburgh. The late pro- 
prietor had it in contemplation to have rebuilt the place upon 
the model of a neat commodious Englifh village, but from the 
interfedtion of feus, and the oppofition of their pofllflbrs, he 
was obliged to defift from the attempt. The houfes in confe- 
quence,have been fuffcred to drop into ruin, and thofe which 

remain

are chiefly occupied by labouring people, whofe wives, with 
fome widows in the place, employ themfelves in warning linen, 
or carry milk to the inhabitants of the neighbouring city, for 
which their vicinity to the loch of Dudingfton, and to many 
old and excellent pafture fields, affords them the molt conve- 
nient oportunities. Formerly it is fuppofed to have 

contained above 500 inhabitants. At prefent the number does 
not exceed 200. 

Eafler Dudingfton has not varied fo much in its fize and 
population. It has lately been rebuilt in part, and the new 
houfes according to their original defoliation, are for the moft 
part occupied by coalliers. Portobello and Brickfield, now 
the moft populous and profperous villages of the parifh, are 
but of very recent origin and name. The grounds on which 
they are built is a part of the Figget lands, which alto- 
gether confift of about 70 acres. Thefe continued down to 
the 1762 or 1763 a mere wafte, covered for the moft part 
with furze or whins, and were commonly let to one of the 
Dudingfton tenants for 200 merks Scots, or L. 11:2: 2 T 8 r fter. 
In one or other of the above mentioned years, the lands of 
Figget were fold for L. 1500 fter. The purchafer imme- 
diately began to improve his property, and in a few years 
parcelled it out into different feus at the rate of L. 2 : 2, and 
fometimes even more, per acre. He foon indemnified himfelf 
for the expences of improvement with the crops he raifed, 
and by the feu duties enfured an annual income of about 7 per 
cent, for the original price. Portobello hut was the firft houfe 
raifed in the midft of the original wafte about the year 1 742, 
and derived its title from the Spanilh American city of that 
name, of the capture of which, the news had arrived in Britain 
about that period. Since the cultivation and improvements of

or commodious dwellings have been erected by the feuers, 
cither for their own accommodation or for bathing quarters, 
for which the agreeable foftnefs of the adjacent fandy beach, 
the purity of the air, and the convenience of the MufTel- 
burgh or rather London poft road form obvious recommenda- 
tions. ' 

AfpeB and Improvements of the Country, Surface, Wt, — 
There is not a more highly cultivated fpot in Scotland, nor 
one which more refembles the rich champaign of England, 
than that which the general afpecl of this parifh difplays. 
But this has not been the cafe fo long as the immediate 
neighbourhood of the Metropolis might have induced us to 
have imagined. The lands of Prefton field were the firft 
that were improved in the parifh, or probably in the countv. 
The proprietor of that eft ate was Lord Provoft of Edinburgh, 
about the time of the Revolution in 1688. At 1 hat period, 
the fulzie or fweepings, and manure from" the ftreets of the 
city was fo little valued, or rather the proper ufe of it was 
fo little underftood, that in (lead of drawing revenue from it, 
a considerable fum was paid to feme of the farmers in the 
neighbourhood for removing it. The then proprietor of Pref* 
ton field, availed himfelf of the opportunicy to enrich his ef- 
tate. He undertook to empty or to fcour the ftreets ; and 
he applied the manure thus obtained, to improve the lands of 
Prefton field. Thefe he laid down in the moft favourable 
condition, incloftd and fubdivided. And as it is believed, 
that thefe were the firft inclofed lands in the vicinity of 
Edinburgh, fo it is certain, they were the firft improved. 
As they are befides the oldeft, To they are (till eftecmed the 
beft grafs paftures about the city, or perhaps any where elfe 
in Scotland. It was rather a matter of wonder, that fuch an 
example was not immediately followed by many of the 

neighbouring^ 



TMdingJion- ' 

rteitdibotiring gentlemen, who muft quickly have observed" 
the fingular benefit which refulted from this experiment, 
The profecution of feeh improvements, however, at any dife 
tance from the city, might at that period have been much 
if not totally obftrufted, from the ftate of the roads, which 
xvere generally ruinous, and often itafteffcble in the winter 
feafon. It might arife partly from this circumftance, which 
formed alfo another obftacle to cultivation; that it was nod 
till after the year 1750, that carts came to be in general ufe ; 
at leaft to the weft of Edinburgh, though they had been, long 
employed upon the eaft fide, the conveyance of all materials 
having been before that period, in facks, hurdles or creels, 
upon the backs of horfes. About 1730, the offals and ma- 
nure of the ftreets of Edinburgh fold at 2d per cart : At 
prefent, the cart load in fome circumflances fells at is 6d, 
or upwards; though in moft cafes, the ftreets and othet 
fources of fuch unfightly treafures, are let by general or ex- 
ten five contracts. 

The eftate of Dudingfton, was much later in undergoing 
any 'effective improvement. The tenants originally pofleffed 
their lands in run-ridge or run-dale ; and in each of the; vil- 
lages of Wefter and Eafter Dudingfton in which they refided^ 
they had accefs to a common, upon which they paftured their 
fheep, horfes, and other cattle, which were kept by a common 
herd. It is fomewhat remarkable, that before the year 1 746, 
there never was au inftance of a leafe upon that eftate ; yet 
it is believed, there is not an older or more refpeftahle ten- 
antry in Scotland; fevcral of the families of the prefent ten- 
ants having been in poficflion of their farms for upwards of 
200 years. About the year 1751, the proprietor, the late 
Earl of Abercorn, began to fubdivide his eftate info commo- 
dious farms, to build convenient farm-houfes, and offices 
upon each, and to inclofe them with ditches and hedges/ 

Z 35 a ' TA© 



3^4 Statijiical Account 

The eftate was thus reduced into a regular and progreflive 
itate of cultivation 5 and the country beautified and adorned 
with hedge-rows, clumps, and plantations of various fcrma 
and extent. Though the rents comparatively have been 
greatly advanced, in confequence of thefe improvements ; 
the tenants are all thriving, live comfortably, and perhaps 
are in every refpea, in a better condition than their prede- 
ceflbrs ; fome of whom only paid at the rate of 5 s per acre 
for the arable land of an inferior quality, with an interea in 
the commons, for which no rent was demanded. Prior to 
the year 1746, the medium rent of land in the parifh was 
about 10s for the computed acre, now it is about L. 2 : 2. 
In 1763, foon after the Earl had compeared the fubdividing 
and endofing of his eftate, he began to build his manfion 
houfe of Dudingfton, upon an elegant and commodious plan, 
the work of the late Sir William Chalmers. The houfe and 
offices were finifhed in 1768 ; and continue to exhibit a beau- 
tiful fpecimen of Greek architecture and elegance, and of 
Englifh accommodation and affluence. The noble villa was 
furrounded with fhrubbery, pleafure grounds, canals, gar- 
dens ; and in the formation of the whole, it is fuppofed, above 
L, 30,000 fterling, were expended. The beautiful variety 
of the ground, the happy pofition of the clumps and groves, 
the linking diverfity of the water embellifhments, canals, 
lakes, illes, and cafcades j and above all, the grandeur and 
beauty of the furrounding fcenery and profpecls, independ- 
ently of the magnificent form and architecture of the houfe 
itfelf, muft ever render the place fingularly pi&amp;urefque, ele- 
gant and attracting. 



Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c. — The foil is naturally but poor or

attaining to fo much; towards the eaft, inclined to and reft- 
ing on a ftrong clay ; and near the fea-coaft degenerating into 
a light, but with culture not unproduaive, fand. Agriculture 
bas been carried to a high degree of perfetlion; though it 
muft be confeffed, from the circumftances of fituation,^ there 
is little fcope here for the exercife of ingenuity, or the inven- 
tion of refources in the application of the art. , The great 
medium of improvement is the manure of Edinburgh ; and 
the great objed of ambition, is the multiplying of wheat 
crops. Thefe by the command of manure, can be often 
forced upon the foil before the return of any ordinary rotation 
of crops would permit their introduaion. The fallowing, 
drill, pafture, and turnip hufbandry, are little praaifed in 
this neighbourhood, from the dearnefs of the ground ; and 
the eafy though expenfive aequifition of the richeft manure. 
Crops of artificial grafs and clover are frequently introduced, 
generally cut twice in the feafon, and feldom allowed to re- 
main above two years upon the ground. Often the greater 
part of both crops is fublet and retailed in bunches in Edin- 
burgh, at idi the bunch, the ftanding price, though the 
bunch itfelf varies in fize, according to the feafon, crop, &amp;c. 
Potatoes are alfo aflaple commodity, often fublet like clover at 
L. 8, and even L. 10 per acre. Barley, oats, peafe, as ufual 
have their place, though the laft as feldom as poffible ; but 
afluredly the fineft crops of each fpecies of grain that can be 
feen any where, are raifed here. Grounds that are kept in 
pafture, are feldom occupied by fheep to any extent ; but are 
generally grazed by milk cows, and road horfes from the 
neighbouring city ; and thefe pay in the fummer months 3d 
per night for each horfe, and 6d per cow.

of various kinds, though once profecuted with confiderable

into a fatal decline. Manufrdures, however, of a different

cinity of the metropolis, and the fk'dl and fpirit of the under- 
takers, a profperous iflue may naturally be expected to the at- 
tempt. Upon the fouth-eaft borders of the parifh at Magda- 
lene bridge, an attempt was made fome years ago, to intro- 
duce the manufactory of Scots fuperfine broad cloths, which 
after having been attended with confiderable fuccefs for a 
time, was at laft fuffered to drop into decay. In the works 
erected to profecute this defign, a manufaaory of hats is at 
prefent carried on. Salt has been long prepared upon the 
fea coaft, in the parifh. Maitjand pans derive their name, 
from, and were probably erefted by fome of the Lauderdale 
fimily, at one time proprietors of the land around. Magda- 
lene pans, and Magdalene bridge, are fuppofed to have been 
named from a neighbouring chapel dedicated to St Magdalene., 
fituated in the parifh of I'nverefk- The profperity and pro- 
duce of the falt-works, is in a confiderable degree, regulated 
by the ftate of the coal, of which the following article treats. 
A few years ago, the number of falters with the officers em- 
ployed

ployed in the work, amounted to 1 7. Their labours afforded 
employment to above 40 carriers, all women, who retailed 
the fait in Edinburgh, and through the neighbouring diftrifts. 
The quantity of fait delivered by the Gx pans, regularly em- 
ployed, ufed to be about 18,000 bufhels annually. 

Coal —Thirteen feams of coal have been difcovered and 
wrought upon the eftate of Dudingfton. Thefe are of vari- 
ous qualities, and fome excellent in their kinds. They crop, 
as indeed the ftrata of all minerals upon this coafl preferve the 
fame inclination, to the weft ; the dip or declination, is nearly at 
an angle of 45 degrees from the horizon to the eaft, a circum (lance 
which of itfelf mult always have rendered the working of the 
coal difficult. Moll; of the above feams have been wrought 
from a very remote period of time, which cannot now be af- 
certained, where they approach the furface, and as far as a 
fimple free level could clear them of water. Under the Du- 
chefs of Argyle, a rude machine compofed of, and named, 
chain and buckets  was employed to raife the water in the 
mines from a greater depth. When the property fell into 
the poffeflion of the late Earl of Abercorn, the coal and fait 
works were at firft let to Mr Biggar of Woolmet, an enter- 
prifing man, who opened a level from the fea, and carried it 
through the eftates of Dudingfton, Niddry, and part of Ed- 
monfton, up to Woolmet bank, a powerful drain of above 
3 miles in extent, of moftefTential advantage to the more ele- 
vated coal works of the neighbouring proprietors, but even- 
tually productive of ruin to that of Dudingfton, befides 
opening the generating fource of interminable law pleas. 
About the year 1763, the Earl of Abercorn began to ere£t a 
fteam engine of very confiderable power upon the Dudingfton 
coalliery, extending its operation to the depth of 52 fathoms. 
This engine was rendered ufelefs in 1790, when on the 20th 

of 



of Dudingjlon. 3^9 

of March the whole feams of coal were overflowed and choak- 
ed from the communication of the level with the higher 
grounds. Before this period another engine of greater power, 
and upon a new conftruclion*, had been ereaed near the 
fouthern boundary of the parim to work the coal of Brun- 
ftane which lies beyond its limits. The (haft of this engine 
pit reaches to the depth of 60 fathoms, and interfefts three 
feams of coal, the firft 7 feet thick, the next 9, and the laft 
15. The other materials through which it defcends, arc 
chiefly very deep ftrata of a coarfe red free-ftone, fome of 
clay, and neareft to the coal a kind of pyrites fchift, which 
the workmen call bands of bleas. The porous quality of the 
free-ftone rock, the number of cutters, and above all the 
inaufpicious communication of the fatal level, admit fuch an 
influx of water, as has all along rendered this undertaking 
fingularly laborious and expenfive, and at laft reduced it to a 
very languifliing condition. The number of coalliers, bear- 
ers, and other workmen employed at the coalliery before 
1790, ufed to be about 270. The number is now great- 
ly reduced. If the working of the Dudingfton coal mould 
ever be revived, it will require the aid of two (learn engines 
of very great power to carry it on with any fuccefs. If 
both thefe coallieries mould be finally abandoned, though 
there be ftill much coal not yet exhaufted in the neighbour-

hood, this may tend to raife confiderably the price of that 
important article, a temporary dearth of which was lately 
fo feverely felt in the city and neighbourhood of Edin- 
burgh. Of fuch unwelcome interruptions of the public 
fupplies of fuel, and of the ferious inconveniences which 
they produce, there are caufes which are not perhaps at- 
tended to fo much as they deferve. Since the period when 
the coalliers were emancipated by the interpofition of the 
legiflature from that ftate of villainage, by which, like the 
adfcriptitii gleba of feudal tyranny, they had been chained 
for life to the foil or work upon which they had been born, 
fome conduftors of coal works for a long period, difco- 
vered no better methods of binding them to their fervice, 
than by plunging them into debt, or alluring them by difli- 

pation They were in many cafes feduced from their 

former mafters by more enterprifing or lefs fcrupulous em- 
ployers. The debts, contracted in the work which they were 
to leave, were paid, and a premium fuperadded, which they 
were tempted, like the infatuated raw recruit, to fpend in 
immediate intemperance. More money was often injudi- 
cioufly lent them, in the vain hope, that the deeper they 
were involved in debt to their new mafters, the more clofely 
would they be incited to labour, and the longer they fhould 
be conftrained to remain at their new tafk. But inftead of 
this, the men, as a little lefs (hallow policy might eafily have 
forefeen, in fuch cafes have become difpirited at the view of 
the debts in which they have been fo haftily and often fo 
unintentionally plunged; and at laft defpairing ever to dis- 
charge them, they fink into obftinate indolence, defpondence, 
or profligacy ; or they fairly run off from the work, and re- 
pair by (lealth to fome new contractor, who, though aware of 
their obnoxious condition, winks at the nick, and, when dif- 
cOvered, perhaps pays the fatal debt, and enfures the repeti-

tion of the fame fraudulent retribution again ft himfelf. 
Thus at laft, either from the ftubbornefs of defpnir, the 
relifli for bribes and indulgences, and the habitual tafte for 
extravagance fo imprudently foftered, the men get into theiv 
rebellious moods, and refufe to work without fome new 
bribe, or perhaps unlefs their wages be raifed in propor- 
tion to the increafe of price, to which their mafters may 
have chofen to raife the coal itfelf. There is another 
circumftance, which, though it does not fo much corrupt 
the morals of the perfons concerned, contributes however 
to aggravate the dearth, and to raife irregularly the price 
of coals. When it is prefumed that the demand and the 
price of this article will rife confiderably in the market, a mul- 
titude of carters and coal drivers abandon their common occu- 
pations, flock to this new traffic, and become the carriers, 
in the hope of an advanced and exorbitant profit. As it is 
impoffible to fupply this fudden increafe of carriers with 
immediate freights, many of them are compelled to ftand 
all night, and fometimes all day to boot, upon the hills, 
waiting their turns for loading. Upon their cart load, they 
are afterwards compelled to lay not only the ordinary price of 
carriage, but this extraordinary expence of attendance and 
rifk ; while it is evident, that half the number of carts might 
remove all the produce of the pits in the fame time, and find 
regular employment with moderate and lefs hazardous gains. 
Convenient remedies for thefe errors might be eafily difcover- 
ed and profitably applied.

black coloured {tone, foft, fmooth, and unftuous in appear- 
ance, which, as it admits of an agreeable polifh, might be 
converted to ufeful architeftural purpofes if wrought below 
the crop rock, and treated with (kill. Petroleum, or foflil 
pitch, and manganefe in fmall quantities, have alfo been found 
in the crevices of the free-ftone quarries. Upon the fea coaft, 
in the interlaces of rocks and ftones, curious and rare fpeci- 
mens of petrified plants and trees have been found. Some of 
them refembled the finelt Marfeilles quilting : others formed 
the evident petrifactions of reeds and exotic plants, now known 
to be indigenous in tropical regions only ; a circumftance 
which as it has fometimes occurred fo unaccountably in nor- 
thern climates, has given rife to fo much ingenious fpecula- 
tion, and to fo many extravagant theories. Small pieces of 
chalcedony, porphyry, and agate in larger mafles,have alfo been 
picked up upon the beach of the Forth, the boundary of the 
parilh. Many of thefe have been polilhed, and preferved in 
the cabinets of the curious ; and few remnants have efcaped 
the avidity of collectors in fo public and acceflible a fpot. 
Marie of different kinds and great richnefs, has been found in 
great abundance in Dudingfton loch, the property of Sir Wil- 
liam Dick, and occafionally wrought, though from the vicini- 
ty of the place to the unfailing ftores of ftrong Edinburgh ma- 
nure, it has been undervalued and neglected.

The botanift may find more fcope for the Ft» of

exhibit naturally the common weeds, which bring both mor- 
tification and ftimulus to the induftry of the hufbandman.

The mountain itfelf, contains above 400 fp«ies of plants ; 
a number much beyond what Mr Lightfoot has afcribed to it 
in his Flora Scottica. But thefe, with its other treafures

bly elude defcription in the prefent great ftatiftical undertak-

affords a curious variety of indigenous plants. Of thefe, the

The fifli which are found in the lake, are pike, perch, and a 
profufion of eels; twenty dozen of which have been killed in 
an evening, by the aid of a barbed fpear, trident, or rather 
fexdent. Carp and tench had been imported by the Earl of 
Abercorn, to ftore his canals and ponds } but have now for 
the moft part been deftroyed by the pike, or warned away 
by the floods. The fifh and {hells of the neighbouring fea 
ore alfo the fame which are common on the fhores of the

minate the pocket or hoze fifh are caught upon the ihorc 
the feelers or antennae of which are faid to have been in

another article of ancient luxury, (echinus aefculens of Lin-

Linnaeus has named Folus candid us, which perforates rocks, 
and forms its habitation within their ftrong munitions. 

Antiquities. — Though Froiffart affirms that there were above 
100 chateaux in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, in the 
time of Queen Mary, and though this parifh be fituated fo 
near to the metropolis, no ruin of caftle, camp, or tower, 
can now be traced within its limits. The church is certainly 
a building of confiderable antiquity. Dr Littleton, when 
liifhop of Carliflc, and upon a vifit to the lord of the manor, 
concluded probably from the (trudlure of the arches, and the v 
(tile of the ornaments, that it mull have been the work of 
the Saxons. There is no record, however 4 , authority or date,

by which we can venture to afcribe its origin to fo remote a 
period. Under the bellfry, there appears a date beginning 
Si » but of which the remaining cyphers, and other infcrip- 
tion, are now obliterated. Some years ago, in dragging the 
marie of Dudingfton loch, the head and horns of a (lag, 
fome coins, the infcriptions of which were effaced, the blade 
of a fword, and the heads of fome fpears and javelins, all 
from their ftrudure and materials believed to be Roman, 
were difcovered. Some of thefe were fent to the mufeum 
of the King, fome were prefented to the Antiquarian Society, 
and. fome are preferved in Preftonfield houfe. In the adja- 
cent meadow, in the opening of drains and ditches, under 
the firfl ftrata of mofs and gravel, have been found wrecks 
of oak trees, hazel bufhes and nuts ; and the almoft confumed 
iron of horfe fhoes of different dimenfions. At the mouth of 
Dudingfton or the Figget burn, have alfo been obferved, im- 
merfed in a deep ftratum of clay, the trunks of large oak 
trees, which when cut or broken, have been found black as 
ebony to the heart. They may perhaps be remnants of the 
King's foreft to the eaft of Edinburgh, in which, it appears, 
by the original charter of erection of the monaftery of the 
Holy Crofs, the Monks obtained a privilege to fend their hogs 
to feed. A caufeway of confiderable antiquity forms upon 
the north-eaft the boundary of this parifli ; and is conjectur- 
ed by fome, to be a remnant of one of thofe regular roads 
which the unfortunate Mary is faid to have been fo attentive 
to encourage, for the improvement of her rude kingdom. 
Several roads of this kind, converged to the palace of Holy- 
rood houfe, and this which now bears the name of the Fifli- 
wife's caufeway, once formed a part of the great poll- road to 
London. The boroughs of Linlithgow and Peebles, are alfo 
faid to have been bound to uphold this caufeway ; and it is 
known to have been a common practice of the above-men-

Remarkable Events, CharaBers, bV. -Tradition fays, that 
the Figget whins, formerly a foreft, afforded fhelter and a 
place of rendezvous to Sir William Wallace and his myr- 
midons, when they were preparing to attack Berwick. The 
fame doubtful chronicle reports a circumftance which is 
confirmed by the more refpeftable authority of private letters, 
though it has not found a place in the hiftories of the times. 
Before the battle of Dunbar, the leaders of the Scots demand- 
ed a conference with the ufurper Cromwell •, he contented to 
meet them on the morrow, half way between the Leith and 
Muflelburgh rocks," at low water, upon the fands, each party 
to be accompanied with 100 horfemen. Any queftion they 
might choofe to propofe, he agreed to anfwer i but declined 
admitting of any ammadverfion or reply. A part of this cu- 
rious but unfuccefsful conference is reported to have been in 
thefe words. " Why did you put the king to death ?" " Be- 
« caufe he was a tyrant, and deferved death." " Why did 
« you diflolve the parliament ?" " Becaufe they were greater 
« tyrants than, the king, and required diffolution."— At a later 
period, while the ill-fated Charles-Edward, the grandfon of 
Cromwell's vi&amp;im, paraded his ihort-lived royalty in Holy- 
roodhoufe palace^ in 1745, his fcanty forces were encamped 
for above a month, to the eaft of the village of Dudingfton ; 
and many of the inhabitants remember the arts which their 
leaders employed to magnify their appearance, and to raife 
their own importance, and the bitter regret which the men 
exprefled for having been impelled by their chieftains into 
their rafh, but at that time not unpromifing, attempt. A

phenomenon of a different kind, not effeded by the diforders 
of the moral, but the convulfions of the natural world, was 
obferved near the fame fpot, and about the fame period ; 
though it has not been recorded in the common produQions 
of the time. On the 13th September, i 744 , a water-fpout 
broke upon the top of Arthur's feat, and dividing its force, 
difcharged one part upon the weftern fide, and tore up a 
channel or chafm, which ftiil remains a monument of its 
violence ; the other divifion took its diredion towards the 
village of Dudingfton, carried away the gable of its moft 
wefterly cottage, and flooded the loch over the adjacent 
meadows. 

Some characters have appeared in this parifh, not unwor- 
thy of notice. About the period of the overthrow of the 
Monarchy, or prior to the Reftoration, the parfon of Duding- 
fton, (the Fpifcopal form then prevailed,] was named Mon- 
teath. Having been fo unmindful of his character and office, 
as to engage in an illicit amour with a lady of rank in the 
neighbourhood, he found himfelf neceffitated to fly from the 
fcene of his difgrace and degradation. He repaired to France, 
and immediately applied for employment to the celebrated 
Richlieu. He told him, he was of the Monteath family in 
Scotland. The Cardinal remarked, that he was well ac- 
quainted with the Monteaths, and defired to know to what 
branch of the family he pertained. The exiled parfon, 
vvhofe father had been a plain fifherman in the falmon 
trade of the Forth, fomewhere above Alloa, readily anfwer- 
ed that he was of the Monteaths of Salmon net. Richlieu 
acknowledged, that he had not heard of that branch; but 
admitted with becoming candour, that notwithstanding his 
ignorance, it might be a very illuftrious family. He re- 
ceived Monteath to his patronage ; and foon advanced him 
to be his fecretary, in which fituation he wrote and pub-

of the London Antiquarian Society, and published eflays 
and letters, Edinburgh 1739. Thefe difplay a considerable 
knowledge of the Celtic and Hebrew languages, and were 
chiefly intended to form an introduction to his great but 
unfinifhed undertaking of a Celtic Dictionary. They are 
commended by Mr Pinkerton, and quoted with refpect by 
Gebelininhis "Monde Primitif," and Bullet in his "Memoires 
" Celtiques." Pollock was fucceflbr of Malcolme in the 
benefices ; but was foon removed to Aberdeen, as ProfefTor 
of Divinity. Names higher in rank and fame than thefe 
might alfo be recorded, to add fome celebrity to Dudingflon. 
The celebrated John and Archibald, fucceffive dukes of Ar* 
gyle, paffed much of their time, and it is faid, received a 
part of their education with their mother, who refided con- 
stantly in this village, prior to the 1734, The late Earl 
of Abercorn made this his favourite refidence ; and formed 
of it a kind of new creation : a Nobleman, whofe character 
was little known, or rather little underftood ; but who pof- 
fefled fingular vigour of mind, integrity of conduct, and 
patriotic views. The late Sir Alexander Dick was univerfal-

fpirit, and urbanity of manners.

Church, Schools, Poor, &amp;c— The probable antiquity of the 
church has already been noticed. Its prefent appearance re- 
dounds not fo much to its praife. The feats in the lower part 
of the church are in a tottering and ruinous ftate, though the 
pews in the galleries wear a refpeftable afped. It would not 
require much expence to render the whole both commodious 
and elegant. A very beautiful femicircular arch divides the 
choir from the chancel, and the walls and roof are in a very 
refpe&amp;able ftate. An elegant marble obelifk (lands in the 
church-yard, a monument to the late Patrick Haldane, Efq. 
of Gleneagles, to erect which, L. 200 iter, were configned 
by his unfortunate grandfon, whofe fate is recorded and fculp- 
tured upon the fame pile. The manfe is delightfully fitua- 
ted, and tolerably commodious. The ftipend is in money 
L. 78 : 12:9, and in grain, three chalders. The public fchool- 
houfe is inconvenient and ill conllrucled and the provifion 
for the teacher, as has fo often been lamented in fimilar cafes, 
is deplorably diminutive and inadequate to the importance 
and fuccefsful exercife of the office. The legal falary is L. 9 
per ann. The perquifites arifing from the conjoined office of 
Jeffion clerk, and the fchool fees, may one year with other, a-

Dudingfton, was originally erected by the tenants in the 
neighbourhood, and is now fupported by a fmall contribution, 
and the ordinary fees of teaching. A funday fchool has alfo 
been tried in the eaftern diftrict of the parifli, and has of late

confidcrably increafcd. At prefent there are 13 poor on the 
roll, who receive 2s, 2 s 6d, 3 s, and 4 s per month. Families 
in diftrefs are occafionally fupplied from the funds 

Population.—^ ftate of population has been for fome time 
very variable. From the late interruptions and threatened 
decay of the coal works, a great body of the people employed 
in them have removed to fcenes more favourable to the re- 
gular and durable exercife of their occupations. In one vil- 
lage alone, Joppa, which was folely inhabited by coalliers, 
above 30 houfes have been deferred, or fuffered to fall to 
ruin, within the fpace of the laft 4 years. To counterbalance 
in part, this deficiency of population, feveral families of new 
manufaaurers, &amp;c. have in the fame period fettled in Porto- 
bello, Sec. A migratory colony, befides, of bathers, fummer 
lodgers, &amp;c. upon the fame coaft, continue every year to in- 
creafe their numbers. But thefe cannot with propriety be 

rated 



• A fund, or box as it is commonly named, is alfo fupported in this and 
fome of the neighbouring pariflies, by the coalliers and carters, for the main- 
tenance chiefly of their fick or difabled members. Little or nothing is pro- 
vided for their widows or furviving children. But, if the fcheme were placed 
upon a more liberal and advantageous footing : were its objeas in fome fenfc 
revcrfed, and its chief expenditure devoted to the fupportof the widows and 
orphans, inflead of being confumed in expenfive funerals, and engroiTed in the 
felfuTi fuftenance of the fubferibers themfelvcs, it might become a truly valu- 
able and praifeworthy cftablilbment.

CharaBer of the Inhabitants—^ people in general of 
the parses in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis, are 
necelTarily of a very mixed character, and too frequently 
more corrupted comparatively, in the lower ranks, than in 
fituat 10 ns more remote, and Iefs expofed to the contagious 
effects of fuch a neighbourhood. In every country, perfons 
employed in the adive exercifes of hufbandry, have generally 
difplayed an inoffenfive fimplicity, and laudable regularity of 
manners. For this charafter they have probably been much 
indebted to the order which they are obliged to obferve in all 
their proceedings, to the returning, continued regularity of 
their employment, to the moderate but uniform profits which 
they draw from their labours, and to their happy fecluiion 
from evil communications and fcenes of corruption. The 
labourers and hufbandmen of this diftrift prcferve the fame 
general charafter, though the frequent and unavoidable in- 
ttrcourfe with the city which they are neccflitated to maintain, 
has not been without its polluting efllcls. Coalliers have ge- 
nerally exhibited a direct contrail: to this fimplicity and re- 
gularity of manners ; and where tiiey have not enjoyed the 
fmgular advantages of prudent dirt&amp;ors and wiiolcfome difci- 
pline, they have been unhappily too often diflinguifhed by 

rudenefs, 



of 'Dudingjloti. 3 8 3 

rudenefs, diforder, and profligacy. The degrading opera- 
tion of that (late of villainage from which they have fo re- 
cently efcaped, the corrupting tendency of that injudicious 
management by which they have fmce been influenced, their 
irregular and fometimes exorbitant gains, which at one time 
overftocks, and at another ftarves them, and which common- 
ly puts it in their power, by the fruit of three days labour, to 
pafs the reft of the week in abfolute idlenefs, or in fottifh in- 
dulgence ; nay, the very darknefs, dirt, and unreftrained in- 
tercourfe which prevails in their fubterraneous regions, un- 
awed by the eyes or the opinions of the world above, may all 
combine to produce or to aggravate this degradation of man- 
ners. In the coalliery of Dudingfton, there have been fome 
agreeable exceptions to this general defcription, though its 
application to the prevalent hue of fuch fcenes of darknefs, 
is too legitimate and congruous. Manufaftures of every 
kind have commonly been thought unfavourable to purity of 
manners. The profits which they afford are greater, and 
more irregular than thofe of hufbandry. In truth, wherever 
men are colle&amp;ed together in confiderable numbers, cor- 
ruption is generated ; and as there will probably be fome 
amongft them found of depraved manners, the contagion is 
too apt to fpread around. Where the conductors themfelves 
are men of Heady principle, or where the more refpectable 
workmen acquire an afcendency, a fpirit of ferious enquiry, 
and Uriel behaviour is fometimes introduced among the ma- 
nufactures, which may tempt the world to call them too 
good. And where the reverie takes place, a fpirit of licen- 
tioufnefs and diforder will prevail, which even the indulgent 
morality of the world may pronounce to be too bad. Of 
both thefe defcriptions of characters, the manufacturers of thi» 
diftricT. afford examples. Though fuch moral and fecondarv 
caufes may thus tend to communicate a general complexion 



or

or colour to the manners of a country, profeffion, or family, 
the fpirit of religion may certainly powerfully counted the 
evil peculiar to each fituation, or improve and perfect the 
good. The fpirit of religion, however, is not fo prevalent 
or general in this place, as to produce effe&amp;s which can be 
very oftenfibly vifible, or extenfively fek. A great propor- 
tion of the people, however, are regular and decent in their 
attendance upon religious exercifes, and difplay a correfpon- 
dent practice in the integrity, ufefulnefs and beneficence of 
their common conduct. The more defedive are certainly, in 
the language of the ufual comparative and confolatory apolo- 
gies of the world, not worfe than their neighbours.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2324039">St. NINIANS</name> 

(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 
By the Rev. Mr Sheriff.</head>

    <p>

Name. 

r T"^HE ancient name of this parifh was Eggles The ap- 
pellation is derived from the eminence of the place of 
worfhip, ecclefia, by which the parifh was diftinguifhed. 
The modern name, both of the parifh and of its principal 
village, St. Ninians, is derived from St. Ninian, whofe hif- 
tory is not certainly known. The following conjecture is, 
however, fufHciently probable to give fome gratification to 
the curious. According to Buchanan *, Dongardus fuc- 
ceeded to the kingdom of Scotland in the year 452. About 
this period, the Scottifh ecclefiaftics were infe£ted with the 
Pelagian herefy. Palladius was employed by Celeftine to 
oppofe the Pelagians : and Ninianus is n.entioned anions: 
his difciples, as highly diftinguifhed, both by the extent of 
his learning and the fanQity of his life. The character of 
Vol. XVIII. 3 C thofe

3 8 6 Statiftical Account 

thofe times gives fuflicient reafon to believe, that Ninian was 
afterwards canonized : and as no other faint of that name 
occurs in our hiftory, it is not unreafonable to conclude, that 
St. Ninian's Row in Edinburgh, St. Ninian's Well in this 
place, as well as this parifti and village, received their appel- 
lations in honour of this pious reformer. 

It is not necefiary to fuppofe that the parifli adopted the 
name of the faint immediately after his death, or even imme- 
diately after his canonization. In our own times, new build- 
ings have afTumed the names of ancient faints : whilft a char- 
ter, belonging to the abbacy of Cambulkenneth, furniflies 
a reafon for limiting the prefent name of the parifli to the lat- 
ter years of the p.ipal fupremacy in Scotland. 

The names of the other villages are generally of Englifh ex- 
traction. To this clafs, belong Newmarket, Mil town, Char- 
terfliall, Clay hills, Newhoufe, and Bannockburn. Pow- 
milne and Polmaife appear to be derived from pou, a provin- 
cial word, fignifying a watery place. From the Gaelic we 
mud learn the meaning of fuch names as thefe : Touch, 
Touch- adam, Touch- gorm, Auchenbowie, and Auchenlilly, 
Linfpout. 

Situation.— The parifli belongs to the fynod of Perth and 
Stilling, and to the prdbytery of Stirling. It is bounded 
on the eaft by the parifli of Airth ; on the fouth, ^y Lar- 
bart, Dunipace, and Kilfyth ; on the weft, by Fintry and 
Gargunnock j the river Forth, if the fmall fpace occupied by 
the parifli of Stirling be excepted, feparates it on the north 
from Kincardine, Lecropt, Logic, and Alloa. 

Extent The road between Powbridge, the eaflern extre- 
mity of the parifli, and R.ndyford, the weftern extremity, 
mcafures between 1 5 and 16 miles : but as the figure of the 

parifli 



of St. Ninians. 3 8 7 

parHh is irregular, its extent may be computed, at a medi- 
urn, about i o miles from eaft to weft, and about 6 miles from 
north to fouth. 

The appearance of the Pari/b ancient and modern.— The pa- 
rim Is naturally divided into three regions. The moft nor- 
therly divifion is called the Carfes. The carfes are flat lands 
lying along the banks of the Forth, from the eaft to the weft 
end of the parifh : thefe lands, in a plain but a little raifed a- 
bove the level of the Forth, extend fouthward from one to 
two or three miles. 

The dry field lands form the middle divifion. Thefe rife 
fuddenly and confiderably above the level of the carfes, and 
occupy by much the moft extenfive part of the parifh. The 
muirlands form the higheft region and the moft foutherly di- 
vifion. They rife confiderably above the level of the dryfield 
grounds, and occupy, it is fuppofed, fomewhat more than a 
fourth part of the whole extent of the parifh. 

It is highly probable, that not only a great part of the dry- 
field lands, but that a great part of the muirlands alfo was 
originally covered with wood.. The royal foreft of Dun- 
daff mult have covered the high lands, which are ftill cal- 
led by the name of the lands of Dundaff. The royal 
foreft of Stirling muft have covered the rifing grounds to 
the fouth of that town. An extenfive mofs renders it pro- 
bable, that even the low lands of the parifh, efpecially to the 
north eaft, were once covered with trees. There can be 
no doubt, that at an early period, the Torwood occupied 

much of the lands of the parifh to the eaft and to the fouth 

v 

eaft. 

The limits of the carfe and dryfield lands, ftill afiume the 
general appearance of the banks of a river, and give plauCbi- 
lity to an opinion, that the carfe lands were originally covered 

3 C 2 by

by the water of the Forth. But be this as it may, the hifto- 
ry of the battle of Bannockburn, gives fufficient evidence 
that the carfes, in the Reign of King Robert Bruce, formed 
an almoft impaffible morafs. 

It is by no means probable, that the exertions of art were 
much employed in improving the original appearance of the 
parifh. We have few monuments of antiquity, except the 
Roman caufeway which enters the parifh at the Torwood, 
and pafTes through it in a north- wefterly direction. 

The ruins found in the Muirland, near the fource of the 
Carron, fliould, with fome others in the parifh, have been 
patted over in filence, were they not generally fuppofed to be 
the remains of a caftle, therefidence of Sir John the Graham, 
who fell in the battle of Falkirk, defending the liberty of his 
country, againft the ambition of Edward. 

Prefent Appearance. — The prefent appearance of the parifh 
is very different from its former ftate ; the face of the country 
is naturally beautiful, and the natural beauty of the hills and 
vallies is increafed by the windings of the Forth, by innu- 
merable inclofures, by many young thriving plantations, by 
a variety of villages, and by feveral genteel houfes, appearing 
in different parts of the parifh. 

The carfes are now efteemed as valuable as any land in 
North-Britain. They have already attained the higheft de- 
gree of modern cultivation ; and generally produce luxuriant 
crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, flax, and artificial 
graflcs. 

The dryfklds are in general arable, and have likewife reach- 
ed a confiderable degree of cultivation. They produce the 
fame crops with the carfes ; though the produce of the latter 
be generally fuperior to the produce of the former, both in 
quantity and quality.

The muirlands are in general moft profitably employed in 
rearing black cattle andfheep-, though in many places they 
rarable, and might on every farm fu PP ly the quantny of 
cornconfumedby the feuars and tenants. 

Apiculture in the Carfes.- Rotation of Cro P s.-A farm is 
divided into fix parts. The firft part is laid down m fallow, 
the fecond part in wheat, the third in beans, the fourth m 
barley, the fifth in grafs, the fixth in oats. The rotation on 
each of thefe fix parts is the fame, viz. fallow wheat beans, 
barley, grafs, oat,. The only difference confifts m the crop 
with which the rotation begins. The firft part begms w:th 
fallow, &amp;c. according to the prefent condition of the land. 

TJhge The fallow whilft preparing for a crop of 

wheat, is ploughed fix times, if the weather be favourable ; 
the fields for beans or oats once, for barky thrice or four 
times ; graffes are ufually fown with the barley. 

Manure. Eight chalders of lime are allowed to an acre. 

The lime is thrown on the fallow after the fifth plowing, 
and immediately before the fixth plowing, when the wheat is 
fown. Dung is laid on the ground that is preparing for 
barley ; feventy carts are allowed to an acre. No other ma- 
nure, for the moft part, is employed during one rotation of 
fix years. 

Seed and Produce.— Two firlots of wheat fown on an acre, 
return from eight to ten bolls. Three firlots of barky fown 
on an acre, return feven bolls. One boll or five firlots of 
oats fown on an acre, return fix or feven bolls. Five or fix 
firlots of beans fown on an acre, return feven or eight bolls.

Harveft ufually begins about the middle of Auguft and

The cultivation of the dryfield lands is fomewhat different 
from the cultivation of the carles. The fucceffion of crops 
m the dryfield is commonly in the following, order : Oats two 
years, barley one year, grafs one year, pafture two years. 
Where the ground is very good, peas and beans inftead 
of oats are fometimes fown in the fecond year of the ro- 
tation. 

Land preparing for oats, peas or beans, is ploughed once. 
Ground for barley twice. Graffes are ufually fown with the 
barley. 

Lime is laid on the dryfield lands in the. month of Auguft, 
immediately after the grafs crop is cut. It is not ploughed 
down. Seven chalders are allowed to an acre. Dung is laid 
on the ground, preparing for barley; fixty carts drawn by one 
horfe, are allowed to an acre. When beans and peas are 
fown, the dung is laid upon the ground preparing for them. 
Neither more nor other manure is almoft ever ufed during 
one rotation of fix years. There is marie in the parifh, but 
the ufe of it has of late been almoft entirely difcontinued.

Oats are fown about the middle of March. Barley about 
the beginning of May. Beans about the firft of March. 

Oats and beans are reaped about the middle of September. 
Barley about the latter end of Auguft. 

When wheat is fown on the dryfield lands, which is not 
generally done, the preparation, excepting two plowinge, is 
the fame as in the carfes. 

The carfe land is too wet during winter, for the profitable 
cultivation of turnips ; they are fometimes fown on the dry- 

fields. , 

A few potatoes are planted by almoft every farmer, whe- 
ther in the carfes or in the dryfields. Three bolls planted on 
an acre return about fixty bolls. A little flax alfo is generally 
fown after potatoes. Twelve pecks of lintfeed fown on an 
acre, return thirty fix ftones of lint from the mill. Diffe- 
rent kinds of ploughs are ufed. The price alfo varies from 12s. 
to L. 2 : 12s : 6d. Two horfes are ufually put to a plough 3 
and are fufficient to cultivate a farm of thirty acres. 

It need hardly be added, that thefe ftatements have been 
made at an average, and mull frequently and confiderably 
vary according to the circumftances of particular feafons, and 
of different farmers. 

Roads.— Seven miles of the great turnpike road from Edin- 
burgh to Stirling, five or fix miles of the turnpike road from 
Stirling co Glafgow, about twelve miles of the road from 
Dunbarton to the ferry near Alloa, lie in this parifti. All our 
roads and bridges are kept in excellent repair by the attention 
of the country gentlemen. The expcnces are defrayed by the 
produce of the tolls, or of the ftatute labou-. 

About 



39 2 Statijlical Account 

About twelve years ago, an aft of parliament was obtained 
for the better regulation of the ftatute work in the county of 
Stirling. By that acl, inftead of ftatute labour, leave is given 
to affcfs the land in 18s Iter, for every L. IO o Scots of the 
valued rent. 



Rivers.— The water of Endrick, famous for its trouts, rifes 
in our muirlands; and after running weftward through the 
parifhes of Fintry, Balfron, Killearn, Drymen, and Buchan- 
an, empties itfelf into Loch Lomond. 

Bannockburn (fo called, ( Major is Hijloria) becaufe on it 
was made the meal of the bannocks, or panis cineritius of the 
Romans ; cakes toafted under the afhes were called bannocks), 
receives its water partly from Loch Coulter, and partly from 
the high lands in the north weft part of the parifh. It takes 
its courfe towards the north eaft, and falls into the Forth with- 
in the bounds of the parifh. This fmall river might be em- 
ployed to great advantage by the manufacturer or artifan. 

The Carron runs along the fouthern boundary of the parifh 
for five miles and an half. The Poems of Offian have mark- 
ed the banks of this river as the fcene of battle between the 
Romans and the independent clans of the north. 

It has been thought, though it cannot be certainly deter- 
mined, that the Earl's burn, the Earl's hill, a hill and a rivu- 
let in the muirland part of the parifh, derived their names from 
the refidence of fome feudal baron or earl in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Carron. It is natural to fuppofe, that Gillies 
hill, another hill in the muirland part of the parifh, derives its 
name from the name Gill or Gillies. The names both of 
Gillies and Morifon occur in the muirlands. It is certain, 
that the fair lady, mother of Gill Morice, « lived on the Car- 
ron fide." This union of faas and probabilities fuggefts to 
the imagination, though it cannot perfuade the judgement 

that 



of St. Ninians. 393 

that this parlfli was the fcene of the tragical fong, known by 
the name of Gill Morice. The Carron was once diftinguifhed 
by a cafcade called Auchintillilin's fpout. It is now dlftin- 
guifhed by a very extenfive iron manufadory in the parifh of 
Larbert. 

The Forth is the only great river with which we are con- 
cerned. It forms the boundary of the parifh on the north. 
The length of the river from Gargunnock where it meets, to 
Kerfey where it leaves this parilh, is more than fixteen miles, 
though the diflance betwixt thefe places does not in a ftraight 
line exceed half that extent. The windings of the Forth have 
been remarked and admired by every traveller of tafte ; but 
whilft they beautify the country, they render the navigation of 
the river peculiarly tedious. A minute defcription of the 
Forth feems altogether unneceflary, as the: Forth or ancient 
Bodotria is fufficiently known to every ftudent of Britifh 
hiftory. 

Loch Coulter, the only confiderable loch in the parifh, ex- 
tends about two miles in circumference. It abounds with 
perches and eels, and lies in the muirland part of the parilh. 
It is currently reported, on the evidence of witneffes (till alive, 
that about twenty-four years ago, by fome convulGon of na- 
ture, a ftone weighing nearly a ton was thrown from its bed 
/ in the loch to the diftance of fome yards to the northward. 

The Carron frequently overflows a confiderable tra£t of 
meadow and fome arable land on its banks. Some of the low 
lying lands on the banks of the Forth are fubje&amp;ed to the 
overflowings of the river. A confiderable farm called Boll- 
for-nought, probably from its being gained from the Forth, is 
particularly fubjec~r, to this inconvenience. The wall with 
which it is furrounded has fometimes been broken down by 
the weight of the water, and the greater part of the land over- 
flowed.

It may be proper in this place to obferve, that feveral years 
ago, a remarkable water /pout emptied itfelf, partly on the 
lands of Touch, and partly on the lands of Touch-adam. 
The water which fell on the lands of Touch, carried offfome 
cattle, feveral houfes with their furniture. A few of the inha- 
bitants were drowned. The water which fell on the lands of 
Touch-adam, directed its courfe towards the village of St. 
Ninians, and carried off a bridge and two houfes, together 
with a great quantity of earth from the minifter's glebe and 
ibme other places. 

No other remarkable phenomena of this kind are talked off, 
excepting two fhocks of an earthquake, which m one nighr, 
about thirty years ago, were very generally felt in the parifh 
and neighbourhood. 

There are feveral mineral fprings in the parifh j but they 
are not at prefent much frequented. 

We have feveral merchants who retail the articles of ordi- 
nary conlumption. 

We have no great manufactories. Four tanneries employ 
about 20 hands. Four mafters employ about 113 hands 
in making nails. One hand works from 1000 to 1200 nails 
per day. 

The moft confiderable manufacture is carried on at Ban- 
nockburn. Of late cotton-cloth, and for a long time, all the 
tartan ufed by the army, has been manufactured at .this vil- 
lage. 

There are three coal-works in the parifh; one at Auchen- 
bowie, one at Pleanmuir, one at Bannockburn. Thefe works 
taken together, raife about 600 tons of coal per week. 1 hey 
fupply the adjacent country, efpecially to rhe weft and north,

The parifh abounds with lime-ftone. At prefent, however, 
it is not wrought to any confiderable extent, except at Craig-

end and MurravVhall. At MurrayVhall from « to 13 
chalders of lime are wrought by about 1 7 hands. The burn- 
ing feafon begins about April, and ends about Martinmas. 
The lime is wrought under ground, in the fame manner as 
coal. The feam of lime is from 5 feet 6, to five feet 8 or 
10 inches thick. At Craig-end, 16 men and 2 horfes are 
employed in working yearly about 2000 chalders of hme. 
The feam at this work, is about 5 feet 8 inches. By a chal- 
der is meant 6 bolls peafe meafure. A chalder of {hells is 
equal to 18 or 19 bolls of Hacked lime. The lime at both 
thefe works is of the firft quality. An experiment was 
made at Craig-end ; and in 96 bolls of lime, there was found 

only one boll of fand. 

From 50 to 100 hands are ufually employed in malting, 
and in diftilling aquavitae. There are at leaft 6 dlftilleries 
in the parifh. Some of them at prefent, (November 1794,) 
are not employed.

Rent The valued rent of the parifh certified to the 

Exchequer in the year 1661, amounted to L. 20,861 Scots. 
But according to the fubdivifion dated by the Commiffioners 
of Supply, it does not exceed L. 20,710 of the fame money. 

In the year 1775, the minifter applying for an augmenta- 
tion of ftipend, dated the real rental of the parifh at 
L. 1 2,663 'fterling. But as it is certain, that the rent of land, 
of coal, and of lime, has rifen confiderably fince that time, the 
real rental at prefent cannot be computed at lefs than 
L. 15,000 fterling. 

The landholders amount at prefent to the number of 
132; 51 have held their property for i 4 years; 36 have 
fucceeded as heirs ; 4 5 have purchafed their eftates : 25 pof- 
iefs L. 100 valued rent and upwards; 47 poflefs from L. 20 
to L. 100 valued rent; 60 pofiefs from L. 1 to L. 20 valued 
rent. 

Meetings of Landholders. — Thefe proprietors have in the 
fchool-houfe a commodious room, where they ufually meet 
for tranfacling bufinefs. Ten days, fabbathsnot included, pre- 
vious to a meeting of Landholders, intimation of the time 
and caufe of the meeting mull be made by letter, to fuch of 
their number as do not refide in the parilh; to fuch as refide, 

fimUar 



of St. Ninians. 397 

fimUar intimation is given from the precentor's deflc, after 
divine fervice is concluded. 

Thefe meetings provide for, and fuperintend the building 
and repairing of the church, manfe, fchool-houfe, manfe-of- 
fice-houfes, and the walls of the glebe and church-yard. 
They have a right to infpeft the expenditure of the funds, 
committed to the management of the Kirk Seffion. They 
have a right to infpea the expenditure of vacant ftipend. 
They have at prefent the principal management of the pro- 
vifion made for the poor. They almoft alone nominate to 
the office of fchoolmafter ; and as landholders in the pariffi, 
they have a limited right to vote in the eledion of minifters, 
ferving in the church eftabliffied by law. Every caufe is 
determined by a majority of votes. Records of their tranfac- 
tions are kept by their clerk, and appeals may be made to 
the Court of Seffion, from any decifion fuppofed to be illegal 
or irregular. 

The confiderable eftates, are Touch, Touch-adam, and 
Polmaife, Sauchie, Bannockburn, Graigforth, Auchenbowie, 
Stuart-hall, Throlk, Carnock, Grunyards, Plean, and lands 
belonging to the town and hofpitals of Stirling. Few of the 
proprietors of thefe eftates refide in the pariffi. 

Population. Though the inhabitants of the pariffi havs 

been frequently numbered, we are not able by authentic re- 
cords, to afcertain its ancient population. 

In the year 1755, the population returned to Dr Webfler, 
amounted to 6491. In 1792, it amounted to 7079. It is 
beyond a doubt, that the population of the pariffi is increaf- 
ing. The decreafe of population by the uniting of farms in 
the country, ii more than compenfatcd by the increafe of the 
inhabitants in the villages. / 

Farmers. — 



39® StatiJHcal Account 

Farmers.— Somt of our farmers have been favoured with a 
liberal education. A few of them have been inftrufted in 
the rudiments of the Latin language. Almoft all of them 
have been taught writing and arithmetic, as well as to read 
the Englifh language with undemanding and eafe. Moft of 
them from their earlieft years are inured to manual labour. 
Nor are the operations of carting, plowing, &amp; c . confined to 
their earlier years; many of them always, and moft of them 
occafionally, lend their perfonal labour to the cultivation of 
their grounds. 

As our farmers in general do not enjoy the luxuries of af- 
fluence, fo few of them are fubjeded to the miferies of ex- ' 
treme poverty. Their diet is ufually frugal ; but occafions 
are not wanting when they enjoy with temperance the com- 
forts of the table. Their mental qualifications are not infe- 
rior to their external advantages. This valuable order of fo- 
ciety, is in this place diftinguimed by no inconfiderable de- 
gree of manly intelligence and general information. 

A careful and candid obferver will not deny, that our 
farmers are in general frugal, induftrious, and moderately 
happy ; at the fame time he muft acknowledge, that their 
circumftances might, in many refpeds, be confiderably 
improved. It is not altogether without reafon, that they 
complain of the fmall extent and of the high rents of 
their farms. Their dwelling houfes, with a few excep- 
tions, are confefTedly incommodious. Though the veftiges 
of their original flavery be gradually wearing away, they are 
not as yet completely effaced. In fome baronies, the far- 
mers work the hay, and in others, they cart the coals of the 
landholders. Thirlage is an obvious grievance. Thirlagc is 
a low kind of monopoly by which the tenant is obliged to 
make all, or fome part of his meal, at one fpecified mill. 
The confequences of thirlage are finiilar to the confequences 
1 of 



of St. Nimans. 399 

of all other monopolies : Fraud, extortion, infolence, and 
inferior workmanlhip. If thefe crimes be feldom committed, 
the caufe mult be fought in the miller, not in the nature of 
the monopoly. 

ManufaBurers and others.- The education and manners of 
our manufaaurers fo nearly refemble the education and man- 
ners of our farmers, that a defcription of the latter in a great 
meafure fuperfedes the neceffity of defcribing the former. 
Though diftinguifhed by fome peculiarities infeparable from 
their profeffions, our manufaaurers poffefs a degree of en- 
largement of mind, which refkas confiderable honour on 
the order. 

This happy eff c a muft chiefly be afcribed to the general 
caufes which . are every where diffufing an ennobling light 
through the mafs of mankind. In this place, however, fome 
other caufes contribute a fubordinate influence to enlighten 
the minds of our people. The abfence of great manufaao- 
ries, by obliging the individual to tranfadt bufinefs for.him- 
felf, prevents the degradation of mind which invariably follows 
a minute fubdivifion of labour. Many of our manufaaurers, 
as well as of our farmers, are admitted to the office of an elder 
in the different congregations conneaed with the parifh. 
The duties and privileges of the office, tend not only to en- 
large the minds of the elders, but enable them alfo in their 
intercourfe with others, to extend the fphere of general in- 
formation. Add to this, that the public bufinefs, in moft of 
Our congregations, is conduaed on a very liberal plan. The 
great body of the congregation is frequently aflembled and 
confulted, and the habit of thinking acquires additional 
ftrength from the opinions which, on thefe occafions, are 
openly propofed and difcuffed. 

But 



4°° StatWical Account 

But be the caufes what they will, the fact Is underlie, 
that a confiderable degree of intelligence is poffeffed by the 
great body of the people. 

Poor.— The poor are well fupported. The number of vil- 
lages, the vicinity of the coal and lime-works, the eafe with 
which feuars build houfes, and the low rent at which they 
can afford to let them, have induced many indigent people to 
take up their reGdence in this parifh. After many attempts 
to ameliorate the condition of the poor had been made and 
abandoned by the Heritors and Kirk Seffion, the prefent 
fcheme was in the year 1774, adopted by the county of Stir- 
ling. The poor live in their own houfes, and receive a 
monthly penfion, according to their circumftances. A com- 
mittee of refiding heritors, the minifter, fome elders, and 
other parifhioners, meet on the firft Thurfday of every month, 
and fuperintend the payments made to the poor, according to 
a roll made up by the committee at a private meeting. 
The funds are raifed from, 

1. An affeffinent on the land at a certain rate, per cent, 
the one half payable by the proprietors, the other by the 
tenants, according to their refptctive valued rents- This 
rate is fixed at a general meeting, held annually for the 
purpofe. The rate has never been below 12s per L. 100 
valued rent, nor above 16s, except in 1783, when it rofe 
to 1 8s. 

2. A voluntary contribution from the inhabitants of the 
villages. 

3. The balance of the Seffion funds, after paying the ufual 
accounts. 

4. The produce of the deceafed penfioners effects, fold by 
public auction. 

5. The 



of St. Ninians. 4° r 

5. The weekly colkaion at the parim church. 

6. Dues from the mortcloths. 

The number of penfioners varies every month. The fol- 
lowing Table contains the number of penfioners, and the 
fums expended for 1 5 years.

About two years ago, the Seflion received about L. 1000 
fterling, by a will : On a day fixed by the will of the Donor, 
the intereft of this fum is divided amongfl: the pooteft in- 
habitants of the village of St. Ninians. 

Ecclefiajiical EJlate. — It appears from the regiders, that from 
the year 1655, to the year 1732, the office of minifter of the 
Gofpel in this parifh, was fucceflively held by Meffrs George 
Bennet, William Fogo, James Fullerton, James Forfyth, 
William Couper, John Logan, Archibald Gibfon. 

Vol. XVIII. 3 E Mr 



4° 2 Statijlkal Account 

Mr James Mackie, was admitted March 1734. This fettk- 
ment was promoted by the Heritors, in oppofition to a great 
proportion of the inhabitants of the parifh. During this in- 
cumbency, about one half, it is reported, of the inhabitants of 
the parifh, left the Eftablifhed Church, and joined the Secef- 
fion. 

Mr John Gibfon with confent of all parties, was admitted 
May 1754, and till his tranflation to Edinburgh, 1765, the 
parifh continued almoft in the fame ftate in which he found 
it. 

The next fettlement was oppofed by almoft the whole pa- 
rifh. In June, however, 1773, the eighth year of a procefs 
before the General AfTembly, the patron prevailed, and Mr 
David Thomfon was admitted minifter. The Eftablifliment 
was then abandoned by the great body of its adherents. Thefe, 
with a few others from neighbouring parifhes, joined them- 
felves to the Communion of the Prefbytery of Relief. A 
large houfe was ere&amp;ed; a minifter called and ordained; 
and a ftipend was fixed at L. 100 per a?wum. This ftipend is 
1 principally raifcd from the produce of the feat- rents. 

Previous to Mr Thomfon's death in 1787, his hearers were 
indulged with the choice of the afliftant preacher. From this 
period, the adherents of the Eftablifliment were gradually 
augmented. In the year 1788, they refolved from voluntary 
contributions, to purchafe the right of Patronage ; though 
the price amounted to a fum, between L. 600 and L. 700 fter. 
the refolution was foon carried into eftec~l, and a young man, 
who was appointed to preach in the church during the vacan- 
cy occafioned by Mr Thomfon's death, was admitted mini- 
fit r in Oclober 1 788. 

The right of prefentation is now lodged with a committee 
of 9. The committee confifts of 3 elders, 3 heritors, and 
3 heads of families. The members of fhis committee, are 
2 chofen 



of St. Ninians. 4 C 3 

chofen by the people, and hold their places for life, if they 
continue in full communion with the Eftablifhment. The 
committee is obliged to prefent in due time and according 
to the rules of the church whatever candidate is recom- 
mended to them by a majority of votes. Every head of a 
family in full communion with the Eftablifhment, has a 
right to vote in the election of a minifter. 

In 1746, The church, which the Highland army had con- 
verted into a magazine, was blown up ; but whether by de- 
fign or accident, is not known ; feveral lives were loft by 
the expiofion. It is remarkable enough, that the fteeple re- 
mained entire. It Hands at a confiderable diftance from the 
prefent church, and never fails to excite the traveller's fur- 
prize at fuch an unufual disjunction. 

The New Church was built foon after the deftruclion of 
the other. It is 75 by 53 feet within the walls, and at pre- 
fent in complete repair. 

About e« miles fouth weft of the church, there is another 
place of worfhip. The heritors of the muirland part of the 
parifh erected this chapel, and the minifter or his afliftant, 
ufually preaches there on the firft fabbath of every month. 

The ftipend was fettled as follows, by a decreet of modifi- 
cation and locality, of date February 1785. " The Lords of 
" Council and SeiTion, modified, difcerned, and ordained, 
" and hereby modify, difcern, and ordain the conftant fti-

2 chalders bear, and L. 1000 Scots money for ftipend, 
with L. 90 money forefaid for furnifhing the Communion 
Elements ; but have difcerned, and hereby declare, 600 
merks of the faid ftipend (hall be paid by the purfuer, to

The fchool- mafter teaches Latin, Greek, Englifh, book* 
keeping, &amp;c. his falary paid by the heritors, is L. 14:12. 
his other perquifites amount to about L. 20, befides an ex- 
cellent dwelling-houfe, fchool-houfe, garden, and the ordi- 
nary fchool fees. 

There are many fmall fchool s in different parts of the pa- 
rifh ; together with a Sabbath-evening fchool, in which 
the principles of religion are taught gratis, by one of the 
elders of the church. 

Antiquities. — In early times, that traft of country now cal- 
led Stirling-fhire, was fituated upon the confines of no lefs 
than 4 kingdoms. It had the North Umbrean and Cumbrean 
dominions on the fouth, and thofe of the Scots and Pids 
upon the north. Probably it belonged fometimes to one, 
and fometimes to another; for thefe powers were perpetually 
making encroachments on each other. Such a fituation, 
puts it beyond a doubt, that St. Ninians muft have been the 
field of contention, not only between parties and tribes, but 
likewife between nations. An attempt however, to perpetu- 
ate the memory of thefe contentions, were equally vain and 
fruitkfs. The wifdom of hiftory has configned them to de- 
fined

fcrved oblivion ; and to recover them by means of tradition, 
were only to augument the already too numerous monuments 
of the weaknefs and folly and crimes of mankind. Their 
magnitude and confequences, have perpetuated the memory 
of 3 battles, which the ftatiRical reader will expeft in the 
parifh of St. Ninians. 

The battle of Stirling, was fought on the 1 3th September 
1297. The Scots were commanded by Wallace ; the Englifh 
by Hugh Creffingham, and John Earl of Surry and Suffex. 
The defeat of the Englifh, effecled near Corn-town, on the 
northern banks of the Forth, was completed at the Torwood. 
The boundaries of the Torwood are much contra&amp;ed, and that 
part of it which lay in this parifh, is almoft entirely removed. 

The battle of Bannockburn, was fought in this parifh, on 
Monday, the 24th June, 1314. The Englifh Reader may 
find an account of this batrle, in any Britifh Hiftorian. 
The Antiquarian will not be difpleafed with the following 
authentic description of Ballon. 

Bafton, a Carmelite friar, and prior of a monaftery in 
Scarborough, was reckoned one of the belt poets of his age. 
Edward brought him with the Englifh army to Scotland, that 
he might witnefs and celebrate the victory, which that mo- 
narch expected to obtain. The poet was taken, prifoner, but 
obtained his liberty, on condition of compofing a poem in 
honour of the victorious Scots. Independently of the trail fac- 
tion which it records, the poem itfelf is not the leaft of our 
curiofities*.

Geography and Natural liijiory. 

*TnHE annals of the iath century mention this parlfii by 
its prefent name, which is pure Celtic, though a little 
differently enunciated in that tongue. It fignifies the little 
Burial Mount. It is fituated on the banks of the Don, about 
40 Englilh miles from its mouth near Aberdeen, and about 
20 from its fources, in the mountains of Curgarff. It is un- 
equally divided by the river, which the people commonly 
pafs upon ftilts ; which are poles or flakes, about 6 feet in 
length, with a ftep on one fide, on which the pafienger 
raifed about 2 feet from the ground, retting them againfl 
his fides and armpits, and moving them forward by each 
hand, totters through. This fhows the river is not navigable. 
It is however moderately flocked with the two kinds of trout, 
common to all the fmaller rivers on the eaftern fide of the 
kingdom. 

The parifh feparated from its neighbours, on every fide by 
pretty high hills, may be confidered as a level valley, from 2

to 3 miles fquare, to which is adjoined a narrow ftripe, 
ftretched between the north fide of the parifh of Auchendoir, 
and the mountains, for 3 or 4 miles in an eafterly direction ; 
fuggefting by its form to a fanciful imagination, the idea of 
the pafte-board kite, which Dr Franklin firft raifed into the 
thunder cloud. 

Productions — The foil may be regarded as • for the mofl 
part a rich deep gravelly loam, fuppofed to be the mofl fer- 
tile in this great county, the boll of bear weighing 20 flone 
Dutch, and on a well cultivated field, in a favourable feafon, 
2 or 3 ftones more in the boll are generally expected. 

The outfield is ftill managed in the mofl ancient fafhion ; 
but all the modern improvements in the fcience of agricul- 
ture, have been introduced into the infield \ bear is fpoken 
of by its own proper name, and though peafe, potatoes, tur- 
nip, flax, and artificial graiTes, have been long enumerated 
among the productions of the parifh, oats are ftill fcarccly 
known by any other name, than that of corn ; carrying back 
our imagination to that ftate of fociety, when this was the 
only grain known in the country. There are inexhauftible 
quarries of free-done, fit for all the purpofes both of the 
moll fubftantial and ornamental architecture ; but rarely 
found hard enough for mill- ftones. 

Lime is brought for manure in confiderable quantities 
from the parifh of Cabrach on the north, which Dr Anderfon, 
in his report to the Board of Agriculture, feems to have con- 
fidered as in the county of BanfF; and he has not been in- 
formed that the parifh of Glenbucket on the weft, contains 
an inexhauftible ftore of this fertilizing mineral, becaufe by an 
il! direaed policy of the landlord, it has been there for fome 
years locked up 5 for as both the ftone and peat in that very 
inland diftrift are more than equal to the confumpt of all 

generations, 



of Kildrummy. 4*3 

generations, t-Kis reftraint muft have been impofed from the 
idea of inducing the people to beftow that labour on the foil) 
which would be otherwife laid out on the calcination and 
carriage of lime-ftone. In a country, where the whole cat- 
tle are fupported during the fummer, on widely extended 
mountain pafturage inacceffible to the plough, and where the 
whole arable land is under crop at fartheft by the middle of 
June, there is an interval of nearly 3 months, in which the 
whole operations of the field are neceflarily fufpended, 
when the induftry of the people coinciding with their own 
inclination, might be more profitably exerted in making lime 
for fale, than by their prefent cafual and often mifguided 
exertions. On the other hand, the liberty of following their 
own judgement with regard to the ufe of lime on their farms, 
would do more to promote the improvement of the foil, than 
the prefent arbitrary reftriaion which evidently difcourages, 
rather than excites their induftry. 

It is hardly of importance to mention, that there is a con- 
fiderable extent of natural birch-wood, on a bank overhang- 
ing a brook winding near the caftle j and fmall plantations 
of foreft and fir-trees at the manors of Clova and Brux. 

The horfes, though of a fmall fize, are of a fine figure, 
fpirited and hardy. They appear to be an unmixed breed, 
that has for ages paft been raifed in this quarter of the 
country. If properly broke, and well kept, they would 
make fine pownies for ladies, and for an airing in the coun- 
try. They are fold from L. 4 or L. 5 to L. u or L. 14 fter. 
Of late, their fervice has b^en required for the plough and cart. 
In former times, when there were no carts in the country, 
and when the plough was drawn by oxen, their labour was 
reftri£ted to the harrow, — to carrying out the dung in bafkets 
on their fides — bringing in the corn, and exporting the meal 
and other commodities in panniers to the Aberdeen market. 
1 The 



4 T 4 • Statljlical Account 

The black cattle are not fmaller than in any other diftria 
of the county; and they are often of a finer pile and form, 
to which the herbage of the rich foil, and the warm fheltered 
fituation are prefumed to contribute. 

Their number and their value are fo often varied, by the 
rife or fall of the demand or of the price, that thefe particu- 
lars cannot with any rcfponfible precifion be ftated. 

Although there are but few farms on which there are no 
fheep kept, yet this kind of ftock is of no diftinguifhed con- 
fideration, has received but flight attention, and been regard- 
ed rather as a matter of domeftic accomodation, than of 
commerce or agricultural profit. To render this flock cf 
proper account, it is requifite to take meafures in fummer, 
for fecuring a certain and more plentiful fupply of food, 
during the fnows of winter, and the cold weather, and the 
fcanty pafturage of the fpring months. 

There has never been any meafurement or furvey of the 
panfh. The number of arable acres may be fuppofed about 
a fifth part of the whole ; the outfield may be about a third 
part more in quantity than the infield : Originally they muft 
have been nearly of the fame quantity, and of equal value ; 
but at prefent, there is certainly a great difference. The 
outfield may be accounted worth 5s the acre, and the infield 
may be valued about a guinea j but as the number of acres 
is no where afcertained, and as the rents are paid in meal 
and money, in cuftoms and fervices to the heritor, and to 
the miller, neither landlord nor tenant can fay with any pre- 
cifion, what the rent may be by the acre. 

On moft farms it would be proper to remove the buildings 
to the vicinity of the outfields, and to cultivate them in a 
fuitable rotation of crops, with the application of the whole 
manure, and a proper allowance for lime ; while the infields, 
if enclofed and laid out in artificial grafs, would for fome 

years, 



of Kildrummy. 415 

years, be more valuable than in corn ; and by this means, 
the whole land would in a fhort time rife to the value of a 
pound or guinea the acre ; but to efFeftuare this, the purfe 
of the landlord muft be conjoined with the labour of the ten- 
ant, an encouraging length of leafe muft be given to the ten- 
nant, and a progreffive rife of rent to the landlord. 

The parifh is at prefent fhared among 4 heritors. Charles 
Gordon of Ward-houfe, Efq. holds about the one half, the 
principal mefiuage of the Earls of Marre Harry Lumfden, 
Efq. of Auchendoir, has Clova and the north ; the fouth is 
pollened by Jonathan Forbes of Brux, Efq.; and part of the 
eftate of Alexander Leith of Glenkindy, Efq. (ketches from 
the parifh of Towie on the weft. 

"Population. — There is no record extant by which the popu- 
lation of very ancient times can be in any way afcertained. 
It may be prefumed, it has at no time been materially diffe- 
rent from what it is at prefent ; for the number of the retain- 
ers of the Earls of Marre about the caftle, mud be more than 
balanced by that of the improvers lately fettled upon a coti- 
fiderable extent of moor, which was formerly wholly waffce. 
In 1755, the number was 562 fouls. At prefent, the num- 
ber is 568, of whom 221 are males, and 347 females. 
Some of them are craftfmen, fhoemakers, taylors, foriths, 
neceflary for the occafions of the country; yet all of them 
poflefs fome land, and are fo frequently engaged in the ope- 
rations of agriculture, that the whole may be regarded as 
farmers, there being no town or village in the parifh. 

Mifcellaneous Remarks — The Scots language, with the e- 
nunciation peculiar to the county of Aberdeen, is the only 
tongue fpoken in the parifh ; but many of the names of places 
are of the Gsclic language : the names of fome of the farms 

in

in the vicinity of the caftle, indicate them to have been alio- 
cated for the fupport of the refpeftive offices of that ancient 
eftabliflihient, fuch as Cook's hill, Gardener's hill, &amp;c. 

Peat is the only fuel ufed ; though this article is feldom 
bought or fold, it is fo diftant from many of the farms, that 
the corns are generally dried upon the kilns by heath ; the 
fupport of the fire being commonly committed through the 
day, to any of the children of 6 or 8 years old, not other- 
wife engaged ; yet there is no inftance of any kiln being 
burnt. 

The prices of labour, of poultry, and of all commodities 
are the fame, as in the town and markets of Aberdeen. 

Antiquities. — The caftle among the objects of antiquity, 
claims the firft regard. From the river Don, winding along 
the bottom of the hill, which feparates the parifh from that 
of Cuflmie on the fouth, the country gradually rifes towards 
the corner, where the ridge on the weft, joins the mountain 
on the north fide of the parifti : A brook rifing in the angle 
formed by that junction, feems in fome remote age, to have 
directed its courfe foutherly, along the bottom of the weftern 
ridge, right onwards to the river, and in that direction, 
formed a pretty deep hollow ; but has afterwards fallen into 
an eaflerly courfe, and thereby for a little way, formed a 
deep and narrow defile along the bottom of the mountain on 
the north, until it regains its former direction towards the 
river. By this means, it may be prefumed, the eminence 
has been formed on which the caftle is placed. 

Tradition bears, that it originally confifted but of one great 
circular tower, of 5 ftories or floors ; diftinguiflied by the ap- 
pellation of the Snow Tower, in the weftern corner of the 
prefent fabric, which was afterwards carried round a pretty 
fpacious court, forming an unequal pentagon, in which 6 

other 



of Kildrumviy. 417 

other towers differing in magnitude and form, rofe for the 
proteaion of the intervening buildings, which appear to have 
been but 2 ftories in height. Two of thefe towers were for 
the fecurity alone of the only gate placed in the weftern wall, 
occupying the whole fpace between them ; the walls were 4 
feet thick, built of run-lime, and the outfide courfes of free- 
ftone, regularly fquared ; the weftern wall was reared on the 
verge of the acclivity at firft defcribed, which rofe however 
in fuch'a gentle Hope, as'to afford fpace for the garden, 
which, though warm and finely fheltered, would in the pre- 
fent age, be accounted too fmall. The northern fide was fe- 
cured by the fteep banks of the brook, and round the eaft 
and fouth, were deep artificial ditches, the whole fortifica- 
tion occupying nearly 3 Scots acres ; befides a draw-well. 
There may be (till traced from the interior of the fortrefs, a 
fubterranean vaulted paffage, of height fufficient for horfes, 
opening in the bank, now much above the prefent bed of the 
brook, although it is believed, its channel was then on a 
level with the exterior opening of this covered way. In the 
middle of the eaftern wall, the chappel may be ft ill diftin- 
guifhed by the peculiar form of the window above the altar ; 
confifting of 3 very long, and Very narrow flits. Tradition 
reports, that the chappel was occupied as a magazine of 
forage, during the noted fiege, by the forces of Edward I. 
In the year 1306; that when Robert I. and his wife and 
daughter, were underftood to have made their efcapc, by 
means of the covered way to the ; county of Rofs, the befieg- 
ers defpaired of fuccefs, when a piece of red hot iron thrown 
through this window into the forage, occafioned fuch dif- 
traftion by the conflagration, that the caftle was won bv 
furprife and ftorm.

tie with its whole demains, fell into the poffeffion of a pro- 
prietor, who, tending elfewhere, let the adjoining lands to 
a tenant, who preferred low thatched cottages of his own 
rearing, to the lofty roofs of this royal palace, and the ma- 
terials were partly carried off for other buildings, fo that 
both the ravages of man and of time, have conjoined to ac- 
celerate its ruin. 

The family of Fife, in the laft generation, acquired the 
fuperiorities of the Earldom of Marre, by purchafe from the 
crown. It is faid, they (till retain the privilege of holding 
meetings, and tranfa&amp;ing bufinefs, with the vaffals in the 
Snow Tower; it is however certain, this never was, and it 
is much more than probable, that it never will be, afcertained 
by a£tual practice. 

Moft of thofe who vifit thefe ruins, make fome reflections 
upon their ancient magnificence, compared with their prefent 
filent defolation. It would be more pleafant, and perhaps more 
ufeful, to compare the freedom, fecurity, and comfort which 
the people now enjoy, notwithstanding all the clamours 
refpedling the corruption and decay of the conftitution, with 
what they experienced, during any period of the 6oo years 
in which the caftle ftoodin fplendor and magnificence. It is 
certain, that during this long tra£t of time, in which even 
the Kings and Nobles lived in fear, and in comfortlefs infe- 
Curity ; the condition of the inferior ranks of fociety was 
extremely miferable ; while the minds of all were debafed 
under the domination of oppreffive prieftcraft, and the 
gloomieft fuperftition ; the fortunes, perfons, and lives of the 
people, were at the uncontrolled difpofal of their petty, yet 
arbitrary chiefs ; and the people were continually harafled by 
robberies, murders, and predatory wars, among their rapacious 
and capricious lords. Their habitations in cleannefs and ac- 
commodation, were not fuperior to the huts of the moft 

favage 



of Kildrummy. 419 

favage tribes; their furniture, clothing, and victuals, were 
mean and wretched in the extreme. 

But the civil liberty and the equal diftribution of juftice 
which they now enjoy, coftly as thefe bleffings are, by af- 
fording fome degree of fecurity, both to their perfons and 
their fubftance, hath produced among them a fatisfadion 
and elevation of mind, unfelt in former times ; their fpirits 
are neither deprefied by the flavifh dread of infolent tyranni- 
cal fuperiors, nor debafed by the gloom of difmal fuperftition ; 
the pure and gentle religion which they are now taught, 
enables them to fupport the natural ills of life, by their truft 
in a wife and good Providence, and by their hope of a happy 
eternity. Their houfes are tight, commodious, and com- 
fortably furnifhed ; well lighted, and free from fmoke, clean 
in fummer, and warm in winter ; and the drefs of apprentice 
boys, at church and market, is fuperior to the finery of the 
young nobility of ancient times. By their frequent intercourfe 
with the city of Aberdeen, and trafficking in cattle fairs, from 
the mores of the Moray Frith to the other fide of the Gram- 
pian mountains, they have acquired acutenefs, discretion, 
and polimed manners, far fuperior to thofe of the fame rank, 
in the belt cultivated provinces of this great Empire. 

Although the ancient times which have been mentioned, 
were far from being comfortable, yet the parifh contains indi- 
cations of a ftate of fociety in an earlier age, more unhappy 
ftill ; a ftate in which it was necelLry for the inhabitants to 
conceal themfelves under ground, debarred from the free air, 
and the light of day. We are unable to guefs at what cera of 
our hiftory thofe fubterranean abodes were neceffary ; or 
whether the neceffity was occafioned by the weaknefs, or 
pufillanimoufnefs of the people; or whether it arofe from 
the dread of a foreign or domeftic foe. Thofe habitations 
have only been found in one quarter of the parifh, about a

mile north- eaft from the caftie, in a very level moor of con- 
fidence extent, exhibiting no token of having ever produced 
wood, of any kind. Their number is confiderable ; but not 
certainly afcertained; for the people who have lately fettled 
as improvers on the moor, difcover from time to time, one 
unobferved before. Their entrance commonly from the 
weftern end, is not larger than may be (hut by many of the 
greater ftones fcattered over the moor. The infide of the 
largeft yet feen, meafures about 1 6 or 20 feet in length, 
and about 6 or 7 in breadth at the floor; the walls are about 
4 feet high, untouched by the mafon's hammer, and without 
mortar of any kind; approaching (o each other gradually, 
from the foundation, fo as to be covered at the level of the 
moor by flag- ftones about 3 feet in length, above which the 
excavated earth has been carelefsly accumulated ; fo as while 
the rain is thereby carried off, the external appearance is that 
only of a fhapelefs hillock, fuggefting no idea of its contents. 

Thefe remotely ancient abodes, carry back our contem- 
plations to a ftate of fociety, when the principles upon 
which the arch is conftructed, were nearly, but not com- 
pletely difcovered ; and by comparing the ftructure of thefe 
concealed abodes, with the mod durable monuments of the 
wifdom of Egypt, the mod venerable fanes of celebrated 
Alia, and the moft elegant temples of polimed Greece, 
there will be found reafon to believe, that thofe principles 
undifcovered by\he ingenuity of the moft renowned nations, 
were fir ft. known among our own rude anceftors. But as 
Tacitus hath mentioned, (Mor. Germ. C. 16.) that fuch ha- 
bitations were alfo common among the ancient favages oi 
the Continent, we are not certain that the whole credit of dif- 
covering this important branch of architedurc belongs to 
ourfelves.

It might be thought an omifiion, not to mention a Hone

The little green mount, the only burial ground m 
the pariflv, upon which alfo the church is built, has no 
doubt, given the parifh its name ; and it may be prefumed 
a church had been ereaed there, before the foundations of 
the cattle were laid, and before the free ftone quarries 
were opened, which afforded the materials for its walls; as 
the fabric of the prefent church is compofed of common 
ftone, colleaed from the furface of the moor, probably for 
building the firft church , the parifh ever enjoyed. There 
are feveral of the pews, with the initials of the firft own- 
ers, and dates more than a century ago. The ayle on the 
fouth fide, containing the feats, no lefs modern, which 
the Earls of Marre, and their attendants occupied, is built 
over the vault in which the bodies of their dead were for 
man£ generations laid. Several lkulls, and many of the 
bones remain unburied in the bottom of the vault, the 
hatchway entrance from the floor of the ayle being now im- 
perfectly clofed. 

The enbalmed body of a lady lay there in perfeft prefer- 
vation, till about the year 1746, when fome gentlemen of 
the county, idle by the diffractions of that period, carried 
off the body, for more minute infpection, than the accom- 
modation about the church allowed. It was on that occa- 
fion difmembered, and a leg and thigh, it is faid, were fent 
over to Rome. 

It is fuppofed to have been the body either of the fifter 
of King Robert Bruce, Chriftian the wife of Graitney, Earl 
of Marre, who added Kildrummy as her dower to the pof-

Name, Skuatiotiy Extent. 

T^ORROWSTOWNNESS, derives its name from the 
fmall village of Borrowftown *. The parifh is fituattd 
in the county and prefbytery of Linlithgow, and in the Synod 
cf Lothian and Tweeddale. The town flands about 3 miles 
north from the prefbytery feat, and about 18 miles north- 
weft from Edinburgh, the feat of the Synod. 

Prior to the year 1634, Borrowftown nefs belonged to the 
parifh of Kinniel. The inhabitants then becoming nume- 
rous, built a church, finding it inconvenient to travel nearly 
2 miles to the Old Church at Kinniel, and petitioned the 
Parliament of Scotland, A. D. 1649, for a disjunftion, and 
a feparate minifter. Parliament granted the prayer of the 
petition, and after feveral vifitations, the prefbytery of Lin- 
lithgow 

* Borrowftown probably the town of the borough, as being in the vicini- 
ty of Linlithgow, the county town in the neighbourhood, and nefs, whick 
fignifies a point of iand proje£Ung into the fea.

Kthgow found it neceffary, that Borrowftownnefs fiiould be 
ereded into a parifii by itfelf, bounded on the fouth, by 
Graham's dyke; on the north, by the fea ; on the eaft, by 
Thirleftone, and on the weft, by the cattle wall, commonly 
called « Capit's wall." In December 1669, the Duke and 
Duchefs of Hamilton, obtained an a&amp; of the Scotch Parlia- 
ment, declaring the church lately built within the town to be 
" the kirk of the hail barony of Kinniel and Borrowftown- 
" nefs." From that period, the pnrifhes have been united, 
and confidered as one. The parilh now is about 4 Englifh 
miles, in length, from eaft to weft, and about 2I- in breadth, 
from fouth to north. 

Nearly of a triangular form, it is bounded on the eaft and 
fouth, by the parifhes of Carridden and Linlithgow ; on the 
weft and fouth, by the river Avon, which divides it from the 
pariflies of Polmont and Muiravonfide ; and on the north, it 
is bounded by the Frith of Forth, reckoned 4 miles in breadth, 
directly oppofke to the burgh of Culrofs. 

Surface, Soil, Rent, Produce. — The pariah comprehends 
more than 320 Englifh acres, all properly divided and 
well inclofed, except about 126 acres in "the neighbourhood 
of the town, which are let or feued for the conveniency of 
the inhabitants. The furface of the high ground or dry- field, 
which may contain 2713 acres, is uneven, rifing gradually 
from the Frith to the fouth, and Hoping gently on the weft, 
to the banks of the Avon. It is let at about 24s per acre. 
The foil is deep and heavy, of a thick, loamy confidence. 
About 330 acres of the north- weft part of the parifii, are 
caffe ground. It is of the fame nature with the carfe of Fal- 
kirk, and reckoned rather fupcrior in quality. Prior to the 
year 1750, this land was let at a low rent. At that period, 
a new leafe was granted, at iS^dper acre. In the year 



of jSorroiuJlQwnneJs. 4 2 5 

1770, another leafe was granted at L. 1 : 18 :6A per acre. 
And in A. D. 1792, the laft leafe was granted at L. 2 : 10s 
per acre. The valued rent of the parifh is L. 3559 : 8s Scots, 
and the real rent at prefent is reckoned about L. 3000, ex- 
clufive of the coal and fait. In general, the ground over all 
the parifh is in good order, and capable of the higheft im- 
provement. A farmer employs 2 or 3 ploughs, with fome- 
times 2 hotfes, and fometimes 4 in a plough. No oxen are 
employed for the purpofes of hufbandry, and grain appears a 
greater object than pafturage. The average price of a good 
horfe reared in the parifh, and 5 years old, is L. 20. A good 
cow of the fame age, is fold at L. 6. Beans, wheat, peas, 
barley, and oats, are fown in rotation. Beans, peas, and 
oats are fown in March and April ; barley in April, and the 
beginning of May ; wheat for the mod part is fown in Sep- 
tember and October. If the feafon is favourable, harveft be- 
gins in Auguft, and ends in October. The crop is reaped by 
domeftics, day-labourers, or fervants hired for the purpofe, 
and their wages vary according to contingent circumftances. 
Within thefe 20 years fown grafs has been introduced into 
the parifh, and pretty good crops of hay have been produced. 
Befides many clumps of young firs in a thriving ftate, there 
are upwards of 70 acres of natural wood in the vicinity of 
Kinniel houfe. 

Heritors. — The Duke of Hamilton is proprietor, and fupe- 
rior of the whole parifh of Borrowftownnefs, except the farm 
of Muir-houfe, afterwards to be mentioned ; it holds of the 
Crown by a charter from Charles II. His Grace the prefent 
Duke never refided in the parifh. The houfe of Kinniel, 
an ancient feat of that noble family, is large and habitable.

are neat, and in good order. Some of them are fpacious, 
and the fineft figures wrought in tapeftry, are to be feen in

diftant period, a wing has been added to the north end of 
the houfe, containing fome elegant apartments. The houfe 
is furrounded by two gardens, by large inclofures, and by 
aged planting, which forms beautiful natural villas ; and 
though now uninhabited, in other times it was the residence 
of Nobility, and the retreat of Kings.

In the parifh, there is one minifter of the Eftablifhed 
Church, one preacher, three ftudents of divinity, and 293 
dhTenters, including all fedaries and their children *, The 
Antiburghers only have a place for public worfhip ; but no 
minifter. The Burghers were connected with a congregation 
in Linlithgow. 

Town. — Borrowftownnefs is a Burgh of Barony, governed 
by a baillie appointed by the Duke of Hamilton. No cer- 
tain information can be obtained when it was built, or when 
it was erected into a Burgh of Regality ; but it was made a 
Burgh of Barony, when the Jurifdi&amp;ion Act was repealed in 
1748 f. It is fituated on the north-eaft corner of the parifh, 
almoft on a level with the fea. At high-water, the tide 
waflies the north fide of the town. The two principal ftreets 
are narrow, and running from weft to eaft, about 300 yards, 
terminate in one, which is continued about 350 yards farther. 
The houfes, bearing the marks of antiquity, are low and 
crouded ; but for the moft part, clean and commodious. 
The fmcke from the coal-works, was lately a great nuifance. 
The town involved continually in a cloud, the houfes were 
blackened with foot, the air impregnated with vapour, and 
ftrangers were (truck with the pandemonian appearance of 

the

the place. But thefc nuifances being now removed from the 
immediate vicinity, to a confutable diftance, and more at- 
tention paid to cleaning the ftreets, the air is more pure and 
falubrious, and the town afTumes a very different afped. 
Still, indeed, the fmoke from the Grange coal- works on the 
eaft, the Bo-nefs falt-pans on the weft, and the duft excited 
by the carts carrying coals to the quays for exportation, occa- 
fionally incommode the inhabitants. 

An elegant building, faid to be an exaft model of Inveraray 
houfe, was built at the head of the harbour, about 20 years 
ago, by the Duke of Hamilton. The ground floor was in- 
tended for a Prifon, the fecond for a Court-room, and the 
attic ftory, for a School. But, the original intention not 
having been carried into execution, this fine building is going 
to ruin. Any rooms in repair, are employed as granaries. 
If the original defign were executed, the houfe would be 
highly ufeful and ornamental to the place. 

Water is fometimes fcarce in fummer, the coal-mines hav- 
ing diverted all the fprings from their former channels. It 
is to be found, however, at a fmall diftance from the town, 
in great abundance, and of an excellent quality, fit for every 
domeftic purpofe. It is propofed to bring it to the town by 
pipes, for the benefit of the inhabitants. Crowded as the 
houfes may appear to a ftranger, no bad confequences are 
felt. No endemical difeafes prevail. The epidemics, fuch 
as the fmall-pox, meafles, chincough, &amp;c. are not more 
frequent than in other places. Dyfenteries are very rare ; 
and fevers, when they do prevail, are in general of a low, 
nervous clafs. It has been obferved, that health is enjoyed in 
a greater degree about Borrowftownnefs, than in many other 
towns of its fize and population. This is eafily accounted for.

potation of vegetable effluvia muft impregnate the atmof. 
pnere ; wh,ch, combined with the vapours from the falt~pan 8 
m the immediate neighbourhood, will correal any feptic qua- 
hty in the air. The walks about the town, are romantic and 
inviting; the walks on the quays, and on the weft beach, 
are, at all times, dry and pleafant, much fitted to promote 
health and longevity. But here, as in many other places 
fpecified in the Statical Account of Scotland, tippling 
houfes are too numerous. It may be ferioufly regretted, by 
the friends of religion and virtue, that fo many people are 
licenfed to vend ardent fpirits in every town and village. 
Such places enfnare the innocent, become the haunts of the 
idle and diffipated, and ruin annually the health and morals 
of thoufands of mankind. Perhaps, if the malt-tax were 
aboliflied, and an adequate additional tax laid upon Britifli 
fpirits, as in the days of our fathers, malt-liquor would be 
produced, to nourifli and ftrengthen, inftead of whifky, 
which waftes and enfeebles the constitution : Or, were Jus- 
tices of the Peace to limit the number of licences hTued, 
by apportioning them to the population of each.place, and 
by granting them to perfons of a refpedable charafter, a 
multitude of grievances would be redrefled, to which the 
innocent fpoufe, and the helplefs infant are daily expo- 1 
fed.

Statiftical Account 

J^nnin.ofthis century, the weft head or pier, had been fc 
, me Before *« P«iod, it is faid, veiTels were 

loaded and unloaded at low water, by means of a caufeway, 
run out mto the mud. The eaft head was begun in the me- 
mory of old people yet alive; and had not been built above 
one third of its prefer* length, when an increafe of trade oc- 
cafioned an application to parliament, for an impoft of two 
pennies Scots on the pint of ale and beer brought into, or 
brewed in the town, for repairing and enlarging the harbour. 
This was obtained in , 744 , for 25 years, and was renewed 
for 25 years longer, in .767, and extended over the parifh ; 
and again, in 1794, continued for 21 years, with the addi' 
tion of an anchorage duty of id| per ton, on every (hip enter- 
ing the harbour. Thefe duties, are under the management 
of 1 s Truftees, eleded from the merchants and fhip-mafters, 
who have been enabled, from time to time, to make great 
improvements on the harbour. One of great importance, a 
bafon for cleaning the harbour, was executed about 30 years 
ago, by the late Robert M'Kell, Engineer. A double wall, 
moated in the heart, was run acrofs between the two piers, 
inclofing about one fourth of the harbour, on the land fide, 
and having 4 fluices. During fpring tides, thefe fluices are 
regularly opened, and fhut at full fea, when a great body of 
water is retained. At low water, the fluices are opened ; 
emptying the bafon with fo rapid a current, that in the courfe 
of a few years from the ereclion, a great increafe to the depth 
of water in the harbour, was made, and continues to be 
maintained at a very fmall expence. This bafon-wall, being 
of fimilar breadth with the two piers, has given great accom- 
modation to trade; and from it alfo, a middle pier has been 
built, parallel to the other two. The addition juft now fi- 
niflicd of 1 60 feet t the eaft pier, not only gives more room 
for fhipping, but clofes in the harbour fo completely, from

the north and eafterly ftorms, to which it had been much ex- 
pofed, that at prefent it may be fairly confidered as one of the • 
fafeft harbours in North Britain, and alfo one of the eafieft ac- 
cefs. The depth of the harbour in fpring- tides, is from 16 to 
18 feet. The piers, bafon, and harbour may include about 2 
Englifh acres. It is propofed, as foon as circumltatices will 
allow, to have a dry- dock, which can be conveniently fituated 
on one fide of the bafon, and will be another material im- 
provement. 

Ship-building and Ships. — At Borrowftownnefs, fhip-build- 
ing has been carried on pretty extenfively for 40 years*- 
There are 2 builders at prefent, of confiderable eminence in 
their profcffion, who employ from 30 to 40 men conftantly ; 
and build veffels from 40 to 3 50 tons burden. One fhip is 
now building for a Company at Greenock, of nearly 400 
tons. 

The (hipping belonging to the town, are at prefent 25 fail? 
whereof 17 are brigantines, of 70 to 170 tons per regifter ; 
and 8 fail are floops, from 20 to 70 tons per regifter 5 employ- 
ing about 170 men and boys. Of the brigantines, 6 are 
under contract to fail regularly once every 14 days, to and 
from London. They are all fine veffels, from 147 to 167 
tens per regifter. The remaining 1 1 brigantines, and 1 o£ 
the floops, alfo a good veffel, are chiefly engaged in the Bal- 
tic trade. The other 7 floops, are for the canal and coafting. 
The (hipping of the port, including all the creeks, are faid to 
be nearly 10,000 tons per regifter; and thofe of Borrow- 
flownnefs, make about one fourth of the whole. 

Trade— Several branches of commercial and mechanical 
induftry are carried on at Borrowftownnefs. A pottery was 
begun on a fmall fcale in the year 1784. Within thefe 3

years, it has been carried on upon a much more extenfive 
plan. At prefent, it employs nearly 40 perfons ; including 
men, boys, and girls. The clay for the ftone-ware is im- 
ported from Devonfhire. The clay for the earthen-ware is 
found in the parifh. Cream-coloured, and white ftone-ware, 
plain and painted, and brown earthen-ware, are the articles 
principally manufactured. A manufacture of foap belonging 
to a company in the town, is carried on to a confiderable ex- 
tent. It employs 6 men, and pays annually to Government, 
about L. 3000 fterling. Whale-fifhing has been often and 
long attempted j but without fuccefs. It is now entirely 
given up. Herring- fifhery was very fuccefsful in the Frith 
laft feafon *. But as it is a new fpeculation in the place, 
nothing certain can be faid on the fubject. Small quantities 
of flounders and whitings are taken during ftream-tides, in 
the run of Avon-water, weft of the harbour, and moftly by 
the coalliers who ufe hand-nets. Some likewife are taken in 
cruives. It has long been thought, that this fiming might 
turn out to much more account, were it followed with atten- 
tion and (kill, as good haddocks have frequently been caught 
in the neighbourhood. 

Many of the women in this town, and the country around, 
earn a comfortable fubfiftence by fpinning filk, the wafte of 
Spittalfield's manufacture, fent by fea from London to agents 
here, who return the yarn to be manufactured into (lockings, 
epaulets, &amp;c. 

Coal and fait are the principal exports of the place, and 
the imports are grain, timber, tallow, hemp, flax, and flax- 
feed,

feed, with other Baltic and Dutch goods. The exportation 
of coal to Holland, had become very early a confiderable 
branch of trade here; and Borrowftownnefs, for the firft 50 
or 60 years of this century, was a great mart for Dutch goods 
of all kinds, particularly flax, flax-feed, and old iron. But 
as the manufactures of this country advanced, fo as to in- 
creafe the demand for Dutch flax, the traders and manufac- 
turers in other places, found their way to a direct importa- 
tion into their own ports, and though there are ft ill two con- 
fiderable manufactories for drefling flax here, and large quan- 
tities imported, both for drefling and felling rough, yet this 
branch has greatly decreafed in comparifon with what it once 
was; and the Baltic trade now chiefly confifts in the articles 
formerly mentioned. 

The commerce of this town with the Baltic, as well as that 
of Leith, Grangemouth, and fome other places on the eaft 
coaft, was greatly enlarged during the war with America. 
That country had been in ufe to fupply Britain before the 
war, with large quantities of timber, iron, tar, pearl and 
pot-afhes. The American trade being fufpended by the 
war, not only all thefe articles were imported from the 
Baltic to this eaft coaft, and by the merchants on this fide of 
the ifland ; but thofe of the weft, to fave the rifle of capture 
in a circuitous voyage round the highlands, made their im- 
portation of thofe goods into the Frith of" Forth, to be carried 
from Bo-nefs and Grangemouth, through the great canal, to 
Glafgow. Great quantities of tallow and hemp, were alfo 
brought over during this period. The trade then enjoyed by 
this and other ports in the neighbourhood, was happily im- 
proved, to furnifh the means of an extended commerce for 
feveral years after the peace was concluded, A. D. 1783. 

It is only fince 1793, the commencement of the prefent 
French war, that the trade of this town has decreafed, in 

3 I 2 common 



43^ Etati/iical Account 

common with the commerce of other ports trading to the Bal- 
tic ; and there is every reafon to hope for a revival, when the 
bleffing of peace fhall be reflored ; an event earneftly to be de- 
fired by all the friends of human kind. 

The corn- trade, both Britifh and foreign, is very confide- 
rable here. In 3 large granaries, and in fome fmaller ones, 
there is very good accommodation for above 15,000 bolls. 

Grangemouth, South Queensferry, and North Queensfer- 
ry, St David's, Inverkeithing, Lime kilns, Torry, and Cul- 
rofs, are united to the Cuftom-houfe of Borrowftownnefs ; 
but the annual revenue received, excluding thefe creeks, will, 
on an average, amount to about L. 4000. The fait- duty 
amounts to about L. 3000 per annum. The bufinefs of the 
Cuftom-houfe employs about 44 officers. 

Coal and Salt. — Coal is faid to have been wrought in this 
parilh above 500 years ago, and has been continued more or 
lefs fince that period. The depth of the pits now in ufe 
is about 42 fathoms. The feam of coal, is from 10 to 
12 feet in thicknefs, and is nearly exhaufted. There are va- 
rious feams, fome of them of afuperior, and others of a very 
inferior quality. All of them have been wrought in different 
places, and at different times, to a great extent, particularly 
in and about Bo-nefs. Oa the fouth eaft, and on the weft, 
there is ftill a vaft extent of unwrought coal. It is propofed, 
to fink a pit foon on the weft of the town. The depth, to 
the principal feam in this quarter, may be about 70 fathoms ; 
but there are feveral other feams at a much lefs depth. Vari- 
ous methods have been adopted, with regard to the manner 
of working the coal; but in general, what is called ftoop and 
throw, has been found the moft eligible. The average quan- 
tity of coal raifed in 12 months, for fome time paft, may be 
about 44,000 tons, A confiderable part ox the great coal has 
1 been

been exported, at 7 s 9 * per ton. The remainder has - been 
difpofed of in the coafting trade, and in the adjacent country. 
A great many of the chew-coals, are carried by the contra* 
(hipping to the London market, at 6s per ton. The greateft 
part of the fmall coal is confumed by the falt-works, which 
confift of 1 6 pans, and employ about 30 falters and labourers. 
The annual quantity of fait made, may be about 37,000 
bufhels, which is partly difpofed of in the coafting trade ; 
but chiefly, for the iupply of the country to the Couth and 
weft of Borrowftownnefs. It is fold at 3 s 6d per bufticl, 
including duty. But upon the duty, there is a draw-back of 
^ per cent, allowed by the Cuftom-houfe to the purchafer. 
It is believed, that the falt-works were neded here a confide- 
table time before coal-pits were opened j and that in place of 
coal, wood was applied as fuel. Hence, fmall coal retains 
the name of pan-wood.— The number of colliers, coal-bear- 
ers, labourers, carters, &amp;e. employed about the coalliery, 
may be nearly 250. 

Eccleftqjlical State, The prefent church of Borrow- 

ftownnefs, is a" good plain edifice. When the parifhes were 
firft united* in the year 1669, the Duke of Hamilton added 
a large aifle for himfelf and his tenants. In this form, the 
church continued till about 20 years ago, when, purfuant to 
an agreement between the town and the Duke's Commif- 
fioners, the aifle was taken down, and the church nearly re- 
built. The two front- corners were extended as far as the 
aifle had gone ; and the area within the walls, is now an ob- 
long figure of 60. feet, by 48. The walls and ceiling are 

handfomely 



* It was formerly mentioned, that Bo-nefs is an united parifh. A little

Kinniel, are ftill to be fecn.

heavy and ill-conftruded. When Bo-nefs was firft detached 
from ICinmel, the annual intereft of the ftock, provided by 
the- inhabitants for the minifter's ftipend, did not amount to 
. 800 merks Scots. An Ad of Parliament was then obtained 
by petition, appointing the inhabitants to be affeiTed, to make 
up the fum ; and reprefentatives were to be chofen annually 
by common confent of the town and Kirk-Seffion, to fix and 
levy the tax. During the firft century after the feparation 
from Kinniel, the annual affeffment authorifed by Parliament 
for making up the 800 merks of town-ftipend, was often le- 
vied 5 but for thefe 40 or 5 o years paft, there has been little 
or no occafion for any fuch contribution. The original mor- 
tified ftock had been early inverted in land, 2 miles fouch of 
the town ; and it is well known, how much the value of this 
kind of property has rifen throughout the ifland within thefe 
50 years. The land which, during the former leafe, yielded 
only about L. 20 per annum, now lets for L.50; and the tenant 
having inclofed the whole, as he was bound to do by the terms 
of hisleafe,itis probable, that the rent will be more than doubled 
at the expiration of the prefent leafe *. To the 800 merks 
Scots given by the town, the Aft of Parliament obtained by 
the Duke and Duchefs of Hamilton, December 1669, appoint- 
ed the old ftipend of Kinniel to be added, and the whole, to be 
the conftant ftipend of the minifter, ferving the cure of the 
united parifhes,— ordering alfo, that a manfe and glebe mould 
be provided by the Duke and Duchefs, in place of the old

. The P enfioner s who receive regular fupply at prefent, are 
in number 36. Occafional fupplies, upon proper recommen- 
dation, are often appointed to fuch perfons as are reduced to 
temporary diftrefs. Upon any preffing emergency, the libe- 
rality of the opulent part of the inhabitants, is exemplary. 
During the late fevere winter, near L. 60 fterling were col- 
leded, and diftributed in the mod judicious manner, by a 
committee of gentlemen in the town. Begging is (till com- 
mon; but the paupers who go about from houfe to houfe, 
are, for the molt part, from other parifhes. 

Roads and Milns — Befides feveral crofs-roads, two public 
roads run through the parifh ; one from Borrowftownnefs, 
leading fouth to Linlithgow, and the Cleugh iron-works, in 
pretty good order, upon which there are feveral toll-bars ; 
another running eaft and weft, (by the water fide,) frequent- 
ed by travellers from Falkirk and Queensferry. On the river 
Avon, which fkirts the parifh on the fouth and weft, there 
are 5 milns, the property of the Duke of Hamilton. To the 
2 corn-milns, all the barony of Kinniel are thirled with their 
oats, and pay as dues the 17th part or peck. Farmers from 
other parifhes, pay only the half of this multure. There are 
1 flour-milns, which grind flour for Falkirk, Borrowftown- 
nefs, &amp;c. The fifth miln was built for the purpofe of grind- 
ing malt, for the brewers in Borrowftownnefs; but is em- 
ployed at prefent, in grinding flint for the pottery formerly 
mentioned. The river Avon is a fine ftream, well fitted for 
the purpofes of machinery. Falls of confiderable height may 
found ; and there is plenty of water, unlefs when the drpught 
of fummer is uncommonly fevere. The water is alfo per-

the hills, after heavy rains. 

Minerals and Antiquities. -BeGdes coal already mention- 
cd, iron (tone is dug from a bank in the neighbourhood 
of Borrowftownnefs, and is faid to abound in other parts 
of the parHh Quarries of excellent granite and free- 
ftone, are alfo wrought on the fouth and weft of the 
town. Lime-none is co be found on the weft end ot the 
parifh. A draw kiln was erefted about 20 years ago, and 
the work carried on to a confiderabl; extent •, but the quanti- 
ty and quality of the lime not anfwenng expeaation, it has 
been difcontinued. 

The Roman wall between Forth and Clyde, well known 
in the Hiftory of Scotland, runs through the high grounds, 
the whole length of the parifh. It is ftill diftinaiy vifible on 
the eaft bank of the Avon. At Inver-avon the ruins of a. 
Roman tower ftill remain. It has been built of common 
free ftone, and ftands in a very confpicuous place. It appears 
from the foundation, that the building muft have been pretty 
extenfive ; and were the rubbifh cleared away, perhaps far- 
ther information on the fubjea might be obtained for the 
antiquarian. In a window of the adjacent farm-houfe, there 
is a ftone with feveral hieroglyphic charaaers, which, al- 
though much venerated for their antiquity, are not under- 
ftood.

Bo-nefs, the afcent is gradual to the fouth, for more than a 
mile and a half ; ami the profpea ftill varying and extending, 
is infxprtffibly grand and beautiful. On the eaft, the horizon 
is boundlefs, the prol'pe&amp; reaching the Pentlaud-hills, Ar-

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiorts.-Vfhen the navigation by the 
canal between Forth and Clyde was firft projeded, it was 
the general opinion, that from the advantageous Htuation of 
tins town and its harbour, the eaft termination fhould have 
been here, and not at Grange-burn. It would ferve no good 
purpofc at prefent, to point out the caufes which combined 
to place the termination orherwifc. Suffice it to fay, the public 
would, in all probability, have been much better accommo- 
dated, and Bo-nefs would have increafed ten fold. To prevent 
this town from fuffering the difadvantages apprehended from 
the termmation of the canal at Grange-burn, a fubfeription 
was opened in the year 1782, on an eftimate for a canal of 
communication from the harbour of Borrowftownnefs to 
Grangemouth, fuppofed to coa about L. 12,000, and fub- 
fcriptions for L. 10,000 were procured. The canal was cut 
from Avon-water eaftward, within a mile of the town, and 
an aqueduft bridge of (tone built for croffing the Avon. 
The expence, however, of this work, and that of procuring 
two Acts of Parliament, together with falaries and heavy 
incidental charges, had, in 1789, exhaulted half the fubferip- 
tion. Doubts were then entertained, whether the navigation 
could be properly executed for the eftimate, as the works

»ext the town were forefeen to be very expenfive. It was 
judged prudent to have a new furvey by that eminent en- 
gineer, Mr Robert Whitworth •, who reported, " That to t 
" complete the canal' properly, L. 17,000 would be wanted." 
By this time, not L. 4000 good money remained, and the 
work was relinquished, till new funds mould be raifed ; 
which unfortunately have never yet been procured, and when 
they fhall be obtained, is at prefent uncertain.' The return of 
peace, with a reviving commerce, may perhaps encourage 
former fubfcribers, or animate new ones, to finifh a work of 
public utility ; and which would be of fo much local advan- 
tage to this town and the adjacent country. 

It is highly probable, that all the low ground in the parifh, 
was formerly part of the bed of the river Forth. This opi- 
nion eafily gains affent, becaufe immediately at the bottom 
of the bank, far from the fhore, and far above the level of 
the prefent fpring-tides, fhells, particularly oyfter-fhells, are 
to be feen in feveral places, and in great quantities. At low- 
water, above 2coo acres oppofite to the parifh are left dry. 
It is laid, that a Dutch company offered, for a leafe of 99 
years, to fence off the fea from thefe acres with a dyke, to 
prepare them for the purpofes of agriculture, which would 
have been a vaft acceffion to the carfe grounds of the parifh. 
But the project failed, and a large extent of ground remains 
ufelefs, (hewing its face twice every 24 hours, to reproach 
the faftidioufnefs and indolence of mankind. 

It appears, as far as the writer of this account has had an 
opportunity to learn, that the natives of the town and parifh 
of Bo-nefs, are fond of a fea-faring life. Many able-bodied 
feamen from this place, are at prefent in his Majefty's fervice ; 
and are diftinguifhed for their fobriety, courage, and loyalty. 
Adventurers from the place, are alfo to be found in the moft 
diftant parts of the globe.— The inhabitants of the town are

<p>

Origin of the Names of Fojfatuay and Tulliebole. 

THE Scots were anciently a nation of warriors; and 
when not engaged againft the common enemy, the 
chieftains often turned their arms againft one another. When 
at peace, their time was employed in hunting, and they na- 
turally diftinguilhed their hunting grounds, by the various 
forts of game with which they abounded. Hence the name 
of Fofiaway, or in the original Gaelic, Fafach Fheidh, pro- 
nounced Fafach-hay, is literally " the defart of deer," to diftin- 
guifh it from the range of mountains to the weftward, called 
in the original, Mueard, or " the height where the bears refort- 
" ed." In the Duke of Atholl's charter, it is written Foffbwhey, 
which is very near the original orthography. The defart of 
deer, correfponds with the defcription of Oflian. He makes 
Fingal fay to Swaran, " The defart is enough for me with all 
" its deer and woods."' 

Tulliebole literally fignifies the Poet's hill : For it is well 
underftood, that every chief had his own bard. By him the 

poems

poems concerning the anceflors of the family, were handed 
down to polity, and Were repeafed fQ £

cmef, mthe fame manner that Tullibardine, or the hill of 
the bards, was the feat of the chieftain of the Murrays 

Formerly FofTaway and Tulliebole were two feparate parifh- 
es, and each had its own paftor and church. The annexation, 
it is fa,d, took place fometime about the year ,614. In the 
Advocates Library, there is an ancient manufcript, which is 
entitled « Regifter of Affignations for the MinifW Stipends, 
for the year 1574 » i„ this manufcript) the ftipends of 
the readers of the two parifhes, are fepara.ely ftated thus.

Foflaway lies in the county of Perth, Tulliebole in Kinrofs- 
fhire, and both are within the bounds of the prefbytery of 
Auchterarder, and the Synod of Perth and Stirling. In 
Keith's Catalogue of the Scots Bifhops, there is an Alphabe- 
tical Table of all the Parifhes in Scotland, with the names of 
the Shire, Diocefe, Prefbytery, and Commiflariot, in which 

each of them is fituated; in which Foflaway is thus ftated, 
1688.

This is evidence, that both parifhes were at an early period 
in the Diocefe of Dumblane. After the annexation down 
to the year 1729, the two places of worfhip, the one at Fofla- 
way,

way, and the other at Tulliebole, were {till retained, and the 
minifter who ferved the cure, preached two fabbaths at Fofia- 
way, and the third at Tulliebole, regularly, and his houfe was 
at Foflaway. In that year, both the old churches were 
thrown down, the manfe and glebe at Foflaway were fold ; 
the prefent glebe and church-yard, which are fituated in the 
parilh of Tulliebole, were purchafed ; and a new church and 
manfe were built, in a fituation more centrical to both pa- 
rilhes, and more convenient for the incumbent. 

Minifters Names on Record. — The fir ft found on the SeflSon 
Regifter (1609), is Mr Laurence Mercer. It appears that 
he was alive in the year 1634. From that period, there is 
a deficiency in the regifter. The next mentioned is Mr Alex- 
ander Ireland, in the year 166 l. He was alive, in 1687. 
Then the regifter is again deficient. It cannot therefore be 
afcertained, in what years thefe clergymen were ordained, or 
when they died. It is evident, however, that they were 
both of the Epifcopal church, belonged to the Diocefe of 
Dumblane, were ftri£t obfervers of church difcipline, and 
were exceedingly attentive to every part of their Parochial 
duty. Seflional bufinefs is recorded at confiderable length ; 
public worftiip is mentioned as regularly performed, and the 
collections for the poor, which were made every fabbath-day, 
are diftinaiy marked. During their incumbencies, the pa- 
rifh was feldom without divine fervice on the Lord's day ; 
almoft never without having a reafon afligned in the record 
fuch as, that the minifter was aflifting his brethren, or was 
unable to officiate. With regard to Mr Ireland, befides fuch 
reafons as thefe, there are other four mentioned fomewhat 
Singular. It is faid in the regifter, 

" No fermon ; becaufe the minifter was at the confecratioa 
w in Edinburgh." 



)um= 



448 Statiflical Account 

" No fermon; becaufe the minifter was called to Di 
" blan e to wait upon the bifhop." 

" No fermon; becaufe the minifter was under the neceffity 
of attending Lord Rollo's burial at Dunning." 
" No fermon ; becaufe the minifter was in the Stormont 
feeing his aged father, who was labouring under great 
" diftrefs." 

Thefe avocations happened at different times, betwixt the 
year 1661, and the year 1687. There is a deficiency in the 
regifter, from 1687, to 1691; but from that period, down 
to the prefenc day, the records are compleat, containing 
every parochial tranfaftion, relative to church affairs. Five 
clergymen are mentioned as fucceeding one another, whofe 
names follow. 

Mr William Spence, admitted 21ft September 1691 ; died 
23d March 1715. Mr Alexander Barton, ordained 23d Apiil 
1712; died 14th June 1716. Mr Barton, was ordained af- 
fiftant and fucceffor to Mr Spence, 3 years before his death, 
and did not furvive him 15 months. Mr Andrew Ure, ad- 
mitted 25th of April 1 71 7 ; died 7th April 1742. To him 
fucceedcd Mr John Storer, ordained 25th Auguft 1743 j 
died 8th June 1778. All thofe minifters are remembered 
by fome of the parifhioners, who are ftill alive ; and their 
memory is ftill held in great refpecl. 

Patron. — In the fettlements of all the incumbents which 
have been mentioned, no patron appeared. They were elec- 
ted by the heritors, elders, and heads of families. At the 
laft vacancy, it was doubtful to whom the right of patronage 
belonged. It was claimed by the crown, and by George 
Graham, Efq of Kinrofs. "There were of confequence two 
prefeutees. The right of patronage was afterwards deter- 
mined by the Court of Seffion ; and was found to be veftcd 

in 



efFoJaway and TuUiebole. 449 

in Mr Graham, by a fpecial grant from the crown. The 
prefent incumbent was ordained on Mr Graham's prefenta- 
tion, 1 1 th of May 1780. 

Church,, Manfe, Glebe and Stipend.— .The church and manfe, 
as formerly mentioned, were built in their prefent fituation, 
in 1729. The church is neither commodious, nor in good 
repair, although it has received frequent reparations fince it 
was built. The manfe and office-houfes were rebuilt in the 
year 1781, and are neat and convenient enough ; but not fo 
fufficiently executed, as might have been expe&amp;ed from the 
fum of money expended on them. Heritors, when they are 
building churches or manfes, ought to endeavour to have them, 
at lead, fubftantially finifhed. This would in the end, fave them 
a good deal of expence. One would imagine, that a manfe, 
which cofts L. 300, might be fo built, as to (land at leaft a 
century. This, however, was not the cafe with the former 
one at EolTaway, which was thrown down in its 51ft year, by 
confent of the heritors, who were wearied out in repairing it. 
Owing to the peculiar fituation of this country, the greater 
part of the houfes ftand nearly eaft and weft ; and as the molt 
violent weather, and greateft hurricanes come from the weft, 
it is found to be a very hard talk to make the weft gabel proof 
againft the rain. Particular attention fhould be given to this 
circumftance, in every houfe built in this part of the country. 

The glebe now occupied by the incumbent, is about 10 
Scotch acres. It was formerly a muir, and is a very poor 
foil. In the year 17219, it was purchafed for L. 29 : 8s fter. 
Its foil is a mixture of mofs and gravel, few inches deep in 
many places ; and lies partly on a bed of mofs, but moftly on 
a bed of very fine fand. 

The ftipend of the parifli confided of 40 bolls ; two thirds 
meal, and one third bear ; and L. 56 : 1 3 : 4 d ft er . in money.

On a procefs, at the inftance of the prefent minifter, the 
Court has lately granted an augmentation, confifting of 43 
bolls, 3 pecks, 1 lippie, 2 tliirds in meal, and 1 third in 
bear, making the prefent ftipend to confift of 83 bolls, 3 
pecks, and 1 lippie, 2 thirds in meal, and 1 third in barley, 
and L. 56 : 1 3 : 4d in money* 

Situation and Extent.— Toftaway confifts of two branches, 
entirely feparated from each other by Tulliebole, which in- 
tervenes, having one of thofe branches on the northern, and 
the other on the fouthern fide of it. As the church of Foffa- 
way flood on the northern branch, thofe families, who dwelt 
on the fouthern, were under the neceffity of palling either 
through Tulliebole, or the parifh of Muckart, before they 
could come to the place of worfhip. This circumftance 
feems firft to have led to the junction of the two parifhes, 
and then to the removal of the church and manfe, from their 
former fituation, to the place where they now ftand, which 
is much more convenient and centrical. The northern 
branch of Foflaway, extends along the Ochil hills, from eaft 
to weft, and is about 6 miles in length, and 3 in breadth. 
Tulliebole lies on the lower ground, extending from the bot- 
tom of the Ochil hills on the north, towards the Cliefh hills 
on the fouth ; and from the Crook of Dovan on the weft, to 
about half way to Kinrofs on the eaft. Its fouthern fide jut9 
out both to the eaft and weft, nearly an Englifh mile farther 
than its northern fide. Cutting off thefe two corners, the 
remaining fpace will be about 3 miles fquare. To the fouth- 
ern fide of the parifh of Tulliebole, is joined the fouthern 
branch of Foffaway, running in a fouth-weft direction, for 
nearly 8 miles in length, and at an average, 2 and a half in 
breadth. The two parifhes taken together, do not form a 
regular figure; but they are bounded in the following man- 
ner ; 



&amp;f Foffaway and Tuttiebole. 451 

ner ; on the eaft, by the parifhes of Orwell and Kinrofs j 
on the fouth, by Cliefh and Saline ; on the weft, by Clack- 
mannan, Dollar, Muckart, and Glen-dovan; and on the 
north, by the parifh of Dunning. 

A map of the parifh of Foffaway, as forming a part of the 
county of Perth, has been drawn by Mr Stobie, factor to the 
Duke of Atholl; and a map of Tulliebole, in conjunction 
with the county of Kinrofs, by Mr John Bell, land-furveyor 
at Edinburgh. Both thefe maps are executed with accuracy, 
in as far as they regard the two parifhes ; but it is not known to 
the writer of this account, if they have afcertained the num- 
ber of acres contained in them. Though both the maps are 
executed with precifion, they differ from the defcription 
which is given here. The reafon is this, above a century ago, 
the barony of Carnboe, in the northern part of the parifli of 
Foffaway, was, by an Act of Parliament, disjoined from the 
county of Perth, and annexed to the county of Kinrofs. It 
is ftill confidered, as belonging to the parifh of Foffaway ; 
but is of courfe, omitted in the map of the county of Perth, 
and comprehended in Mr Bell's map of Kinrofs-fhire. 

By the Act of Parliament lately paffed for raifing men for 
his Majefty's Navy out of every county, the whole of the 
parifh of Foffaway is joined with the county of Kinrofs. 
This naturally leads to the following obfervation ; that it 
would be more convenient for Foffaway, if it were for ever 
annexed to Kinrofs. The diftance from Kinrofs, is only 6 
miles of fine road; the diftance from Perth, is 21 miles 
over J$e Ochil hills. To be obliged to go to Perth for all the 
bufineis which mull be tranfaded there, is attended with a 
very confiderable degree both of trouble and expence. There 
is not a rending Juftice of the Peace in the whole parifh of 
Foffaway. If it were united to Kinrofs- (hire, it; would be 

3 k 2 equally

45 2 Statijlical Account 

equally in the vicinity of the county courts, and of the Juf- 
tices of the Peace. 

Climate, Surface, Soil and Air.— The lands in both pariflies 
are in a high fit nation ; the froft begins fooner, the fnow falls 
earlier, and both continue a longer time than in moft of the 
neighbouring pariflies. Except on the banks of the river 
Dovan, or at the bottom of the hills, where the effeft of 
the fun is confiderable, the northern branch of Foffaway is 
the coldeft diftricl;. It is one continued range of hills. The 
hills are of various heights, from 600, perhaps to 1100 feet 
perpendicular above the level of the fea ; yet they afford ex- 
cellent pafture, both for fheep and black-cattle. Some of 
the hills have mofs and heath ; but the greateft part of them 
is covered with grafs, to the very fummit. Tulliebole, and 
the fouthern branch of Foffaway, lying lower, are warmer. 
On thefe parts, there are fome mofs, fome marfhy ground, 
and fome little hills ; but by far the greateft part is arable 
land. The foil is various ; fome gravelly \ fome clay ; fome 
tilly ; fome loam ; and all thefe foils are capable of confide- 
rable improvement. Tulliebole, although in appearance it 
refembles a plain country, when compared with the hills on 
the north and fouth ; yet contains the higheft grounds of 
any parifli in the plain, between Stirling and Kinrofs» Here 
the fprings of water divide themfelves, fome running weft 
towards Stirling, others eaft towards Kinrofs. In a dry 
fummer, there are more frequently flying fhowers here, than 
any where around. Thefe fhowers are fometimes feen coming 
from the fouth- weft, along the Ochil-hills, and the Cleifli 
hills at the fame time; and when they come oppofite to 
Tulliebole, a part of them has been obferved to feparate on 
both fides, from the main body of the clouds, and meet on 
a rifing ground, adjoining to the Crook of Dovan. From 



@f Fojaway and Tulliehole. 453 

the attraftion of the hills on either fide, there is more cloudy 
and rainy weather, and later feafons here, than in many other 
diftrias; yet the fituation is abundantly healthful; the high 
winds carry off the vapours ; and the ftreams of water having 
great declivities on every hand, little ftagnating water remains; 
and when the Iky is clear, the air is uncommonly pure and 
dry. 

Difeafes.— There are no peculiar difeafes which prevail in 
the parifh. An ague, or a bloody-flux, are feldom heard of; 
fevers are perhaps more /common than any other difeafe. A 
fever, which at its firft appearance, feemed to be of the ner- 
vous kind, but which in the end became putrid, carried off 
many about 2 years ago. Few families efcaped ; and it ex- 
tended to many of the parifhes around. The medicine which 
proved molt fuccefsful, was the jefuits bark given with port- 
wine. This remedy when applied in time, under the direc- 
tion of a profeffional man, was commonly fuccefsful. We 
fometimes hear of a confumption ; of a cancer ; and of a 
dropfy. A few years ago, a woman died, who had been 
tapped for a dropfy 16 times, and after all recovered. The 
quantity of water taken from her at thefe different times, 
was calculated to be 84 Scotch pints. She died, when far 
advanced in life, not of a dropfy, but of complaints arifing 
from old age. Rheumatic complaints are not uncommon. 
Children frequently die of the fmall pox. Again ft inocula- 
tion, there is amongft the lower clafies of the people, an 
almoft univerfal prejudice, of a religious nature, which nei- 
ther example, nor precept, nor the reafonable terms upon 
which inoculation can be obtained, have yet overcome. 

Though the two patifhes taken together, form a large and 
populous diftridt, there is not a phyfician, nor a furgeon, 
nor a midwife in either. Women in child-bed have, how- 
ever, 



454 Statijtical Account 

ever, good affiftance at no great diltance ; and they are, in 
general, very fortunate. Good medical aid is alfo to be had 
from all the neighbouring towns. It is alfo reafonable to 
acknowledge with gratitude, that the united parifhes lie 
under peculiar obligations to the Royal Infirmary of Edin- 
burgh. Several perfons, of late, labouring under various 
complaints, have been received into the Infirmary, recom- 
mended to the phyficians by heritors, or by the minifter, all

fpin, and fees more diftinftly, than when at the age of 70. 
The number of married perfons is 45*, *nd the number of 
children from each marriage, between 5 and 6. The num- 
ber of families is 340, and the number of perfons in each fa- 
mily, between 4 and 5. The number of inhabitants has 
been decreafing for feveral years. In the year 1755, by the 
return made to Dr Webfter, the number was 1765. In the 
year 1771, it was 1828; in the year 1780, 1716; in the 
year 1785, 1610; and it has been dated as at prefent only 
1505. Many reafons can be given for this diminution of 
numbers. A few years ago, feveral weavers, mafons, and 
houfe-carpenters, with their families, went into towns, where 
they found more ready employment, and higher wages. Se- 
veral gentlemen having inclofed their lands, they have let 
them in grafs, and have no fixed tenants; others, having 
taken the pofleffion of them into their own hands, and going 
on with their improvements, have difmiffed feveral of their 1 
cottagers; the new mode of ploughing without a driver, 
which now very much prevails, has leffened the number of 
farm- fervants ; and the union of different farms has alfo had 
its influence. When agriculture is carried on by employing 
cottagers, they not only remain longer than other fervants 
on the fame farms, but by having families, and a fettled re- 
fidence, they add greatly to the number of the inhabitants. 
Hired fervants frequently change their fituations every half* 
year, and having nothing to attach them to one fpot, feldom 
continue long with any one mafter. To give encouragement 
to cottagers, and villages, on proper regulations, would be 
of fervice both to proprietors, and to the community at large. 

Stature, and general Char after of the Inhabitants. — -The fta- 
ture of the inhabitants is not above the middle fize. The 
height of the talleft man in the pariih, is about 6 feet 4 in- 
ches. 



456 Statijlical Account 

ches. It hath been obferved, that thofe of the middle fize, 
are in general more robuft, have fewer complaints, and live 
longer, than thofe who are above the ordinary ftature. Al- 
though few of the original inhabitants of the parifh have been 
much diftinguifhed by their talents, they are not deftitute of 
natural abilities. Their natural difpofitions are friendly, 
generous, and humane. They are contented with their fi- 
xations, and are not difpofed to leave the place of their nati- 
vity. Their religious principles are various, as appears from 
what is already ftated. Few, except the gentlemen, con- 
verfed much about political affairs, till the works of Thomas 
Paine appeared. Since that time, the people converfe more 
frequently on thofe topics. It is, however, but doing them 
juftice to fay, that they are firmly attached to the Conftitu- 
tion of this country, as eftablifhed at the Acceffion of King 
William, and to the perfon and government of his prefent 
Majefty. They are in general adive, and induflrious. 
Befides the bufinefs of agriculture, they apply to the common 
trades pradifed in the country. There are taylors, fhoemak- 
ers, blackfmiths, mafons, carpenters, and weavers; all of 
them well employed, and able to provide for their families. 
The day- wages of a taylor, is 8d, and od, befides his vic- 
tuals ; of a mafon and carpenter, from is 6d, to as. Wea- 
vers are employed partly in the manufacture of the cloth 
ufed in the parifh ; and partly by the manufacturers of the 
neighbouring towns. There is only one baker in the parifh. 
The inhabitants for whom his labour is not fuflicient, receive 
a fupply from the towns in the vicinity. 

Parochial Improvements. — I. Houfes. Within the laft 12 
years, 24 new houfes have been built; though from the re- 
moval of tcmmts and cottagers, a greater number have 
either fallen into ruins within that period, or have been 

demoliflied. 



of Fojfaivay and Tulliebole. 45? 

demolifhed. The greater part of the houfes lately built, 
are intended for the accommodation of the proprietors of: 
land; and are built with ftone and lime, in a very convenient 
and fubftantial manner, ftiited to the property and revenues 
of their owners. There are two ancient houfes in the pa- 
rifhes, commonly diftinguifhed by the name of caftles, or 
towers; that of Tulliebole, and that of Aldie. They are 
both places of ftrength, or fortalices, with gun-holes and 
turrets, fuitable to the times in which they were built. The 
cattle of Tulliebole was built in the year 1608 ; the caftle 
of Aldie, in the century preceding. The one is the family 
feat of Moncreiff-Wellwood of Tulliebole, the other of Mer- 
cer of Aldie. As the proprietors, however, do not refide 
in them, they are faft going into dif-repair ; yet it is hoped, 
and indeed it is pleafing to the country to think, that thofe 
monuments of antiquity may (till be kept up. At no great ex- 
pence, they may be made to ftand for centuries. In different 
parts of the parifhes, there are houfes built adjoining to each 
other, to the number of 10 or 12 ; poffefled partly by feuars 
and tenants, andpartly by cottagers yet thefe are not known 
by the name of villages. There are only two villages in the 
parifhes ; one at the Crook of Dovan, and the other at 
Blairingone. They are both burghs of barony. The former 
holds of the family of Tulliebole, the latter belongs to the 
family of Atholl ; both of them have the privilege of holding 
markets. At the Crook of Dovan, there are two markets an- 
nually, the one in May, the other in October. At Blairin- 
gone, there is one held in the month of June. Little bufinefs 
is tranfa&amp;ed at the Blairingone markets ; but the Crook mar- 
kets, which are for black-cattle, being pretty well attended, 
may with attention and care, be brought to cOnfiderable per- 
fection, and prove very ferviceable to the country at large. 
The only public houfes in the parifhes, are in thofe villages j 
Vol. XVIII. 3 M two 



45 8 Statiftical Account 

two at the Crook of Dovan, and two at Blairlngone. They 
may perhaps be all necefTary, a5 , independant of the markets, 
both villages are on the high road, and Bhuringone adjoining 
the Duke of Atholl's coal-work ; but it is univerfally found, 
that too many houfes, where ardent fpirits are fold, do hurt 
both to the morals and circumftances of the people. 

2. Inclofures. Since the year 1782, above 2coo acres of 
land have been inclofed. The fences are partly made with 
Hone, partly with ditch and hedge. The inclofures are of 
various dimenfions, fuch as beft fuited the fituation, defign, 
and extent of the farms ; they are of all fizes, from 5 to 40 
acres. Where they are intended only for pafture, they ex- 
tend to nearly an 100 acres. A ftone dyke is the moft im- 
mediate, and moft fecure fence. A hedge in this climate, is 
flow in growing, but when reared, ferves both to beautify 
and fhelter the grounds ; and this country, lying high, being 
much expofed, and having hitherto little advantage from 
trees, ftands much in need of fhelter. Proprietors, how- 
ever, are providing on their lands, a remedy for thefe incon- 
veniences, by planting. 

3. Planting. Planting till of late was not much attended 
to; there is indeed fome natural wood, and fome fmall plan- 
tations, in various parts of the parifhes, which have been ad- 
vancing for a confiderable time. They are fufficient to (hew, 
that trees will fiourifh in the foil. This is indeed demonftrat- 
ed by the trees, which according to an old cuftom, obferved 
in moft parts of Scotland, have been planted around the 
barn-yards. Thefe, which confift chiefly of afh, plane, and 
Scotch fir, have grown, even in the higheft grounds, to a 
very confiderable fize, confidering the time when they were 
planted. Planting is, however, now become fafhionable, 
and is proceeding with rapidity. Within the laft 8 years, 
about 8oo,oou trees have been planted. Some of them on 

the 



ofFqfaway and TulHebole. 459 

the lands of TulHebole ; fome of them on the northern, but 
the greateft number on the fouthern branch of Foflaway. 
They are partly in larger plantations, partly in fmaller 
ftripes ; and where they are Efficiently fenced, are, in 
general, in a thriving ftate. The trees are of various Kinds ; 
Scotch fir, plane, larch, oak, elm, beech, afh, fpruce 
fir, and laburnum. The Scotch fir are in the greateft num- 
ber ; and the larch grows quickeft. The laft will foon add 
greatly to the beauty of the country, and afford excellent 
fhelter.

Cultivation and Produce of the Parijhes.—Somt of the origi- 
nal inhabitants ftill retain the old method of ploughing, 
uGng the old Scotch plough, and joining oxen with horfes. 
Thofe who are attached to the old modes of farming, are fo 
far from troubling themfelves with improvements, that they 
are not fond of changes of any kind. 'If a large ftone lies in, 
the field, or, if the furrows are drawn crooked, they are un- 
willing to remove the one, or alter the other ; obferving that 
they were fo in their fathers days, and that the crops were as 
good then as they are now. The greateft part of the farmers 
have happily different views. The new method of ploughing 
with two horfes, and Small's plough, is very generally a- 
dopted. In the improvement of their lands, a confiderable 
number of the farmers fpare neither pains nor expence. 
They bring ploughmen from every quarter, and have brought 
the art of ploughing to a very high degree of perfection. 
The number of ploughs cannot be afcertained ; becauie on 
the fame quantity of land, the number varies according to 
the culture in ufe. The ploughs in the parifh of FolTaway, 
according to the ftatute work, are upwards of 50; thofe of 
the parifh of Tulliebole, about 24 ; more ploughs, however, 
are occafionally ufed. Befides, feveral of the proprietors 

3M2 and 



4^ Statijlical Account 

and farmers, keep young horfes for the harrow. Becaufe the 
froft continues long in the fpring, they fow, in general, later 
than the people on the coaft, and confequently reap later. 
Wheat has been tried in Tulliebole, and in the fouthern part 
Of Foflawajr; but the climate and foil are perhaps againft it. 
The fureft crops are oats, barley, and peafe. The greateft part 
of Tulliebole, and the low lying parts of the northern branch of 
ForT.way, are of a (harp gravelly foil, and feldom fail in pro- 
ducing good crops. The fouthern branch of FofTaway, being 
a mixture of loam and clay, will alfo bring forward beans, 
and in good feafons wheat. Thefe are not, however, fo fure a 
crop as oats, barley, and peafe. Both parifhes taken together, 
not only ferve themfelves with grain, but fend a confiderable 
quantity to market. Lint is every where fown for family ufe, 
and when properly managed makes a good return. All 
green crops, if the feafon is not very unfavourable, fucceed 
well. Potatoes, turnips, clover, and rye-grafs, when the 
ground is properly prepared, feldom fail. On the eftate of 
Foflaway, from which the parilh derives its name, which 
lies high, being lituated partly on the Ochil hills, very con- 
fiderable improvements are at prefent carrying on, by the 
proprietor, who poflefles part of the lands himfelf. Laft fea- 
fon, there was raifed a rich crop of turnips, to a large ex- 
tent ; and nearly 300 bolls of potatoes, which were exceed- 
ingly fine. This feafon (1795), not only grafs, but almoft 
every other crop promifes well ; not only there, but in feve- 
ral other parts of both parilhes. 

Proprietors, Farmers, Farms and Rent. — Thofe who poflefs, 
lands, either as proprietors, or tenants, are above 120; be- 
fjdes a few tradefmen and cottagers, who poflefs as much 
ground as will maintain one or two cows. Thefe final] 
portions of land, are here called pendicles, as depending 

upon, 



of fojfaway and TuUiebole. 4&amp;1 

upon, either the proprietors land, or the larger tenants, from 
whom they are fet off, for Cervices or labour performed by the 
perfons who occupy them. None of the mod confidence 
heritors rtfide in the parifh ; but almoft the whole of the fmall 
proprietors and feuars do. The junction of farms does not hap- 
pen fo often as it otherwife might, becaufe the chief part of the 
fmaller heritors poffefs their own lands, which have neither m- 
creafed nor diminifhed for many years. There are farms of all 
dimenfions, from L. 10 to L. 100 per annum. There are none 
above L. 100, pofleffed by tenants, .except 3 ; arid one of 
thefe is rented at L. 300 per annum. Several heritors, how- 
ever, poffefs their own lands, which would let at above 
L. 100 a-year. The value of fheep farms, may be nearly 3s 
per acre; the arable, from 5 s to 10s; and the inclofed lands, 
from 15s to above L. 1. This is a great encouragement to 
improvement ; for which, nocwithfianding all that is done, 
there is ft ill great room. The valued rent of the 2 parifhes, 
is L. 4106 : 1 6s Scots. The real rent cannot be fo well as- 
certained; becaufe many of the heritors having pofleffed 
their own lands from time immemorial, they have not 
been let on leafe. The whole rent, however, may be fr.fely 
calculated above L. 4000 fterling per annum. That this is 
the cafe will be evident, when it is confidered, that there is, 
including both parifhes, nearly 30,000 Englifh acres of land. 
Allowing 6000 for mofs, water, woods, and rocks, there 
will ftill remain 24,000 acres ; which, if 'rented only at 3s 4d 
per acre, will amount to L. 4000. 

The fize or extent of farms, has never been fixed here ; 
and it would, indeed, be difficult to fix it ; as men, no 
doubt, would be divided in their opinions. It would, how- 
ever, be for the advantage both of the proprietors, and the 
country, that cultivated farms fhould neither be too large, 
nor too fmall, 

There 



Statiftical Account 

There is one circumftance, which deferves the attention 
both of proprietors and tenants. A fufficient diRindion is 
not always made betwixt the qualifications which fit a tenant 
for managing an arable, and thofe which are adapted toa fheep- 
farm. The fame talents do notrender him equally capable of 
managing both. Tenants are very careful, not to difcover their 
want of knowledge in either, when they are anxious to obtain 
a farm; and perfons often obtain fheep- farms, of which they 
have noknowledge, who would have managed a cultivated farm 
well; while others obtain a cultivated farm which they cannot 
manage, who delighted in, and fucceeded in rearing fheep. 
Indeed it feldom happens, that one who has been longaccuftom- 
ed to manage fheep, has ever much fuccefs in cultivating the 
ground ; efpecially, if he is advanced in life. But befides this, 
the mafter, when letting his lands, is always too ready to pre- 
fer the higheft offer. On the other hand, the opulent tenant 
generally offers leaft ; while he, who has little to lofe, offers 
more, obtains the farm, and in a few years, a fequeftration 
enfues. It would be more profitable to a proprietor, to re- 
ceive regularly L. 90 a- year, from an opulent and refpe£tablc 
tenant, efteemed, and ferviceable in the country, than to 
be promifed from another L. J 00, which he only receives in 
partial payments, and for which he is often obliged to ufe 
legal diligence. 

I 

Price of Labour, l&amp;c. — The wages of an able day-labourer 
throughout the year, is is per day ; the wages of a woman 
for the harveft, 8d ; for men, between iod and is per day; 
with breakfaft and dinner for both. Some farmers hire their 
reapers during the whole harveft, and pay to men, between 
25s and 30s; to women, between 2is and 2js. The wages, 
however, depend in a great meafure on the demand there is 
for reapers, and the number that is to be hired. The average 
q wages 



of Fojfaway and Tulliehole, 4^3 

wages of men-fervants, throughout the year, when they eat 
in the houfe, is L. 7 ; for women, not fully L. 3. Farmers 
have a ready fale for every article to be difpofed of, and 
there is a conftant demand ; The prices are, in general, 
regulated by the markets of Alloa and Kincardine on the 
coaft, and are commonly a little below the Haddington 
prices. In the parilhes, there are common rock, and free- 
ftone for building, mofs, lime, and coal. Peats may be got in 
almoft every corner of both parifhes, but are not ufed in great 
quantities ; becaufe coal is at a reafonable price, and near at 
hand. There are lime rocks in different places ; but they are 
only wrought at prefent upon the lands of Gartwhinzian. 
There are two rocks there, which are wrought by the pro- 
prietors. The one is on the plain, the other on the banks of 
the Dovan. The ftrata of the firft are regular, and the ftone 
folid. The lime when flacked, falls at firft into large par- 
ticles, and then gradually duTolves into a fmall powder of a 
cream colour. The ftrata of the other, are confufed and un- 
equal ; but when flacked, fall immediately into a fine white 
powder. That upon the banks of the Dovan, is efteemed 
the whiteft ; but the other is equally ftrong. The lime of both 
rocks, is at prefent fold at is per boll, wheat meafure. The 
fale being wholly inland, is not extenfive ; yet it is of great 
fervice, not only to this parifh, but to a coniiderable part of 
the adjoining country. The coal which is wrought at prefent, 
is at Blairingone, and belongs to the Duke of Atholl. It is 
found, however, in feveral other parts of Foflaway, although 
not wrought. None of this coal is (hipped ; becaufe it is at a 
diftance from the fea, and befides, the quantity thrown out, 
is not fufHcient to anfwer, throughout the year, the prefent 
demand. The price of the fmall coal, is 5d, for 3 burdens ; 
for the great coal, iod, for 24 Hones, Tron weight. The 
driving of lime and coal, is attended with the material difad- 

vantage

vantage of bad roads. The noblemen and gentlemen, are, 
however, exerting themfelves to remedy this evil ; but it never 
will be effeaually done, until turnpikes are eftabHflied. The 
local advantages which have been mentioned, ought to en- 
courage incloHng and improvements ; and mould induce pro- 
prietors and tenants, to exert themfelves, to carry them far- 
ther than they have yet been carried ; efpecially as it has been 
found, that land which before being improved, produced no 
more than between 5 and 6 bolls, from one boll of feed, have 
after being improved, been brought to yield upwards of 11. 
In the parifhes, there is alfo iron-ftone ; but at prefent, it is 
not wrought. 

Sheep t Horfes, and Black Cattle.— -The number of fheep, 
does not exceed 3000 ; and they are all, what are here called 
the Tweed's Muir kind, and pafture only on the Ochil hills. 
The farmers have not begun to try the Englifh fheep ; although 
they are more attentive to obtain a good breed, than they 
formerly were. They have a ready fale for their wool, 
mutton, and lamb ; and the mutton and lamb are efteemed 
good. More fheep might be kept, if they did not breed 
horfes and black cattle: Of thefe, fome are bred for private 
ufe, others for fale. As their number is conftantly varying 
according to the fales, it is impoffible to afcertain it exactly. 
Black-tvittle are peculiarly attended to, of which great num- 
bers are reared. None of them are of the gre.atelt fize \ but 
they are exceedingly hardy, and in general, bring good prices. 
The tenants pay their rents, not only by the fale of grain; but 
by the profits arifiug from their fheep, horfes, and black- 
cuttle. 



Milv.s. — In the two parifhes, there are 9 milns. One lint 
riiiln, one waulk miln, one for man u fad u ring pot barky, and 

6 



of Foffaway and Tulliebole. 46$ 

6 for meal. The one for lint, is on the Dovan near the 
Crook. It is well employed, and of general utility. The 
corn-milns have all a thirlage, that is, fo many proprietors 
bound by charter, and fo many tenants by leafes, to bring 
their grain to thofe milns. There is alfo one barony thirled 
to a miln which is not in the parifh ; which, from its diftance, 
it is at all times very inconvenient to ufe ; and in the winter 
feafon, almoft impoflible. Thirlage operates in every in- 
ftance as a tax on induftry, and is in a high degree unfavour- 
able to the improvement of the country. It would perhaps be 
better for the proprietors* of the milns, as well as for the ge- 
neral advantage of the country, to fell the thirlage ; which 
the heritors are not only willing to purchafe, but for which 
they would give a good price ; though in molt cafes, the con- 
venience of the ficuations would lead them to bring their 
grain to the fame milns which they ufe at prefent. 

Schools — There are two fchools in the parifhes ; one fituated 
at the Crook of Dovan, and the other at Blairingone. The 
one at the Crook is the parochial fchool ; and the fchool at 
Blairingone, is for the benefit of the children belonging to the 
work people of the colliery. The teacher at Blairingone has 
very fmall encouragement ; nothing but what arifes from the 
wages paid him by the fcholars, and a fmall fubfeription, which 
does not exceed L. 9 annually. If nothing more can be pro- 
cured, it is probable, that in a fhort time this fchool will be 
given up, to the great detriment of the village. The falary 
of the parochial fchoolmafter, is L. 5 : n : i£d fterling, per 
annum, in money, with a piece of land, worth about the 
fame fum ; and the emoluments arifing from the offices of 
precentor and feffion-clerk. Parochial fchoolmafters com- 
monly receive a good education, are a body of men of great 
importance to this country, and certainly deferve much better 
Vol. XVIII. 3 N encouragement

encouragement from the landed proprietors, than they at 
prcfent receive. 

State of the Poor. — There are 24 perfons at prefent on the 
lift of the parifh poor; and the funds to fupport them do not 
much exceed L. 30 per annum. This fum arifes from the in- 
tereft of money, from parochial collections, and from fome 
cafualities. There have never been any legal affeffments in the 
parifhes. The fum for the fupport of fuch a number of poor, 
is certainly I'm all. There are none among them, however, who 
cannot work a little ; and fome of them only receive a fmall 
occafional allowance, when the prices of grain are high. 
There are 2 blind women on the lift ; and it is furprifing 
how much they can fpin. The fevereft feafon which has 
happened here for a long time, was in 1782. At that time, 
every defcription of men exerted themfclves to affift the poor. 
A meeting of the heritors, called for the purpofe, thought it 
better to aflefs themfelves, than to encroach on the parifh 
money lent at untereft. Different quantities of meal were 
bought, and fold to the people at the common prices in a 
year of plenty ; and this mode of relief was continued till 
the fcarcity was no longer felt. 

The parifh received fome advantages befides, from the at 
fiftance given by Government in that year, to fome of the 
northern counties of Scotland. Perth-fhire was included; 
and Foffaway being in Perth-fhire, received its proportion, 
which was extremely ufeful ; and was faithfully applied. 

Birds and ^admpcds.-BlrAs, fuch as are comm0n in hUI * 
countries, are found here. Moorfowl, partridges, plover, 
field-fare, dotterel, wild ducks, ravens, a fmall fpecies of the 
eagle, the kite \ and in winter, wild geefe. Of quadrupeds, 
there are foxes, badgers, otter,, pole-cato, hares, and rabbits. 

Thofe 



of Fojaway and Tulliebok. 467 

Thofe who delight to amufe themfelves with the hounds, or 
with the gun, will always find enough to gratify them here* 
There are no where greater numbers of partridges and hares. 
The carnivorous raven is particularly deftruaive to the 
young lambs. His method of attack is fingular and favage ; 
when he darts on the lamb, he firft attacks the eyes, and 
when the animal cries, he feizes on the tongue. The de- 
ftruftion of the fox, and of this kind of raven, is an object 
of importance in this country. 

Etymology of Names of Places.— Dovan, Dobh-an, "fwelling 
or raging water," very properly applied to the river Dovan-, 
becaufe it frequently fwells to a very great height, confider- 
ing its fize ; and runs with great rapidity and violence, until 
it arrives at the banks of Dollar. Gairney-Garana, " The un- 
derwoods." There are two fmall rivers, which have both the 
name of Gairney, which rife in the pariihes ; the one called 
the Eaft, and the other the Weft Gairney ; becaufe the one 
runs eaft, and the other weft ; and the banks of both in fome 
places, are {haded with copfe wood. Solfgirth, has had 
different etymologies affigned to it $ but among others, it has 
been fuppofed to be a Saxon name ; which may fignify a 
Girth, " or fandtuary for the foles of one's feet." It is fTtuated 
in a corner of the county, where Fife and Clackmannan-fhires 
join with it; fo that perfons flying from juftice, from either 
of thofe counties, would here find an afylum. Near this 
place, where two rivulets meet, one may place the right foot 
on Perth- (hire, the left on Fife-fhire ; ftooping down, one 
may place both his hands in the county of Clackmannan ; and

• of the Murray* had a family feat at this place. The Scottifr- 
fpcar was an inftrument of war much ufed in the lowlands ; 
and was always found to be more than a match for the high- 
land broad fword. A proof of this, appears in that rencoun- 
ter which took place between Huntly and Murray, at Cor- 
richie, Oaober 28th, 1562. Dr Robertfon, when men- 
tioning this affair, faith, « The highland broad fword is not 
" a weapon fit to encounter the Scottifh fpear. In every civil 
" commotion, the fuperiority of the latter has been evident; 
" and has always decided the conteft." By ftatute, 1481, 
chap. 81, it is enaded, that fpears fhall not be made, or 
fold, that are fhorter than 5 ells and a half. Gartwhinzian, 
from Gart, an head, and Coinnean, a meeting or rendezvous. 
Every chieftain had a known place of rendezvous, to which 
the whole clan were obliged to repair, on a fignal given. 
The Rocky Pinnacle, now vulgarly called Gibfon's Craig, is 
faid to be the real Gartwhinzian, where the whole clan of 
the Murrays afTembled to attend their chief. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of the parifhes, are the fol- 
lowing. The Palace-Brae, Car-Leith, Hall-Yard, Monks- 
Grave, Gallow-Know, Trooper's- Dubb, and the Reforma- 
tion-Clogg. The Murrays of Tullibardine, the progenitors 
of his Grace the Duke of Atholl, were the ancient chieftains 
of this parifh ; and proprietors of a great many other lands in 
the neighbourhood. At this day, the whole of both parifhes 
ftill holds of the Duke of Atholl ; excepting the barony of 
Aldie, the barony of Tulliebole, the barony of Coldrain, the 
lands of Pitvar, and one farm belonging to Sir John Stewart 
of Grandtully. This laft farm, although it lies in the centre 
of the barony of Carnbo, commonly called Carnbo-Stewart, 
which was disjoined, as before mentioned, from Perth-fhire, 
and adcted to Kinrofs, ftill belongs to the county of Perth. 

The 



ofFoffaway and Tulliehole. 469 

The reafon of this was probably the common one ; that the 
whole property of the family of Grandtully, might be kept in 
the county where the chief part of their eaate was fituated. 
The old Earls of Tullibardine had a family feat at Blairin- 
rone, on the north weft fide of the fouthern branch cf Fofla- 
way. The fite of this old building is ftill vifible, and goes 
by the name of the Palace-Brae. 

On the lands of Aldie, there is a rifing ground called Car- 
lcith. On the middle of this ground, are the ruins of an old 
building, perfectly circular, and nearly 24 feet diameter. 
Not long ago, the proprietor ordered this ground to be plant- 
ed, and the ftones were dug up to make the fence. When 
the work people were going on, they found two ftone cof- 
fins near the centre. They were 4 feet long, and 3 broad, 
and contained to all appearance fome human bones and teeth, 
and fomething refembling tallow, which went to afhes, as 
foon as expofed to the air. One of the coffins was deftroyed, 
before the woik men attended to it. The other was preferved 
entire ; and confifts of 5 ftones pretty exactly joined toge- 
ther, and a very large one for the cover. Various conjec- 
tures are formed concerning thefe ruins. Some imagine, 
that it has been a place of worfhip ; others, that it was a 
burying place ; and that fome perfons of diftin£tion hate 
been buried there. Although a fatisfactory account of it 
cannot be given, it is accounted one of the antiquities of the 
parifh. Aldie, which originally belonged to the Earl of 
Tullibardine, was given away as a portion, with the beautiful 
lady Aldia Murray, who was married to William Mercer, 
laird of Meiklsour ; who was brave and generous, and in the 
times of feudal ariftocracy, ftrongly fupported the chieftain 
of the Murrays. The barony of Aldie received its name 
from the lady ; and the Mercers upon that occafion aflumed 
the mullet of the Murrays, as a part of their arms; and 

there 



Statiftical Account 

there has been a verj clofe friendfhip between the two fa- 
mihes ever fince. 

On the barony of Coldrain, or Collin's Drains, as it b 
tmgmally ft y l ed , there is a place ca „ ed Hall- Yard, adjoining 
to the prefent tenant's houfe. Its form is an oblong fquare, 
with the corners a little rounded. It contains 3 roods and 
36 falls Scottifh meafure of land, confiderably raifed above 
the furface of the ground, on the north, eaft, and fouth. 
It is furrounded with a ditch, which at prefent is in moft 
places pretty entire. It is from 15 to 20 feet wide, and al- 
though much grown up at the bottom, is about 5 feet deep 
below the level of the yard ; and as there are two or 3 fprings 
of water in the ditch, it is probable that it was originally 
filled- with water. Within this area flood a building, which 
feems to have been of fome note and ftrength ; and from the 
foundation of which, not many year- ago, large ftones were 
dug up. The country tradition is, that it was a hunting 
place, belonging to the Earls of Atholl. It belongs at pre- 
fent, to James Sted man of Whin field near Kinrofs. and is 
confidered as an antiquity, for the fame reafon as the Palace 
Brae. 

The whole of the barony of Coldrain, originally belonged 
to the Earls of Atholl. This appears from the copy of a 
charter of apprifing, in poffeffion of the above mentioned 
gentleman. This charter is dated at Edinburgh the 26th 
Dei ember 1609. It appears that Umquhille, John Earl of 
Ativoll, father to James Earl of Atholl, Lord Innermay and 
Balv,any, owed a debt of 17,348 merles Scots, to Sir David 
Herri y of Lethindy; for which, the whole barony was ad- 
judge, The lands were adjudged by a fpecial jury, to be 
worth no more than 10,000 merks; and 500 mtrks to the 
Sheriff appointed on the bufinefs. As no perfon appeared 
for the family of Atholl, to fatisfy Sir David in payment, 

the 



t 



ofFqfaway and tulliehole. 47 1 

the lands were expofed to fale, and the tenants, who either 
held their lands by leafe, or wadfett, appeared, and were the 
purchafers. The greateft part of thefe lands, belong in proper- 
ty to the defcendants of the original purchafers at tins very day; 
but the fuperiority is vefted in the family of Kinrofs. The 
price of thofe lands at the fate in 1609, was about 7 s 6d per 
acre, and as they would now rent at nearly that fum, this mews 
the great increafe of the value of land. 

The lands of Pitvar in like manner, belonged originally to 
the family of Tullibardine ; and were given away on another 
occafion- A clan then at variance with the Murrays, had 
made a fpreith, or open theft of their cattle, and burnt fome 
houfes. The clan Murray, under their chieftain, was imme- 
diately raifed. They purfued the aggreffors, and found them 
in a church, feafting on the cattle. They tout the gates, 
and fetting fire to the church, not a perfon efcaped. This 
piece of revenge, though cruel, was perfcdly charaaeiiftic 
of the feudal times. " To forgive an injury, fays Dr Rooert- 
« fon, was mean; to forbear revenge, infamous or cowardly. 
" Hence quarrels were tranfmitted from father to fon, and 
" under the name of deadly feuds, fubfifted for many gene- 
« rations, with unmitigated rancour." This adion which 
appeared cruel, and being committed in the church, which 
was reduced to afhes, was highly offenfive to the clergy. 
They reprefented it in terms fo highly aggravated, that the 
Murrays were excommunicated by the Pope\ In thofe days, 
fays the above author, " A fentence of excommunication was 
«« no lefs formidable than a fentence of outlawry. Befides 
" excluding thofe, upon whom it fell, from Chriftian privi- 
" leges, it deprived them of all their rights as men, or as 
" citizens." Hence, as an atonement, and to make up 
peace with the church, the chieftain of the Murrays made 
over the lands of Pitvar to the abbots of Culrcfs. Thefe

lands now hold of the crown, as having come in the place of 
that abbacy; and the firft minifter of Cu , rofSj at ^ 
ce.ves the duties payable out of thefe Jands, as part of his fti- 
Pend The name of Pitvar, is ftill enumerated among the 
other lands in the Duke of Atholl's charters. As it was the 
moft fouthern part of the lands belonging to the Murray* 
and on the extremity of the county, it is highly probable' 
that it obtained the original name of Pitvar, by way of diftind 
ton ; Pit, fignifying a hollow, and V ara r, an old name of 
Murray. For it is well known, that Vararis iEftuarium was 
the Latin name for the Murray's Firth. Sometime after this, 
a difpute arofe between the Tullibardine family, and the Ab! 
bots of Culrofs, as to the limits of Pitvar ; when a monk from 
Culrofs, (landing upon the common between the lands of 
Gartwhinzian and Pitvar, made oath that he was then Hand- 
ing on the property lands of Culrofs. One of the Tullibar- 
dine party, enraged at his uttering fuch a falfehood, imme- 
diately run him through the body. Upon examining his 
boots, they were found to contain earth which he had brought 
with him from Culrofs. He was buried on the fpot, and the 
place ftill retains the name of the Monk's Grave, and is 
ranked among the antiquities of the parifhes. 

When the rights of the Scottilh proprietors came to afiume 
a regular form, hiftorians inform us, that, " The lands of 
" fome were ere&amp;ed into baronies, thofe of others into rega- 
" lilies. The juiifdiclion of the former was extenfive, that 
t( of the latter, as the name implies, royal, and almoft un- 
; bounded. All caufes, whether civil or criminal, were 
« tried by judges, whom the Lord of the Regality appoint- 
' ed." Such power was never granted, but to families of 
diftinclion. The proprietor of Tulliebole had this jurifdic- 
tion. During the laft century, a quarrel took place between 
two of his vafTJs, at a market in the Crook of Do\*an. In 

the 



(t 



of Fojaway and TuUiebole. 473 

the heat of paffion, the one drew his knife, and dabbed the 
other to the heart. When his anger was abated., and he had 
recolleded what he had done, he immediately fled. A party 
however, was immediately fent after him, who overtaking him 
before he had reached a mile from the place, brought him back* 
He was kept in clofe confinement all that night. Next day he 
was tried for the murder; a jury was fummoned ; the Lord 
of the Regality prefided. Witneffes were examined ; the 
fa£t was clearly proven. The prifoner being found guilty, 
was condemned to be hanged the fame evening. The place 
appointed for the execution, was a fmall riling ground, at 
the ead end of the village of the Crook of Dovan. As this 
was the only perfon who ever differed in the parifli, his death 
lias been handed by tradition, from one generation to ano- 
ther; and the fmall piece of ground where the gallows was 
erected, dill goes by the name of the Gallovv-know, and 
ferves not only to keep up the remembrance of this murder, 
trial, and execution, but of the jurisdiction formerly exercif- 
ed by the Scottidi Barons. Though no injullice appears to 
have been done in this cafe, it is one of the fubje£ls for 
which this country ought to be grateful to providence, that 
the execution of the criminal law is now happily placed in 
better hands. 

In ancient times, the Kings of Scotland had frequent oc- 
cafion to pafs from their palace at Stirling, to their palace at 
Falkland ; and fometimes took their route by the way of Tul- 
liebole. One of the King Jamefes, tradition does not fay 
which of them, being to pafs that way, was aiked by the fa- 
mily of Tulliebole to dine. The invitation was accepted. 
His Majedy's retinue being numerous, and the cadle of Tul- 
liebole not being fufficiently commodious for the whole com- 
pany, a tent was ereded on a piece of plain ground, near a 
fmall rivulet. The entertainment was fo very agreeable to 

Vol. XVIII, 3 0 the

the King, that he conferred the honour of Knighthood on 
his hoft that very day. Amongft the King's attendants, was 
a trooper much celebrated for his ability in drinking intoxi- 
cating liquors. Among the laird of Tulliebole's vaiTals, there 
was one named Kehie, (a name {till common in the barony,) 
equally renowned for the fame kind of dangerous pre-emin- 
ence. The trooper and he had heard of each other ; and 
each was defirous to try the ftrength of the other. They had 
no opportunity while the King was there ; but they agreed to 
meet early on a Monday morning, foon after, on the fame 
fpot where the King had dined. It is not faid what kind of 
liquor they made ufe of ; but they drank it from what are 
here called quaffs, a fmall wooden vefTel, which holds about 
half an Englifh pint. They continued to drink, till the 
Wednefday evening, when the trooper fell from his feat, 
feemingly afleep. Keltie, took another quaff, after the 
fall of his friend, to {how that he was the conqueror ; and 
this gave rife to a proverb, well known over all this country, 
Keltie 1 s Mends ; and nothing is more common, at this very 
day, when one refufes to take his glafs, than to be threatened 
with, Keith's Mends. Keltie dropped from his feat after- 
wards, and fell afleep. But when he awakened, he found 
his companion dead. He was buried in the fame place, and 
as it is near a fmall pool of water, it ftill retains the name of 
" the Trooper's Dubb." The anecdote fhould ferve as a warning 
againft the criminal and prepofterous folly which occafioned 
it. Some of the people are ftill credulous enough to imagine, 
that the trooper is ftill feen fometimes fitting on the fpot ; 
and in the night, would father go a mile out of their way, 
than pafs by the Trooper's Dubb. The road leading by this, 
place, ftili retains the name of the Court Gate, or Court fTay. 

Among the antiquities of the parifhes, may alfo be enu- 
merated an anvil ftock, that was the property of a black- 

fmith 



of Fojaway and Tulliebolc. 475 

fmith in the Crook of Dovan before the Reformation. At 
that time, a Roman Catholic prieft officiated intheparifh; 
who was' a great declaimer againft the marriage of the 
clergy. The blackfmith, had notwithftanding reafon to 
fufpe£l that he was too familiar with his wife} and pre- 
tending to go on a journey, he returned unexpectedly, and 
found the prieft and his wife together. This fon of Vulcan, 
however, did not, like his predeceffor in the cafe of Mars and 
Venus, prepare a net to link them together ; but he ham- 
mered out a moft fubftantial ftaple, and indignantly dragging 
the prieft to the anvil ftock, he nailed him to it by means of 
the ftaple, and by that part of his body which had done the 
mifchief. He then laid down a knife, and fetting fire to the 
fmith's (hop, gave the prieft his choice, either « to cut or to 
« burn." The prieft hefitated, till the flames approached 
him ; but was at laft obliged to have recourfe to the knife. 
He never afterwards made his appearance in the parifh j and 
no other Roman Catholic prieft was permitted to fucceed 
him ; the anvil ftock, has therefore the name of " the Refor- 
" mation Clogg and the ftory is known by the title of " cut 
" or burn." The original clogg itfelf has been in the pof- 
feflion of the laft 5 minifters of the parifh ; and is now in the 
poffeffion of the writer of this account. This affair is faid to 
have happened during the time that Mary Queen of Scots was 
confined a prifoner in the caftle of Lochleven, under the care 
of William Douglas, to whom it belonged. 

Natural Curiofitles. — In working the lime rock, the work- 
men fometimes meet with pieces of it refembling the fhells 
of fea-fifh. Lately, there was a piece found, exactly fi- 
milar to a common octavo bible bound in white vellum. 
Both from the appearance of leaves, uncut, and from its 
cover, every perfon who has feen it, takes it for a book. 

3 0 2 The 



Stati/iical Account 

Thcmoft (biking curiofities, however, are the Devil's Miln, 
the Rumbling Bridge, and the Caldron Linn on the nver 
JUovan. 

^ i. The Devil's Miln. The Devil's miln lies higheft up the 
nver, and about an Englifh mile below the prefent church of 
Fofiaway. It is f orme d by the water falling over a fmall caf- 
cade, into a cavity made in the rock below. Here is heard all 
that noife, peculiar to a great body of water falling upon a 
miln- wheel, and driving it round with great velocity and force. 
In the cavity below, the water is continually tolfed round 
with great violence, and conftantly beating on tne fides of 
the rock. From this it happens that a noife fimilar to the 
found made by a going miln, is diflindly heard, when the 
water has force enough, by its quantity, to beat the rock 
violently; and when it is not fo high, as to cover the cavity 
altogether. As this miln, according to the country phrafe,. 
goes Sunday and Saturday, it is from this circumftance, cal- 
led the Devil's miln. Near this, and on the Muckart fide of 
the river, is fomething refembling a coal level, running into 
the rock ; which is called the Pigeons cave. This, as the 
accefs to it is difficult, has not been examined with fo much 
accuracy, as to ascertain whether it has been formed by na- 
ture, or by art. 

2. The Rumbling Bridge. About35o yards belowthe Devil's 
miln, ftands the Rumbling bridge. It is fo called, from the 
rumbling noife which the water makes ; pufhing along from 
cafcade to cafcade, on the channel below. The fpan of the 
arch of this bridge, is 22 feet; its breadth 1 1, and its height 86. 
Its height, however, from the furface of the water, varies accord- 
ing to the fwelling of the river, when the meafurement is tak- 
en. When one fees the bridge itfelf, the high rocks all in view, 
the natural wood \yith which in foine places they are covered, 
the water running along from one fall to another below, in 

fomc 



of Fojfaway and Tulliebole. 477 

fome places by the jutting out of the rocks, concealed from 
the eye, and in others, appearing again ; when he fees it 
here calm and fmooth, there all covered with foam, and in 
other places broken, boiling, and tumultuous, and remarks 
the multitude of fowls which are conftantly flying about, he 
will readily acknowledge, that the whole forms a very diver- 
fified, beautiful, and romantic fcene ; which well deferves to 
be defcribed. and to attract the attention of travellers. 

3. Caldron Linn. A mile farther down the river, is 
found the Caldron Linn. There are here two falls of water. 
The uppermoft fall is 34 feet in height; but is not perpendi- 
cular. The other is 44 feet in height, and is almoft com- 
pletely perpendicular. The two falls are diftant from each 
other, 28 yards.' The diltance between the rocks, on each 
fide of the river, is not every where the fame ; but increafes 
from 12 to 22 feet, and is leaft at the higheft fall. Here too 
are intervening rocks ; and there is one like a pillar in the 
midft of the water, horizontal on the top, by which many 
perfons have pafied from the one fide to the other. In the 
fpace between the two falls, are 3 round cavities which the 
water has formed in the rock, which have the appearance of 
large caldrons, or boiling vellcls, from which the name is 
derived. In the firft, there is the perpetual agitation of boil- 
ing water, the fecond is always covered with foam, and the 
third is conftantly calm and placid. The caldrons are of dif- 
ferent dimenfions ; and the third which is the largeft, may 
be perhaps 22 feet in diameter. When the river is low, they 
communicate with each other, not by the water running 
over their mouths; but by apertures made, by the force of 
the waters in the courfe of time through the rocks which 
feparate them, at perhaps the middle depth of the caldron. 
In confequence of this, the third caldron, which communi- 
cates with the great fall, has formed, an opening for itfelf* 

out 



4/8 Statljlical Account 

out of which the whole water, when the river is not fwclled, 
rufhes out to the great fall, with great violence, and with a 
very linking efFecl:. As this caldron, which indeed has not 
been meafured, ftill appears to be very deep, the aperture 
cannot reach to the bottom. The aperture refembles a door, 
or a large window, having a piece of the rock like a lintel ftill 
remaining on the top. When the whole water makes its 
way through this opening, the height of the fall is leflened 
perhaps 7 or 8 feet. To a perfon looking up from the fide of 
the pool below, as no part of the river above is to be feen, it 
has the appearance of a great body of water, from fome pro- 
digious fpring, gufhing out of the rock. When the river is 
large, the water runs over the lintel, as it formerly did at all 
times, and then the height of the fall is as great as it ever 
was. Some months ago, a part of the rock on the fouth fide 
of the river, adjoining the fall, was broken off", and fell into 
the pool below. Yet this has made little alteration on the 
fall but the force of the water, will no doubt, in procefs of 
time, make a great change on it. The caldrons may be 
equally well feen on both fides of the river ; but the great fall 
is feen to moft advantage, from the fouth. There is an accefs 
to the fide of the pool below, where the view of the fall is 
moft complete. Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, 
is the moft proper time to view it. The fun then (nines di- 
redly in front of the fall ; and as there is a gentle vapour 
continually arifing from the pool, into which the water falls, 
' it exhibits to the eye, all the different colours of the rainbow 
which, by the perpetual agitation of the wind, appear and 
difnppear, fo as to form the moft linking and pifturefque 
fcene. 

Bivers. There are various ftreams of water running 

through both parifiies j but the only river conneded with 

either, 



of fojffaway and TuUiehoIe. 479 

either, Is the Dovan. It rifes in the parifh of Alva, and di- 
reaing its courfe eaftward, feparates the parifh of Tillicoul- 
try from Blackford ; runs through the middle of Glendovan ; 
is the line of match betweeen Muckart and the northern 
branch of Foffaway ; touches at the village of the Crook of 
Dovan, (fo called, becaufe there it turns,) and taking its courfe 
in a fouth-weft direaion, again feparates Muckart from the 
fouthern branch of FofTaway ; paffes by Dollar, Tillicoultry, 
and Alva ; and empties itfelf into the river Forth, nearly op- 
pofite to its fource, and only about 6 Englifh miles diftant 
from it. Taking from its fource to the Crook of Dovan, a 
ftraight line, and another ftraight line to where it falls into 
the Forth, they form an angle of about 224 degrees. It 
runs a courfe, including its windings, of about 40 miles. 

The Dovan affords excellent trout, and the trouts are all 
of what are called the burn, or mofs kind. No falmon, or 
falmon trout, can pafs the Caldron-linn. There are, how- 
ever, fome Lochleven trout caught in the Dovan, which are 
eafily diftinguifhed from the burn trout, being of a quite diffe- 
rent kind. This to a ftranger would appear inexplicable, yet 
it is eafy to account for it. A little above the Crook, there is 
a fmall ftream of water which falls into the Dovan. Part of 
this ftream is carried off to fupply the village with water. What 
is taksn off runs towards Kinrofs ; and when it is flooded, the 
trouts, in the fpawning feafon come up, get into the larger 
ftream, and from thence into the Dovan, from whence it is 
fuppofed few return. When the river is greatly flooded, the 
trouts are found to fly from the current of the ftream, to the 
calm and ftill water at the fides. Then it is that many people, 
with fmall hand nets, drag the calm pools, and catch them 
in prodigious numbers. This greatly hurts the fifhing with 
the rod. 

Bridges.— « 



4**o Statijlkal Account 

Bridges.- The bridges on the Dovan, connefted with Fof- 
faway, are 5. The Vicars bridge, leading from the north, to 
the coal at Blairingone, faid to be built by a Vicar, who once 
lived at Dollar, but in what year, is uncertain. It was 
widened 6 feet, about 30 years ago. Higher up the river 
ftands the Rumbling bridge, built about the year 1723. The 
next is the bridge at the prefer* church of Foffaway, on the 
high road from Stirling to Kinrofs. It was built in the year 
1767. At a confiderable diftance farther up the river, ffand 
other two bridges, diftant from each other, about an Englifh 
mile. The firft, is called Old Foffaway bridge, becaufe 
it is buiit near where Old Foffaway church flood. The 

other is called St Serfs bridge, and it forms a communication 

between the parifti of Dunning, and the coal at Blairingone. 

Both thefe bridges were built as they prefently ftand, within 

the Iaft 60 years. 

A Flood on the Dovan. — The greatefl flood which has been 
obferved on the Dovan for many years, was in the month of 
Sept. 1785. The rain began about 4 o'clock in the morning. 
About q, the river was increafing with great rapidity. At 
10, it had covered the marks taken notice of in a large flood. 
This led to a clofer obfervation. The river fwelled to at leaft 
18 inches perpendicular, above the height to which it had 
been known to rife for many years. Though the rain, where 
thefe obfeirvations were made, continued as violent as ever, 
the river began to decreafe, nearly in the fame proportion, in 
which it had been increafing a little before. At v firft, this 
appeared quite inexplicable ; but the caufe was foon known. 
The rain had abated on the hills, from whence the flreams 
defcend, which fupply the river ; and all the water that fell on 
the low ground, had no influence to keep up the river at its 
former height. At the Rumbling bridge, the river was run- 
1 ning 



of Foffhway and Tulliebole. 4 3 r 

ning with prodigious rapidity and force, and had covered all 
the cafcades, which are obfervable when at its ordinary lize. 
It carried along with it great quantities of grain from the 
fields, many trees, and feveral ftieep. The river, from a little 
above the Devil's miln to the Rumbling bridge, is hemmed in 
by rocks on each fide, not diftant, where fartheft from each 
other, more than 16 feet ; and in fome places fo near, that it 
may be ftepped over. The Caldron Linn appeared in its 
higheft dignity. As the water filled almoft the whole fpace 
between the two falls, up to the fummit of the rocks, the 
uppermoft fall was fcarcely difcernible ; but the other appear- 
ed in all its majefty. The immenfe body of water, the height 
which the fall then had, and the agitation which it produc- 
ed in the pool below, formed a molt linking and even 
an awful fcene ; and feemed to make the rock quake at thje dif- 
tance of 30 yards. When looking up from the fide of the 
pool below, to the immenfe body of water ruming over the 
fall, it is impoflible to defcribe its dignity, and the amazing 
whirling and boiling of the pool. It was obferved about 2 
o'clock j the fun {hone bright, and there was a frefh g.ile of 
wind. The gentle vapour which appears at all times, had at 
this time increafed like a thin cloud; and afcended fully 200 
feet above the tops of the rocks. The rainbow was feen in 
full perfedion ; and the cloud being continually toffed by the 
wind, refembled the Aurora Borealis. 

The Dovan, in comparifon with other rivers, is exceedingly 
fmall; but at this time, it was a confidcrable river indeed. By 
anobfervation made near the prefent manfe of FofTaway, where 
it is confined by rocks almoft perpendicular, to a channel of 50 
feet wide, and running on a declivity of 6 feet in 150, it 
was found to exceed its ufual fize about 12 feet in perpendi- 
cular height.

Situation, Isfc* 

npRINITY GASK, or Tarnty, as it is vulgarly pronoun- 
ced, occupies a pleafant fituation in Strathearn, an ex- 
tenfive and beautiful diftrict of Perth- fhire. It ftretches from 
caft to weft, along both fides of the river Earn, for feveral 
mile?. The bank on the north rifes with a gentle flope ; 
(as the word Gajk, in the original Gaelic, is faid to denote, 
Stat. Hiji. of Scotland, Vol. i. p. 479), and commands a wide 
and diverfified profpec"t. The ground, to the fouth of this 
bank, is chiefly level, and feems to have been the alluvion of 
the river ; which, like the Forth below Stirling, takes through 
this plain a very winding courfe, and frequently makes con- 
fiderable encroachments on its banks. 

Heritors.— -The principal heritors of the parifli, are His 
Grace the Duke of Atholl ; the Earl of Kinnoul ; Sir Thomaa 
Moncrieff, Bart. General Drummond of Machany; General 

Graham 



of Trinity Gq/k. 4$3 

Graham of Balgowan ; Thomas Hepburn, Efq. Only two o£ 
the heritors refide in the parifh. 

Population.— This parifh, according to the report made to 
DrWebfterin 1755, contained 913 inhabitants. The pre- 
fent number is 795. The decreafe from 1755 to 1795, is 
118. 

Church. Stipend.— This parifh is fituatcd in the county o£ 
Perth, the prefbytery of Auchterarder, and fynod of Perth 
and Stirling. It confifts of the united parifhes of Kinkel and 
Wefter Gafk ; and, as report fays, contained a third place of 
worfhip, called Chapel-hill. The union of the three, into 
one parifh, is faid to have given rife to the prefent name of 
Trinity Gaflc. The kirk at Chapel-hill has long fince fallen 
into ruins. From the rubbifh large ftones, fome with croffes, 
&amp;c. cut upon them, have been occafionally dug up. The 
adjoining burying ground is converted into a cottage-garden, 
in which human bones are fometimes found. Divine worfhip 
has till of late been performed in the church of Kinkel ; where 
in fummer, the minifter officiated every fourth fabbath. The 
building having fallen into difrepair, is now abandoned as a 
place of worfhip j which was the more readily fubmitted to, 
as the minifter was not fuppofed to be under any obligation to 
continue the former practice. The church and manfe at Tri- 
nity Gaflc were rebuilt about 20 years ago, and are in good 
repair. Mr James Brough, the prefent incumbent, was or- 
dained minifter here in 1794. The ftipend confifts of 36 
bolls of oat-meal, 24 bolls of bear, and L. 43 fter. in money. 
A procefs of augmentation is at prefent depending ; and the 
funds for obtaining it are very fulRcient. The glebe, con- 
fiding of the old glebe of Wefter Gaflc, united to a piece of 
land, exchanged two years ago for the glebe at Kinkel,

contains 16 acres of good land. The Earl of Kin»oul is patron. 
One of the firft erecled Seceding Meeting Houfes, belonging 
to the Antiburgher Synod in Scotland, is at Kinkel ; and is 
regularly attended by a numerous congregation, collected 
from this parifli and the neighbourhood. 

School. Poor.— The parochial fchoolmafter has a falary of 
L, too Scots, (L. 8 : 6 : 8 ller.) with a free houfe and garden. 
The poor on the parifh lift are 4 ; befides a few indigent 
families, who, on particular occafions, receive a little affift- 
ance. The funds for their fupport are chiefly made up of 
colleaions at the church, and the intereft of L. ioo fterling, 
faved by the feffion in times of plenty. The colleaions at an 
average amount to about 4s weekly. None of the poor are 
permitted to beg. 

Agriculture mid Manufnblures.— Although almoft the whole 
parifli is arable, upwards of 1000 acres of land, which 
might be eafily improved, are allowed to remain in a Hate of 
nature. This muirifh land, which lies away from the river 
in the higher part of the parifli, yields but a fcanty crop of 
coarfe grafs to the cows that are paflured upon it, for a 
rent of from is to 5s per Scotch acre. It feems to accord 
with the prefent ftate of human nature, that men, whether 
viewed as individuals, or conne£ted in fociety, {hould grafp 
with avidity at foreign treafures; while they leave unimprov- 
ed the certain advantages which are within their own power. 
Arable farms, generally confifl; of a plough-gate of land, con- 
taining about co or 60 acres. The ufe of lime and marie 
has greatly improved the fyftem of agriculture. Graffes are 
now fown with fuccefs ; and turnips have lately been culti- 
vated with profit. Clover and potatoes in general do well ; 
and are highly advantageous to the farmer. A confiderable

part of the foil, being a mixture of clay and loam, is well 
calculated for producing wheat, which, in fmall quantities, 
is now fown, and it is hoped will foon be in more general 
ufe. Lint in fome places grows very well ; and premiums 
for cultivating it have been obtained in the parifh. Mr 
Thomas Stalker has this year (1795), preferved lint-feed, 
from lint produced upon an acre and a half on the banks of 
the Earn ; v/hich, from its fituation, feems to have been de- 
pofited by the river. The foil is rather heavy, and of a 
blackifh colour. Mr Stalker thinks that the feed will equal in 
quality any that is imported into Scotland. The parifh con- 
tains, befides about 40 acres of natural wood, chiefly oak, a 
good many thriving plantations, which beautify and flicker 
the country. As many horfes are reared in the parifh as 
preclude the neceflity of any foreign fupply. The breed of 
late is greatly improved. The cows are rather fmall, and 
are preferred to the larger kinds, as being more adapted to 
the foil, as well as the Cze of the farms. But were the lands 
inclofed, and more attention paid to the dairy, a larger breed 
of milk-cows than the prefent would probably be found to 
be more profitable. From 6 to 1 2 milk cows are kept on 
each farm of a plough-gate of land. The milk is made into 
butter, and fkimmed milk cheefe, chiefly for the market in 
Perth. Sheep are almofl wholly banifhed from the parifh ; and 
a few hogs are reared for home confumption. The parifh is 
fupplicd with four meal and two lint-milns. The aflricYions 
by thirlage, to fome of thefe mills, were till of late very op- 
preffive ; but in mofl places a remedy is found, by the propri- 
etors of land, who relieve their tenants from the burden ; or by 
the tenants themftlves who purchafe the right to the multures, 
and thereby have the liberty of grinding their corns where 
they pleafe. The grain produced in the parifh is greatly 
more than fufficient for the confumption of the inhabitants. 

Manufactures 



4 8 6 Statifiical Account 

Manufactures have fearcely, if at all, found tRe* way int# 
this parifh ; it contains, however, as many tradefmen as are 
nectflary, in ordinary cafes, for the cuftomary work of the 
inhabitants. 

Flings.— The river Earn, the only water of confluence 
m this neighbourhood, abounds with excellent falmon and 
trout. The falmon are caught in confutable abundance, 
chiefly in two cruives, which are placed in the river, and iox 
the ufe of which a yearly rent is paid. 

Roads and Bridges.— The roads in general are extremely 
bad ; and, in fome places, almoft impaffible in wet weather. 
The communication over the Earn was formerly by means 
of a ferry, which, on many occafions, was very dangerous; 
but an excellent ftone-bridge was lately built near Kinkel. 
This, and the other bridges in the diftricl, being built by a 
voluntary fubfeription, are not burthened with any pontage. 

Antiquities. — The only piece of antiquity worth notice, is 
a part of the Roman road, or caufeway, that runs from Stor- 
mont to the celebrated camp at Ardoch. This road, for 
jriore than a mile, in a ftraight line, occupies the higheft 
ground in the parifh. It is very complete, and, with little 
or no i - epair, ferves for a public road. The ftones of which 
it is made are pretty large; and are laid in good order. 
It is commonly dry, even in the wetted feafon of the year. 
The road, however, of which it makes a part, is but little 
frequented. 

MifceUatieous Ohfcrvations. — Two fmall public houfes, one 
at Trinity Gafk, and the other at Kinkel, are found to be ne- 
ceflary for retailing ale and whifky, for the accommodation of 

the 

\ 



of Trinity Gajk. 4*7 

the neighbourhood. They are prdduaive of no bad confe- 
quences. 

The mod noted well in the parifh is at Trinity Gafk. It is 
remarkable for the purity and lightnefs of its water ; the fpring 
is copious and perennial, Superitition, aided by the interef- 
ted artifices of popilh priefts, raifed, in times of ignorance and 
bigotry, this well to no fmall degree of celebrity. It was af- 
firmed, that every perfon who was baptized with the water 
of this well, would never be feized with the plague. In 
thofe times, few ventured to difbelieve what was aflerted by 
the Monkilh Clergy ; and fewer were poflefied of fortitude to 
oppofe the fyftem of influence, which the Eftabliftied Church 
had obtained ? But the extraordinary virtue of Trinity Gafk 
well has periftied with the downfal of fuperftition, and tne 
introdu&amp;ion of a free and rational enquiry into nature and re- 
ligion. 

One great difadvantage, under which the inhabitants of this 
pariih labour, is their diftance from" fuel. The works from 
which coal is generally procured, are diftant about 20 miles, 
and the roads far from being good. Half the fummer is fpent 
in bringing home as much coal as is neceflary for the winter's 
fupply. Peats are procured from the mofs of the higher 
grounds, but not without great labour and wafte of time. And 
it is obvious, that the time and labour which the necefTary pro- 
vifion of fuel requires, muft be equally unfavourable to the 
induftry of the mechanic and of the farmer. Thefe difad- 
vantages, however, are common to many places in the neigh- 
bourhood. 

The low grounds through which the Earn take6 its ferpen- 
tine courfe, are expofed to frequent inundations from the river. 
Owing to this circumftance, the land cannot with fafety be 
flowed till late in fpring; and even then, a fudden fall of rain 

upon 



488 Siatijlicnl Account 

upon the neighbouring heights fwells the river, andcarries away 
the foil the whole depth of the furrow, and that frequently 
after the feed is fown. The land being thus deprived of its fer- 
tilizing foil, and not infrequently covered with fand and gravel, 
remains a long time in a ftate of barrennefs. The harveft 
floods are fometimes alarming and ruinous to the farmer. 
His fields of corn are often entirely deftroyed, and 
the grain carried down by the flream. His mind is 
kept in conftant alarm, during the rainy feafon ; and the fab- 
bath is often fpent in removing the crop to a place fecure from 
the reach of the water. Upon lands thus fituated, few im- 
provements in agriculture can be carried on. Inclofures* 
whether by ftone dykes, hedges, or ditches, are rendered ufe- 
lefs by the floods from the river ; the dykes are levelled with 
the ground ; the hedges torn up by the roots ; and the ditches 
filled up with fand and gravel. Proper drains in fuch fixa- 
tions are impracticable ; and the manure laid upon the land 
is often rendered ufelefs, or wholly fwept away. The common 
courfe of cropping on the extenfive tra£t of land, which is 
thus expofed, is 3 years in white crops fucceffively ; and 3 
years, often 4, in lee. Much land is alfo wholly loft, by the 
frequency with which the river changes its courfe. No fewer 
than 12 acres in one farm, have within a few years been carried 
away from the banks, by the force of the water. The only 
remedy for thefe evils, is to ftraighten the courfe of the 
water, and to fecure it by proper embankments.

§ I . Name of the Town, 

r | ^ HE town of Perth gives its name, not only to the parifh, 
but alfo to the extenfive county in which it is fituated. 

The late Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, (Annals of 
Scotland, Vol. ii. p. 341.) fays, "The derivation of the 
*' word Perth, ufed in vol. i. p. 138, ought to be omitted. 
" I have been favoured with different interpretations of the 
" word. Not knowing which to chufe, I judge it beft to 
" omit them all." 

In this Statiftical Account, however, lbme explanation of 
the name may be expected. 

The word Perth, is pronounced by the Highlanders, Peirt 
or Peart. According to this pronunciation, the word is faid 
by fome perfons to mean a finifhed labour, or complete piece 
of work ; and to refer to the building of the town, or to the 
fortifications with which it was originally furrounded. 

Vol. XVIII. 3 But 



49° Statiflical Account 

But Fordun, (vol. ii. p. 99 .) whcn fpeaking of a remark- 
able fiege which the town fuftaincd from the Norwegians, 
in the time of the Pids, during which the Scots joined with 
the Pids in repelling the enemy, fays, « I have found, in 
« fome old writs, that the town of St John, now called 
" Perth, was anciently called Bertha." 

The contrafted pronunciations of Bertha, are Berth and 
Bert; and, as the letters B and P were ufed indifcriminately 
in the Gaelic language, the Highlanders might eafily change 
the name into Perth or Pert. 

Bertha, in the German language, fignifies celebrity, fplen- 
dor, or what is defervedly illuftrious, the fame as Eudoxia in 
the Greek. Thofe perfons who were called Eudocia by the 
Greeks, were by the Germans called Bertha. If the Pitts 
therefore, in whofe territory the town was, were originally 
Goths or Germans, there would then be no neceffity of feek- 
ing for a Celtic derivation of the word Perth. 

§ 2. Origin and Roman Name of the Town. 

There were towns in Britain prior to the time of the Ro- 
man invafion. But it may be prefumed, from the rude 
ftate of the arts, and the wandering manner of life of the 
inhabitants, that they fcarcely deferved to be called by that 
name. 

That particular tribe of the Picls which pollened, with 
fome other fmall territories, the county of Fife, and that 
portion of the county of Perth which lies on the fouth of the 
Tay, were called the Horeftii. 

Whether, before the Romans invaded the country, there 
were any conftant or occafional affcmblage of the people, in 
dwellings erected for them, where Perth now ftands, cannot 
perhaps at this diftance of time be determined with any cer- 

taintv.

tainty. We may therefore pafs on to the generally received 
opinion which is, that the town was regularly built ; and 
fortified at the command of Agricola, while he was profe- 
cuting his conquefts on the north fide of the Forth. 

Richard of Cirencefter, the difcovery of whofe book has 
thrown great light on the antiquities of Scotland, when 
fpeaking of the Horeftii, fays, " Their towns were Alauna, 
" Lindum, and Victoria ; the laft of which was more illuf- 
" trious than the reft, not only in name, but alfo in reality. 
" It was built by Agricola, at the river Tay, 20 miles from 
" the exit of that river into the fea.'' (Rich. Itinerary, 
lib. i. c. 6.) 

This is an exa£t defcription of the fituation of the town of 
Perth. The diftance to Dundee, which is commonly confi- 
dered as marking the exit of the river, is 20 Englifh miles. 
It is probable, however, that Richard meant Scots or com- 
puted miles, as he had his report from fome Monks of his 
order, who had been in Scotland in the 13 th century, and 
had there examined the remains of Roman antiquities. He 
might therefore fpeak, according to the manner of the coun- 
try, of the diftance of Perth from what may be called the real 
exit of the river. He evidently means Perth, and Mr Win- 
taker, in his hiftory of Manchefter, applies the name accor- 
dingly. Perth, or Vidoria, is reckoned to have been one of 
the Latin towns, on which ample privileges were always con- 
ferred. 

Mr Henry Adamfon, a young man of the clerical profef- 
fion, Son of James Adamfon, Provoft of Perth, and brother 
of Dr John Adamfon, Principal of the College of Edinburgh, 
wrote his metrical hiftory of Perth about the year 1620, 
which was publifhed, after his death, in the year 1638. 
^ The name which Mr Adamfon gave to his book, was, 
" the Mufes Threnodie." But, according to the fafhion of 

3 Qji the 



49 2 Statijlical .Account 

the times, when the book was to be publilhed, it received the 
fantaftical name of " Gall's Gabions." 

It is written in a very handfome and fpirited manner ; and 
William Drummond of Hawthorndean, the celebrated Scot- 
tifh poet of thofe times, wrote a complimentary letter to Mr 
Adamfon, defiring him to publilh his work, and congratulat- 
ing the town of Perth on having given birth to a citizen, 
" fo eminent in love to her, and fo dear to the Mufes." 

Mr Drummond's letter was dated July 1 2th, 1 637. But it 
did not arrive, if it arrived at all, at Perth, till after Mr 
Adamfon's death, who died in May 1637. 

I have thought it neceflary to mention thefe few particu- 
lars concerning Mr Henry Adamfon, as introdudory to the 
ufe to be made of his hirtory ; and more efpecially, as, I 
find the brevity required in this Statiilical Account, will 
not permit me to take any farther notice of him, or of any 
other remarkable perfons, natives of the town of Perth, 
unlefs fome more important articles were to be negle&amp;ed. 

The purport of what he fays of the origin of Perth, with 
fome additional circumftances, from Tacitus and Fordun, 
is as follows. 

" Cnseus Julius Agricola, in the third year after Vefpafian, 
** who had fent him to be governor in Britain, viz. about the 
" year of the Chrili ian j9£ra 79, led a numerous army, round 
" by the pafs of Stirling, into the country on the north fide of 
" the Forth. New nations or tribes were difcovered, which 
" the Romans wafted all the way to the Tay. The people 
" fled before them ; fo that Agricola, in his progrefs, had 
" leifure to erecl: many forts or caftles. 

" He was nearly 5 years eitablilhing the Roman power on 
" the north of the Forth, till he was recalled by Domitian. 
" At firft, the natives, in the winter, demolilhcd the fummer 

" camps 



of Perth. 493 

« camps or fortreffes. But thefe, as well as the winter refi- 
" dences, were at laft rendered impregnable. 

« When Agricola and his army fir ft faw the river Tay, and 
« the adjacent plain on which Perth is now fituated, they cried 
"out wich one confent, Ecce Tiber! Ecce Campus Martins I 
« Behold the Tiber ! Behold the field of Mars ! comparing 
" what they faw, to their own river, and to the extenfive 
« plain in the neighbourhood of Rome. The Italians, many 
" ages after, were in ufe to give to the Tay, the name of 
« New Tiber ; and Fordun gave the name of Tyber-more, 
" to an extenfive moor which lies weft from the town of 
" Perth. 

" As the field at Rome was by the early Romans confecrat- 
" ed to Mars, ib their defendants found, in the field adjoin- 
" ing the Tay, an old temple, which the Britifh or Welfh 
" writers fay, was built many ages before, by one of the 
" Britifh kings, and dedicated to Mars. The Romans per- 
" formed worfhip there to that heathen deity, in hopes of 
« their expedition's being favoured in the new country into 
" which they were come. 

" Agricola pitched his camp in the middle of that field, 
" on the fpot where Perth (lands. He propofed to make it a 
" winter camp ; and afterwards built what he intended fhould 
" be a colonial town. He fortified it with walls, and with a 
" ftrong caftle, and fupplied the ditches with water by an 
" aqueduct from the Almond. 

" Alfo, with much labour to his foldiers, and probably to 
" the poor natives, a large wooden bridge was conftru£ted 
" over the river at Perth." 

.The particulars which Mr Adamfon relates were not of his 
own invention. They were agreeable to the current tradition- 
And he, or the fpeaker whom he introduces, fays, they were 
written in an old manufcript; but were flipt, as many other' 

things 



494 Statijtical Account 

things w erC , out of the records which were more recent 
(Mufes Threnodie, Mufe Hi. v. 2 2 o- 223 , 242 ^ I? f 
It is not my pur P ofe to affirm that the building of Perth 
h Ppened cxa aiy in the manner now related. Bu't the pa, 
culars are not ^probable. The fame or other circumftan- 
ces more remarkable, might have occurred. 

One of the remaining parts of che north wall of the town 
having been taken down a f ew years ago, a pretty large brafs 
com of « C*far Auguftus Pontifex Maximus," was found in 
it, which has ever fince been in the poffeffion of Mr James 
Ramfay, prefent Provoft of Perth. 

The ftory of an old Britifh temple at Perth, is given by 
Hohnihed. He took it, I prefume, from Galfridus Mono- 
mutenfis, who was bifhop of St Afaph in 1 15 1 • and whofe hif- 
tory is faid to have been a tranflation of what had been written 
in the Armorican, or Welfh language, by Tiffilio, a biffiop 
m Wales, and fon of the Prince of Powis-land. The ftory, 
more particularly, is, that long before the time of our Saviour,' 
the fon of Regam, fecond daughter of king Lear, governed 
the whole iftand of Britain. He built 3 temples, one to Mars 
at Perth in Scotland; another to Mercury at Bangor; and 
a third to Apollo in Cornwal. 

An old houfe of a mean ftrucW, flood on what was rec- 
koned the fite of the old temple at Perth. It bore, for ages, 
the name of " the Kirk, or houfe in the green," and belonged 
to the family of Mercer of Aldie. The late Colonel Mercer, 
laird of Aldie, took it down about 8 years ago, and built in 
its ftead a modern houfe. He caufed a marble ftone to be 
placed in the front of the new houfe, bearing the family arms, 
with this infeription added, " Here ftood the houfe of the 
" green." 

But a remaining part of the building had been unknown, 
and was wholly fubterraneous. When the mafons had dug 

about 



cf Perth. 495 

about 3 feet below the level of the ftreet, they came to 2 flat 
arches, which they broke through. Under each of thefe 
arches, was an apartment of 26 feet in length, and 14 in 
breadth. The thicknefs of the walls, which were of large 
ftones, ftrongly cemented, was 3 feet and a half. Rubbith 
had filled up the apartments to nearly about 3 feet below the 
roof. There had been in one of them, a door to the north ; 
and in the other, a door to the fouth. I have not heard ex- 
actly what the depth of the walls was, only in general, that 
it was not very great. 

About two miles up the river, in the parifh of Redgorton, 
which is feparatcd from the parifh of Perth, not only by that 
part of the water of Almond, which runs ftraight to the Tav, 
but alfo by a part of the parifh of Tibbermuir, which lies 
along the fouth fide of the Almond j there feems to have been 
an out-poft, or Roman ftation, which was probably connect- 
ed with the winter camp, or the colonial town of Perth. 

On a high ground on the north of the Almond, and which 
the water has been continuing to undermine for many years, 
Roman urns and pieces of armour have been difcovered, 
which may be confidered as indications of a battle having been 
fought in its neighbourhood, probably not far from the bottom 
of the Grampian mountains. It is faid alfo, that about a 
quarter of a mile farther north, in a clear day, when the 
water is low, the remains of a timber bridge may be feen in 
the bottom of the river. 

This place, however, which was evidently an appendage of 
Perth, and where no regular town could have ever been 
built, has received, in contradiftidion to Perth, fince the 
days of Hector Boece, the name of Bertha. 

It is not to be fuppofed that the natives of the country 
would affix to the town the Latin name Vi&amp;ofia. It might 
have recalled to their minds, perhaps, forne fignal vittory 
3

49^ Statiftical Account 

over them, which had given occafion to the name. But they 
might make ufe of a word in their own language, fuch as 
Bertha, to fignify that the town appeared to them an illuftri- 
ous piece of work. 

Other occafions of the name may be conjectured. Per- 
haps the Goddefs Victoria was by the Romans worfhipped in 
a particular manner at Perth. Or, perhaps the Victorian 
legion might have a principal refidence there, either while 
Agricola was governor, or in the next century, when the 
Romans were again on the north fide of the Forth, and con- 
tinued there 30 years. 

§ 3. The name St. "Johnflon. 

The Picts, after they were converted to the Chriftian re- 
ligion, or the Scots, after their king had fucceeded to the 
Pictifh throne, confecrated the church and bridge of Perth to 
St John Baptift, whom they feem alfo to have chofen tutelary 
faint of the town. In procefs of time many perfons gave to 
the town the name of St Johnftop. But it was never fo called 
in any of the public writs, nor by the inhabitants in general. 

§ 4. Seals, or Armorial Bearings of the Town. 

A common feal belonged to the Burgh of Perth, in the 
reign of Alexander II, and perhaps long before. I have feen 
no copy of it, and therefore know not whether it was the fame 
which was afterwards ufed. 

Many impreffions of the feal, which was ufed from about 
the year 1400, are appended to charters which belonged to 
the religious houfes at Perth. On the obverfe, it reprefented 
the decollation of St John Baptift-, Salome (landing by with 
a platter in her hand, to receive the head. On the reverfe, it 
reprefented the fame faint infhrined ; and a number of priefts, 
or other perfons, kneeling before him.

The legend round both fides, S. Communitatis ville Santli 
Johannis Baptifte de Berth. The feal of the community of the 
town of St John Baptift of Berth. 

The fuperftitious feal was laid afide after the reformation 
of religion. The feal fince ufed, refers to the Roman origin 
of the town. It bears a golden eagle difplayed, viz. an eagle 
of the double or imperial kind ; the two heads looking diffe- 
rent ways'. A red efcutcheon, charged with the Holy Lamb, 
pafiant, carrying the banner of St Andrew within a filver 
double treflure, furmounts the bread of the eagle. The le- 
gend, at the bottom, Pro Rege, Lege, et Gregc. " For the 
" King, the Law, and the People." 

Befides the large or common feal, a fmaller one is made 
ufe of on fome occafions. It bears a fingle eagle, wholly fur- 
mounted, except the head and wings, with an efcutcheon 
oharged as the other. The furrounding infeription is, Sigil* 
lutn fecretum Burgi de Perth. 

§ 5. Situation of the 'Town. 

Though that district of the county, in which Perth is fi- 
tuated, be commonly defcribed as lying on the fouth fide of 
the Tay ; yet, according to the turn which the river takes, the 
town may be faid to be fituated on the weft fide. The prin- 
cipal ftreets from the river run nearly from eaft to weft. 
Along the oppofite bank, is the town of Bridge-end ; the 
church and village of Kinnoul, and a number of villas with 
gardens, or pleafure grounds, which extend a great way. 

The town divides a very fpacious plain, into what are cal- 
led the north and fouth Inches ; each of which meafures 
about a mile and a half in circumference. They are called 
Inches, or Iflands, becaufe they have the Tay on the eaft, 
and on the other fides, the branches of a canal which comes 

Vol. XVIII. 3 R . froin 



49 8 Statiftical Ac count 

from the Almond, and which brings down a large propor- 
tion of that fmall river to Perth. 

The ftone barrier at the head of the canal, which divides 
the water of the Almond, was mod probably an invention 
and work of the Romans. The name which it bears, is 
Louis-wark ; which, according to Shaw's Gaelic Dictionary, 
means water-work. 

There are fome documents of this canal having been in ex- 
iftence before the time of Malcom Canmore ; who, after the 
death of Macbeath, afcended the throne in 1057. Without 
it, there could have been no fupply of water for the mills 
which were then at Perth. It ft ill fupplies the mills, and 
now alfo the wells with water, and formerly filled the ditches 
when the town was fortified. 

The Inches are ufed partly for pafturing cattle belonging to 
the inhabitants, and partly for walking and other recreations. 
Alfo, as in the Campus Martius, military men perform their 
exercifc there. Both the Inches are furnifhed with benches, 
and the fouth Inch is furrounded by an avenue of trees of dif- 
ferent kinds. A poet, or a painter, might find full fcope in 
either of thofe Inches, to indulge his particular genius. 

To the welt the profpecl: is bounded, at about a mile's 
diftance, by what is called the Moor. That part of it which 
belongs to Perth, contains a (lone quarry, and is covered 
with an exterifive wood, which is of great value to the public 
revenue of the town. 

The tide, from the German ocean, flows up the river by 
the fouth fide of the Carfe of Gowrie, and reaches, though 
not fo full, about two miles above Perth. The fprjng or 
high tides bring (hips, confiderably above 100 tons burthen, 
clofe to the fhores of the town.

§6. A Mijlake to be rectified in former Hi/lories. 

He£tor Boethius, or Boece, a native of Dundee, and Prin- 
cipal of the King's College of old Aberdeen, began, as he 
himfelf tells us, to write a hiftory of Scotland in 1525, and 
finifhed it in April, 1526. It was printed at Paris, in 1526, 
by Jodocus Badius, who complimented him in fome Latin 
verfes, on his having transferred into his hiftory, in the be- 
half of the Scots, " the grace, and milky eloquence of 
" Livy." 

Boece's hiftory was held, for a time, in great reputation. 
It was clofely followed by Buchanan and others. But how 
he has amplified, with fabulous circumftances, many of the 
events mentioned in Fordun's Chronicle, which was evident- 
ly his text book, has been illuftrated, with a peculiar degree 
of fpirit, by the late Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, ill 
his " Annals of Scotland," and in fome of his fmaller pieces. 
At prefent, no credit is given to Boece, but in fo far as his 
afll-rtions are fupported by better teftimony. 

Among his other amplifications of what Fordun has relat- 
ed, is his tragical ftory of the defolation of Perth by water, 
in the year 1210, (Lib. 13. Fol. 288. firft edition.) 

It would be tedious to quote the whole pniTige, which is a 
pretty long one. What I find moft fault with in it, is his af- 

3 R 2 fcrtion 



5°'° Statijiical Account 

fertion, that Perth is not "the ancient Bertha, but a new city, 
built in another place by King William, after Bertha had 
been deftroyed ; though he grants that the Burrow-privilege 
of the old city was transferred to the new. 

Fordun wrote his hiftory long before the time of Boece. 
Major's hiftory was printed in 1 52 i - Both thefe authors re- 
late, that an inundation happened at Perth, in 1210. But 
their relations of it were very different from that which was 
afterwards given by Boece. 

The following account of it comprehends all the particulars, 
mentioned by Fordun and Major. 

" In the year 1210, and, as fome would have it, about the 

time of the feaft of St Michael, there happened fuch a 
'* great fall of rain, as made the brooks and rivers exceed 
*' their ufual channels, and carry off much -of the harveft 
** crop from the fields. 

" The water of Tay, with the water of Almond, being 
" fwelled by ihe increafing rain, and by a fpring tide from 
" the fea, paffed through a great part of that town, which of 
" old, whs called Bertha, now alfo Perth, in Scotland. In 
«' confequence of a mound or rampart giving way, not only 
*' fome houfes, but alfo the large bridge of St John, with-an 
«' ancient chapel, were overthrown. 

" William the King, David Earl of Huntington the King's 
(( brother, Alexander the King's Son, with fome of the prin- 
" cipal nobility, went into a boat, and failed quickly out of 
* the town, otherwise pofhbly they might have perifhed. 
« Of the burgeffes, and other perfons of both fexes, fome 
« went into boats, and others fled, for fafety, to the gallene$ 
*« or balconies which were over their houfes." 

1 have-to add to this defcription, that it is full fea or tide 
at Perth, about 2 hours 18 minutes after the moon's fouthing. 
According to a calculation made by a learned gentleman, the 

fprinj 



of Perth. 50 1 

fpring tides, on Monday, Goober 4th, 1210, happened at 
Perth, 18 minutes paft 2 in the morning; and 42 minutes 
part 2 in the afternoon. 

It may be fatisfaftory to give the progrefs of the king, as 
it may be traced in Fordun's hiftory. In fummer 12 10, the 
king who was then aged and infirm, went to amufe himfclf 
in the province of Moray, where the place of his birth was. 
In his return, he fell fick at Kintore, a town in the diftricl: 
of Garioch, and county of Aberdeen. He did not recover 
till September 21ft, and then was fo well, as to come to For- 
far ; where he remained a little time. From thence he came 
to Perth, being on his way to Stirling, where he was to hold 
a parliament, or a great council as Fordun calls it, a fhort 
while after Michaelmafs. 

The ufual refidence of the king, when at Perth, before the 
Dominican Monaltery was built, was the old cattle which 
flood on the north fide of the town, where the ftreet now is ; 
which for more than 400 years has been called by the name 
of the Caftle Gavel. 

It was noticed under a former head, that a large portion of 
the water of the Almond is conveyed by the aquedudt to 
Perth. Even now, fince the ftreets have been confiderably 
raifed, when any inundation happens, the water of that 
fmaller river, as well as the water of the Tay, may be faid 
to flow in great abundance in fome parts of the town. 

It was to guard the cown againft dangerous inundations, 
that the ftreets were raifed from time to time. Old ftreets, 
well paved, are found 6, 8, or 10 feet below the prefent fur- 
face. Subterraneous apartments fometimes have been difco- 
vered. Within thefe 1 2 years, fome mafons came to what 
they reckoned to have been a (table or cow houfe. They 
could not, with any certainty, difcern the walls, which pro- 
bably had been originally of turf or clay. But they found 4 

flakes, 



5 02 Statijlical Account 

flakes, and alfo a manger, wholly and very neatly wrought 
of the twigs of trees ; a kind of work which was much prac 
tifed by the ancient Britons. 

^ According to the courfe of natural caufes, the bed of the 
river mud alfo have been confiderably raifed, An old reve- 
rend gentleman, who died a few years ago, in a manufcript 
hiftory of his parifh, in which are fome high mountains, 
wrote as follows : 

" The foiI wafhed away by the heavy rains is carried 
" down from the high mountains into the ftreams and ri- 
« : vers, and by them into the fea ; where it fubfides, and 
" gaining on the fea has made our Carfes of Gowrie, Stir- 
ct ling, and Falkirk. In proof of which, fome perfons dig- 
" ging for coals in the Cirfe of Falkirk, found a complete 
" boat in the clay, 5 fathoms deep; and fome other perfons, 
*' digging for a draw-well in Perth, found at 3 fathoms below 
" the level of the bottom of the river Tay, tripods or chairs, 
" and fome other pieces of houfehold furniture." 

Walter Goodall, in his edition of Fordun's Scoti-Chronicon, 
in the year 1759, thought it neceffary, for the vindication of 
the antiquities of Perth, to fubjoin to the account which For- 
dun gives, (vol. i. p. 528.) an annotation from a Latin manu- 
fcript in the College of Edinburgh. Of a part of which the 
following is a tranflation. 

« c The author, viz. Fordun, plainly relates thefe things 
" concerning one and the fame city. But He£tor Boece, 
tc and George Buchanan his follower, tell a fabulous ftory 
ct of an ancient city Bertha, which from thenceforth was 
t{ entirely deft rted ; and of another, and new city, built in 
" another place, by King Wiltliam, and which was called 
" Perth, from a noble perfon of that name, who contributed 
" his lands to the building of the town." 

a The 



of Perth. 5°3 

The annotator thus takes away from Boece's ftory, that 
part which relates to the change of the name, and fituation of 
Perth. Lord Hailes, in his Annals, fub anno 1210, takes 
away the other exceptionable part, wherein Boece fays, au 
infant fon of the king and many other perfons were drown- 
ed. 

His Lordlhip had been induced to retain what related to 
the change of Perth. He was pleafed to inform me, that for 
once, he had put fome confidence in an afiertion of Boece, 
thinking it fcarcely pomble for Boece to miftake, or venture 
to write what he knew to be falfe, concerning a town only 
20 miles diftant from the place of his birth. But his Lord- 
fhip did not advert to the difputes about priority, and other 
fuch matters ; which, in the time of Boece, and near 100 
years after, were keenly agitated, fometimes not without 
bloodfhed, between the two very ancient towns of Perth and 
Dundee. 

In fupport of what the annotator or Fordun has obferved, 
I. It is certain that the town had the name of Perth, long 
before the year 1210. There are many hundreds of charters 
from about the year 1106, to the year 121 o, ftill extant. 
Any perfon who will take the trouble of looking into thefe 
charters, will find, that whenever there was occalion to 
mention the town, its name was always written Perth, or 
1'crtht, or, by way of contraction, Pert, the fame as after- 
wards. 

There was no noble perfon who gave his name to Perth; 
but there were fome perfons who took their Grname from 
that town. It was a mere local firname, as many others 
were. Thus, in ancient, as well as in modern writs, perfons 
are mentioned of the following firnames, viz. Stirling, Aber- 
deen, Abernethy, Dundee, Kirkaldy, Hawick, Muflelhurgh, 
and many others of the fame kind. 

2. It

2. It is certain, that tenements and ftreets in Perth arc 
defcribed in charters, prior to the year 1210, the fame as 
they afterwards were ; which would not have been the cafe, 
if the old town had been deftroyed. 

I crave the indulgence of producing one inftance from two 
charters which belonged to the Abbey of Scone, and which 
are contained in the old chartulary, preferved in the Advo- 
cates Library at Edinburgh. They are not very long. I 
fhall therefore giv.e tranflations of them, only adding the 
original words where the tenements and ftreet are defcribed.

Hay; Alexander Sheriff of Stirling; Roger de Mortimer ; 
" Philip de Lundin ; at Perth, 14th day of April." 

To afcertain the year in which this charter was granted, 
it is neceffary to make the following remarks concerning the 
witneffes. 

1. Philip de Valliams was made great Chamberlain, about 
the year n 80. But he continued in that office about 33 
years. 

2. Duncan M'Duff, the father of Malcolm Earl of Fife, 
died in 1203. 

3. William de Hay died before the year 1199. 

4. Hugh Roxburgh, Bifhop of Glafgow, was made Chan- 
cellor of Scotland in 11 89, and died, Ides of July, 1199. 

The above charter to Henry Bald mufl therefore have 
been granted betwixt the years 11 89, and 1199.

' Sper; Richard de Lenna; and many others." 

The date of this Charter cannot eafily be afcertained by the 
names of the witneffes. William, King of Scots, is men- 
tioned as dead. He died, December 4th 1214, and was fuc- 
ceeded by his Son Alexander II. who died July 8th 1249. 
It is ranked in the chartulary, among thofe charters which

granted very late in that reign ; becaufe Henry Bald, and 
Andrew the Son of Simon, who were living before the year 
1 199, were fbill alive. But Henry Bald, who had become a 
Goldfmith, or Banker as the term anciently implied, feems 
to have been old, and preparing for death, by giving two of 
his fhops in his tenement in Perth, as alms to the Monaftery. 

Every one who compares thefe two charters, may fee that 
no alteration of the town had taken place, in the interval be- 
twixt the year 1 199, and probably the middle of the reign of 
Alexander II. 

3. The original charter which King William granted to the 
town of Perth, dated at Stirling, on the Lord's day, October 
10th, and which by the names of the witneffes, is afcertained 
to have been in the year 1 2 1 o, is ft: ill extant. 

A tranflation has been circulated among fome of the Bur- 
gefTes. It does not make the fmalleft mention of any change 
of the name, or of the fituation of the town, which it cer- 
tainly would have done, if any fuch changes had happened. 
The Kin^ confirms the privileges which the burgh enjoyed in 
the time of his grandfather King David, who died in 1153, 
and adds fome new privileges. 

He was holding his great council, or Parliament at Stirling, 
which Fordun fays, was to meetfhortly after Michaelmafs iu 
1210. The public writs were dated, as if granted on the 
day of the commencement of the Parliament. The King, 
that he might be enabled to fulfil his treaty with King John 
of England, craved, and obtained a fubfidy of 16000 merks ; 
of which very large fum in thofe days the Barons agreed to 
pay 10,000, and the Burrows 6000. On that occafion, the 
Burrow of Perth feems to have been rewarded with a very 
clear and particular charter of privileges. 

4- Still more to confute the itory of Boece, there is a char- 
ter by Walter, fon of Alan, one of the anceftors of the Lords 

3 S * , o£ 



5° 8 Statijlical Account 

of Ruthven, to the abbey of Scone. It appears from the 
names of fome of the witneffes, that it was granted in or be- 
fore the year 1 200, In this charter, the fituation of Perth at 
the time is marked beyond all doubt, by a defcription of the 
road which led from Perth to Tibbermuir. 

" I grant," fays the above named donor, " and by this my 
" charter, have confirmed to God, and to the church of the 
" Holy Trinity, and of St Michael of Scone, and to the ca- 
" nons ferving God, and to ferve him there, that whole land 
" which Suane the fon of Thone my grandfather, gave to 
" them in Tibbermore, according to its marches, viz. From 
" the King's well on the ftreet which comes from Perth, and 
" leads to the forefaid village." (Scilicet, a fonte Regis, qui 
eft fuper ftratam quse venit de Pert, et tendit in villam prse- 
fatam.) 

The King's well, is about 2 miles weft from Perth, and in 
the ftraight road to Tibbermuir. If Perth had then been fi- 
tuated 2 miles up the river, and on the north of the Almond, 
the road from it to Tibbermuir would have had a quite dif- 
ferent direction, a great way to the north and weft of the 
King's well. 

I regret that I fhould take up fo much room in Sir John 
Sinclair's Publication. But jultice ro the town feems to re- 
quire it. In almoft all hirtorical writings, or books of travels, 
in which Perth is defcribed, Boece's ftory is retailed, or al- 
luded to; lb that no real hillory of Perch can be given, till 
that fable be exploded. 

It is furprifing, that during the courfe of 270 years, no 
perion feems to have been at fufiicient pains, to examine 
what Boece had faid of Perth, by comparing it with authentic 
records; or at leaft, that no pcrfon^who had done fo, was 
lacha warm friend to truth and to the antiquities of Perth, 



as

as to make public the particulars of the evidence on which the 
ftory is confuted. 

Sir Robert Sibbald was much perplexed, in his treatife on 
« the Roman ports on the fouth fide of the Tay." He found 
evidence that the Romans had a ftation, or colonial town At 
Perth. But he had not taken the opportunities of fully con- 
futing what Boece had faid. Therefore, he fuppofes, that 
when Bertha was deftroyed, the new town of Perth was built 
where the ruins of the old Roman ftation were. 

But it would have been better to have had recourfe to his 
favourite hypothecs of the winter and fummer camps - ; and to 
have fuppofed, that the ftation in the parifh of Redgorton, 2 
miles above Perth, had been the fummer camp, and an ap« 
pendage of the colonial town. 

I beg leave juft to obferve, that the kingdom was divided 
into parifhes, long before the time of King William the Lion. 
Malcolm Canmore gave, and afterwards his fucceflbrs con- 
firmed, to the abbey of Dumfermling, the church and parfo- 
nage tithes of the town and parifh of Perth. I have feen the 
old chartulary of that abbey. The abbot and Monks conti- 
nued to receive the tithes, and to regulate what concerned the 
church of Perth ; but they never had any thing to do with 
the church and tithes of the parifh of Redgorton. 

§ 7. Boundaries and Extent of the Pari/fj. 
Excepting a part of the ground weft from the town, where 
there is an encroachment from the parifh of Tibbcrmuir, the 
parifh of Perth bears, in ics figure, fome refemblance to a 
femi- circle ; the river of Tay, on the eaft, forming the dia- 
meter. 'I he length, from fouth to north, is about 4 miles; 
and the greateft breadth, from eaft to weft, is about 3 miles. 
The town is fituated nearer to the north, thin to the other 
extremity of the parifh. 

The 



5 ro Statijlical Account 

The Tay feparates the parifh of Perth from the oppofice 
parifhes of Scone, Kinnoul, and Kinfauns. On the north, 
it is bounded by the parifh of fibbermuir. On the weft, by 
the parifhes of Tibbermuir, and Aberdalgie. On the fouth, 
by the parifhes of Forteviot, and Dunbarny. And on the 
I'outh eaft, by the parifh of Rynd. 

§ 8. Heritors. 

The heritors in the country part of the parifh, are the Earl 
of Kinnoul, Lord Gray, Sir Thomas Moncrief, the heirs of 
Oliphant of Bachilton, Mr Marfhall of Hillcairnie, Dr Aruot, 
Colonel Mark Wood, M. P. Mr Anderfon of BLckfriars ; the 
town of Perth, King James VI.'s Hofpita! of Perth ; Glover 
Incorporation j Taylor Incorporation ; Robertfon and com- 
pany. 

The yearly rent of the lands, in the country part of the pa- 
rifh, is reckoned to amount to about L. 6000. 

§ 9. Soily and Cultivation. 

The foil is partly loam, and partly clay. The lands being 
in the neighbourhood of a populous town, and of a port to 
which great quantities of lime are conveyed, are generally fo 
well cultivated, as to yield rich crops. 

§ 1 o. Remarkable Villages. 

The remarkable villages, are the caftle of Balhoufie, an an- 
cient feat of the Earls of Kinnoul. The caftle of Pkthevelefs, 
an ancient feat of the Lords of Oliphant. Feu-houfe, a feat 
belonging to Mr Marfhall of Hillcairney. 

The old caftle which belonged to Rofs of Craigie, has long 
been demolifhcd •, but in the fite of it, there is a pleafant and 
pretty populous village. The village of Craigie-mil!, where a 
great breiveiie is cfhblifhed, is alfo populous.

An extenfive bleachfield has long been eftablifhed, upon 
the canal from the Almond, at the village of Tulloch, which 
has thereby become confidcrable. Muirton of Balhoufie, is 
the largeft and moft populous of any of the villages. 

I forbear to mention the fuburbs, or the ftreets and portions 
of land which lie on tbe outfide of the ancient line of the 
walls of the town. It is difficult in fome inftances to deter- 
mine which of them are not, and which of them are really 
comprehended in the royalty. 

The parifh of Perth is fo much occupied, and fo much 
furrounded through a great extent of the country, with en- 
tailed eftates, that the merchants, who have fucceeded in 
trade, are difcouraged from laying out their money in the 
purchafe of lands. Some of them have been obliged to pur- 
chafe eitatesat a confiderable diftance. 

§ il. Trade. 

In the early times Perth was a place of great trade. Alex- 
ander Necham, an Englifh writer, who read lectures at Paris 
in 1 1 80, was made Abbot of Exeter in 12 15, and died in 
1227, takes notice of Perth in the following diftich, quoted 
in Camden's Britannia. 

" Tranjis ample Tai, perrura, per oppida, per Perth. 
" Regnum Jujlentant illins urbis opes" 

Thus Englifhed in Bifhop Gibfon's Tranftation of Camden's 
Book. 

" Great Taj through Perth, through towns, through country files. 
" Perth the -whole Kingdom with her wealth fupplies " 

The lit. ral verf.on is, « Go on g-eat Tay, through fields, 
*' through towns, through Perth. The wealth of that city 
" fupports the kingdom." 

An 



5 12 Stati/lical Account 

An extenfive commerce was carried on, during many ages, 
between Perth and the Netherlands. The merchants of Perth 
vifited in their own (hips, the Hanfe towns. And it is a part 
of the eulogium conferred on Alexander III. who died in 
1286, that he devifed fuccefsful meafures for fecuring the 
trading {hips of the nation, " againft Pirates, and againft 
" being detained on flight pretences in any of the foreign ports. 
*' In confequence of the care which he exercifed about the 
" trade of the kingdom, which for fome years, during his 
"minority, had been on the decline; multitudes of fhips 
" foon came from diverfe regions, loaded with goods of va- 
" rious kinds, to be exchanged for the commodities of this 
" country." (Fordun, vol. ii. p. 130.) 

The German merchants, or Flemings as they were called, 
very early frequented the port of Perth. And not a few in- 
duftrious Germans, who wrought in the woollen and linen 
manufactories, and in flaming of cloth, feem to have fixed 
their abode at Perth, and to have been received as burgefles. 

But King William the Lion, following the example of his 
grandfather King David, put the foreign merchants under a 
great reftriclion when they came to Perth with their goods, 
in a charter which he gave to the town, in the year 1210. 
And, in that fame charter, as a farther difcouragement, he 
granted to his burgefles of Perth, " that they might have 
" their own merchant gild, fullers and weavers excepted." 

What feems to have been the political reafon of the excep- 
tion of thefe two trades, viz. the apprehenfion of an inunda- 
tion of foreigners, has long fince ceafed to exift. The ful- 
lers have been admitted members of the Guildry. The wea- 
vers have their own incorporation, and the Legiflature, fo far 
from being apprehenfive of the confequences formerly dread- 
ed, has of late years, for the encouragement of manufa&amp;ures, 
allowed that weavers may exercife their trade freely in all 

the 



of Penh. 513 

the burroughs, though fuch of them as have been already in- 
corporated, are not obliged to receive any others into their 
legally conftituted fociety, but on certain conditions. 

It is neceffary, in this Statiftical Account, to pafs over the 
different turns which trade has taken in Perth, and to offer a 
view of what may be confidered as its prefent Hate. In this, 
I have been aflifted by others, and (hall infert what I have re- 
ceived from them. 

The Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth nominated 
a number of gentlemen, who are members of the fociety, and 
who are well acquainted with trade, to make a ftatement of 
the articles comprehended in the diftrict of the town, the 
cuftom-houfe, and linen ftamp-office, which may be called 
the trade of the place. The following report was given in, 
fubferibed by Mr John Young, as Chairman of the commit- 
tee, who had taken a great deal of trouble in collecting 
the materials. The report was dated June 10th, 1794, with a 
note added, which bore that the feveral articles were not 
over-rated ; but rather, if there was any error, under-rated. 

" Matmfaaures.— The ftaple manufafture of Perth is linen; 
and of late, a confiderable quantity of cotton-cloth. There 
are above 1500 looms employed in the town andfuburbs; 
which manufafture of linen and cottons, annually, about 
L. 100,000 fterling value. Befides this, there is, at lead 
L. 120,000 fterling more in value of linen, purchafed In the 
Perth market by the dealers. Thefe goods are wove in the 
furrounding country, and all pafs through the hands of the 
traders in Perth; fp that the total of the linen and cotton 
manufaaures, amounts to about L. 220,000 fterling. The 
different fabrics, and the general purpofes to which they 
are applied, together with their extent, may be arranged as 
follows :

Printing J^orks. — There are 3 printing-works in this neigh- 
bourhood, fome of them only lately eftablifhed, carried on 
by companies refiding iri Perth, viz. 

Ruthven print-field, in the barony of Huntingtower, upon 
the property of the Duke of Athole, carried on by Young, 
Rofs, Richardfon, and Caw. 

Cromwell-park, eftablilhed on the grounds of Thomas 
Graham, Efq. of Balgowan, Member of Parliament for the 
county of Perth, under the firm of Melifs and Co. 

And Tulloch print field in the vicinity, on the property of 
the Earl of Kinnoul, carried ort by Sandcman Lindfay, and 
Co. 

Thefe works at prefent may be eftimated to do bufinefs, at 
lead to the extent of L. 80,000 fterling/w annum, and ori 
the increafe, being moftly new eftablifhments. 

The produce of thefe works, is (hipped at Perth, chiefly 
for the London market. The printers here have a full com- 
mand of the article of Silefia linen for handkerchief printing; 
being the ftaple manufafture of the town and neighbourhood 5 
theylikewife fupply part of the country demand, in England 
and Scotland* 

Gotton-Woih.— At Stanly, there is a confiderable cotton- 
mill for fpinning twift, by water,, the firft that was efta- 
blifhed in the neighbourhood; in which Sir Richard Ark- 
wright intefefted himfelf much in the butfet, George Demp- 
fter, Efq. and company: The proprietors have lately built 
another mill, which will probably be employed foon in fpin- 
niflg linen-yarn by water. 

There is alfo a cotton- work for fpinning twift, by wa- 
ter, at Cromwell-park, under the firm of Wright, .Melifs, 
and company ; and a fmaller one at Stormont bleach-field 
belonging to Thomas and John Burland. The operation of

all thefe will produce above L. 30,000 fterling annually, and 

tley are on the increafe, being new eftablifhments. 

There is cotton fpun in the town, and at Luncarty bleach- 
id, by water, foi wefts and other purpofes, fuch as the 

manufacture of (lockings, &amp;c. to the extent of L. 5000 fter. 

per annum, only lately begun. 

Bleachfields. — There are 4 public bleachfields in this neigh- 
bourhood, that whiten cloth for the country round, and for 
the manufacturers in the principal towns of Scotland, and e- 
ven fome of them have quantities of cloth from England to 
bleach. 

At Luncarty bleachfield, they whiten annually on an ave- 
rage, 600,000 yards of linen, |ds of which maybe called low 
priced linens, with diaper and table linens, from Dumfermline,. 
Edinburgh, Perth, &amp;c. ; and the other third confifts of fine 
linens and meetings. This work is carried on by Sandeman, 
Turnbull, and Co. and is on the ground of Thomas Graham, 
J£fq. of Balgowan. The fame company have another bleach- 
field atTuhoch, where they whiten about 300,000 yards an- 
nually of linen for the public. They are chiefly low priced 
linens. 

At Huntingtower bleach- field, (upon the Duke of Athole's 
eftate,) carried on by Richardfon and Co. Thomas Young 
manager, there are fully 600,000 yards of linen bleached 
annually, about |4s of which, are low priced goods, the 
olher third confifts of diaper and fine goods. _ 

AtStormont bleach-field, carried on by Thomas and John 
Barland, on the ground of the Earl of Mansfield, they whi- 
ten to the extent of 450,000 yards annually; }ds Silefias, 
Britannias, fhir tings, Sec and the other third Diaper and 
fine goods. ^

At both Luncarty and Huntingtower, there is fometimes 
in the throng of the feafon, above 60 Scots acres at each work 
covered with linens. 

Leather ManufaBure.—Vaz manufaaure of fhoes and boots 
is carried on here with great nicety, to the extent of at leaft 
L. 8oco per annum, chiefly fhipped for the London market. 

They prepare at the tan-works, from 4 to 5000 hides, and 
about 500 dozen calf fkins annually j and do bufinefs in tan- 
ning to the extent of L. 10,000 fterling yearly. 

Paper Mills.— -There are 3 mills for the manufaaure of 
paper in this neighbourhood, which contain at prefent 6 
vatts j but are conftru&amp;ed, fo as to admit of 9. 

Thefe mills produce at prefent, from 9 to ic,ooo reams of 
writing and printing paper ; and from 7 to 8000 blue ; car- 
tridge, brown, grey, and other packing papers, value above 
L. 8000 fterling per annum; and increafing in value in pro- 
portion to the quantity of fine paper manufactured. This 
manufactory, though only lately taken up by Morifon and 
Lindfay of this town, is allowed to produce uncommonly fine 
writing paper, which is chiefly fent to the London market. 

Lintfeed Oil. — The crufhing of lintfeed into oil, has been a 
trade in this town and neighbourhood for many years pad \ 
but it is now on the decline : the firft mill erected in Scot- 
land for the above purpofe, was at Huntingtower about z 
miles from this town. 

Salmon Fijfjings. — The falmon fifhery on the Tay is very 
extenfive ; and the rent confulerably increafed of late. It 
may be ftated at L. 7000 fterling per annum; of which the 
community of Perth draws above L. 1000 fterling of rent. 

The 



518 Statijlkal Account 

The fiflnng begins on the nth of December, and is given u P 
on the 26th of Auguft. P 
The fpring and part of the fummer fifh go frefh, packed in 
ce, to the London market ; and when plentiful in warm wea- 
ker, they are pickled for the fame market. No town in Scot- 
land is better appointed for intercourfe with London than 
Perth, as every 4 days, at leaft daring the fiflnng f ea fon, 1 
fmack fails, and in general, makes the paffage up within the 
week, if the weather be any way favourable; and the paffage 
to London has often been performed within 60 hours ; the 
veffels return with porter, chcefe, groceries, and other goods, 
for the confumpt of the town, and fupply of an extenfive 
nfing country. There are ; 7 veffels conftantly employed in 
the trade.' 

Mills.— The mills belonging to the community or burrough 
of Perth, are rented by Ramfay, Whittel and Co. at about 
L. 800 fterling^r annum. 

The leading article they manufadure is wheat into flour ; 
about two thirds of which may be fuppofed on their own ac- 
count, for the fupply of the town and neighbourhood ; be. 
fides, quantities are occafionally fhipped to the different 
towns of Scotland. The other third may be flared as manu- 
factured at thefe mills by the bakers in town, for which they 
pay multure to the company at a fixed rate, agreeable to the 
old charier of the burrough. The quantity ground may be 
eftimated upon an average, at 60 bolls per day. They alfo 
grind at thefe town mills, malt, bear, oats, and peafe ; antf 
manufacture. barley to a confidcrable amount. But the article 
of malt is greatly diminilhed fince the late Ac~t of Parliament, 
Which prohibited the working of the fmail flills in this diftrift, 
the line being fixed to the northward of Perth. 

. 1 This

This company likewife rent from Lord Kinnoul the Bal- 
houfie flour and meal mill adjacent, where they alfo manu^ 
facture confiderable quantities of flour and oat- meal. 

The flour mill of Pitcairn in this neighbourhood, parifh oj^ 
Redgorton, the property of Lord Methven, is employed by 
Mr James Ray, the granaries of which are likewife in Perth ; 
it is fuppofed to manufacture at leaft 5000 bolls of wheat into 
flour at an average annually, which is moftly confumed in 
Perth and its neighbourhood. 

Foreign Trade. — The exports from this to foreign parts are 
fo very inconfiderable, as not to merit any flatement. 

The imports from foreign countries, may be computed 
above L. 30,000 fterling^r annum, of which above L. 9000 
value may be reckoned for flax and flax-feed. There are con- 
fiderable quantities of wood, iron, and wine imported, and 
occafionally fome grain. 

The following flatement from the cuftom houfe books, 
for an average of 5 years, will fhew the flax and lint-feed 
trade. 

Imported from 10th October 1783, to 10th October 1788. 
Say a quantity which leaves an average importation for each 
year of 

48 Tons of flax from Holland. 

23 Do from other ports. 

71 Tons of flax, and 1177 hhds. of lintfeed. 

?t an average of 5 years, from 10th October 1788, to loth 
October 1793, there were annually imported, 

63 Tons of flax from Holland. 

15 Do. from other ports. 

7a Tons of flax, and 167 1 hhds. of lintfeed.

And in 1791 there were no lefs than 360 do. 
which fhews the increafing improvements in agriculture." 

I was likewife favoured with the following particulars, re- 
lating to the glover incorporation and their trade, in a letter 
from Mr Robert Gray, glover in Perth, dated November 
27th 1794. 

" The flunners and glovers are one incorporation. There are 
about 70 freemen members of it ; not all operative indeed ; 
any thing confiderable in the bufinefs, is in a few hands. 
Excepting 'the Guildry, they are pofieffed of a larger fund 
for their poor, than any other incorporation in Perth. 
• This incorporation has a very convenient Ikinner work, 
and drefs about 30,0.00 fheep and flaughtered lamb-fkins 
yearly. More than 20,00a of thefe, are of the flieep and 
lambs killed in the town. The reft are from the neighbour- 
ing country, and from the Highlands. Moft of them are 
fent to the London market, and are much efteemed for 
their cleannefs from greafe, and for their finenefs of grain. 

There are befides thefe, a good many fmall and (link kid, 
and mert lamb-fkins drefled here, which are got from the 
inonh-weft of Scotland. But kids having become fcarce from 
breed of goats not being encouraged in the Highlands, on

account of the plantations, they have of late been in part fup» 
plied with Italian kid, and lamb {kins for their glove manu- 
factory; and they have a plentiful fupply of mori lamb-fkins 
for that purpofe, from the fouth Of Scotland ; and parti* 
cularly from the country bordering on the river Tweed. 

The glovers here have been long famous for making good 
gloves. The quantity manufactured yearly, is from 2 to 
3000 dozen of pairs, and are chiefly for home confumption." 

I have have alfo been favoured by Mr James Morifon, with 
the following account of the book-trade carried on by him 
and his brother. He fays, in a letter, dated June 10th 1794, 
" Since January laft, We have printed about 14,000 volumes. 
So that you may fafely ftate, that except Edinburgh and 
Glafgow, Perth is the only toWn in Scotland where books 
are printed to any extent ; and that there are generally 
" from 20 to 30,000 volumes printed here annually." 

Since the above date, the Univerfity of St Andrew's have 
appointed the Morifons in Perth to be their printers. 

§ 12. Manners* 
I fee nothing in the manners of the inhabitants of Perth to 
diftinguifh them in any very great degree, from the manners 
of the inhabitants of fuch other towns* as are faid, in the 
modern fenfe of the expreffion, to be in an improved ftate. 
There are perfons I hope in all places, who deferve much to - 
be commended, and there are others who need a reforma- 
tion. 

An increafe of trade brings along with it ari increafe o£ 
wealth to the merchants, and of days wages to the opera- 
tive people : Its natural confequence, therefore, is, a man- 
ner of living fcarcely known in the former times. 

It is too much the cafe with the generality of mankind, 
that their piety does not increafe, in equal proportion to their 
V0I " XVI1I  wealth i 



5 12 Stati/lical Account 

wealth; whereas the bounties of the Divine Providence, 
when they are liberally conferred, ought to excite in the 
perfons who receive them, a difpofition to make greater and 
more devout returns of gratitude to God. 

Some of the public amufements common in other places, 
are to be found in Perth. Among thefe, particular notice 
may be taken of the amufements of^the theatre. Players oc- 
cafionally come to Perth, and fometimes they remain very 
long. 

It is generally acknowledged, that many of the plays, com- 
monly a£led, have an immoral Pendency •, and the political 
confequence of fuch a captivating amufement, frequently 
introduced in a commercial city, cannot be a good one. 

It may afford what may be reckoned a piece of curious in- 
formation, to relate how plays were regulated in Perth, more 
than 200 years ago. It appears from the old records, that a 
company of players were in Perth, June 3d, 1589. In obe- 
dience to an a£t of the General Affembly, which had been 
made in the year 1574 — 5, they applied to the confiftory of 
the church for a licence, and (hewed a copy of the play, 
which they propofed to exhibit. 

The words of the record, fome of them a little modernifed, 
are, "Perth, June 3d, 1589, The minifter and elders give 
" licence to play the phy, with conditions that no fwearing, 
" banning, nor one fcurrility mall be fpoken, which would 
" be a fcandal to our religion which we profefs, and for an 
" evil example unto others. Alfo, that nothing fhall be ad- 
" ded to what is in the regifter of the play itfelf. If any one 
{ who plays (hall do in the contrary, he. fhall be warded, and 
« make his public repentance." That is, he was to be im- 
prifoncd, and afterwards to appear in the church to be re- 
buked in the public place of repentance. 

Guthry, 



of Perth. 523 

Gutbry, in his Hiftory of Scotland, when fpeaking of a 
company of Englifh players, who came to Scotland in the 
year 1599, fays, " I have great reafon to think that Shake- 
" fpear was one of the number." That actor and writer of 
plays, mod probably, began his excursions before the year 
1589. If therefore they were Englifh a£tors who were at 
Perth that year, he might perhaps be one of them. 

In the record, the minifter and elders fpeak of the actors as 
being all of them men. For it was not till fome time after 
the restoration of King Charles II. that women appeared 
upon the ftage. No doubt, if fome restrictions, fimilar to 
thofe in the record were now in ufe, a reformation of the 
ftage might be expected. 

There are no hackney coaches in Perth, but many poft- 
chaifes, which are often ufed as fuch coaches are in the larger 
towns. There are fome perfons who keep carriages of their 
own; and ftill a greater number who keep men-fervants in 
livery, as being fuitable to the (tile of living which they are 
able to fupport. 

There are great taverns, and a coffee-room ; but there are 
no gaming-houfes that I know of, nor any perfons who feem 
to make gaming a trade. The opulent inhabitants live gen- 
teely, and are cautious not to exceed in their expences. In 
the year 1793, w ^en there were many failures in other places, 
there was not one of any confequence in Perth, it has often 
been noticed, as what is honourable to Perth, that thofe of 
the better rank, fet a good example, by giving a regular at- 
tendance in the churches. 

The craftfmen in Perth, were long diftinguifhed by a drift 
regard to religion, and by the remarkable care which they 4 
took in training up their children, their apprentices, and even 
their journeymen, in good principles and praftices. I truft 
it is ftill generally the cafe. 1 have heard, however, from 

3 U 2 ' f ome 



£24 Statiflical Account 

fome of them, that they do not find it a matter fo eafy to 
control their young people, as it formerly was, 

I with to fave myfelf the pain of defcribing the lamentable 
effedts-which happen to fome perfons, from their being too 
ready to leave their loom, or their work- {hop, to meet in 
companies, or in clubs, in the ale-houfes. This propensity, 
however, is not peculiar to Perth. It is as much, or perhaps 
more to be complained of in other places, where the efftas 
?ilfo have been more vifibko 

§ 13. Population, 
The firft full year's lift, now extant, of marriages, baptifms, 
end burials, in Perth, is for the year 1562. The numbers are, 

Marriages—! — ■. — 70 
Baptifms- 1 - -225 
Burials — 182 

The number of burials, multiplied by 31, makes the num- 
ber of the inhabitants at that time, to have been 5642. 

The number of baptifms, multiplied by 27, makes the 
number of inhabitants to have been 6075. 

With regard to the number of marriages, it is to be ob- 
served, that the manner* of the people, till long after the re- 
formation of religion, were exceedingly lice-ntious. The Kirk 
Sefiion was abundantly fevere. Its minutes, now ext.uit, 
commence in May 1577 ; and it appears, that from that date, 
lo October 7th, 1577, which was the day of the annual elec- 
Uon of elders and deacons, 24 perfons had been puniftied 
for having children otherwife than by lawful marriage. And 
from October 7th, 1577, to O&amp;ober 6th, 1578, there were 
67 fuch perfons punimed. 

I do not give much credit to the accuracy of the old lifts of 
marriages, baptifms, and burials. Sometimes there are no 
% perfons 



of Perth. 525 

perfons mentioned for months, and fometimes for whole 
years. I have known many applications made for extracts 
from the regifters, kept prior to the laft 20 years, and often 
what was fought for, could not be found, which occafioned 
trouble and lofs to fome families. 

For fome years paft, a regulation has taken place, which 
has a good effect. Not only the eftablifhed minifters, but 
alfo fome of the diffenting minifters, from a regard to the 
intereft of families, have agreed to require from the parent, 
who prefents a child for baptifm, a line from the keeper of the 
regifters, certifying that the birth of the child has been marked. 

Such a regifter of burials as could be depended upon as to 
accuracy of numbers, only began to be kept February 7th, 
1792. In the following ftatement, therefore, the number of 
burials can only be given from that period. 

In the report fent to Dr Webfter, in the year 1755, the 
number of the inhabitants was reckoned to be 9019. The 
great increafe of inhabitants fince that time,, will appear from 
the following ftatement.

It is to be remarked, that many of the boys who come as 
apprentices from different parts of the country, leave the 
town as foon as they have learned their trade. 

Alfo many other young men, whofe parents are refiding in 
the town, go to feek their fortuae elfewhere in the kingdom, 
or in foreign parts. The females in general remain, and there 
are always more unmarried women than batchelors.

For the reafon mentioned in the laft remark I made upon 
the marriages, I do not think that any accurate calculation of 
the number of inhabitants can be made in multiplying the 
number of baptifms by 27. 

Burials in the Following Tears. 

From the 7th of February, to the end of December, 1792, 
died 103 men ; 112 women; 173 boys; 174 girls; 28 Hill 
born. Total 590. 

In the year 1 793, died 114 men; 152 women; 1 81 boys; 
147 girls; 47 ftill born. Total 54r. 

In 



of Perth. 



In the year i794 died 94 men; 141 women; 129 boys; 
121 girls ; 34 ftiU born. Total 5 19. 

I reckon the burials in the year 1793, to be the average 
number. Therefore, 641, multiply by 31, makes the num- 
ber of inhabitants in the town and parifh of Perth, to be 
19,871 ; which falls fhort of the calculation made of the 
number of inhabitants made in Dundee, 4139. 

Formerly, while the town was furrounded with high wall?, 
and towers, and water trenches, the air of it might not be 
very healthful. But it has now for many years been laid 
quite open. There are new ftreets both to the north and 
fouth, by which, a free air circulates through the town. 

There are no difeafes peculiar to the parifh of Perth ; and 
the town enjoys this Angularity, that none of its inhabitants 
are feized with the ague, of which the natural caufe may be, 
that the town is well fheltered from the eaft wind by the op- 
pofite hill of Kinnoul. 

I am informed that the aged rector of the grammar fchoo! 3 
Mr Alexander Watfon, who has for fome years retired from 
bufinefs, has frequently faid, that d uring the zio years in 
which he taught the fchool, there were fome of the fcho- 
lars who died by accidents, but only two by difeafe. 

§ 14. Ptor. 

The poor are very numerous. Some of the heritors main- 
tain any who may be upon their eftates. The great refort 
of the poor, from all parts of the country, is to Perth. Some 
of them make a fhift, perhaps for 3 years, to maintain them- 
felv.es, and then when they fall into diftrefs, or their cart 
horfes die by which they gained their daily bread, they apply 
to the public for relief. 

The inhabitants in general, are charitably difpofed. Be- 

fides 



Statijllcal Accmnt 

fides what they give in private to diftrefled perfons or families, 
they often make large voluntary contributions. 

The permanent funds for the maintainance of the poor, 
are what is given by the Guildrey j by the feveral incorpora- 
tes; by the friendly focieties, which are now on a furer 
footing than formerly; by the hofpital, the yearly revenue of 
which, is about L. 320, by the Eftablifhed Kirk Seffion, the 
yearly funds of which, chiefly arifing from what is collected 
at the doors of the churches, amount to about L. 300. 

The different kinds of the diffenters, efpecially the inde- 
pendants, do much for their own poor. And the Magiftrates 
yearly affefs the inhabitants to the amount of about L. 3 6oj 
which, however, is not fufficient to maintain the begging 
poor, as many of them are ftill to be feen in the ftreets, and 
at the doors of houfes. 

Provoft Alexander Simpfon, in the year 1778, mortified 
L. 100 to the 2 Eftablifhed Minifters and their affiftant, on 
condition that the yearly intereft of it fhould by them be dif- 
tributed to poor perfons. And in the year 1780, Mrs Smythe 
of London, mortified L. 100 to the two Eftablifhed Minif- 
ters, for charitable purpofes, the yearly intereft of which 
they diftribute to the poor. 

§ 15. Civil Hijlory. 

It is not my intention in this Statiftical Account, to enter 
into the particulars of the civil hiftory of Perth, I refer to all 
the hiftories of Scotland which have been publifhed, in which 
many occurrences relating to Perth, are taken notice of. It 
was long reckoned the capital city of Scotland, and now hold9 
priority next to Edinburgh. In feveral of the public writs, 
efpecially in the time of King James VI. it is called the city 
of Perth, and ftill bears the tide. 

The 



of Perth. 529 

The Parliament houfe at Perth ft ill remains, and is con- 
verted, as well as it pofiibly could, into dwelling houfes. 
There remain alfo the ancient houfes of many of the nobility ; 
which are now, in a manner, alfo modernifed ; fuch as the 
houfes of the Bifhop of Dunkeld, Earl of Errol, and Earl of 
Athole. The Earl of Gowrie's houfe, which was originally 
built by the Countefs of Huntly, about the year 1 5 20, remains : 
but is not likely to remain much longer. In the year 1746, it 
was given by the magiftratea to William Duke of Cumberland, 
who fold it to government for the purpofe of containing bar- 
Tacks for a company of artillery. It is now, I am told, to be 
immediately taken down ; and new barracks are to be eredled 
fit to contain not only a company of artillery, but alfo a full 
regiment of foot. 

The citadel, which Oliver Cromwell built in the fouth 
Inch, was demolished after the Reftoration. Very foon there 
will not remain the fmalleft veftige of the entrenchments. 

The laft of the large towers upon the town wall, called the 
Spey tower, was taken down about 30 years ago. There is 
yet a fmall round tower on a remaining part of the wall, 
which is called the Monk's tower, and where probably the 
Monks who had been diforderly, were fometimes confined, in 
order to do pennance. In the laft century, the Earl of Kin- 
noul who was chancellor of Scotland, and poffefled Gowrie's 
houfe and garden, built the upper moft room of this tower, to 
be a fummer houfe. 

The revenue of the town is confiderable, and well manas 
ed. The people are ambitious of fecuring their money in the 
funds of the public revenue, which may fometimes tempt the 
managers to contract: more debt in the execution of their 
fchemes, than they might otherwife do. Nearly about one 
half of the members of the town council are deputed by the 
trades.

The late Earl of Kinnoul exerted himfelf in obtaining a 
new bridge to be erected over the Tay, in 1766. Befidea 
what was given by individuals, and by different focieties in 
the town, L. 2000 was given from the public revenue. The 
magiftrates have agreed to join with the county in ere&amp;ing a' 
bridewell; but the execution of this fcheme is neceflarily de- 
layed till the times mall be more peaceable. 

§ 16. Ecclefiaftkal Stute. 

The parifh church of Perth is a large and ancient building, 
and bears a refemblance to the form of a croCs. It is now 
divided into what are called the eaft, middle, and weft 
churches. The eaft church is the mod modern part of the 
building. It contains what was formerly called the choir, 
and was built about the year 1400, after the old choir had 
been taken down. It is in the bed ftile of Gothic architec- 
ture, and was lately furnifhed, in a very elegant manner, 
with feats and galleries. 

The parifh church, which had been dedicated to St John 
Baptift, the manfe which belonged to it, and another houfe 
in Perth, with the whole tithes of the parifh, were given by 
Malcolm Canmore, and confirmed by his fons Alexander I. 
and David I. to the abbey of Dumfermling. The abbot and 
Monks received the ret~lory tithes, and employed a vicar to 
officiate at Perth. 

At the reformation of religion, the property of the abbeys, 
and of other fuch religious houfes, reverted to the crown. 

King James VI. in 1589, at the time of his marriage with 
Ann of Denmark, conferred on her the lands and other pro- 
perty of the abbey of Dumfermling. This deed was confirm- 
ed by A&amp;s of Parliament, in 1593  but !t was cm£ted that 
ihe fhould allow for the officiating clergy, and for fome other 
rurpofes fpecified, one third of the benefices of thofe churches 



of Perth. £ 3 r 

which had belonged to the abbey. Her tackfman of the 
tithes of Perth, was John Rofs, laird of Craigie. He paid a 
third part for the purpofes enacted, and tranfmitted the over- 
plus to the Queen's Majefty. The Queen, however, foon 
after the year 1600, gave up her right to the tithes of Perth, 
and the town council became patrons of the parifh. 

From the year 1560, to the year 1595, there was only 
one minifter in Perth. From 1595 to 1716, there were 
always two niinifters, and only one parochial church. In 
the year 1716, the weft part of the building, which had 
been feparated from the reft, by a partition wall, was ordered 
to be feated, and a third minifter was called by the magi- 
ftrates. 

The town continued from that time to have 3 minifters, 
till the year 1740; in which year, one of the 3 minifters, 
was along with fome other brethren depofed by the Gene- 
ral Afiembly, for following what were denominated divifive 
courfes. The refolution of palling fuch a fentence had been 
carried by the cafting vote of the Moderator of the Aflembly. 1 
The brethren who had been depofed, though they were not 
allowed to -preach in the parochial churches, did not ceafe 
from the exercife of their miniftry, but began what is called 
the party of Seceders in Scotland, and very foon went farther 
in their oppofition to the church, than they at firft intended. 
The depofed minifter in Perth, was much beloved by the 
people. A great number of the parimioners attached them- 
felv.es to him, and left the eftablimed church, fo that the 
town council thought there was no longer any need of a third 
minifter. 

The population of the town, however, continued to in- 
creafe. In, 77 ,, the choir of the oKH building was converted 
into a feparate church, and an ordained affiftant was provid- 
ed for the two minifters. But the remedy was not fufficient 

. i

as there was but a fmall part of the area of the choir which 
had not before been occupied with feats. 

It could not be expected that the public funds of the town 
were to keep pace with the increafe of inhabitants, fo as to 
afford the number of churches neceffary. Attempts were 
made from time to time, to obtain a chapel of eafe, the reme- 
dy ufual in other towns ; but they did not fucceed. Only in 
the year 1788, a chapel was built by fubfeription for the 
Highlanders in Perth, and a minifter provided who fhould 
preach to them in the Gaelic Language. 

The following is a lift of the feveral churches and religious 
congregations in Perth. 

The people of the eftablifhed church, who are above two 
thirds of the inhabitants, have 3 churches, which altogether 
contain about 2300 perfons. They have 2 minifters, and an 
ordained afliftant. The town council alfo have provided an 
afliftant for the fenior minifter. 

The rectory tithes ufually paid, are divided betwixt the 
1 minifters. Each of them has yearly from the heritors, 80 
bolls oat-meal, and 70 bolls barley ; alfo of vicarage tithes, 
L. 3 : 14 : 5-f. The town council pay yearly, out of the feat 
rents, to each of the 2 minifters, L. 21:5:67; and have 
lately added, during their pleafure, L. 20 more. The town 
council pay yearly, to the ordained afliftant L. 100; and 
during their pleafure to the afliftant of the fenior minifter, 
L. 50 yearly. 

The Gaelic chapel has one minifter, whofe yearly ftipend 
is L. 50, out of the feat rents of the chapel. 

There is a new chapel in Paul's llreet, which contains 
about 1000 people, who do not reckon themfelves duTen- 
ters, but wifh their chapel fhould be revived as a chapel of 
cafe to the eftablifhed church. They have agreed to give to 
a minifter who fliall preach to them, L. 100 yearly. 

The 



of Perth. 533 

Th« diffenters of different kinds, are as follows : 

i A fmall congregation of the old Scots Epifcopals, which 

has one minifter. 

2. An Englifh Epifcopal chapel, which has one minifter. 
Several families from the country attend this chapel. 

3. A fmall fociety of Cameronians, who affea to be called 
the old Scots Prefbyterians. They have no minifter refident 
among them. 

4. A fmall fociety of Anabaptifts. The principles they 
entertain here, are not very well known. 

5. A congregation of Burgher Seceders, which has 2 mi- 
nifters. The people who attend, are chiefly inhabitants of 
the town. It ought to be obferved, in juftice to the fenior 
Burgher minifter, that as a brave old man and a chriftian, 
he -has diftinguifhed himfelf in oppofing the introduction of 
French principles. 

6. A congregation of Antiburgher Seceders, which has 2 
minifters. Many of th« people, who attend in this congrega- 
tion, come from the neighbouring pariflies. 

7. A congregation of what are called Relief people, which 
has 1 minifter. Many of the people who attend in this con- 
gregation, are faid to come from the neighbouring parifhes. 
A difguft having arifen among fome perfons in Perth, about 
the year 1786, on their having been refufed a chapel of eafe 
for their accomodation, they applied to the prefbytery of Re- 
lief, and a church was immediately built, and foon filled 
with people. 

8. A fmall fociety of Balchrifty people, who are a fpecie* 
of Independants. 

9. A pretty large church of that kind of Independants, who 
commonly are called Glaffites, or Sandemonians. They are 
not like the Englilh independants in the time of Oliver Crom-

w^but upon chrittian principles, are loyal and peaceable 

A gentleman in Dundee, f ome years ago, wrote to his cor- 
respondent in Perth, that if it were agreeable, an Unitarian 
rmmfter, who was then rending in Dundee, would come to 
lerth to give a iermon and an explanation of his principles, 
lne Perth gentleman very properly replied, there were al- 
ready too many religions in Perth, and he did not wifh to fee 
any more. 

It may feem a matter of furprife, that the eftablifhed 
church at Perth, mould maintain its ground among fo many 
chlknters. I am told there is not a vacant feat to be let in the 
3 churches; except, perhaps, fome ufelefs feats in the back 
part of the galleries. The number of communicants confide- 
rably exceeds the number of perfons for whom the churches 
are feated. And there are, befides to be provided for, all 
the young perfons, and a great number of others who do not 
communicate. It is furely therefore of importance, even in a 
political view, that more houfes of worfhip, under the jurif- 
diclion of the church, fhould be provided. 

I hope the falfe philofophy, which, for above half a centu- 
ry, has prevailed much in France, and which was adopted by 
fome writers in our own country, the effects of which, now 
appear, has made few or no converts in Perth. The people 
in Perth, have been accuftomed to the evangelical doctrines 
explained in the particular ftandards of our church, and they 
generally delight in them, as affording them the truer! happi- 
nefs. It is obfervable, that in as far as the faith of a people 
alters from thefe falutary truths, there will enfue all manner 
of licentious conduct. 

I have converfed witli fome, who evidently had been hurt 
by reading the vifionary and irreligious writings of Thomas 
Payne. One of hem told me, he thought no reply had been 
i made 



of Perth* 53 £ 

made to thefe writings. When I told him many replies had 
been publifhed, and in which the fophiftries of Payne had 
been detected, he faid, he had not money to purchafe many 
books, but would willingly read thefe replies if he could get 
them eafily. If it be the fafhion of the times, or has been 
the practice of fome perfons, to put into the hands of the 
poor people books of a dangerous tendency, furely the friends 
of our religion, and of our civil conftitution, fhould endea- 
vour to put into their hands, in as liberal a manner, books of 
a better kind. 

§17. Ancient Religious Houfes. 
I fhall fcarcely do any thing more than give a lift of the 
monafteries, churches, and chapels, in the town or fuburbs, 
and in the parifh of Perth. There were, 

1. The Dominican or Blackfriars monaftery, founded by 
Alexander II. in 1231. 

2. The Carmelite or Whitefriars monaftery, in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town, at Tullilum, which was founded fome 
time during the reign of Alexander III. 

3. The Charter houfe, or Carthufian monaftery, founded 
in 1429, by King James I. and his Queen. This King was 
murdered in the Blackfriars monaftery at Perth, and was in- 
terred in the church of the Carthufian monaftery ; where 'his 
Queen alfo afterwards was interred, and Queen Margaret, 
mother of James V. ^ 

4- The Francifcan or Grayfriars monaftery, founded by 
Lord Ohphant, in 1460. 

Befides, the parifh church of St John Baptift, and the 
churches which made a part of the buildings of thofe 4 mo- 
naftenes, there were a number of chapels, fome of which had 
hofpitals for the poor and fick, and fmall nunneries annexed 
to them. 



1. Our 



53^ Statijlical Account 

1. Our Lady's chapel which adjoined the old bridge, and 
was renewed after the former one had been overthrown along 
with the bridge, in the year 1210. 

2. St Laurence chapel, at the caftle gavel, the property of 
which, was given to the Dominican monaftery at Perth, by 
King Robert III. in 1405, that the Friars there might pray 
for the foul of his mother Elifabeth More, " who was refting 
*' in the church of the predicatory Friars of Perth." 

3. The chapel of St Ann, mother of the Virgin Mary, C- 
tuated at the fouth fide of the church-yard. An hofpital was 
annexed to this chapel. 

4. St James's chapel, adjoining to the fouth fide of the 
church. 

5. The fmall chapel of Allareit or Lorefta. 

6. St Paul's chapel. 

7. St Katharine's chapel, to which was annexed an hofpi- 
tal for a certain number of old men. 

8. St Magdalen's chapel, with a nunnery annexed. The 
property of it was given to the Carthufian monaftery. 

9. The chapel of St Leonard the abbot. It had an hofpital 
and nunnery annexed. Lady Elizabeth Dunbar, who had 
been privately married to that unfortunate Prince David 
Duke of Rothfay, and whom he was afterwards obliged, to 
reject, became priorefs of this nunnery, in the year 141 1. 
The chapel with its pertinents, was afterwards given to the 
Carthufian monaftery. 

AH thefe churches and chapels were filled with altars con- 
sented to various faints, and each of the altars had one offi- 
ciating chaplain, or more, when more than one faint was 
honoured at the fame altar ; and generally, each of thefc 
chaplains had about L. 10 in the year. 

In the archives of the parMh church of Perth, are the char- 
ttfarc, an accompt-hook which the prior kept for fome years 

previous.

previous to the Reformation, and 162 writs or charters which 
belonged to the Dominican monaftery ; 20 charters which be- 
longed to the Carmelites or Whitefriars ; 92 charters which 
belonged to the Carthufians; 207 charters which belonged to 
the chapels and altars. 

The acts and canons of the national councils were depo- 
fited in the Dominican monaftery at Perth, where thefe 
councils ordinarily aflembied. But they were carried off or 
deftroyed at the Reformation. 

It was at Perth that the reformed religion was firft public- 
ly avowed. Mr John Knox, attended by many of the chief 
nobility of the kingdom, preached a fermon in the parifli 
church of Perth, againft idolatry, Thurfday, May nth, 1559. 
After the fermon, one of the priefts having given a trifling 
provocation, a number of the people broke down all the altars 
and images, in the parifh church, and then proceeded to the 
entire demolition of the monafteries. No veftiges of the 
monafteries and chapels are now to be feen. Ever fince that 
remarkable sera, a weekly fermon has been preached at 
Perth, on the Thurfday forenoon. 

Mr Henry Adamfon, in his metrical hiftory, fays, that 
" all the churches and chapels had lofty fpires." The only 
fpire now remaining, is that of the parifti church. However 
nectfiary it might have been reckoned to deftroy the cells of 
the monafteries, their churches, if they had been left ftand- 
ing, would now have been found very ufeful. 

The records of the reformed church have been better kept 
at Perth, than in rnoft other places. Regifters of the tran- 
faclions of the Kirk Seflion, with fome few interruptions, 
are extant from the year 1577. The regifters of the prefby- 
tery of Perth, are extant from the year 1618. And the re- 
gifters of the fynod of Perth and Stirling, are extant from the 
year 1638.

$ 1 8. V irious Particulars. 

Having enlarged fo much on the preceding heads, I muft 
be more brief in fome other articles. 

Perth is the county town where the Sheriff-court meets. 
The Lods of Jufticiary hold a court here twice in the year, 
when they go on their circuits. The Provofts were fheriffs 
within the town, fince the time of King Robert III. They 
bear alfo the office of coroner, which office is not much ex- 
ercifed in Scotland. 

The inhabitants of Perth, by a decreet in 1602, enjoy fome 
difiinguifhing privileges. One of which is, that they are the 
only perfons, who, in the courfe of trade, are exempted 
from paying what is called, « the fliore filver at Dundee." 

The Perth bank has fubfifted for many years ; and there 
is alfo in Perth a branch of the bank of Scotland. 

The grammar fchool is in great repute. It has a rector and 
2 inferior matters. The academy for mathematics, autono- 
my, and the feveral parts of education which are proper to 
fit young men for bufmefs, is well attended by ftudents, even 
from fome diftant countries, and is in a flourifhing ftate. 
It has a rector, an affiftant, a French mailer, and a drawing 
mafter. 

A Literary and Antiquarian Society was founded at Perth, 
December 16th, 1784. A confiderable collection has been 
made of books, original eflays, ancient manufcripts, coins, 
medals, fubjecls of natural hiftory, and other materials fuit- 
able to the defign of the inftitution. But the fociety has not 
yet publiflied any volumes of its tranfaclions. 

There is alfo a general library, which continues to be well 
furnifhed with books, chiefly in the line of hiftory. 

About 200 of the moft refpe&amp;able inhabitants of the town, 
are afibciated as Volunteers, to bear a part in the defence of 

our 



of Perth. 539 

our conftitution, and the maintenance of peace and good 
order. 

The town has been much enlarged of late years, and new 
ftreets, in which are excellent houfes, have been opened 
in all quarters. If the nation mould profper, thefe will pro- 
bably form at laft a new town, on the ground of the Black- 
friars.

By the Rev* Mr Lewis Dunbar.</head>

<p>

Name, 

THE name feems to have been the fame in ancient and 
modern times, and is probably of Gaelic origin. Some 
who underftand the Gaelic language are of opinion, that the 
etymology of the name Kinnoul, in ancient writing Kynnoule, 
is Ceann-Juil, Ceann fignifies, head or end, in a literal, 
and in a more general acceptation, Principal or Chief; alfo, 
'Terminating Point. Jul of. which Juil is the genetive cafe, 
fignifies a view or profpecl:, in allufion, either to the exten- 
five profpecl: which the fituation of the hill of Kinnoul com- 
mands, or the great diftance at which it may be feen by a 
traveller ; or it may refer to the termination, or rather inter- 
ruption of that range of hills called the Sidley hilis, rifing to 
the fouthward of Forfar in Angus, and falling from their 
height, as they itretch in a wcfterly courfe along the north- 
ern edge of the Carfe of Govvrie, till they rife again fuddenly 
in the hill of Kinnoul, which marks the weftern extremity of 
the Culonade. But the etymology of names is generally mat- 
ter 



of Kittnoul.

ter of mere conjecture. From this place the title of the 
noble and antient family of Kinnoul derives its origin. 

Situation, bfc— This parifh is fituated in the Prefbytery 
and County of Perth, and within the Synod of Perth and 
Stirling. It is of a very irregular form, being interfered in 
different directions, for 3 or 4 miles, by the adjoining parifhes 
of Scone, St Martin's, and Kinfauns. 

That part of the parifh which lies adjacent to the church 
and manfe, is beautifully fituated, on the eaft fide of the river 
Tay, directly oppofite to Perth, and is between a mile and a 
half and 2 miles fquare ; bounded on the north and northeaft, 
by the parifh of Scone ; on the foutheaft and fouth, by the 
parifh of Kinfauns ; and on the weft and fouthweft, by the 
river Tay. The disjoined diftri&amp;s of the parifh will be beft 
known, by examining Stobie's map of Perthfhire, under the 
names, Inchyra, Balthayock, Murrays-hall, and Balbeiggie. 

Soil, Culture, &amp;c. — The foil of this parifh is various. 
Near the Tay, in fome places, it is a ftrong clay, (particular- 
ly at Inchyra), in fome light and gravelly, and in others a good 
loam, and fome part of it has a tilly bottom. Every fort of 
foil has been greatly improved of late ; many fields, which 
formerly were barren and uncultivated, are now, by proper 
culture and management, producing rich crops of all kinds of 
grain. The rapid progrefs of improvement here, as in mofl 
parts of the country, within the laft 20 or 30 years, has 
raifed the value of land amazingly j and were fome of the pre- 
fent leafes expired, the rent of fome farms would be more 
than doubled. The tops of the hills and fuch grounds as 
were reckoned unfit for cultivation, are now covered with 
thriving plantations •, fo that there is not much wafte ground 
in the parifh. The art of hufbandry is now too well under- 

ftood, 



54 2 Statijlical Account 

ftdod, to preferve the abfurd diftinftion of out-field and in- 
field, which formerly prevailed. On the farms which lie 
near to Perth, no ftrid rotation of crops has been obferved ; 
having the command of lime and other manure, by an eafy 
carriage from Perth and Bridge-end, the farmers can keep 
their ground in good heart without it ; but it would certainly 
be better, were they to obferve a regular rotation, as the 
ground would thereby be kept in proper ord^r at a fmaller 
expence ; and it would contribute greatly to their advantage, 
if more attention was paid in cutting down thirties, and other 
weeds around their fields, before they fhed their feed. There 
is not much fummer fallow ufed here ; but the end of a fallow 
is in a good meafure attained by the horfe-hoeing of turnip 
and potatoes, which, when done with attention, effe&amp;ually 
deftroys the annual weeds, and cleans the ground. A great 
deal more grain is raifed in the parifh, than would ferve the 
inhabitants ; and it is generally of an excellent quality, and 
brings a good price in the market. The prices of grain vary 
according to circumfbvnces, and the flare of the preceding 
crops. The feed time commences commonly in March, and 
clofes with May. Wheat is fown from the middle of Sep- 
tember, to the end of October. The harveft generally begins 
about the end of Auguft, or the beginning of September. 
The prefent medium rent of land, may be about L. I : 8 per 
acre ; a few acres near to the church of Kinnoul, are let at 
L. 5 ; others at L. 3 : 3 per acre. Such is the value of land in 
this neighbourhood, that 5 acres, which pay of feu-duty and 
public burdens, about L. 14 per annum; were fold about 9 
years ago, for L. 560. The general contents of the panfli 
are about 2906 Scots acres; of which 2214 are arable and 
pafture lands, a fmall proportion excepted. The remaining 
692 acres are planted chiefly with Scotch fir; intermixed 
with larixes, beech, and other fored trees. Large qualities 



of Kinncul. 543 

of potatoes are planted by fome farmers, which are fold, 
when growing, in fmall lots, to tradefmen and labourers, in 
Perth and Bridge-end, and ufually bring from L. 8, to L. 12 
per acre. Few or no flieep have been kept in the pariOi, fmce 
the hills were planted, and the practice commenced of laying 
down fo much ground with clover, and other green crops. 
The Englifh plough is generally ufed. It is drawn by a pair 
of horfes, and managed by one man without a driver. All 
other implements of hufhandry have of late been greatly im- 
proved. The valued rent of the parifh, is L.4775 : 18 : (5, 
Scots. The real rent may be at prefent about L. 301 7 : 13 : 6, 
including L. 520 for falmon fifliings. 

A confiderable part of the parilh is inclofed with hedges 
of hawthorn, or beech, which makes a fine warm fence, as 
it does not fhed its leaves in the winter} fome part with itone 
fences. 

Air, Climate, and Difeafes — The air is generally pure and 
falubrious ; although in winter, the hoar frofls are fometimes 
very fevere near to the river. The inhabitants are affiided 
with no peculiar difeafes; nor are epidemical infections 
either common or remarkably fatal. Fevers are rare, and are 
commonly of the flow and nervous kind, and chiefly among 
the lower clafs. Rheumatic and afthmatic complaints are 
the moft prevalent, and efpecially among the aged of the 
poorer fort, which is probably owing in a great meafure to 
fcarcity of fuel, and to cold lodging. The famll-pox is the moft 
fatal difeafe among children, as the pradice of inoculation has 
not even yet become general; at times too, the meafles and 
hooping cough carry off many infants, when thole difeafes 
prevail in the neighbourhood. But the people in general, 
enjoy good health, and many of them live to old age, though 
there are few inftanccs among them of remarkable longevity.

Stati/lical Account 



One man died a few years ago, above 100; and 6 are now 
alive, who are above 80. The ague, which was very com- 
mon about 30 years ago, is now fcarcely heard of. But in 
places where this diforder was moft prevalent, and efpecially 
in the Carfe of Gowrie, it is obferved that young people 
are now more liable to confumptions than formerly. The 
jaundice alfo has of late become a more frequent difeafe, 

Rivers, Salmon Fi/Jjing t°fc. — There are no rivers which 
run through this parifh ; the Tay, which wafhes its weftern 
borders, being rather to be confidered as its boundary, than 
as making any part of it, excepting-in one fmall fpot oppofite 
to the church, where this noble river divides itfelf into 2 
parts, and forms a fmall ifland j one half of which is in this 
parifh, and the other in the parifh of Perth. That branch of 
the river which is in this parifh, is called the Willow-gate. 
But that which is next to Perth is the courfe which veffels of 
burden ufually hold, when going to Perth or Bridge-end ; 
but boats and fmall floops often come up the Willow-gate, as 
being a fhorter pafTage. Veffels from 90 to 100 tons burthen, 
can eafily make the fliore of Bridge-end in fpring-tides ; and 
when larger veffels are employed, part of their cargoes are 
taken out (about 2 or 3 miles below Perth) and put into 
boats, which are ufed as lighters, from Perth or Bridge-end. 
It is generally thought, that the Tay difcharges more frefh 
water into the fea, than any other river in great Britain. 
The Tay abounds with excellent falmon, and fine trouts of 
different kinds, which are highly flavoured, and weigh from 2 to 
6 pounds. The greater part of the falmon fifhings on the Tay, 
are rented by a company in Perth, who employ a vail number 
of boats and fifhermen. They feldom espofe their fi(h to fale 
in Scotland, excepting at Perth ; where the price of falmon 
in the fpring is fometimes is, and fometimes 9 d per 1,1m 



of Kinnovl. 545 

and in the fummer months, they are never fold below $d per 
lib. Since the practice of packing falmon in ice has prevailed, 
they are fent frelh to the London market in fmacks, during 
the whole flming feafon, which commences on nth De- 
cember, and clofes on the 26th of Auguft following. Two 
large ice houfes for this purpofe, were built fome years ago 
on the north fide of the church of Kinnoul : all the trouts 
which are caught in the nets, are the property of the fi mer- 
men. The flfnings belonging to this parifii are rented at 
L. 520 per annum. A very particular account of this valuable 
branch of trade having been already publifhed from other 
parifhes in the neighbourhood, it would be improper to extend 
this article farther. 



Nurfery, feV.— About the year 1767, a nurfery was be- 
gun in this parim, by Mr James Dickfon from Haflendean- 
burn, near Hawick. He was foon after fucceeded by his 
brother Mr William Dickfon, and his prefent partner Mr 
James Brown, by whom it has been conducted for upwards 
of 20 years, on a very extenfive fcale, and with that degree 
of fuccefs, to which their induftry and tafte are fo juftly en- 
titled. This nurfery contains between 30 and 40 acres of 
ground, on the eaft bank of the Tay, direaiy oppofite to 
Perth ; for the cultivation of which the number of hands 
varies, according to the exigencies of the feafon ; but at an 
average, more than 40 find conftant employment. The foil 
and expofure of thefe grounds, are both remarkably fitted for 
rearing plants of Inch a vigorous and hardy nature, as are 
fuitable not only to the flickered, but to the expofed liga- 
tions, with which the varied face of the country abounds. 
This nurfery contains all kinds of fruit, and foreft trees, 
evergreen and flowering fhrubs, flower roots and plants, 
which are naturalized to the climate. The proprietors have 

Vol. XVIII. , Z 1

Statiftical Account 



always been particularly careful in the felection and proof of 
the various kinds of fruit-trees, and in confequence of this, 
the demand has been very extenfive. On the nurfery grounds, 
(fouth from the church of Kinnoul,) they have lately erefted 
a large well conftru£ted green-houfe, in which there is not 
only a numerous, but a rich collection of exotic-plants. 
And at their {hop in Perth, they keep a complete afibrtment 
of all kinds of garden, grafs, tree, and flower feeds. Thefe 
various articles, find a ready market, not only in the rick 
adjacent country, but in the more remote parts of Scotland. 
They are even frequently fent to England and Ireland ; for 
which, the many regular opportunities of water-carriage from, 
Perth, particularly to London, and other places in fouth Bri- 
tain, give this nurfery great advantages. The happy effeas of 
the eftablifhment of fuch a branch of trade, are not confined to 
the actual operators, but are confpicuous on the face of the 
whole furrounding country. The plants and trees in our 
gardens and orchards, have been not only increafed in num- 
ber, but improved in quality. Numerous and extenfive 
plantations have been formed, and are all thriving fo well, 
that an example produaive of fo much ornament and utility 
to the country, is every year finding many imitators. 

Bridge-end, and Bridge of Perth,- -The village of bridge-end, 
derives its name from its fituation, being placed at the eaft 
end of the bridge of Perth. 

The old bridge over the Tay, at this place, having been 
carried away by a great flood in the river, in the year 1621, 
the communication between Kinnoul and'Perth, was after- 
wards carried on by means of ferryboats, which were always 
attended with confiderable inconvenience and expence; and 
frequently with great danger. No fewer than 30 boats, and 
as many boat-men, were employed on thii ferry, as U was 
• ons 



of Kinnoul. 547 

one of the moft frequented panes in Scotland. Some of thefe 
boats were occafionally employed as lighters, for vefiels in the 
river. In this ftate, things continued until 1765, when a 
fubfcription for a new bridge was opened, chiefly by the pa- 
tronage of the lateiEarl of Kinnoul, to whofe patriotic exer- 
tions, it is well known, the prefent bridge over the Tay at 
Perth, owed its exiftence. It was reared under his aufpices ; 
he pledged a confiderable part of his private fortune, to carry 
on the work; and it will remain a lading monument, to 
the honour of that great and worthy nobleman. The fub- 
fcription foon amounted to L. 1 1,298 : 17 : 6, of which 
government furnifhed no lefs a fum than L. 4000. 

The foundation ftone was laid on the 13 th September 1766, 
by its principal promoter, the Earl of Kinnoul, in prefence of 
the fheriff- depute of the county, the Provoft and Magiftrates 
of Perth, and feveral other gentlemen, amidft the applaufes of 
thoufands of fpeclators. The bridge was cdmpleated, and the 
laft of the workmen paid off, 13th of November 1 77 1 . The 
Earl of Errol's coach was the firft that palled along the bridge, 
in the winter between 1770 and 1771. The plan was drawn 
by Mr Smeaton architect, and the work executed according to 
his orders, by Meflrs Guyn, Morton, and Jamiefon. The 
bridge confifts of 10 arches, one of which is a land arch. The 
clear water way, is 589 feet 9 inches. The extent of all the 
arches, 730.9. The wing walls, 176. So that the total length 
of the bridge, is 906 feet 9 inches ; and to the credit of the ar- 
chitect and undertakers, it has remained hitherto firm and un- 
fhaken. The utility of this bridge is not confined to Perth and 
its neighbourhood, but extends to the country at large; as all 
are more or lefs concerned in an eafy and fafe communication, 
at fo centrical a fituation, between the northern and fouthern 
parts of Scotland. Several attempts were made at different 
periods, to rebuild the bridge at Perth, but all thefe attempts 

were 



54 s Statiftkal Account 

were deferted, probably from the want of a proper fund to ren- 
der them effectual. The whole expence of the bridge, was 
L. 26.446 : 12 : 3. 

Before the new bridge was built, Bridge end was a poor 
paltry village, confifting of a few houfes, chiefly for the ac- 
commodation of the boatmen and their families. The houfes 
were low built, ill-lighted, and covered with ftraw-thatch ; 
but of late, a better ftyle of building has prevailed, and a 
great addition has been made to the village. Within the lafl 
7 years, no lefs than 31 new houfes have been built, which 
are commodious and well lighted ; which will cherifh a fpiirit 
of cleanlinefs, and contribute materially to the health of the 
inhabitants. Some of the houfes lately built, are rented at 
L. 50, and none of them below L. 9 or L. 1 o per annum. There 
are 98 houfes in the village, and the buildings are flill going 
on ; and perhaps the time is not far diftant, when Bridge-end 
will be an extenfive, populous, and refpedtable village. Some 
gentlemen of confiderable landed property refide in ic ; and 
were fome fpirited manufacturers eftablifhed there, they 
would have the btft opportunity of purchafing linen yarn and 
cloth, going to market, from the Carfe of Gowrie, Coupar of 
Angus, and the Stormount, as the turnpike roads from thefe 
difiricts, all meet in Bridge-end. The Earl of Kinnoul, is 
fupericr of the whole village ; and by his Lordfhip's charter, 
for the baronies of Kinnoul and Pitcullen, he is entitled " to 
*' hold a weekly market every Thurfday, and 4 free fairs in 
" the year; ) on the 15th of May; the 2d on the 12th of 
«' June ; the 3d on the 5th of July ; and- the lad on the 7th of 
" October. By faid charter, alfo the village of Bridge-end, 
" is to be called the burgh of Kinnoul : and the faiis to be 
« held there, or in any other town or place within the rega- 
" lity; with power to erect and build, free fea-ports, harbours,

« the lands of Kinnoul and Pitcullen, or any part thereof 
«' upon the water of Tay." The beautiful villas, built on 
the rifing ground, immediately above Bridge-end, are a con- 
fiderable ornament to the place and neighbourhood. 

Population. — The population of this pariflh, is greatly en- 
creafed within the laft 8 or 10 years, although fome fmall 
crofts have been conjoined, and feveral cottage-houfes defert- 
•ed, which mould naturally have diminilhed the population. 
This increafe of inhabitants is not owing to any manufac- 
tures eftablifhed in the parifli, for there are none ; but it is 
chiefly to be aferibed, to the toll being taken off the bridge of 
Perth ; a circumftance which has induced many tradefmen and 
others, to purchafe ground, and build houfes in the village of 
Bridge-end, who would not otherwife have thought of it ; 
and there is a great probability, that the parifh will (till in- 
creafe, as the village of Bridge-end, from its fituation, pro- 
mifes in time, to become confiderable.

Church of Kinnoul, Manfe and Stipend.— Sir Robert Erfldne-, 
Lord of Erflcine, and great Chamberlain of Scotland, in the 
reign of David Bruce, gave in pure alms to the monaftery of 
Cambufkenneth, the patronage of the church of Kinnoul, 
with fome lands lying in Strathern. He was proprietor of the 
barony of Kinnoul, in which he was fucceeded by Sir Nichol 
Erflcine his fecond fon, It was ufual for the abbeys or monaf- 
t-ries, to retain the redtory tithes of the churches which were 
gifted to them, and to maintain an officiating vicar out of the 
fmall tithes ; but this was not the cafe, with refpett to the 
church of Kinnoul. The monaftery always prefented a reftof 
or parfon, who, in confequence, received the rectory tithes, 
or at leaft, a part of them, as he could agree with the mo- 
naftery. 

The Patron Saint of the Church of Kinnoul, was St Con- 
ftantine. 

" January 4th 15 18 — 19, John Watfon, burgefs of Edin- 
" burgh, fold to his beloved coufm, Mr James Davidfon, 
u Chaplain of the altar of St Ninian, within the parifh church 
" of St Conftantine, the martyr of Kinnoul, a houfe and 
" garden in Perth." 

N. B. Conftantine III. King of Scotland, became a Monk 
among the Culdees at St Andrews. He is denominated Monk 
and Martyr in the Scottifla calendar, and his aniverfary was 
celebrated on the 1 ith day of February.

of Balmuto, in Fife. 

2. Mr Walter Drummond, in the year ijoq, was Dean of 
Dumblane, Parfon of Kinnoul, Clerk of the Regifters and 
Council of Scotland. He was fecond fon of Sit Malcolm 
Drummond of Cargill, and brother of John, the firfl Lord 
Drummond. In the time of the firft Vifcount of Strathallan, 
who wrote the hiftory of the Drummonds, there was a cham- 
ber in the caftle of Drummond, called from him, " Walter's 
M chamber." He was the anceftor of the Drummonds of 
Deanftown. 

3. Mr John Drummond, was fon of the faid Mr Walter. 
He fucceeded him in the Deanry of Dumblane, and in the 
parfonage of Kinnoul. By order of his uncle, the firft Lord 
Drummond, he married, in the year 15 f4, in the church of 
Kinnoul, Margaret Tudor, widow of King James IV. to 
Archibald Douglas, commonly called the great Earl of An- 
gus. The daughter of this marriage, was the Countefs of 
Lennox, mother of Henry Lord Darnly. The Earl of An- 
gus, was a grandfon of Lord Drummond.

Parfons after the Reformation. — Mr William Rynd, De- 
cember 20th, 1560, was appointed by the General Aflem- 
bly minifler of Kinnoul. He was about the fame time, 
chofen rector of the grammar fchool of Perth ; and continu- 
ed in both offices, till his death, February 20th, 1610. Ma- 
ny articles of his public conduct are recorded in the Eccle- 
fiaftical Hiftories of Scotland.

MrNinian Drummond, about 1610, was tranflated from 
fome other parifli, and admitted minifter of Kinnoul. He 
was grandfon of the firft Lord Drummond, and 5th fon of 
Henry Drummond of Riccarton. His two immediately elder 
brothers were Papifts, and, enjoying offices under the Pope, 
refided in foreign parts. His wife was Margaret Crighton, 
daughter to the laird of Lugtown. His fecond fon, Mr Ed- 
ward Drummond, having been for fome years with his Popifh, 
relations in Avignon, and in Rome, was prevailed upon to 
profefs the Popifh religion. But he returned to his own 
country in 1628, and in the year thereafter renounced the 
errors of Popery, and became a Proteftant minifter. Mr 
Ninian Drummond, was greatly refpe£ted in the church. 
He wrote concerning the antiquities of the houfe of Drum- 
mond, and his book was of ufe to the Lord Vifcount Strath- 
allan, when he wrote his hiftory of the Drummonds. He 
died at Kinnoul, April 1635, having arrived at a very old 
age. 

Mr Thomas Halyburton, defcended from a family in An- 
gus, was fettled minifter of Kinnoul, September 16th, 1635. 
He accompanied the Earl of Kinnoul' s children to London iu 

1639, having obtained, from the preftbytery, leave of ab- 
fence. He was tranflated to the church of Errol, February 

1640, and died minifter of Errol, January 1649. 

Mr James Oliphant, was ordained minifter of Kinnoul, 
September 1640. He had ftudied in the Univerfity of St 
Andrews*. He refided much in the family of the Earl of 
Kinnoul j but at laft, promiftd that he would refide more 
conftantly in his own parilh. He was fomecimes under pro-

In 1644, fome of the Irifli, who were ferving under the Marquifs of 
Montrofe, roafted their meat in the parilh church of Kinnoul, and burnt the 
forms or feats which belonged to the Communion Tables.

cefs, before the ecclefiaftical commiffion, and other courts, as 
a malignant againft the folemn league and covenant, andfeems 
indeed to have been all along a well-wifher to the royal caufe. 
In 1649, he preached a fermon, fhewinghow unlawful it was 
for women to pray or to teach in public. But he made ufe 
in this fermon of fome reflections fo fcvere againft women in 
general, as brought him under fome cenfurc. After the King's 
reftoration, in 1660, Mr Oliphant, as might well have been 
expected, conformed to Epifcopacy, and thereby kept poffef- 
iion of his church, till his death, in April 1665. 

Mr Thomas Fowler, fon or grandfon of the aged Mr James 
Fowler, minifter of Kinfauns, was ordained to be minifter of 
Kinnoul, November 28th, 1665. After the Revolution, in 
1689, he was ordered to leave his church, for not conforming 
to prefbytery. His parifhioners, however, being greatly at- 
tached to him, he continued for fome years to evade the exe- 
cution of the fentence. At laft, in 1697, he was obliged, 
wholly to leave his church, and delivered up the kirk-box, 
ar?d above 500 merks in money contained therein. 

Mr Andrew Darling, was tranflated from the parifh of 
Hoddam in the prefbytery of Middlebie, to be minifter of 
Kinnoul, January 19th, 1698. He was a native of the town 
of Galafhiels, in the county of Selkirk. He had been fent as 
a mimonary to affift the prefbytery of Perth, who were then 
very few in number; becaufe many parifhes had refifted the 
introduction of Prefbyterian minifters. His popular talents 
made him of great ufe to the caufe of prefbytery in his own 
parifh and neighbourhood. He died at Kinnoul, in 1731, 
or 32. 

Mr Thomas Ranken fucceeded him in March 1733, and 
continued minifter of Kinnoul, till November 1745 ; when he 
was tranflated to Aberdalgie, which was then a much (mailer 

benefice

benefice than Kinnoul, a circumftance which is not very 
common in tranflations. 

Mr Patrick Bannerman was tranflated from St Madoes, 
and admitted minifter ofKinnoul, 13th November 1746, and 
remained minifter there till November 1760, when he was 
tranflated to the parifh of Salton, in the prefbytery of Had- 
dington. 

Mr Patrick Meik was tranflated from the parifh of Monei- 
dy, to Kinnoul, July 29th, 1761, and died there, 18th 
July 1782; and the prefent incumbent was tranflated from 
the parifh of Dunning, in the prefbytery of Auchterarder, 
and was admitted minifter of Kinnoul on the 7th Novem- 
ber 1782. 

The church was rebuilt in 1779. It is a decent and commo- 
dious houfe of worfhip ; but by much too fmall for accommo- 
dating theparifhioners. Several families have been obliged to 
take feats in the churches of Perth, a circumftance which dimi- 
nifhesthe provifion for the poor which depends on the weekly 
collections of this parifh- The church is beautifully fituated on 
the banks of the Tay, oppofite to Perth ; upon the north fide of 
it, there is an aile, belonging to the family of Kinnoul, and 
which was the burying-place of that noble family, till about 20 
years ago, when a vault was built for that purpofe, on the eaft 
end of the church of Aberdalgie. In 1635, an elegant monu- 
ment was erected on the north wall of the aile,, to the memory 
of chancellor Hay, the firft Earl of Kinnoul •, in the middle of 
which, is a ftatue of his Lordfhip, as large as the life, dreffed 
in his robes as chancellor, and embellifhed with efcutcheons, 
and coats of arms. It is a very ftriking likenefs of that great 
man, if we can judge from the belt portraits of him in Dup- 
plin caflle. There is no infeription on the monument. 

The manfe was built in 1735 -, it has received fome addition 
fince, and has been at different times repaired. The ftipend

wheat; and about L.52 fterling of money, including the 
Communion Elements. The glebe is about 4 acres and a 
half; there is no allowance for grafs. The facrament is dif- 
penfed regularly once a year, at which time, no lefs than be- 
tween 900 and 1000 communicate: a confiderable number 
or them come from the neighbouring parifhes. The collec- 
tions on that occafion amount to about L. 10 : 10 fterling. 
The great number of communicants is chiefly owing to the 
vicinity of Kinnoul to the populous town of Perth. The 
Earl of Kinnoul is patron. An Antiburgher meeting-houfe 
was built about 7 or 8 years ago, on the eaftern extremity of 
this paiifh ; but the people who belong to it have no minifter. 

School and Poor.— For feveral years the parochial fchool 
has been in a flourifhing condition. The number of fcholars 
is much the fame during the fummer and winter; and is fel- 
dom under Co, and fometimes about 80. 

The fchool mafter's falary was lately raifed from 100 to 
200 merks, paid by the heritors ; he has a free houfe and 
garden ; and as precentcr and Seffion clerk, his falary is L. 3 
per annum. The prefent number of fcholars is 65, of whom 
4 read Latin; 20 read Englifh ; 24 learn writing, and 17 
arithmetic The fchool fees per quarter are, for Englifh, is; 
for writing, is6d; for arithmetic, 2S; and for Latin, 2s 6d. 
The fchoolmafter's falary, together with the fchool fees and 
other perquifites may amount to L. 35 fterling; there is 
another fchool in Bridge-end, taught by an Antiburgher Se- 
ceder, which is pretty well attended. 

P(0#\— There are no begging poor in the parifli ; but many 
vagrants retort thither, from every quarter. The funds for

church; the ftated dues for the mort-cloth at burials ; dues 
on marriages ; a voluntary contribution of the heritors and 
pariftiioners, who do not contribute at the church doors, or who 
only attend the church occafionally ; and the intereft of L. 170 
lent out on proper fecurity, by confent of the heritors, at 4f 
percent; amounting at an average, to L. 50 per annum. The 
number of poor upon the parilh roll at prefent is 18, who re- 
ceive weekly from 6d to is 6d, according to their circum- 
ftances. Befides thefe ftated penfioners, many occafional cha- 
rities are given to families in diftrefs ; fome receive payment 
of their houfe-rent ; fome have the fchool-fees of their chil- 
dren paid; and others receive fome coals for the winter. 
When the poor are entered upon the roll, their effe&amp;s at their 
death are fuppofed to belong to the poor's fund ; but very 
little advantage accrues from this, as generally the claims of 
relations for attendance, and the expence of the funeral, is 
more than the effefts of the deceafed will repay. An intima- 
tion is given twice a year to the heritors, to meet with the 
Seflion, to make up a lift of the poor, and provide for their 
maintenance ; although no legal affeflment has been hitherto 
laid on the parifli ; and it is hoped, it will not be found ne- 
ceffary, if non-refiding heritors and others who do not con- 
tribute at the church, or who only attend occafionally, beftow 
their charity, according to their abilities. 

Antiquities.— About a quarter of a mile fouth from the 
church, there is a fmall veftige of the old caftle of Kinnoul. 
Heftor Boethius, takes notice of a curious interview between 
King James the I. and an old lady who refided there. " The 
"ftory, (fays Cant, in his hiftory of Perth), is not altogether 
" improbable. The King was inquifitive; the lady was above 
" 100 years old, and had feen five of die King's predeceffors, 
f befides Wallace the governor. Boece, informs us, that

" loft her fight by old age, (he was feated next to his Majefty, 
" and gave him the hiftory of Wallace and Robert Bruce ; 
" and told him, that {he had feen them both, who were not 
*' only handfome, but very ftrong ; and that Wallace exceed- 
*' ed Robert Bruce in fortitude. The King departed to Perth 
*' well pleafed with the entertainment given him by the lady." 
It is to this ftory, that Adamfon refers, in thefe lines of 
(Book vi.) of his Mufcs Tkrenodie, printed at Edinburgh 163.8. 

" Within this place, a lady did remaine, 
■ " Of great experience, who likewife knew

the bridge of Perth ; and whole lands are on both fides of

of Kinnoul. 559 

At Balthayock, the feat of an ancient family of the Blairs, 
are the remains of an old caftle, the walls of which are al- 
moft entire. It appears to have been a place of confiderable 
ftrength, and bears the marks of great antiquity ; but we arc 
at a lofs to know by whom or at what period it was built, 
as there is no record found to determine it ; and fcarcely any 
traditional account handed down concerning it. It is fituated 
on the top of a den, where many ufeful herbs and rare plants 
are found. The caftle is fuppofed to have belonged to the 
Knights-Templars. 

Hills. — There are 2 hills in this parifli, Kinnoul-hiU and 
the hill of Murray's hall, which are rather different parts of 
the fame ridge of hills, at the diftance of 2 miles from one 
^another ; from which there is one of the moft beautiful and 
extenfive profpe£ls. The hil! of Kinnoul, is the moft remark- 
able. Its height, above the level of the Tay, is 632 feet. 
On the fouth, it is exceedingly fteep, confiding of ragged 
rock, and prefents a very ftriking and formidable appearance. 
It is covered with a thriving plantation, to the very fummit : 
On the north fide of the hill, there is a gradual afcent, through 
a ferpentine walk, by which a carriage can eafily go to the top. 
This is called Montague's walk, from the late Duke of M, 
who was in Scotland when it was formed. 

There are feveral very rare plants to be found on the top of 
ths hill of Kinnoul, among which, are the following : 

Cynoglofum Ojfianale Officinal hounds tongue 

Nrpeta Cataria Cat-mint 

Allium Vineale V; ne Qarlick

This hill has been long famous for the number of pebbles 
found in it, confiding of fine agates, onyx, and a few corne- 
lians. 

There is a fleep and hollow defcent betwixt two tops of the 
hill, which is called the IVindy Goiule. Near to this place, in 
certain pofitions, there is a remarkable echo, that repeats 
above 9 times; and on the face of the hill there is a cave, in 
a fteep part of the rock, which, it is faid, will contain about 
a dozen of men. It is 1 called the Dragon-hole. We are in- 
formed from the ancient recqrds of the kirk-feflion of Perth, 
that during the times of Popery, a great number of people af- 
fembled here, on the 1 ft of May, to celebrate fuperftitious 
games, which the Reformers prohibited under fevere cenfures 
and heavy penalties. There is a tradition among the com- 
mon people, that Sir "William Wallace hid himfelf in this 
hole of the rock, when he abfeonded for fome time. 

Provifions, and Servants Wages, £sV.— «The price of pro- 
vifions has rifen greatly of late years; things in general, 
are at leaft doubled in price, within the laft 20 years. 
Chickens, which were then fold for 2d, are now 4d or 6d 
a piece ; hens, which formerly were fold for 7d or 8d, are 
now from ia to is 3d; eggs are 6d and 7 d the doz. ; beef 

in autumn, is 4^ and in f P rin S $ d ' and fometimes 6d 
per lib.; mutton from 3d*, to 4^ ™ autumn, and 5 d in 
fpring; veal and lamb arc commonly 6d ; all Amfterdam 
weight. A goofe fells at 2s 6d, and 3s; turkeys, at 4s 6d, 
and 5s; all other provifions are in the fame proportion. 
The prices here are regulated by the Perth market. The 
yearly wages of a plough- man have increafed at leaft one 
half fince 1770. At that period a good plough-man could 
have been hired for 4 or 5 guineas ; and now the common 
wages are 9, 10, and fometimes 12 guineas. The wages of 

women 



of KinnouL 56 1 

women fervants, are between L. 3 and L. 4 per annum ; of an 
houfe carpenter a day, is 8d; of a mafon, is 6d and is 8d ; 
of a taylor with vi&amp;uals, 6d or 8d ; and of a common labour- 
er without victuals, is or is 2d. 

Characler of the People.— -The inhabitants of this parifh, 
with a few exceptions, are fober, induftrious, ccconomical, 
and contented with their fituations in life. They are in ge- 
neral, very regular' in their attendance on the ordinances of 
religion : they are ready on every emergency to relieve the 
diftreflss, and alleviate the miferies of their fellow creatures, 
according to their abilities. And although there are different 
religious opinions among them, they live in peace and good 
neighbourhood. 

Roads There are 3 turnpike roads which go through part 

of the parifh ; one leading from Perth to Dundee ; one to 
Cupar of Angus ; and one by Scone to Kinclaven. Thefe 
will prove of great advantage, as the farmer has thereby an 
eafier accefs to lime and other manures, and the product of 
the land is carried to market, at lefs expence and trouble. 
But the benefit derived from good roads, muft (till be partial 
and much limited, while the crofs-roads remain in the mife- 
rable ftate in which they are at prefent, not only in this neigh- 
bourhood, but alfo in many other diltricts, of the country ; 
and it is hoped, that fome method will foon be adopted to 
remove this inconvenience, at leafl in fome meafure. At firft, 
the common people did not relifh the turnpikes j but they are 
nowfenfible of the advantage of them. 



Mifcellaneous Obfcrvatlons . — The number of farms in this 
parifh, is about 27*, more than the half of thefe, are very

foiall, and cannot fupport a family without fome other . 
ployment. The number of heritors is about a3 ; the mod 
part of them are fmall feuars or portioners. Lord Kinnoul is 
the principal heritor : there is no free-ftone quarries in the 
parifh; but there is pi nty of whin ftone, which is very ufe- 
ful for building houfes, and has been of great f-rvice in making 
the turnpike roads in this parifh and neighbourhood. There 
is only i meal mill in the parifh : of late, feveral mills have 
been built for threfhing corn. There is a confiderable brew- 
ery and malting concern in Bridge-end. Laft feafon, there 
was there malted 2008 bolls of barley, which paid of duty, 
L. 761 : 10 :o. There is alfo a fmall tannage, which does a 
good deal of bufinefs ; and about half a year ago, Mr Young, 
a watchmaker, has fet up a new branch of trade ; he makes all 
the mechanical parts of a watch, and fends them to the Lon* 
don market ; he makes none which are fold under L. 25 :5, 
when they are completed. 

This parifli and diftri£t, derivee great advantages from its 
vicinity to Perth, and to the Tay, which is navigable to this 
place. The fuel of this country is coal, a regular fupply of 
which, till of late, was brought in plenty, from the Firth of 
Forth, and fold at a moderate rate. The ordinary price, 
within thefe 6 years, was 3s 2d per boll, which weighs 4© 
ftones ; and the fame quantity now, is 4s, or 4s 6d. The 
late A£l of Parliament, which took off the duty coaft ways, 
has in fome meafure, removed this hardfhip, as many, now 
burn Englifh coal on reafonable terms. Some of the poor in 
this place ufe brum -wood, and fome of them, make a kind of 
peat of culm, or drofs of coals, mixed with cow-dung.

(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 
By the Rev, Mr Gibb.</head>

<p>

Name, 

npHE parifti of Strathblane takes its name from the river 
Blane, which rifes in it, and runs through its whole 
extent. Blanc is a contraction of two Gaelic words, fignify- 
ing warm river. The literal interpretation of the word 
Strathblane, confequently is, " the valley of the warm river j" 
a name fitly appropriated to this parifti, which from its fitua- 
tion, enjoys a peculiarly mild atmofphere. Lying on the 
fouth fide of the Lennox hills, it is fheltered by them from 
the inclement winds of the north ; while the reflection of the 
fun's rays from a light fandy foil, produces an agreeable tem- 
perature of the air at all feafons. 

Skuatioriy Boundaries, &amp;c — Strathblane is fituated in the 
northweft corner of Stirlinglhire, and lies withing the bounds 
of the oommiffariot of Glafgow. In ecclefiaftical matters it 
belongs to the prefbytery of Dumbarton, and fynodof Glafgow 
and Ayr. It is bounded on the eaft, by the parifti of Camp- 

4 B 2 fa, 



5^4 Statijlical Account 

fie ; on the fouth, by the parifhes of Baldernock and New- 
kirkpatrick ; and on the weft and north, by the parifh of Kil- 
Irarn. It lies 10 miles north from Glafgow, 14 eaft by fouth 
from Dunbarfon, and 20 fouthweft from Stirling. Its form 
is an oblong fquare, 5 miles long, and 4 miles broad. 

Soil, and face of the Country. — This parifh may properly be 
diftinguiihed into valley and moor grounds. The valley is 
bounded by high hills on the north, and by a rifing ground on 
the fouth fide of the river, which afcends about one third of 
the height of the oppofite hills. This hanging ground on each 
fide of the river, confifts of a light quick foil, is well culti- 
vated, and produces excellent crops. Toward the weftern 
extremity, the valley widens confulerably ; and the foil there, 
on the level grounds, is clay mixed with a rich earth, depo- 
fked from time to time, by the overflowing of the river. 
This foil is fit to carry heavy crops of any kind of grain. 

The moor runs parallel to the valley, commencing at the 
brink of the rifing ground on the fouth fide of the river, and 
extending in an uneven furface, about a mile and a half in 
breadth. Here the ground defcends into the parifh of New- 
kirkpatrick, w,ith a declivity fimilar to that with which it af- 
cends from the Blane. A great proportion of this confifts of 
heath ; but in many place?, particularly on the fouth border, 
and in the weftern extremity, it is now cultivated, and pro- 
duces crops nearly as rich as thofe in the Strath. The foil 
here, in the parts fufceptible of cultivation, is dry, light, 
and rocky ; and from the return which it makes, when pro- 
perly laboured and manured, gives great encouragement to 
the improver. Befides thefe moor and valley grounds, the 
hills on the north fide of the parifh afford moft excellent paf- 
ture for blatk cattle and fheep. 

The 



of Strathblane. 565 

The general appearance of the country is agreeably piclu- 
refque. Coming from the fouth, the traveller at firft afcends 
from the fertile fields of New-kirkpatrick, into what appears 
an extenfive heath ; but which he no fooner enters, than he 
finds it interfperfed with cultivated fields, and here and there 
obferves a lake of feveral acres. Defcending into the valley, he 
is charmed with the verdure of the country, the mildnefs of the 
air, and the appearance of chearfulnefs and plenty, which is 
difplayed around. Several neat villas fcattered along the bot- 
tom of the hills, and here and there a cafcade precipitating 
its torrent from their fides, enliven and beautify the fcene. 
In fummer, the landfcape is enriched and adorned by the 
luxuriant foliage of the woods with which the hills are fkirted, 
and the whole receives an air of grandeur, from the abrupt 
precipices in which the hills terminate. Toward the weft, 
the hill of Dumgoiack, on the Duntreath eftate, prefents a 
Angular and ftriking appearance. Infulated in the middle of 
the valley, of a conical figure, and compleatly clothed with 
wood, it arrefts the attention ; whilft a {boulder of the oppo- 
fite hill, projecting like the pedeftal of an arch, directs the 
eye, as it were'through an immenfe vifta, to the plains be- 
low, when the whole profpett is bounded by the diftant 
mountains on the fide of Lochlomond. 

Cultivation , and Produce. — For many years paft the farmers 
have paid confiderable attention to the improvement of their 
lands; and perhaps the ftate of agriculture is nearly as far 
advanced as the nature of the foil will admit. Already in- 
clofed, for the mod part dry, and originally quick and fer- 
tile, it requires only to be manured and laboured, in order to 
produce plentifully. The manure chiefly ufed is lime, and 
the opportunity of getting it readily from the neighbouring 
parifhesof Campfie and Baldernock, has caufed it to be gene- 
rally 



5 6 5 Statiftical Account 

rally adopted. The quantity laid on at once is but fmall, 
being 4 chalders per acre ; but this is repeated with equal ad- 
vantage, after two rotations of crops, or every 12th year. 
This fad has been afcertained by undoubted experiment. 
The crops generally raifed, are oats, barley, and gnfs-feeds. 
The ufual rotation, is 2 years pafture, 2 ciops of oats, 2. 
of hay, and then pafture again. The lime is fpread upon 
the pafture grafs, a year previous to ploughing it up for oats. 
This gives it time to incorporate with the mould, and both 
improves the grafs, and meliorates the foil for a future crop, 
to a higher degree than when laid on in the fame year in 
•which the ground is ploughed. The grafs-feeds are fown 
with the fecond crop of oats, in the quantity of half a boll of 
rye-grafs feed, and from 4 to 6 pounds of clover feed to an 
acre. This courfe of cropping is uniformly adhered to, and 
is only varied, in as far as barley is partially introduced for the 
fecond crop of oats. As far as this can be done, it is cer- 
tainly an improvement'on the plan; but as barley only fuc- 
ceeds when the ground is well dunged, the fowing of it can- 
not be extended any farther than the quantity of that manure 
collected in the courfe of the year will admit. 

This method of croping may be thought too fevere, efpe- 
eially the fecond crop of hay, which is very impoverishing. 
But as this article brings a good price, being ufually fold at 
dd per (tone, the farmer depends a good deal upon it for his 
rent-, and it yields ready money the fecond year, without any 
expence of feed or labour ; an object worthy of being attend- 
ed to. 

Of late years, however, the farmer's hopes have in a great 
meafure been fruftrared in this refpect, by the inattention of 
the feed merchants, who have fupplicd them with rye-grafs 
feed, which remains only one year in the ground. The firft 
appearance of this annual feed, caufed a good deal of alarm 

and 



of Strathblane. 567 

and difappointment, and various methods have been adopted, 
to remedy or fupply the defect- Some by preferving and 
collecting the feed of fuch as remained the fecond year, ac- 
quired by degrees, a ftock fufficient for their own fupply. 
Others, by fowing an additional quantity of clover feed, fe- 
cured at leaft, a good bulk of hay the fecond year, though 
inferior in quality to the rye-grafs hay. 

But the hope of an effectual and general relief is now af- 
forded, by the public fpiriced propofals of the Farmers Society 
at Glafgow, who have lately taken the matter into confidera- 
tion. This fociety (of which molt of the farmers in this pa- 
rifh are members), confifts of the moll noted and experienced 
farmers in an extent of country of 15 or 20 miles round Glaf- 
gow. The exertions of fo many men, eminent in their pro- 
feffion, promife to become of general utility. By a private 
fubfcription among themftlves, they have already raifed a 
confiderable fund, from which, they give premiums to emi- 
nence in agricultural exertions or ufeful improvements. 
They alfo aflift fpirited members of their own body, by lend- 
ing them money from their fund, toward carrying ufeful pro- 
jefts into execution. It has been propofed amongft them, to 
commiflion their own grafs-feeds from the beft foreign mar- 
kets ; by this plan if it (ball be carried into execution, they 
will not only fecure the beft in quality, but alfo have a 
faving on the price. W hen imported to the general depot at 
Glafgow, each parilh can conveniently get the quantity alot- 
ted to it conveyed home. It is by turning the attention of the 
inhabitants of a country to fuch ufeful and practical objeas, 
that a nation may expect to become truly great. 

Peafe and beans have been found to thrive well in fcveral 
farms, and one fpirited farmer made lately an experiment of 
a wheat crop, which fucceeded to his wifh. From 2 acres, 
he reaped 32 bolls. The ground indeed was fummer fallow- 



560* Statiflical Account 

ed, and richly dunged. This fuccefs would have encouraged 
him to continue the plan, but the fcanty fupply of dung pre- 
vented him. He therefore now fubftitutes a turnip crop for 
the fummer fallow, and a barley crop for the wheat; and 
from an exact, calculation, he finds he is a gainer by this lat- 
ter method. If this practice fhould become general, it will 
certainly be more profitable than the method at prefent in 
ufe.

Grazing.— Agriculture, however, conftitutes only onebranch 
of the farmers employment in this parifli. The rearing and 
feeding black cattle and fheep, occupy a confiderable {hare of 
their attention. The excellent pafture afforded by the hills, 
which can never be turned to agricultural purpofes, both 
compels and encourages their exertions in the grazing line. 

In this branch, the Hock of milk cows deferves to be firft 
mentioned. This has been brought to a confiderable degree 
of excellence, by the attention which has been given to pro- 
cure bulls of a good kind, and by felecTmg the beft and hand- 
fomeft cows to breed from- Accordingly, the breed is much 
efteemed in the country toward the well and north, and the 
farmers find encouragement to rear as many as they can, to 
anfwer the demand that is made from that quarter. Ihe 
cows reared, are fold when they firft become pregnant 

which 



cf Strathblane. 569 
hich is at 3 years old, and they then bring from L. 5 to L. 6 



w 

each. 



Befides the milk cows or native flock, a confiderable num- 
ber of highland cows are fattened upon each farm. Thefe 
are commonly bought in at the Michaelmafs and Martinmafs 
markets, and wintered upon the farm, with the afliftance of 
a little fodder, from New-year's-day, till the middle of April. 
They are then fed during the following fummer, and fold to t 
the Glafgow and Paifley markets in autumn. At the time 
they are fold, they generally- weigh from 18 to 24. ftones of 
beef and tallow, which brings, at an average, 6s per ftone. 

The fheep ftockconfifts of ewes, which are all of the fhort 
or black faced kind ; which the farmers Jiave taken confide- 
rable care to improve, by feledling the belt rams, and fupply- 
ing the defect of their (lock, with the belt and flouted ewe 
lambs. In addition to this, they alfo buy in from time to 
time, good lambs from thofe parts of the country which are 
famed for keeping good ftocks of fheep. The profits arifing 
from the fteep flock, are chiefly derived from the wool and 
lambs. The fmeared wool fells at 6s per flone, and white 
-wool from 8s to 9s. The lambs bring at an average. 6s each. 
A few of the worfl ewes called Jhotts, are likewife fold every 
year about Martinmafs. 

The ewes are fo managed, as to begin to produce their 
lambs about the 10th of April; the m oft proper feafon on 
high grounds. It fometimes happens, that a number of them 
have twins. When that is the cafe,- the ewes are brought 
down to the low grounds, where the rich paflure enables N 
them to nurfe both. If any e^e happens to lofe her lamb, 
fhe is confined in a houfe, with a twin lamb taken from ano- 
ther, for two nights; by which time, , fhe becomes attached- 
to it, and nurfes it as her own. In the latter end of July, 
the lambs are weaned ; when thofe fcle&amp;ed for keeping un'

the ftock, arc put to a feparate part of the farm, where they 
are kept apart from their dams, till next fummer. The reft 
are either fold for flaughter, or for flocking farms in other 
parts of the country. 

In the month of November the whole ftock is fmeared ; a 
practice which, although it is both expenfive and troublefome, 
is found to be not only neceffary, but beneficial. The falve, 
a mixture of tar and butter, kills the vermin with which fheep 
are infefted, and makes the wool adhere clofely to the animal. 
This contributes both to its comfort during the winter, and 
preferves a better fleece till the feafon of fhearing, than what 
is then found on the white or unfmeared fheep. The wool 
alfo, though not of fo fair a colour as the unfmeared, is yet 
of a better quality. Thefe advantages attendant upon uncar- 
ing, have been afcertained in the moft fatisfa£tory manner, 
by a comparative experiment lately made by a farmer in this 
place. He took 100 lambs of the fame ftock, and divided 
them equally ; taking equal care in every refpe£t of the two 
parcels. He fmeared 50, and left 50 unfmeared. At the 
fheep fhearing feafon, 4 fleeces of thofe that were fmeared, 
weighed a ftone ; whereas, it took 7 fleeces of the unfmear- 
ed to produce the fame weight.., The quality too of this 
jfaft was infcriqr, being coarfe and matted. He perfifted in 
the experiment for 5 years, and the older the fheep grew, 
the preference in favour of the fmeared wool became liiil 
more decided ; till at laft the merchant could fcarcely be 
prevailed upon to take the white wool at the fame price 
with the fmeared. The ewes alfo failed fooner than the 
others ; fo that he gzrve up the attempt, fully convinced of 
the propriety of fmeanng the wool flock. 

The fame entcrprifing fpirit, however, which prompted the 
above experiment, induced him to try others, for reducing 
the exuence of fiuearing. After repeated trials of fundry in- 
gredients 



of Strathblane. 57 1 

gredients mixed with the tar and butter, in order to reduce 
the quantity of thefe eXpenfive articles, he found that butter- 
milk in a certain proportion, produced this effe£l. Thus, 2 
pints of butter milk, added to 6 pints of tar, Scots meafure, 
and 12 pounds Tron, of butter, will fmear 4 fheep more 
than the fame quantity of tar and butter by themfelves. If 
the butter-milk be a week or two old, it is fo much the better. 
It makes the tar and butter incorporate more clofely, renders 
the falve firm, and draws much finer upon the fheep, than 
without it. Befides thefe advantages, the falve thus prepar- 
ed, is fit for immediate ufe ; whereas, without this ingredi- 
ent, it requires to ftand fome days after it is made, before it 
can be ufed. 

The horfes kept in this, parifh, are entirely deftined for the 
purpofes of hufbandry, and a very few are reared for fale. 

A table is fubjoined, fhewing the numbers of each kind o£ 
cattle in the parifh. 

Horfes kept for labour,

This article ought not to be concluded, without taking 
notice of the laudable exertions of Archibald Edmonftone, an 
extenfive grazier on the Duntreath eftate, to introduce im- 
provements in his line. Among many other attempts to 
this purpofe, (to which allufions have oftener than once been 
already made in this account,) he has lately introduced a few 
fheep of the true Spanifh breed into his farm. The only- 
hazard of which he was apprehenfive, was that the inclemen-

57 2 Statijlical Account 

cy of the weather in winter would hurt them. Of this ap- 
prehenfion he has been moft agreeably relieved. They have 
already flood two winters, as well as the reft of his flock ; 
and one of them was the moft fevere, that has been known 
for many feafons. The only precaution which he ufed, was 
to keep them on his low grounds during winter; but in fum- 
mer, they are fond of feeding on the tops of the hills, and 
thrive there as well as the native breed. Their lambs are 
equally hardy as themfelves, and promife to become a great 
acquifition to the country ; the wool being much fuperior to 
any ever known in this place. Each ewe produced L". 4, and 
the ram L. 5, which brought 3s 6d per pound, and was even 
at that price fold much under value. 

Laft year he crofled the breed with the Spanifh ram and 
Scots ewes; and alfo with a Scots ram, and the Spanifh 
ewes ; and this experiment has fucceeded beyond expectation. 
The lambs thus generated, have wool little or nothing infe- 
rior to the old Spanifh fheep, and they may be expected to 
be even hardier than thefe, as being inured to the climate 
from their birth. In fhort, there is not a doubt, if he had a 
fufficient extent of low ground to winter a large ftock upon, 
that Mr Edmonftone would pufh this experiment to a degree 
which might prove highly beneficial to himfelf, to his land- 
lord, and, as Jetting an ufeful example, to the whole country. 

In autumn laft, he alio procured a few Cheviot ewes, 
which he has crofled with his Spanifh ram. It is expected 
this will produce a hardy breed, and improve the wool to a 
It ill greater degree of finenefs, than the crofting with the 
common Scots ewes ; but on the fuccefs of this experiment, 
tune muft be left to decide. 

Manufactures. — Although this parifh cannot boaft of ex- 
teiiiive citabliiLmcnts m manufactures, yet lying in the vici- 
nity

nity of the city of Glafgow, a portion of that fpirit of enter- 
prife, which poflefTes all ranks there, has diffufcd itfelf hither. 
Thr*e bleach fields have lately been ereaed, which employ a 
confiderable number of perfons. Thele belong to companies 
•ftationed at Glafgow, who fend their goods here to be 
bleached. Nothing can excel the foftnefs and purenefs of 
the water for this purpofe, being broken by ruihing frOm the 
hills and precipices, and filtered through beds of the cleaned: 
fand. The ground alfo on the banks of the river, affords 
the moft favourable fituations for fpreading cloth. Confiftmg 
of a warm fandy foil, it contributes towards whitening and 
clearing the goods fooner, and to a more exquifite purenefs, 
than can be done where the foil below is of a clayifh texture. 
The chief employment of one field is bleaching muflins and 
pullicates. The other two belonging to inkle factories in 
Glafgow, are wholly confined to bleaching tapes and yarn. 

Mechanics. — Of thefe weavers conftitute the greateft pro- 
portion, as befides.the employment they get from the country 
people, they are fupplied with abundance of work from the 
manufacturing companies in Glafgow. There are about 22 
looms employed in this manner ; befides 10 inkle looms lately 
fet to work, at one of the bleachfields above mentioned. Of 
other tradefmen, there are 7 taylors, 3 fhoemakers, 3 hofierj, 
3 carpenters, and 1 fmith. 

Population. — There being a great many feuars or fmall he- 
ritors, who refide upon and labour their own lands, this pa- 
rifh has on that account been defs fubjeft to nu&amp;uation in 
its inhabitants, than might otherwife have happened. It has 
however experienced fome changes in this relpecl:. A con- 
l:clerable diminution of numbers has been produced, within 
the laft 20 or 30 years, by the greater proprietors letting out 
3 their 



574 Statiflical Account 

their lands in large farms, which exclude cottagers. On the 
other hand, an' acceffion of 60 or 70, has lately been obtain- 
ed, by the perfons employed at the bleachfields. 

The population as returned to Dr Webtter, in 1755, was 
797- In this prefent year 1795, it is found by an adual 
enumeration, to be 620 fouls.

Poor. — The poor are fupported by the weekly collections at 
the church, and the intereft of a fund amounting to L. 220, 
accumulated by charitable donations from individuals, hav- 
ing property or intereft in the parilh. There are at prefent 
7 perfons on the parilh-roll; 5 of whom receive 5s monthly, 
and the other 2, being bed-rid, receive 10s monthly. Befides 
this allowance, they are fupplied with coals in the winter, 
and for fome of them, their houfe rent is paid. Several 
others, who have not hitherto been admitted on the roll, re- 
ceive fuch occafional aflxftance, as their necelfity requires. 
Thefe diftributions are managed by the Kirk Seflion, without

any e" pence to the fund. To their difcretion alfo, is left 
the apportioning each poor perfon's fupply, and they keep re- 
gular books for the infpe&amp;ion of the heritors. By this ma- 
nagement, the poor' are kept from public begging, a nuifance 
wherever it prevails ; and with which this parifh, notwith- 
ftanding it thus fupports its oMyn poor, is greatly infefted by 
mendicants from other parts. 

Heritors. — The fuperiority of this parifh is veiled in his 
Grace the Duke of Montrofe and Sir Archibald Edmonftone 
Baronet of Duntreath; whofe anceftors, at one time, alfo 
poflefled the whole property of it. In the beginning of laft 
century, that part of it which belonged to the eftates of Mon- 
trofe was chiefly feued out ; the caftle of Mugdock, and the 
park adjoining, being alone retained in the family. The 
eftate of Duntreath, formerly one of the greater baronies, in 
right whereof the proprietors fat in Parliament without elec- 
tion, ttill conftitutes about a third part of the parifh. The 
anceftors of this family, were twice allied to the Royal Fami- 
ly of Scotland. Their laft marriage into it was between Sir 
William Edmonftone, Baronet of Duntreath, and Mary 
Countefs of Angus, daughter -of Robert III. and filter to 
James I. This Princefs lies buried in Strathblane church. 
The prefent Sir Archibald is lineally defcended from both 
alliances. 

There are 9 other heritors, who poflTcfs property in the 
parifh, from L. 100 to L. 250 each; befides i 5 of fmaller 
note, who refidc on, and farm their own lands. The whole 
rental of the parifh, amounts toL. 2500.

deling, prefent a very forry appearance for a place of wor- 
fbip. 

The ftipend hitherto has been 85 bolls of oat-meal, and 
L. 27 : 7 : 1 1 fterling in money.' A new decreet of modifica- 
tion was obtained at the inltance of the prefent incumbent, 
before the Teind Court, in 1793, converting the money into 
grain; which when allocated, will augment the value of 
the living to L 136. His Grace the Duke of Montrofe is 
patron. 

Roads, £5* c. — This parifh is interfered with good roads in 
every direction. Two turnpikes run through it from fouth 
to north, in parallel lines, at 2 miles diftance from each 
other. The one leads from Glafgow to Balfron, and a little 
beyond that village, joins the great military road between 
Stirling and Dumbarton, at the 17th mile- (lone from Stirling. 
The other line leads from Glafgow to Drymen, where it alfo 
joins the military road, at the nth mile from Dumbarton. 
Befides thefe roads, which interfecVthe parifh at right angles, 
there is another which cuts it diagonally, from foutheaft to 
northweft, forming a junction between the Edinburgh road 
near Kilfyth, and the above-mentioned military road at Dry- 
men bridge. The weftern part of this line, which was for- 
merly impaffible, is juft now converted into an excellent 
turnpike road. If the bridge over the Leven at the mouth of 
Lochlomond, which is at prefent in contemplation, be built, 
the ftraight road from the weft highlands to Edinburgh, will 
run through Strathblane, thereby avoiding the compafs by 
Stirling on the one hand, and by Glafgow on the other. 
To thefe advantages, it will add that of being more level, 
there being no fenfible afcent from the Leven, to Kilfyth. 
All thefe roads h'ave received very material improvements 
within the laft 6 years. From being fo fteep and rugged,

that a horfe could not draw half a load upon them, they 
are now rendered fmooth and level, to that a carriage of any 
weight may pafs with cafe* This improvement we owe to 
Robert Dunmore of Ballendalloch Efqr, the original mover 
of it ; a gentleman to whofe public fpirited exertions this dif- 
tricl: of country {lands indebted for many real and permanent 
advantages. 

There are many bridges over the ftreams which fall from 
the mountains; but none of any note. They all confift of t 
arch, of about 12 feet fpan. Of thefe, there are 7 within 
the parifh, which render the communication eafy and fafe at 
all times. 

Wells, Lakes, &amp;c The hills, which form the northern 

boundary of the parifh, conftitute part of that range anciently 
known by the name of tc the Lennox hills." In former times, 
the noble family of that name had extenfive pofleffions in 
this part of the country; and the diftric~r. itfelf was denomi- 
nated Lennox. The fhire itfelf is now partitioned between 
the counties of Dumbarton and Stirling; but the range of 
hills will tranfmit the name to pofterity. 

The i( Lennox hills" reach from Dumbarton to Stirling, 
beyond which the range is continued from the Forth to the 
Tay, under the name of the Ochils. Throughout the whole, 
ftupenduous piles of bafaltic rocks are found. In Fintry, which 
lies in the midlt of this range, about 8 miles eaftward, a 
moft magnificent colonade of thefe pillars prefents itfelf; of 
which a particular defcription is given in the Statiftical Ac- 
count of that parifh. In this parifh, the front of a precipice 
for the fpace of a furlong is lined with ftately columns of 
the fame kind. They confiit of 4, 5, and 6 fides, are from 
2 to 3 feet in diametsr, and 30 feet high. They rife from 
the horizon with a little inclination from the perpendicular,

and fome of them are apparently bent in a fegment of a curve 
line. 

The higheft hill in the parifh is the Earl's feat, elevated 
above the reft of the range, with a conical top. Here the 
Blane has its fource, whence it runs in a fouthweft direction 
for 3 miles, and is then precipitated from the fouth fide of 
the hill, over feveral very high falls. The moft remarkable 
of thefe is the fpout of Ballagan, a cafcade of 70 feet. This, 
when the river is fwelled, puts on a very grand appearance. 
Leaving the fpout, the Blane turns due weft ; when after 
running 8 miles in this direction, it lofes itfelf in the Endrick, 
which falls into Lochlomond. It may here be obferved, that 
the Blane, with the whole diftri£t through which it runs, 
has been omitted to be marked in Ainflie's map of Scotland. 

At the fpout of Ballagan a very remarkable feftion of the 
hill is prefented. The fide of it, cut perpendicularly by the 
water, difcovers no fewer than 192 alternate ftrata of earth 
and lime-ftone. Near the bottom of the fection are found 
feveral thin ftrata of alabafter of the pureft white. There 
were found alfo near the fame place, among the rubbifh 
thrown up by the river in a late inundation, fome fragments 
of antimony, which when tried by a chemical procefs, turned 
out to be very rich fpecimens. The fource however, whence 
thefe were dug, has not been difcovered. If it fhall be 
found, it may probably prove a valuable mine. 

There are 6 lakes in the parifh, the largeft of which does 
not exceed half a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile in 
breadth. Thefe lie in the moor-land part of the parifh, and 
contribute to render that a chearful profpe£t, which would 
otherwife be bleak and dull. They abound with pike, 
perch, and trout. They are alfo frequented by wild ducks, 
and other aquatic fowls. In the Blane likewife, there are 

plenty 



of Strathblane. 579 

plenty of Cmall and fome large trout ; and falmon make their 
way up in confiderable numbers, at fpawning time. 

Buildings.— 'The caftles of Mugdock and Duntreath, efpe- 
cially the former, have been anciently places of confiderable 
ftrength. There is no tradition concerning the time when 
they were built ; nor do they bear any infeription from which 
that can be ascertained. Their conltru&amp;ion, however, deter- 
mines them to have been built about the fame time, and for 
the like purpofe, with many others of the kind in Scotland, 
viz. to defend the chieftains who poflefled them from the 
fudden incurfions of a hoftile or enraged neighbour. The 
caftle of Mugdock feems to have been a regular fortification. 
Covered on the eaft and north by a lake, the waters of which 
were drawn around it by a ditch, whereof the fcite is ftill 
apparent ; it mud have been inacceflible to any force, which 
could be .brought againft it iu thofe days. The fquare tower 
which is ftill entire, has fomething peculiar in its conftruc- 
tion. After rifing to the height of the outer wall, the weft 
and fouth fides of it fpread fo as to form an obtufe angle at 
the corner, over the great arched gate-way. This would ap- 
pear to have been done with a view of more eafily obferving 
from within the motions of an affailant. By this conftruc- 
tion alfo, miflive weapons might be difcharged from both 
thofe fides of the tower, upon an enemy approaching the 
gate. 

Oppofite to this tower, at the diftance of 300 yards, is 
heard a very extraordinary echo. It repeats any fentence of 
6 fyllables, in the exa£t tone, and with the very accent, in 
which it is uttered ; waiting deliberately till the fentence is 
finiihed, before it begins ; and it will reverberate even a 
whifper.

Trees.— Two oak trees adjoining to the public road at Blar- 
quhofh, in the weftern extremity of the parifb, attract the 
notice of paiTengers, as being unufually large in this part of 
the country. The trunk of the largeft, meafures 15 feet in 
circumference, and its branches form the radii of a circle 30 
yards in diameter. As the public road pafles underneath it, 
it falls within the notice of every traveller. The other grows 
near it, and though not quite fo large, is a more beautiful 
tree, having a taller trunk, and being more clofely covered 
with foliage. 

Inundations* — Owing to the vicinity of the hills which at- 
tract the clouds, the Blane is frequently fubject to fudden 
fwellings. It has however, only rifen twice to an alarming 
height, withing the memory of perfons now living. About 
Co years ago, a water fpout is faid to have burft at its fource ; 
which poured fuch a torrent from the hill, as threatened 
unavoidable deftruction to the plains below. Happily how- 
ever, as the Blane falls into ths valley, at a place whence it 
declines to both the eaft and weft, the waters, burfting from 
their accuftomed channel, were difcharged eaftward. By 
this circumftance, the country was faved at that time, from 
the effects of the deluge. The waters turning in this direc- 
tion, where the valley ia wide and level, they ftagnated upon 
it. Here alfo, they could do little damage, the ground to- 
ward the eafl. for 2 miles being marfhy. 

The accounts, however, which old people gave of the mag, 
jiitude of that inundation, were fuch as appeared fabulous; 
till they were again formidably exemplified, during a thunder 
itorm on the 13th of Auguft laft, 1795. About 8 o'clock on 
the evening of that day, the clouds which during the after- 
noon had hung in threatening afpecl around the fkirts of the 
horizon, were condenfed above the Earl's feat. , Here they

burft, and fell, as was evident from the effeds, in entire 
(beets. The fpout of Ballagan appeared as an opening, 
whence the bowels of the mountain were ifluing in water : 
reaching the plain, the torrent burft the banks of the river on 
each fide, and difcharged itfelf in nearly equal quantites to 
the eaft and weft. That which run weft, tore up every thing 
before it. Corn fields were laid wafte. Oats, barley, and - 
potatoes, were destroyed to a great amount. Much damage 
was done to the bleachfields below. It carried ftones of 3 
tons weight a confiderable way into the open field. At one 
place, it forced a parTage for itfelf along the public road, 
which it tore up like the channel of a river. In fhort, it pre- 
fented fuch a fcene of devaftation, as muft appear incredible 
to thofe who have not feen it. It is computed, that there 
was at leaft 6 times the quantity of water ever feen in the 
river, during the greateft ufual floods ; and had it not been 
for the circumftance of a part being difcharged to the eaft, it 
would have fwept the houfes fituated on its banks before it. 
It lafted 4 hours, during which time, the thunder and light- 
ening were tremenduous. 

Hijiorical Anecdotes. — The name of Rob Roy M'Gregor, a 
famous Highland free-booter, is familiar to every inhabitant 
of this part of Scotland. The depredations which he and his 
defcendants committed are ft ill related with wonder. The 
following copy of an order of the Juftices of the Peace, met 
' in quarter feffion at Stirling, a little after the middle of laft 
century, will fliow the manner in which he held the country 
under contribution. It is taken verbatim from the original 
manufcript, fent at that time to be publifhed at the kirk of 
Strathblane.

Sure them againfi: the depreciations of a banditti employed by 
himfelf to plunder. And as he poffefled power enough to 
overawe even juftice itfelf, it is not to be wondered at, that 
he obtained fuch an order in his own behalf. Such an inci- 
dent fhould reach us to fet a high value upon the happy privi- 
leges which we enjoy under a mild and fafe government. 

About 2 years ago, a number of old coins were found in 
this parifh, inclofed in a log of wood. They confided of 
crowns, half crowns, and (hillings of Elizabeth, James I. of 
England, and Charles I. A few gold coins were alfo found 
amongft them, and fome Dutch ducatoons ; the value of the 
whole might amount to L. 40 fterling. The log was about a 
foot and a half fquare. A fmall triangular opening was cut 
into the furface of one of the fides; by this aperture, the log 
had been excavated, and the treafure depofited. It was then 
clofed up with a piece of wood, neatly fitted to the place, and 
fattened with wooden pegs. As none of the coins bear a 
later date than the reign of Charles I. they muft have been 
concealed during the troubles which preceded or fucceeded, 
the death of that monarch. 

The hiftory of the log itfelf is fomewhat fingular. It can 
be traced back for 40 years. At that time, it is remembered 
to have ferved as a prop to the end of a bench in a fchool- 
houfe, near the church. Afterwards, it was ufed as a play 
thing by children, who amufed themfelves with carrying it to 
the top of a declivity, whence it rolled to the bottom. It 
then lay many years on the wall of the churchward. At laft, 
it was appropriated by a crazy old woman, a pauper, who 
lived in a hut by herfclf. She ufed it as a feat for above a 
dozen of years. She dying, a neighbour was employed to 
warn the clothes that were found in her houfe. As fuel was 
fcarce, the log was laid on the fire to heat water for that pur- 
pofe ; it not burning quickly, the walher woman took it off,

and proceeded to cleave it with a hatchet. At the firft ftroke, 
the treafure came out and was fecured by the woman, who 
perceiving the value, wiflied to conceal it. In a few days 
however, it was divulged. But the woman's hufband, who 
was a worthlefs fellow, got hold of it, and decamped with the 
whole amount \ a few pieces excepted, which he had previ- 
oufly fold. He has not fince been feen in the country, and

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011960">LEUCHARS</name> 
(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Mr Kettle.</head>
<p>

Name, Situation, Soil, l°fc. 

T EUCHARS, if derived from the Celtic language, is faid 
by fome, to fignify a wet flat; by others, a place 
abounding withrufhes; either, or both interpretations faith- 
fully defer ibe the appearance which the furface made fome 
years ago, a great way to the northeaft, and a little to the 
fouthweft of this village. The diftria is of large extent 
from weft to eaft, and from fouthweft to northeaft, more 
than 9 ftatute miles, and more than 5 miles broad, at two 
different parts of the parifh, conGderably diftant from each 
other. The meafurement by Mr William Innes now lies 
before me. 

The figure of the parifh is completely irregular, being 
bounded on the northeaft, eaft, and foutheaft, 'by the Ger- 
man ocean, and the various windings of the river Eden on 
thefouth, and fouthweft; on the other parts by the neigh- 
bouring parifhes. It is affirmed with truth, that within the 
bounds of this diftrift, every foil known in this country is to

be found: blue, white, and red clays, ftrong and weak, 
fliarp lands, loam of various depth and ftrength ; a mixture 
of loam and clay, light lands, mofs, heath and bent in no 
fmall quantities. Be»f6re Sir David Carnegie fold part of the 
lordfhip of Leuchars, he employed a number of workmen to 
cut a large drain of 3 miles long, palling through the weft 
end of the village of Leuchars, that the furface on each fide 
of it might be turned into more important ufes. The Hen. 
Robert Lindfay bought this part of the lordfhip before the 
effe£t of the drain was fully proved. Mr Lindfay found himfelf 
under the neceflity, at no fmall expence, confiderably to enlarge 
the former drain, and thereby rendered it effectual for relieving 
the flat- grounds of the water through which it parted. Many 
acres formerly covered with coarfe grafs and rufhes, and about 
36 acres fouth and weft of Leuchars, covered with water to a 
confiderable depth in the winter feafon, and not free from wa- 
ter in the fummer, are now producing abundant crops of all 
kinds of grain, clover, turnip, and cabbage. Thefe grounds 
are let from 14s to L. 1 : 16 per acre ; yielding a profitable re- 
turn to the generous landlord, and affording the labourers hope, 
that their expence and induftry may not he altogether unre- 
warded. Of the many remaining acres to the north and 
northeaft, fome are highly improved, and others in a ftate of 
preparation for fimilar crops'. Thefe circumftance's are motives 
which fhould prompt to exertion' in all fimilar filiations in 
Scotland; but are by no means, to thofe who wifh well to 
mankind, the moft important motives for draining water from 
the neighbourhood of villages. . Before the above drain (of 20 
feet wide, and 14 deep, for a confiderable way above the 
outlet) was cut, the families who lived near the ftagnant wa- 
ter, were fubjea in the fpring and end of autumn, to inter- 
mitting fevers of very long continuance; from 23 to 33, and 
fometimes to 3 9 days. Whole families were to be feen in 

iucn

fuch diftjefc at the fame time, that no one could affift the 
others. They depended on the kind miniftrations of their 
neighbours, for the fuppiy of their ncceuuies. Often has 
the poor's fund been employed, to pay women to wait upon 
fuch diftrefied families; and it is hoped, it will not be looked 
upon as a proftitution of that facred fund. Since thefe ftag- 
nant waters were completely drained, thofe difeafes and the 
fad train of complaints connected with them, have happily been m 
unknown; meanwhile, it is fuppofeable, , that the fame hap- 
py effeds rauft flow from the fame caufes in every part of the 
country, and fhould prove an irrefiftable motive to draining, 
independent of the profit or fatisfaftion refusing from it. 
It is not eafy to d.fcribe the pleafure of viewing luxuriant 
crops, adorning the place where the eye had been accuftom- 
ed to fee ftagnant water and noxious vapour 'impregnated 
with difeafes and death. 

Agriculture.— The culture of this parifh is conducted by a 
fober well informed perfevering and wealthy tenantry. No 
expence or labour is withheld. Every exertion is made to 
beftow whatever is thought neceffary, under the providence 
•of a gracious God, to. aid the fertility of the foil. All chilling 
moifture is led away, and the plough is made to return till 
the roots of every weed are deftroyed. Every meliorating 
crop has its due rotation. Lime, that genial pulverizer, that 
give's healthy fermentation, is brought by water from England 
and Scotland, and from lime-kilns in the neighbourhood by 
land carriage, and thrown with unfparing liberality upon the 
fertile bofom of the earth. 

A very confiderabl- quantity of wheat is annually raifed in 
thisdiftricl, although feveral of the tenants have been unwilling 
to mention the exact number of bolls they fow ; by their own ■ 
account, there were 649 bolls fown in 1790; and in 179 , 

4 E z "' 670 



5 8 8 StatijHcbl Account 

6,70 bolls were fown. I believe that the fowing of wheat is 
upon the increafe in this panto ; and although I do not pre- 
fume to be a judge, I have an apprehenfion, that it may be 
carried too far. 

Confiderable quantities of wheat, barley, peafe, and beans, 
are annually exported from this diftria ; fevtral hundred 
tolls of oats, and fometimes of potatoes; but the exported 
potatoes as far as I know, never turn to great account, which 
has in fome meafure cooled the ardour of exporting this va- 
luable part of the produce. Flax is alfo raifed ; but not in 
fuch quantities as to compete for premiums. It is thought 
a fevere crop, and there is feldom more fown than what is 
neceffary for the ufe of the families, or in order to induce 
labourers to engage for the harveft. The tenant gives 10 
yards fquare to fow one lippy of lint-feed. Some tenants al- 
low two lippies to each of their labourers. Formerly, the 
land here was ploughed by 4 and 6 oxen, and 2, fometimes 
4 horfes before them all, yoke fellows in a large Scots 
plough. The ground is now ploughed with a horfes, in a 
chain plough made upon Small's conftru&amp;ion. The horfes 
are guided, and the plough directed by one man. Here may 
be one or two of the tenants who ufe 2 oxen and 2 horfes in 
1 plough, and one tenant who has 2 oxen without horfes, in 
1 or 2 of his ploughs. If it was proper for the writer of thefe 
ia£ts to give his own opinion, he would be inclined to approve 
of and reco:r,mend the laft practice, efpecially in large farms. 
Every tenant fows a confiderable field of clover, in proportion 
to the extent of his farm, or the neceffities of his flock. On 
every farm, turnips are raifed in fmaller or greater fields, as 
they are intended for the cows and young Itock only, or for 
fuch as are fed for the knife. There is no great attention 
given to a peculiar breed of cattle in this fliftVift ; becauTe 
the cultivated lands are thought too valuable, and the weaker 

and

and uncultivated, infufficient for raifing cattle of bone. The 
Fife cattle, however, always bring good prices in the market ; 
and I believe it will not be W\A that the cattle of this parifh arc 
inferior to thofe of, the other parts of the country. Cabbages 
and greens are alfo planted in the fields, but in fmall quanti- 
ties by the fide of the turnip, to be ufed when froft renders 
the turnip more difficult to be obtained. Potatoes, that make 
fo great a part of the food of the lower chfTes of fociety, arc 
cultivated by every one who rents land, for the ufe of his fami- 
ly, horfes, cows and hogs. They are in general ufed for the 
lad 3 animals without boiling. The tenants give 10 yards 
fquare or 12 for planting a peck of potatoes to the manufacr 
turers and other labouring people, for fo many days work in 
harveff, or any other throng feafon ; wifely thinking that 
this is preferable to money, as it procures them hands in the 
time of their need. Much ufeful information concerning the 
culture and prefervation of this invaluable root has been 
lately obtained, by means of the benevolent exertions of the 
Board of Agriculture. 

I know not if the following obfervations have been made. 
Many caufes for the curie-top amongft potatoes have been af- 
figned, that mankind might avoid this devourer of fo valuable 
a part of their food. When that part of the potatoe is cut 
for a fet which the former year adhered to its root, it invari- 
ably produces a curie- top. It would be of no fmall confe- 
quence, therefore, before the feed is cut into fets, that a 
careful hand fhould be employed to cut off this part of every 
potatoe, and keep it entirely feparate from the feed. When 
there is too little of the potatoe left af the bottom of the eye, 
that is feparaced for a fet, it has the fame unhappy confe- 
quence. This year has led men of obfervation to conclude, 
that wet land produces the curie- top. There are two very Jong 
rid 2 es m a field near this place, planted with the fame culture,

manure, and feed : the one ridge is rather lower and flatter 
than the other. In this ridge, there is not one plant of an 
hundred found. In the other ridge, the 4 rows lying neardfc 
the furrow on each fide of the ridge, are curie-tops, with very 
few exceptions the 4 rows on the higheft part of the ridge, 
are healthy vigorous plants. I know no way of accounting 
for this, but by faying that the excefs of moifture has produ- 
ced it. 

There were in this diftri&amp; in 1792, more than 1559 
cattle young and old, male and female. There were 
420 horfes of the above defcription, and of fheep, 1940. 
The tenants breed their own cows, and moft of them their 
working horfes. There are in this pariflb 7 threfhing milns, 
and their, number will foon be increafed. One of thefe is let 
and kept in motion by water, a very confiderable faving to the 
tenant ; and the machine, one would think, muft move more 
fleadily, and with greater effe£t, than thofe worked with hor- 
fes. Some indeed have made ufe of oxen and horfes ; but 
thefe animals have fo different a movement, that the practice 
has not become general. It is to be hoped, that oxen will be 
trained for this ufeful inftrument of hufbandry ; and there can 
be little doubt, that in fome fituations and circumftances, it 
might be worked by the force of wind. There are 4 meal 
milns in the diftria ; one lint and barley mill, moved by one 
water wheel; and one belonging to a dyer for the purpoi^s of 
his employment. 

There are 3 bridges in the parifh, all of them over the 
Multree burn ; one of them giving paffage to travellers from 
Cupar to the north, and the other to travellers from the north 
to St Andrews : one end of the Guard bridge refts on this 
parifh ; the other on the parifh of St Andrews. 

On this end of the bridge is erefted the only toll-gate within

the bounds of the diftrift. There are 50 tenants in the pa- 
Tifh.' The extent of their farms is very different ; from 10 to 
500 acres. Thofe of the laft mentioned extent are in the 
eaffc part of the parifhJ The land lets at from 10s to 50s an 
acre, excepting thofe extenfive farms in the eaft part of 
the parifh ; which are rented at from L. 40 to between L. 60 
and L. 70. 

Heritors, Improvements, &amp;c — There are 16 heritors in the 
diftric"t, 14 of whom do not refide ; a very material lofs to the 
poor, and no fmall difadvantage to the inhabitants, as their 
refidence would give real encouragement to the induftrious, 
and a ferious check to thofe few who in every fociety are in- 
clined to be diforderly in their manners and practice. In the 
year 1782, we received no affiftance from the heritors for 
the fupport of the poor, and were more than once obliged to 
borrow from the members of the Seffion ; being unwilling to 
diminifh any little fum we had been enabled in more plentiful 
years to lay up for the purpofe of increafing the poor's annual 
income. For fome years pad indeed the heritors have at- 
tended with a fpirit of liberality to the neeeffities of the poor ; 
and we cannot entertain a doubt, that their benevolence will 
always be in proportion to the circumftances of the parifh. 
On that part of the eftate of Leuchars, purchafed by the Hon, 
Robert Lindfay, containing 3736 acres, ftands part of an old 
houfe, commonly called the caftle of Leuchars, built upon a 
forced bank of earth, on the edge of a fwamp, furrounded by 
a deep and broad moat, inclofing about 3 acres of ground. 
In the time of our forefathers, this muft have been a place of 
defence, having no accefs but by a narrow bridge, till the 
large drain was cut, which has rendered it acceffible on all 
fides up to the moat. There is a draw- well in the middle of 

the

•the court, which, to the aitonifament of thofe who lived there 
fome year? ago, became dry when the water was.letoutof 
the moat, for the purpofe of Wing it. The workmen 
came at laft upon the mouth of .a covered drain, which they 
found on a level with the bottom of the well ; and upon going 
down into the well, they difcovcred the fame drain open 
there; from which they were naturally led to think, that the 
inhabitants had been fuppiied with water from the moat with- 
out, when furrounded by an enemy. 

On this cftatt, alfo are fome fine old trees. 
Mr Lin d fay has planted i38 acres with various kinds of 
timber; the plantation is in the mod thriving ftate, and gives 
a molt delightful reft to the eye, where once there was no- 
thing to be feen, but a moor producing fome coarfe grafs, 
heath, and furze. The traveller too, is pleafed with the va- 
riety of nature's luxuriant productions. Mr Lindfay has alfa 
inclofed feveral fields with ditch, hedge, and dyke; and 
hedge rows of trees. Thefe will in a fhort time, {belter and 
beautify the diftrict. In the meantime, they pleafingly em- 
ploy the. imagination in anticipating what their maturity may 
produce. On the eltate of Leuchars, have been built 5 farm 
fteadings, fuitable to, and convenient for the different farms, 
where the tenants are lodged, if not elegantly, yet with fuit- 
able conveniency. The proprietor has alfo feued ground to 
the manufafturers and others, for building a houfe, and a 
fmall garden at the back of it, at the rate of L. 4 per acre. 
So that the village of Leuehars, in place of being literally 
the village built with turfs, i,s become a neat country village 
built with (tones and mortar ; the houfes at leaft are com- 
modious for manufacturers. There are more than 70 new 
houfes built in this village, within a few years ; 8 of them 
have 2 floors, and 4 of them are covered with blue flates.

On the eftate of Eari's-hall, belonging to Robert Bruce 
Henderfon, Efq. Advocate, are a few old trees. On this 
eftate is built one of the moft extenfive farm (leadings in the 
parifli. Thefe two eftates, once were in what is called run- 
rig, two ridges belonging to Leuchars, one to Earl's-hall. 
This mode of divifion, while it may feem to fecure to each 
proprietor his proportion of good and bad land, mull be at!-, 
tended with the moft unhappy effects, as it drags the wheels 
of improvement, and expofes the labourers to no inconfide- 
rable temptations. 

On the eftate of Pitcullo, belonging to Neil Fergufon, Efq.~ 
Advocate, are fome very fine old timber, and feveral fine 
thriving clumps of young trees.. Here are more inclofures, 
both with ftones and lime, and a greater number of old hedges 
with rows of trees within, than on any eftate in the diftrict ; 
here indeed were made the firft improvements in agriculture 
and inclofing. On this eftate alfo,- are two fubftantial new 
farm tofts. 

On the eftate of Ardit, the property of John Anftruther, 
Efq. Advocate, are alfo to be feen fome fine old trees, hedges 
and clumps rifing. Thefe two eftates on the weft fide of the 
parifli, as they rife above the flat ground on the eaft, afford . 
an agreeable and pleafing variety to the traveller, from Cupar 
to St Andrews, from Cupar to Dundee, or from either of 
thefe burghs to Cupar. 

On the eftate 6f Drone, belonging to Robert Meldrum 
Efq. of Clayton, there are more than 20 acres planted; 
fome 20, fome 7 years old; and within thefe 5 or 6 yearsi 
about 10 acres were planted with great tafte, in different di- 
rea.ons, from the houfe of Clayton, that will greatly beautify 
the fituation of that building. Here a lf 0 are two excellent 
farm fteads. There are 8 acres planted on the eftate of Pit-

timber. This eftate is inclofed with ditch and hedge, and 
hedge rows of different ages, which both give beauty and 
warmth to the fields. 

In the garden belonging to Pitlethie, once flood one of the 
hunting feats of James the VI. King of Scotland which had 
been taken down to a little below the furface, and thus ren- 
dered invifible. In digging this garden, the fpade rung 
againft a firm ftone, and as {tones are valuable here, upon 
removing the earth, the foundation of this hunting feat was 
discovered to a great depth and thicknefs. This was carefully 
raifed, and a great part of Mr Lawfon's houfe and offices 
was built from this quarry. Here too, were found the 
Royal Arms of Scotland, cut in a ftone, which is ftill pre- 
ferved, being placed in the front of one of the houfes. In a 
field, near the houfe of Pitlethie, grows a venerable fpread- 
ing thorn, where his Majefly's hawks after their toils, wer^ 
accuftomed to refrefh themfelves through the night. 

Sheughy-dyke, qr Tentsmuirs, is a very large flat part of 
the diftridt. on the eaft ; about which many wonderful ftories 
have been told, concerning the original inhabitants, and the 
peculiarity of their manners. After the mofl laborious en- 
quiry, I find no reafon to conclude, according to general re- 
port, that this part of the parifh was peopled by the crews of 
a Danifh fleet wrecked on the coaft. I prefume, that the 
greatefl part of this flat, moory, benty, fandy ground, has 
been left by the gradual retiring of the fea, , The fea has been 
rnaking a gradual retreat from that part of the parifh, for 
many years paft, and has left what feems to me ftrong proofs 
pf having once flowed and ebbed on thofe grounds. The 
name feems to have been founded in that caution and ccco- 
jiomy with which men take pofleflion of property they are 
riot fure of holding; for when the people took their ftation 
$he fea formerly made her furrowed hed, they mult

have entertained a fear, that (he would in fome future ftorm, 
return and occupy thofe parts (he had been accuftomed to 
travel over. They did not at firft therefore build houfes, but 
ere&amp;ed tents on thofe parts that fwelled a little above the 
furrounding flats ; and to make the fituation of their tents 
more comfortable and dry, they dug a fheugh or ditch, laying 
the fod, and calling the earth inwards ; hence feems to be 
derived the name Sheughy-dyke. The tent ere&amp;ed in the 
middle gave rife to the other name Tents-moors. 

When thefe moors have been opened by digging, there has 
been found in fevsral places, a greater variety of (hells, and 
filh-bones, than could be reafonably fuppofed to fall from the 
tables of thofe tent'dwelling inhabitants ; and feem to lead 
the mind to conclude, that the aged and ftorm-ftruck inhabi- 
tants of the ocean being warned co the more, obtained a grave 
by the next tide covering them with fand. There afe like- 
wife in thefe moors 4 long beautiful canals. Thofe who 
cfpoufe the idea of peopling this part of the diftrift with (hip- 
wrecked Danes, fay, that thefe canals were formed by thofe 
foreigners, to defend themfeives from the inhabitants of the 
furrounding country. I fhall not fay, how improbable this 
account appears. Thefe canals feem to give no countenance 
to fuch art aflertion. The moft extended of them is not 2 miles 
long ; and there is a great fpace of flat ground between the 
north end of them and the river Tay : the fouth end of them 
and the river Eden, confequently could form no defence. 
But, fuppofing they could have done fo, would it not have 
been eafy for the Scots, to fail from the Forth and Tay, dif- 
embark on their rear, while their land forces attacked them 
in front ? Thefe canals do not polTefs depth of water to ren- 
der them the leaft defence. They feem to have been formed 
by the retiring ocean. There are 4 long, broad, beautiful,

Toremont, and Tcnts-muir, or Big waters. I obferve this 
year, that the tenants are cutting drains, and letting the wa- 
ter out of thefe canals, to render the pafture more beneficial 
to their cattle. Strangers riding into this flat and not very 
fertile part of the parifh, are furprifed with finding this wate- 
ry variety. I have fcen their eyes .return to it with pleafure. 
In the fummer, efpecially if it be a dry one, the greateft part 
cf the water is carried away by the wind, and exhaled by the 
fun. When in this ftate, the canals furnifh a confiderable 
quantity of coarfe grafi, for the horfes and cattle. In this part 
of the diftricTt, there are cattle of a fmall fize reared, as may 
well be fuppofed, from the nature of their pafture ; and a 
few working horfes of a diminutive breed, to labour the fields, 
of no great extent, kept in tillage. One great difadvantage at- 
tending this fandy part of the parifh is, that after the fields 
are fown and harrowed, if the wind blows ftrong from the 
weft, or fouthweft, the mould is blown off the feed, and not 
infrequently, a confiderable part of the feed is blown from 
the fown ground. 

This foil is favourable to turnips, barley, and clover ; good 
crops of oats and rye, are obtained here. The barley that 
grows in this fandy foil, is heavier in proportion to an equal 
tjuantity of the fame grain that is produced from good clay ■ 
the former being thinner in the huflc than the latter. The 
crops of peafe, with a few beans among them, are not fo fure 
or ^produdlive. 

There is in this part of the diftricT, a falmon fifhing of no 
inconfiderable value, oppofite to a fmall rivulet that runs into 
the ocean. From the entry of this rivulet, along the fhore to 
the river Eden, the people fometimes amufe thcmfclves by 
' fifhing in the fummer fcafon, in the following manner: Two 
of the people take a long net with' weights upon the lower 
edge of it, go into the feu as far as they may with fafety, ex- 

. tend 



of Leuchars. 597 

tend their net, and drag it gently to the fhore : In this way, 
they are fometimes more, fometimes lefs fuccefsful in taking 
fea trout, flounders, and other kinds of fifh. They ufe the - 
fame mode of fifhing alfo, in all the convenient pools in the 
river Eden, when it is low water. This they only do for 
amufement, or when they long for fifh. - Is it not fuppofeable, 
that if thefe fifhings were properly attended to, they might 
fupply all the diftrict with this wholefome and agreeable ar- 
ticle of food ? There were two no way inconfiderable falmon 
fifhings in the river, one immediately below the Guard bridge, 
the other oppofite to the Coble-houfe ; fo called, from a fmall 
boat being kept there, by which travellers from the fouth to 
the north, and from the north to the fouth, fhortened their 
Way by 2 miles, in place of going round by the Guard-bridge. 
But fince the diftillery was erected upon the fouth fide of the 
river at Kincaple, upon a bank flopping towards the Eden, 
both thefe fifhings have been much injured by noxious water 
flowing from the diftillery which runs into the river. The 
one at the Coble-houfe is entirely given up, and the other 
greatly decreafed. When thefe were fifhed, falmon was 
bought here at id£ and a id^- per pound Dutch. No falmon 
can be purchafed now below 4d, or frequently 8d per pound. 
The Tents-moors, and many other farms in the parifh, 
abound with grey rabbits. It is allowed on all hands, that 
the fale of thefe animals with their furrs, yields more than 
L. 200 per annum. This part: of the parifh is now almoft 
the only one where fheep are reared. It/has been thought 
that the true breed of Scots fheep are to be found here : ori- 
ginally it might have been fo ; but they have paffed through fo 
many crofs breeds, that they are^greatly degenerated ; yet there 
remain fome very fine-wooled fheep, which, if properly attend- 
ed to, might again rival their neighbours for the finenefs of their 
fleeces. There has been a fuck of 180 fheep lately added to 
1 the

the former ftock, making in all 2 , 20 . It is only in this part of 
the diftnft, the numbers are kept up. They have been de- 
crcafing in the weft part of the parifh, for many years, and 
now are reduced to one flock. In this flock, are a great pro- 
portion of long tailed flieep without horns ; their pafture is 
higher, and of courfe, more dry and nouriming ; the ftieep 
of a larger fize, and finer wool. But in the eaftpart of the 
parifli, the grafs is of a coarfer nature, and the foil more fub- 
jeft to retain water from its flatnefs ; the fheep of a fmaller 
fize, the 4 quarters weighing from 20 to %6 pounds. The 
time was, when every farm in the diftria, had a flock be- 
longing to it ; till the culture of clover and rye-grafs became 
general, and every fpot of grafs land was made to feel the 
pulverifing effcas of the plough and harrow, when it was 
thought more profitable to part with^thefe meek, harmlefs, 
and ufeful creatures. 

In the Tents- moors, fmuggling was carried on to a great 
extent, by thofe men in the neighbourhood, who were de- 
termined to rifle their fortune and charaaer on the events of 
a day ; for the inhabitants of this corner, were only aflifting 
in concealing and tranfporting their unlawful imports. By 
the wife and vigorous interpofition of the directors of our 
juftly admired government, fmuggling, that illicit traffic big 
with many evils to mankind, is now happily unknown over 
all our coafts. The inhabitants of this remote corner have 
been blamed for cruelty to fhip- wrecked failors. If the 
charge be juft, it does not belong to them alone ; they are 
but a handful; the place is thinly peopled. In the days of 
old, it might have been fo ; but I have feen much attention 
and kindnefs fliewn to fuch unhappy failors as were caft upon 
our lhore. I truft, and believe, that every future period 
ihall be marked with an increafe of brotherly love to the un« 
fortunate.

Church, Stipend, School and Par.— The church of Leuchars 
is placed nearly in the middle of the parifb. It is an ancient 
lofty building, part of it very ancient, fituated on a rifing 
ground. , The building is more than fufficient to hold the pa- 
rifliioners. There is no record by which the time of its erec- 
tion can be fixed, and there is even no tradition on the fubje&amp;. 
The church was once the only one in Scotland whofe fteeplc 
afcended on the eaft end of the building. The time was, 
when our forefathers worshipped here according to the forms 
of ihe Romifh church. The door through which the oiganift 
entered to perform that part of the fervice allotted to him, is 
ftill feen in the eaft gable of the church ; and the place where 
the holy water was kept to purify the worfhippers on their 
entry into this temple is alfo vifible. The iron hook on which 
was fufpended the lever for weighing meal on the Lord's day, 
is batted into the key ftone of an arch in the fteeple ; and *m 
the place below, other merchant wares were fold on that 
holy day. 

A very little weft of the prefent church, once ftood a cha- 
pel called St Bernard's chapel ; no remains of this monument 
of antiquity are now vifible, the ftones of it having been ufed 
for common purpofes. R,ound where it ftood are to be feen 
many graves, conftrudted of 4, and fome of 6 ftones. Some 
of thefe graves have lately been looked ioto without affording 
any thing worthy of being recorded. 

There is a moft excellent well flowing with an abundant 
ftream of foft water, near the weft end of the village, (for the 
village is now extending weftward,) called by the name of 
the Saint, to whom the chapel was no doubt confeerated. 
A little north of the eaft end of the village, to the conve- 
nience and comfort of the inhabitants, there is another well 
of equal excellence, called the Lady well, no doubt confe- 
(rated $0 the Blefled Virgin. Tradition fays, there once

6o ° Statijlical Account 

flood a We of worfhip-on the eafl fide of che road, oppofite. 
to the houfe of Ardit; a frhall field belonging to that eftate 
retains the name of the glebe. There was alfo once a chapel 
and burying ground at eaft Drone in this parifh : The glebe 
is the name of a field there too, but the real hiftory of thefe 
has not been tranfmitted to us. There is a tradition, according 
to the account by the Rev. Robert Dalgleifh of Scots craig, 
D. D. that the village ^of Ferry-Porton-craigs, before the 
1606, belonged to this parifh. 

The ftipend of this parifh till the year 1791, was 64 bolls 
bear; 8 bolls wheat; 8 bolls oats; L. 330 110:9 Scots, and 
L. 36: 16 : 8 Scots, vicarage, in which is included 40 merks 
for Communion elements. By an Interlocutor of the Court 
of Seffion in 1791, their Lordfhips were pleafed to give the 
following augmentation. Out of a part of the free tythes of 
the parifh, 24 bolls bear ; 24 bolls meal ; and L. 42 : 15 : 1 1 
Scots, in which is included, L. 42 Scots for Communion ele- 
ments. The Sacrament of our Lord's Supper is annually difV 
penfed in this congregation, in the beginning of March, and 
end of July, to between 700 and 800 communicants. The 
Kirk Seflion received from the bifhop of St Andrew's, from 
funds belonging to himfelf, L. 28 Scots for Communion ele- 
ments ; the receipt of which, is entered for the laft time in 
the Seflion records, in the year 1728. 

The legal falary of the parifh fchoolmafter, is L. 6: 13 14 
fterling. He has beiides, by a mortification, a houfe, gar- 
den, and croft; and 2 acres of light land, about half a mile 
northwefl of the village of Leuchars; and L. 4 : 10 : 6 fter. 
\. ft to -thofe who hold the office of fchoolmafter, by a late 
eminent and worthy clergyman of this parifh, the Rev. Alex- 
ander HenderfOn. 

Leuchars is a pleafant healthy country village, where boar- 
dew may be kept to advantage. The prefent incumbent, 

2°t 



of Leuchars. 60 1 

got a few foon after he was elected, and |ias room for a great- 
er number. The number of fcholars in the winter is from 
80 to 100. The fchool fees are as low as any in Scotland. 
Every man who is fenGbie of the importance of educating the 
youth, and understands the true interefts of his country, muft 
regret, that a body of men fo refpedtable, and fo extenfively 
ufeful as the parifh-fchoolmafters are, fliould 'have appoint- 
ments fo very unequal to their labour and to the fituation of 
their families. 

The poor in this parifh arg fupported in their own houfes. 
The Kirk Seffion are enabled to provide for them by the 
weekly collections at the church, and the money arifing from 
the mort-cloths, which were originally purchafed from the 
poor's funds ; by the rent of 5 acres in the priory of St An- 
drews, purchafed in the fame way ; and by the produce of a 
few feats in the church, yielding about L. 1 fterling per annum. ' 
I believe there is no fund managed with fuch care, or ren- 
dered fo extenfively ufeful, as the little funds in the hands of 
the Kirk Seffions of Scotland. We do not allow any of our 
poor to beg, though beggars pour in upon us from the north 
and fouth, in greater numbers than the fituations of men in 
moderate circumftances can enable them to fupply. There 
are laws to prevent this ,- but of what ufe are laws, if they 
are not put in execution ? We have invariably found that 
thofe who are moft unwilling to accept of aid from the pa- 
rifh, are leaft eafily fatisfied, when they have begun to receive 
it; whereas, thofe who modeftly intimate their wants and 
receive affiftance, as foon as their circumftances become lefs 
neceffitous, with hearts overflowing with gratitude to 
Almighty God, inform us that they are able to fupport 
themfelves, and thank the Seffion for the kindnefs fhewu 
them while it was neceflary. Penfioners of this defcription, 
we fupply with the greateft fatisfadion. 

Vol. XVIII. 4 G Population^ 



6o2 



Statiftical Account 



Population, bV.—By the return to Dr Webfter in 1755, 
the numbers were 1691. By the laft accurate furvey of the 
parifh, the numbers were 1620. The decreafe, which is 71, 
is to be accounted for in the following manner. There are 6 
different farms in the parifh, occupied by one tenant ; for- 
merly pofleffed by 3. There is indeed one farm divided into 
3, but there are 3 other farms poffeffed by one tenant, which 
were formerly occupied by 2. Every plough in the parifh 
fome years ago, had a man to hold, and a youth to drive it ; 
the labour of the farms was chiefly carried on by married fer- 
vants whofe families refided on them, It is mOre the cuftom 
now to perform the labour by unmarried fervants who have a 
houfe near the tenants, in which they fleep, and prepare their 
food. After they retire from work, they are free from the 
refpedr. due to the eye of their mailer, and if inclined to wan- 
der, are at full liberty. I believe that thefe circumflances 
are not favourable to morals, and that the union of fmall into 
large farms, is unfriendly to population.

as many from neighbouring parifhes are buried here, and 
many of the people of this parifh in the neighbouring church-

Statiftical Account 

There are In the parifh, 22 Antiburgher, and 13 Burgher 
Seceders; 1 Berean, and 1 member of the Epifcopal church ; 
37 Diflenters in all. There are 13 wrights; 9 mafons ; 9 
fmiths ; 8 fhoem^kers ; 6 taylors ; 3 wheel wrights, 2 of thefe 
are coopers ; 1 /urgeon ; 1 brewer ; 1 baker, and 1 bee-hive 
and bafkct maker. In the village of Leuchars, are 7 alehoufes, 
and there are 2 others in the diftria. Two ale-houfes in the 
village of Leuchars, are certainly fufficient to fupply all the 
inhabitants ; and a greater number tends very much to deftroy 
the mor.aU, and impair the health of the inhabitants. There 
are 90 looms in the parifh, 34 of thefe in the village of Leu- 
chars. The weavers are employed in what is called houfehold 
work of various kinds •, but chiefly in brown linens, fingle 
and double fail cloth, which they weave for the Dundee mer- 
chants. Several of them buy yarn, weave it, and fell the 
webs to merchants in Dundee and Cupar. This kind of 
manufacture is increafing, and it is thought will increafe. 
There is one of the weavers famous for working all kinds of 
damafk, and other table linens. It is thought the population 
will foon rife above the return made to Dr Webfter : there 
are 10 new houfes built in the village of Leuchars this fum- 
mer, to be inhabited at Martinmafs next. A great fpirit for 
building has difcovered itfelf for feveral years paft, efpecially- 
in the village : though building is carried on at a great ex- 
pence, free (tones have not been found in the diftricl:, exqept 
on the fouthweft, by the fide of the river Eden, below a mod 
valuable furface : The proprietors are unwilling to break more 
of it than what is absolutely neceffary for their own ufe, and 
the ufe of their farms. The cart load of free ftones cofts 2s, 
the /kiving and toll, 3d. On the weft fide of the parifh 
which is hilly, there are inexhauftible fields of fine hard blue 
whin flones; thefe coft is for driving the cart load, and 4d 
for quarrying. From the top of Lucklaw-hill, part of which 

is 



ef Leuchars. 605 

is in this diftricT:, there is a mod extenfive and delightful 
profpedt. 

Advantages and Dif advantages. —It is no fmall advantage to 
this diftria, that the river Eden is navigable nearly to what is 
called the Inner- bridge; a little below which with the con- 
currence and affiftance of fome of the heritors, the tenants 
have built upon the north bank of the Mulltree-burn, com- 
monly called Mothry water, a wall perpendicular on the fide 
of the water, and have filled up the ground behind the wall 
in fuch a manner, as to make it eafy for carts co approach the 
wall where they may load and unload fmall ve'flels : This gives 
opportunity of importing what the inhabitants ftand in need 
of, and exporting whatever they can fpare. Carriers from St 
Andrews to Dundee pafs and repafs twice every week through 
the village of Leuchars. Carriers from all the towns of the 
fouth coaft, from Crail to the Ely, pafs once in 14 days; per- 
haps oftener in fummer. 1 Carriers from Dundee and St An- 
drews, to Edinburgh, going through Cupar the county town, 
pafs within a mile of the village. Thus, an eafy and regular 
intercourfe is maintained between all thofe diftant places, 
and what we wifh to fend, or defire to have from them, is 
conveyed at the ordinary expence of carriage, according to 
the weight. 

The inhabitants of this diftricT. derive no fmall advantage 
from the lhell-fifh in the river Eden. They gather cockles 
and mufcles in their different feafons, fometimes eat them by 
themfelves, fometimes prepare them with potatoes, or onions; 
and the high flavoured juice that is obtained from the fifties in 
the boiling y with a little feafoning, makes a truly wholefome 
and delicious meal. 

There was c ftablifhed by mutual confent, in the year 1792, 
a fociety calling themfelves the Brotherly Society of fupport,

in and about Leuchars, and members from the neighbouring 
parifhesare admitted. The laws of the fociety are /P ious, 
benevolent, and well meant. Every member on his admif- 
Tio'n pays 2s 6d Iter, and 8d quarterly, or 2s 6d annually. 
The intention of the fund is to relieve the members when 
under ficknefs or the infirmities of old age, or the widows 
and children of deceafed members; who, it is propofed, are 
to receive 3s 6d weekly, or if a nurfe fhould be neceflary, 
4s 6d. If any of the members die whofe furviving relatione 
are unable to defray their funeral expences, they are to re- 
ceive L. 1 : 5 for that purpofe. (It is fubmitted, whether fo- 
cieties of this nature in different parts of the country, may not 
be ufeful.) Their funds alfo enable them to buy quantities of 
meal, coals, or any other neceflary article to divide amongft 
them. There are 2 fairs held in Leuchars, the one on the 
fecond Wednefday of April old ftyle, for the fale of cattle, 
(heep, lint- feed, fhoes, and all other kinds of merchant goods, 
the other on the third Friday of October, old ftyle. The pit 
coal is at a great diftance, and from the throng in the fummer 
feafon, the fetching one cart containing 5 load, cofts 5s 2df, 
and is the work of a long day for one man and 2 horfes. 
The proprietors of coal, are threatening to raife the price. 

Difeafes.~ Epidemical difeafes are not known in this dif- 
tridt, iince the great drain was cut. I have known 3 perfons 
within thefe 20 years, affected with St Vitu.s's dance to a 
very high degree. It was defired that a fiddle fhould be play- 
ed on in the prefence of the affected perfon. It was not 
regular mufic that gave relief, but the ftriking of certain 
firings, which the perfon under agitation, defired fhould be 
itruck again. The effect was aftonifbing ; the perfon afTed- 
©d, became quiet, fat down, and in a little, afked to be put 

to 



of Leuchars. 607 

to bed, but ftill called for the perfon to play, till the feelings 
that produced the agitation were abated. 

Some years ago, the people in this parifh profeffed a religi- 
ous fcruple againft innocutating their children. They are 
now come to look upon it as a religious duty to adopt the 
pradice ; and not a few of them, when a lancet loaded with 
matter was procured for them, innoculated their own chil- 
dren. If the fcruple could be- got over throughout all parts 
of the country, how, many lives would it fave, how many 
fore hearts to parents would it be the means under God of 
preventing?

Char after of the People They are in general fober and' 

induftrious ; regular attendants upon Divine worfhip on the 
Lord's day ; and grateful to a kind providence for- the bleffings 
they enjoy.- They are remarkably fteady in their attach- 
ments, in their loyalty to Our Gracious Sovereign and happy 
Gonftitution : 14 from this diftritT: entered to ferve His 
Majefty when v a late call for failors was made through the 
counties. — With what pleafure do I relate thefe fa£t,s, after 
having read with horror in the Advercifer, for Tuefday the 
3d November 1795, the wicked and treafonable attack made 
upon the facred perfon of George the III. Thanks and 
praife with my whole heart do I offer to the providence of 
God, for preferving the life of the beft of Kings, who has 
ever been the father of his people ; and pray moft fervently, 
that the crown may long, very long flourifh on his facVed 
head, until it pleafe the unerring Difpofer of all events, to 
crown Our Gracious King with a crown that fhall for ever 
flourifh in glory, and transfer his earthly crown to the head 
of His Royal Highnefs George Prince of Wales.

Antient and Modem Name. — Situation, and Extent. 

HP 1 HE antient name of thi6 parifh was Aberluthnot, or as 
-*~ it is more commonly exprefled in ancient records, 
Aberluthnet. This name it received early, but at what par- 
ticular period, is not now known. It feems, however, to be 
of Gaelic etymology, and to bear an allufion to the fituation 
of the village in the center of which the church (lands ; to 
the'fmali rivulet that pafles by, and the lands that furround 
it ; or perhaps fome memorable event in this particular 
place, now buried in oblivion, has introduced the name, 
and communicated it to the church and parifh* The eftate 
of Kirktown-hill, which is now fcarcely known by any other 
name, was formerly called the Kirk lands of Aberluthnet, 
as appears by a charter for thefe lands, granted by Car- 
dinal Beaton, to David Barclay of Mathers, anno 1540, 
and by another of confirmation from Queen Mary, anno 
1543, by which were conveyed to him alfo, all the 
lands and acres of the village of Aberluthnet, the burgh 

of 



of Mary-kirk. 609 

of barony, weekly market, and yearly fair, together with the 
Mill, Mill-lands, and Bourn of Aberluthnot, lying on the 
banks of the North-Efk river. Before the Reformation, and 
in honour of the Virgin Mary, the parifh obtained a change 
of name, frbm Aberluthnot, to Mary-kirk, which it now 
bears. This is evident from the above-mentioned charter, in 
which there is not the leaa mention of Mary-kirk. It is 
bounded on the fouth by the North-Efk river, which feparates 
it from the county of Angus, and parifh of Loggie-Pert ; on 
the eaft and northeaft, bySt Cyrus, Garvock, and-Laurence- 
kirk ; on the north and northweft, by Fordoun and Fetter- 
cairn. It is about 36 0 45' north latitude, and 2° 1©' weft 
longitude. Agreeable to Mr Garden's map and me'afurement 
of the county, anno 1774, the form of the parifh is irregular. 
It comprehends 81 91 Scots acres*, and its length and breadth 
are nearly equal. It is at the diftance of 4 Scots miles from 
Montrofe, and 6 from Brechin,— -placed at the fouth extre- 
mity of an extenfive plain, generally known by the How, or 
hollow lands, of the Mearns; and is fo exceedingly flat and 
level, that you feem, almoft in every direction, gradually to 
defcend as you approach the river. The only hills or eminen- 
cies in this parifh that feem greatly to variegate the fcene are 
Kirktown-hill and'Balmaleedie, which run, the one behind 
the other, in a northeaft direction, about 2 miles. Their 
fouth extremities are at a little diftance from the village of 
Mary*kirk •, and as the diftance is increafed, they advance by 
a gradual elevation, until they terminate all at once by a fud- 
den flope, in what is called the Wide Open. This feparates 
them from the Garvock-hills, which extend feveral miles in 
the fame courfe, and are a boundary to the paiifh.

Village of Mary.kh k.-Nw the banks of the North-Elk 
river, and fomewhat more than half way, on the road leading 
fromMontrofe to Laurence-kirk, lies the village of Mary-kirk; 
to and from which the traveller is delighted with the agree- 
able appearance of the country. To the north and northweft, 
at the diftance of fometimes 7 or 8, 9 or 10 miles, he be- 
holds the majeftic appearance of the Grampian mountains, 
darting their lofty heads to the clouds. In an almoft oppofite 
direaion, and bounding the pariih, lie the hills of Can- 
terland, Balmaleedie, Kirktown-hill, and Garvock ; though 
not fo ftately as the former, yet as they are cultivated to the 
tops, they pleafe the eye, and appear as fo many kfeguards, 
appointed by providence, to fhelter the vallies below from the 
frequent ftorms that come with great violence from the eaft 
and northeaft. Here the number of gentlemen's feats, w the 
variety of woods and lawns, the grateful fertility of the fields, 
and the beautiful meanders -of the river, together with the 
extenfivenefs of' the profpect, and the champaign appearance 
of the country, all invite the ft ranger to travel from Montrofe 
to the north in this road, rather than in any other. The vil- 
lage itfelf, has indeed no other ornaments than its local filia- 
tion, its ferene air, its falubrious and refrelhing fprings, and 
pleafant fields, to recommend it. It has not now, nor does it 
appear to have had, in the memory of the oldeft man alive in 
theparifh, any weekly market or annual fair. The number of 
the inhabitants it contains is 208, and their dwelling houfes are 
49. It is fupplied with mechanics almoft of every denomination, 
except weavers and bakers. Befides, there are 3 fhop-keepers 
who fell molt thirgs needful in the place \ and for the accom- 
modation of travellers, there are 2 inns or pubhe-houfes ; the 
houfes in general are in a ftate of decay, the ftreet or ftreets 
narrow and irregular. There are indeed a few new houfes 
lately built ; which, though they may. be convenient to tiie 
3 pofleftbrs, 



of Mary-kirk. 6il 

pofleflbrs, do not appear to add to the regularity of the place ; 
it is therefore hoped, that the proprietor of the village, who 
has already been planning out a broader ftreet, will take care 
that a new one be rebuilt after a more approved model ; and if 
a bridge over the North- Elk river at Mary-kirk, which is now 
in contemplation, and to which a fubfcriptlon is already 
opened, mould take place, it would not only be an advantage 
to the village, but to the country in general. To promote 
this, not a few of the farmers and inhabitants for a good many 
miles through the Mearns, have already fubfcribed ; and if 
the heritors of this parilh, and other gentlemen in the neigh- 
bourhood who have an intereft in it, would with their ac- 
cuftomed public fpirit, lend their helping hand, this necefia- 
ry and ufeful work could not fail to be foon and eafily 
accompliflied. This is the mere to be wifhed, as within 
a few years, 2 perfpns have loft their lives at the Ford, 
and Ferry-boat ; and many other individuals, by not being 
acquainted with the proper entry to the Ford, or by the inat- 
tention or ignorance of fome drivers of carriages, have been 
expofed to the mod imminent danger. It is to be obferved, 
that the North- Elk, oft times in rapid torrents, not only de- 
fcends the Grampian hills, overtops its banks, and inundates 
the valleys below, but with impetuous violence fweeps every 
thing before it ; fo that ftrangers ought by no means, to enter 
ralhly into this river, 

Ecclefiajlical EJlate,— The parochial church, which is ill 
fituated in the middle of the village, has long been in a ftate 
of decay, and bears the marks of great antiquity. It is 96 
feet long, and 17 broad. Its walls are much funk in the 
earth, and the floor and area are imdifferent places, at leaft 
4 feet below the burial ground on the outfide of the wall. 
There is an aile, on the fouthwall, oppofite to the pulpit where 

4 H 2 ^9 



^ 1 2 Statijlical Account 

the Strachans, ForbefTes, and FouJertons, who were propric 
tors of Thornton, have been buried. In this aile, built anno 
1615, there is a (lately monument to the memory of D. Eliza- 
beth Forbes, lady of Thornton ; and of Sir James Strachan 
Bart, her hufband. Its pillars, images, and other devices, 
were finely cut, elegantly ornamented, and highly finifhed. 
Near the centre of this monument is a Latin infeription, 
but this is fo defaced by age, and by a burning, occafioned by 
the Covenanters, about the time of the Revolution, that it is 
not now legible. On the ceiling of this aile, which is of oak, 
there is a numerous lift of honourable and ancient families, 
(with their coats of arms beautifully painted,) who were con- 
ne&amp;ed with the family of Sir James Strachan of Thornton. In 
the eaft corner of this aile, there is a Font ; and on the north-' 
eaft wall of the church, 2 prefifes near to e-!ch other, in which 
were preferved the facred utenfils. At the entry, ly the 
flocks, almoft copfumed by age; and on the outfide of the 
church, ftrongly fixed to the wall, are thejoggs*. Near 
the gate of the church-yard {lands a ftone, and tradition fays, 
this was the crofs where the weekly market flood. About 6 
years ago the church received a new roof. By taking down 
the old one, which was oak, there was deflroyed a ceiling of 
the fame wood, on which was beautifully carved a crofs, a 
crown, St Peter's keys, the armorials of bifhop Elphingftone, 
and Dunbar, and feveral other eminent bifhops. There was 
alfo removed from the church an efcutcheon of the family 
of Lord Halkerton, thought to be a fine painting. On the 

wall 

• Thefe were never appropriated by the church, as infrruments of punifh- 
ment and di;grace; hut were made ule of, when the weekly market and an- 
nual fair flood, to confine and punifli thofe whs had broken the peace, «r

wall near the pulpit, there is a monument, not much orna- 
mented, e'refted by Mr William Raic, in honour of his fa- 
ther and mother. On it is the following Latin infcription.

" Parentavit Filius, W. R 

On the fame wall, on the other fide of, and a little more 
removed from the pulpit, is a tomb, the burial place of the 
Barclays of Johnfton and Balmakewan ; and the only thing 
that can be faid of it, is, that it has a too near communication 
"with the church, has its entry through it, and is only feparat- 
«d from it, by an old door. Many of the inhabitants of the 
parifh, as well as the heritors, claim the right of burial* in 
the floor of the church and it would be accounted no left 
unjuft and cruel to deprive them of this right, than of an 
inheritance left them by their fathers. Befides the eftablifh-' 
ed church, there are 3 different places of worfhip in the pa- 
rifh. In Luthermoor, there is one for the Seceders. At 
Sauchie burn, another. for the Bereans ; and in the village of 
Mary-kirk, a third for the Independants ; all which, are tole- 
rably decent, and abundantly fufheient to contain the con- 
gregations. To thele places, the difienters above-named, in 
this and the neighbouring parifhes, re fort. Some years ago, 
there was in J.utbermoor, a chapel for the Scots Epifeopa- 
lians, but of late the chapel and ground belonging to it 
have been fold off ; and the congregation, who were a 

peaceable, 



6 14 Statiflical Account 

peaceable, and decent, affembly, have removed to Lau- 
, rence-hrk, where they have an elegant and (lately place of 
worfhip, which was fet on foot, and endowed by Lord Gar- 
denfton. About 24 years ago, and for feveral years after, a 
very great alienation of affeftion, and confequently a depar- 
ture from the true fpirit of Chriftianity took place. Since 
that time it is happily removed, by the increafing moderation 
of the feveral teachers of religion. The tide of paflion and 
prejudice, which formerly agitated the minds of many, is 
entirely gone ; and a perfect harmony, and good undemand- 
ing among thofe who are candidates for the fame happinefs, 
and profeflbrs of the fame religion, (though they may differ a 
little in their fentiments of it,) feem now to have fucceeded. 

Manfe — The rnanfe lies fouth of the church, in a hollow 
below it, and fome of the offices form a part of the church- 
yard wall; and may be faid to be the only part of it now 
Handing. The manfe was built in 1732, and received repara- 
tions in 1775, that produced no great advantage to the hern 
tors or minilter ; and fince that time, he has been put to con- 
iiderable expence to render it habitable. At prefent it (lands 
in great need of being repaired. It is hoped, however, that 
the heritors, who are all of them men of opulence, public 
fpirit, jultice and humanity, will fpeedily call an eye to the 
church, the manfe, and offices. The prefent incumbent is 
the third Prefbyterian miniller fince the Revolution. He 
was fettled here in 177.1, by a prefentation from his father, 
who bought the patronage from the mailers of the King's 
College at Aberdeen, about the year 1765 ; who at the 
lame time fold off all their other patronages. The patron is 
Major Garden, who fucceeded to all Lord Gardenfton's ef- 
tates, in this, and the parifh of Laurence- kirk ; and confe- 
quently 



of Mary- kirk. 615 

quently to the patronage, which was fold by the incumbent 
to his Lordfliip, not long before his death. 

Glebe.— The glebe confifts,of a little more than 4 acres, at 
a confiderable diftance from the manfe. The ftipend of Mary- 
kirk from 1650, to 1794, was annually 4 chalders of victual, 
and L. 29: 3:4 fterling in money. As the mafters of King's 
College, Old Aberdeen, claim the teinds of the parifh, a 
procefs of augmentation was commenced againft them, in 
the Court of Teinds, in 1788, which they defended with 
great obftinacy, until 1794, when the minifter obtained from 
the Lords of Council and Seffion, the Commiffioners of - 
Teinds, a decreet of modification and locality, for an^a-ug- 
mentation to his ftipend, of 3 chalders of victual, bear, £ 
meal, and L. io Scots, for Communion elements. But this 
augmentation, moderate indeed as it 'is, his opponents feem 
to quarrel with ; and threaten an appeal to the Hpufe of Peers. 
They draw from this parifh, by their converfion of victual, 
from the heritors, upwards of L. 173 fterling, which is 
more than twice the minifter's old and new ftipend put toge- 
ther. 

School.— About 7 years ago, there was a new fchool and 
fchool -houfe erected by the heritors ; the old fchool being 
ruinous and ill-placed* above the arch of the tomb of John- 1 
fton. The fchoolmailei's falary is L. 10:10 fterling, and 
L. 2 : 8 as clerk to the Kirk Seffion-, and Caldham's fund, he. 
His other perquifites as fchoolmafter are very inconfiderable ; 
for proclamations, 2s 6d ; baptifms, iod; teaching Englifti 
by the quarter, is 6d j Arithmetic, ?s; Latin, 2s 6d. In 
fummer there , are but few fcholars, in winter, the number 
may.be about 30. Befides, there 1 are 2 other fchoolmafters 
hi the parifh, who teach Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic ; 

but 



6*6 Stati/lical Account 

but have no falary, and are paid only by thofe who employ 
them. 



Poor — The number of poor frequently increafcs and dimi- 
ni(hes ; but at preferit, there are 2.5 upon the poor's lift. A 
good many years ago, Robert Perie, a refpedable farmer, 
born in this parifh bequeathed 400 merks Scots to the poor of 
this parifh. Some fmall legacies, donations, and favings, 
given and eftablifhed, when the neceffaries of life were 
much cheaper than at prefent, have made up L. 57 fterling, 
which, added to Perie's fund, amounts to L. 79 : 4 : 5^ fter. 
Befides, there are L. 3000 merks Scots, leffby Mr George 
Keith, formerly proprietor of Caldham, for pious ufes, and 
to keep in repair, a bridge over Luther-water at Caldham ; 
the intereft of which is generally employed in fmall dona- 
tions to decayed inhabitants, by an application having been 
made to the heritors. The wcekfy collections are at an ave- 
rage about 5s, and with about L. 3 fterling, collected when the 
facrament is difpenfed, will amount to L. 16 fter. per annum. 
There is a gallery built in the church, for the benefit of the 
poor, which yields little above L. 1 fter. The greateft part 
of the weekly collections are divided among the mod necef- 
fitous poor every week, immediately after difmiffing the con- 
gregation i and others are occafionally fupplied with what is 
over. The money derived from the 2 m'ort-cloths amounts 
to very little. There are generally no penalties given by 
church delinquents; for they take care to get themfelves 
noofed foon enough to prevent it ; and we do not wifli for 
money in this way to fupport the poor, if it could poffibly be 
obtained any other way more honourable and humane. 
Confidering the badnefs of the church, it is amazing that the 
minifter lias any one to hear him on the Sunday, but the 
fchoblmafter, and the kirk officer, who are obliged to attend, 

by 



of Mary-kirk, 617 

by virtue of their refpective offices ; or that there mould be 
any thing ftated for weekly collections. 

Air, Climate.— The air here is tolerably dry, mild and 
temperate, and the climate falubrious. Though the ground 
is very flat and level, yet there are no ftationary difeafes oc- 
cafioned by noxious vapours, arifing from ftagnated waters. 
We have no lakes ; no mofles ; or if in former times there 
have been any, they are now all drained and exhaufted. In 
alraoft every part of the parifh there are rivers, rivulets, and 
brooks to carry off" the rains that ly upon the ground, together 
with the waters emitted from the fprings. The high moun- 
tains at a diftance, and the lower hills that bound us on the 
northeaft, attract the clouds above, before and behind us. 
Did the rains that fall upon them, defcend fo frequently upon, 
our hollow grounds, they would render our lives comfortlefs, 
and our fields pools of water. We fometimes in what we 
think dry weather, envy our neighbours that live neareft the 
hills, for the feafonable and refrefhing fhowers wd fee them, 
receive : but, perhaps,, had we more difcernment, we would, 
greatly rejoice that they have not yet come to us, as our 
ground is not fit to receive them. When epidemic diftem- 
pers invade any of the neighbouring parifhes, and now and 
then cut off feveral of the inhabitants, they feldom penetrate 
our boundary ; or if they do, their attacks are lefs violent and 
destructive. In fhort, the climate here is fo good, that in 
fome years, there have not been above 7 or 8 perfons buried 
in this church-yard ; and molt of thefe old people, worn out 
by age and infirmities. Inoculation does not univerfally pre- 
vail, though feveral attempts have been made to render it 
general ; yet very few children die of the fmall-pox. Though 
there are not many inftances of great longevity, yet there are 
feveral perfons now alive, above 80. About 3 years ago, a 

Vol. XVIII. 4 1 maa 



&amp; 1 * Statijiical Account 

man died here aged 103 years. An inftance of the mildnefs 
of the climate is apparent from the little quantity of fnow 
that commonly falls here, and from its ihort continuance on 
the ground. In 1782, while the Grampian hills were deeply 
covered with fnow, for the fpace of 8 or 10 days, the people 
in this neighbourhood were bufily employed in cutting down, 
and gathering their corns; and it is to be obferved, that it 
was in a great meafure owing to this very circumftance, 
that many poor individuals were kept alive. Add to this, 
that the bounty of government, and the great care taken by 
the heritors, to keep a good part of their grain for the con- 
fumption of the parilh, and their timely interpolation in autho- 
riGng the Kirk Seflion, from the poor's funds, to buy up and 
fell at an under price, (not above is the peck,) what victual 
the moft neceflitous of the inhabitants needed, put this pa- 
rifh (ill as the times were), in a much better fituatipn than 
moft of the neighbouring parifhes. 

Papulation The amount of Dr Webfter's lift of inhabit- 
ants in 1755, was 1280. 

In 1774, Mr Garden ftated, probably with lefs accuracy, 
the number of fouls to be io3o ; fince that time, it is evident, 
they have been increafing confiderably, by the lift that is 
hereto fubjoined. The increafe can eafily be accounted for, 
by aflerting, that there were not fo many families, in Luther- 
moor then, as there are at prefent. At that time, there were 
only a few houfes in it, belonging to a fmall number of 
feuars; but now it is prefumed, there are more families 
fcattered over it, than there are families in the village of 
Mary-kirk. It was then only a moor, all covered over with 
heath ; but now, moft part of it, is either corn ground, or 
planted with trees: and although the foil is cold, fpungy, 
and wet, yet by trenching, draining, inclofing, and planting 

tretb, 



of Mary-kirk* 1 619 

ftets, the place is not only rendered pleafant to the eye, 
but even beneficial and friendly to the health of the in- 
habitants. Several other houfes have been built in the parifh 
fince that period. We cannot give an exad lift of baptifms, 
as many parents are not fond of the expence of enrolling their 
children's names in the lift of inhabitants; and for being 
married, and having a poor friend departed this life, they 
think, they mould rather receive fome reward and compen- 
fation, than pay a penalty. The minifter made out an exact 
lift in 1793, when the members amounted to 148 1, by 
which it appears that there is an increafe from Mr Garden's 
number in 74, of 401-, and from Dr Webfter's in 1755, 
(which was probably nearer the truth,) of 201. 

But the ftate of the population will be better underftood by 
the following Table.

Proprietor*) Rents. — The number of heritors in the parifh is 
10, and only one at prcfent refides in it. The valued rent is 
L. 6060 Scots; the real rent is nearly L, 3300 fterling. In 
the courfe of 20 years, the parifh has increafed much in its 
rife of rents, improvement, and cultivation. During this 
Ihort period, all the eftates in it have been fold, except 3, to 
new proprietors ; and a good many of the farms have got new 
tenants. The fame caufes may have concurred to effectuate 
thefe alterations here, which have taken place in other parifhes 
of Scotland. The eftates were bought at a time when there 
was no demand for land j but were they now in the market, 
they certainly would fell at a much higher price.

.Soil. — The foil here, as in all other parifhes, a various. 
The lands that ly neareft the banks of the North-Efk, on a 
dry bottom, are efteemed beft i and are fure, almoft in every 
ieafon, to produce the earlieft crops. In fomq places, the 
foil is light, and much inclined to the nature of fand. In 
other places, bordering on the river, it is deep and fertile ; 
and has much the appearance of an improved loam. In the 
north and northweft part of the parifh, it is moorifh, and has 
a cold till, and clay bottom ; which in many places, ly 8 or 
10 inches below the furface. But in the northeaft, on the 
fkirts of the hills, and in the vallies below, it is a deep clay, 
which, when fufficiently drained, manured, and cultivated, 
will produce very good crops of wheat and barley. The 
center o.f the parifh, in different places, partakes of the na- 
ture of one or other of thefe foils ; and in the proper cultiva-

tion of which the farmer is fure to reap the pleafure and ad* 
vantage *'. 

Cultivation. — Agriculture here, within the courfe of 25 
years, has experienced a very great change; and is now ar- 
rived at no fmall degree of perfection.. It is generally owing 
more to want of money than {kill, that farmers do not raife 
good crops, and always adapt their crops, to the nature, fi- 
tuation, and improvement of the foil. The prefent mode of 
farming, and fucceihon of crops, vary according to the nature 
of the foil, the tafte and capacity of the farmer. Here they 
generally fow wheat andmufhlie, but more of barley, Chefter 
bear, oats, and peafe : nor do they neglect the culture of 
turnips ; and if the foil be fuhiciently dry, they are fure to 

increafe 

* The great variety of foils that appear in different places of this pari/h, 
and not only in the fame farm, but in the fame field, might be rendered by 
much labour and induftry, of the greateft advantage to the cultivator; as 
they are manifenly adapted to the great variety of feeds that are, and ought 
to be fawn : — fome of which, require a light, others a grofs earth, or an in- 
termediate foil :— fome are indeed fo fandy and light, that all the juices 
which are lodged in them by the air, immediately evaporate ; and the corn 
that requires a flrong nutriment, could never fobfift in fuch a fituation. To 
remedy which, an intermixture of clay or rich earth, is abfolutely necefTary. 
On the contrary, there are other foils fo unpleafant, fo tough and clayey, 
that fcarce any feed can penetrate through them. To remedy this, much 
ploughing and draining, fandatid lime, and a comport of dung, w'rth earth of 
a contrary nature, will operate above defcription. There are others again, 
that preferve a medium between thefe two extremes, and are qualified for 
different productions, as they more or lefs correfpond to the nature of fand 
or clay. Wheat, for inftance, in this country, never thrives but in a rich 
and humid foil, which is very fat and marfhy; and barley, Chefter bear, and 
oats, though they delight in a fandy foil, yet they never fail to profper in 
the richeft; if fufficwntly covered over, with well pulverized earth, in a dry 

feafon.

increafe the quantity. One fourth of a farm is commonly fown 
with grafs feeds, and laid out for hay and pafture. Another 
fourth confitts of fummer fallow, and green crops -, fuch as 
turnips, mufhlie, peafe, and potatoes. The other half of the 
farm is fown with corn in any mode that may appear moft be- 
racial to the farmer. Little limfeed is fown except for fami- 
ly ufe, unlefs the farmers mean to have wheat after it ; and, 
in that cafe, they dung and lime well. In preparing for any 
crop that has a foil with a wet bottom, they think it neceffary 
to drain it by every poOible means-, fo that any water iffurng 
from the ground, or rain water on the furface, may gently 
run off with the" leaft damage to the foil or manure. In 
almoft every farm, there are to be found all the neceffary 
and modern implements of hufbandry, fuch as different 
ploughs for light and deep foil, carts proper for vidual, 
dung, (tones, lime and wood,— drag and light harrows, roU 
lers, fanners, &amp;c. No lime-ftone quarries have as yet been 
difcovered, Lime is to be procured at the diftance of 4 or 5 
miles ; but moft people bring it from a greater diftance, from 
eaft Mathers, which is about 7 or 8 miles; the price is the 
fame, is rod per boll, lime-ihells ; but they think it of a 
preferable quality. The farmers have fucceeded well in their 
attempts to improve the breed of work horfes, with which 
they not only fupply themfelves, but are enabled to bring 
what they do not ftand in need of to market : but the breed 
of black cattle has been lefs the object of their attention; 
and the reafon they give for it is, that weighty cattle deflroy 
their grafs fields, much more than fmall cattle; Iheep are entire* 
ly gone, unlefs a few fed and fold to the butcher, or kept for 
family ufe. The farms are properly flocked with black cattle, 
in proportion to the extent of each farm. Part of the rent is 
commonly paid in victual. Services are fometimes contracted 
(or in the leafes, but are not rigidly exacted. Many of the

tenants, in their leafes, ate bound to carry all their grindable 
corn to fome particular mill, and to pay certain different rates ■ 
lor grinding it, vh. aboil for i6 f 2I , 24 bolls. The far- 
met, or the mill-mafter on that account, pays to the-heritor 
a h.gh rent for his mill, and the other tenants ftrive to have 
as little grindable corn as poffible. By this means, he is in- 
jured, and they complain that they are not allowed to grind 
at any mill what quantity of vicinal they pleafe. This has 
been the occafion of very ferious contefts before the Civil 
Court ; both difagreeing about, and explaining in their own 
way, the terms of the contraft. Formerly, the tenants 
ploughed with oxen, as well as horfes ; but now the former 
are entirely laid afide, unlefs in a few farms, where they oc- 
cafionally employ them in the plough, wain, or drag-harrow. 
The farmers pay for their land in this pariOi, from 5s, ios, us, 
15s, to 25 s, 30s, and 40s, per acre; but the laft high prices 
are only given about Mary-kirk, by thofe who have other 
employments befides their farm, or on account of an inn, a 
meal and barley mill. There ar© 6 mills in the parifti; 3 on 
Luther- water, and 3 on the North Elk. Two of them have 
all the machinery neceffary for barley. We have no manu- 
factures of any kind ; but we expect, that when the bridge is 
creeled, we fhall have every thing fet to right ; and ftrong 
motives to excite our induftry. The tenants have inclofed 
very little of their farms, unlefs here and there a field or two 
for their own accommodation and convenience. And the reafon 
they give is, that they have fhort leafes, many of them not 
above ioyears; for this is the longeft period now commonly 
given. The heritors have all the grounds furrounding their 
manfion houfes regularly and neatly inclofed, with a ftoue or 
earth dyke, ditch, and quick fet hedge ; and the proprietor 
of Balmakewan has lately furrounded all his farm with an 
earth and Rone dyke; but the fields on the water-fidje near

until the very e,nd 0 f April, or the beginning of May; and 
throughout the fummer it was the general opinion, that this 
crop would be the lateft ever known here, even later than 
that of I782 . i In thc end of - Auguft) ^^^^ ^ 

middle of September, the weather became exceedingly mild 
and warm, and of courfe, the filling and ripening 0 f the 
grain, was very much accelerated. Soon after this, a very 
great froft took place in the night, which blafted the tops 
of the potatoes, and had fuch influence upon the Hand- 
ing corn, (which was not completely filled,) that it now 
feemed 'neccflary to cut it down with all convenient fpeed 
Before the pth of Odober, nearly one half of the crop was 
qut down. From that period, to the 24th, it rained with 
very little interruption. This occafioned a very great fpring- 
ing' of the vidual cut down, and remaining in the fields. 
On the 24th, the rain was fucceeded by a violent ftorm of 
wind, which it is faid, has fhaken in many places a confide- 
rable part of the (landing crop. It will therefore be extreme- 
ly necefiary for gentlemen, who are entrufted with the police 
of the country, to take care that no vidual be feht abroad, 
until they are fure there is a quantity at home, fufficient to 
fupply the demands and neceffities of the inhabitants. By 
the former lift of wood, it is evident, this parifh is well 
planted and ornamented with it.. The Earl of Kintore, it is 
faid, has at Inglismaldie, his family feat, the feat of the 
Lord Halkertons, and in other parts of his eftate in this pa- 
rifh, no lefs than 1500 acres, and that he draws by the fale 
of his wood at Inglismaldie alone, upwards of L. 1000 per 
annum. Befides, the other heritors have planted around their 
manfion houfes, and on moors, a large quantity of wood, 
which fcrves not only to beautify the country, but will in a 
little time, both accommodate the inhabitants, and bring great 
profit to themfelves. Mr Gillies of Balmakewan, the only 

heritor 



of Mary-kirk. 627 

heritor now refiding in the parilh, from his fine nurfery * 
Luther bridge, has planted fome years ago, no lefs than 150 
acres, on a moor, near the poft road from Brechin to .Lau- 
rence-kirk ; (which road paffes through the center of the pa- 
xifhj and a great quantity more, to ornament Ins p ace, and 
decorate the banks of the Luther, and North-Eflc. At Hatton 
alfo, there is a plantation of about 100 acres. The variety ot 
trees planted in this parilh, is as follows, firs, oaks, beeches, 
afhes, elms, birches, chefnuts, walnuts, larches, pines, Scots 
and American fpruce, alders, willows, planes, and limes. ' 

Roads, Views, Rivers, Bridges, Rivulets.— -There are 3 
public roads in this parifh ; the reft are private roads, intend- 
ed to accommodate the parilhioners to church, milns, and nei- 
bouring markets. The 3 public roads are finely finished, and 
kept in proper repair by ftatute labour * The turnpike-road 
from Brechin to the North-Efk bridge at Inglismaldie, not 
only paries through a pleafant country, adorned with elegant 
feats, and beautiful landfcapes, but the traveller is pleafed 
with the windings of the North-Efk, and of th* Krook and 
Weft water defcending into it : and as he approaches towards 
its banks, it travels with him as a majeftic and entertaining 
companion before the venerable houfe of Inglismaldie. Here 
the woods, the fields, the lawns, the motion of the rivers 
and the trees jutting out of the rocky-cliffs that embellifh its 
banks, decorate the fcene : but when he comes to the bridge

Inghsmaldie, there is a fine opening before us, and by turn- 
ing a little to the eaft, with the wood on our right hand, by 
gradual defcent, we approach Luther water ; over which there 
is a ftately bridge of one arch, the (tones of which are faid to 
contain much iron ore. Here there is a moft delightful land- 
fcape. The North-Efk defending to the eaft, the Luther to

towering birch, hanging over the edge of the ftream on the

It enters this parifh, near the burn of Johnfton, and feparates 
both at the bridge and village of Laurence-kirk. Running 
nearly through the center of the parifh, it traverfes the lower 
lands, the diftance of 7 or 8 miles ; and after having turned 
3 mills*, and paffed under 2 bridges f, it divides the eftates 
of Inglismaldie and Balmakewan, before it defcends into the

which, during the froft laft winter, (that was fuppofed greater and of longer 
duration than any ever remembered,) was always employed in grinding vi&amp;ual, 
while the other millt, on the Nerth-Elk, (viz. Bridge-mill, Mary-mill, 
and Spear-mill,) were for a long time flopt, by reafon of the violence of the 
froft. 

t The bridges are Luther formerly mentioned, and Caldham. This lad 
was ere£led in 1783. It confifts of 3 arches, and ftands on the public road, 
fomewhat lefs than half way between Mary-kirk and Fettercairn. At this 
bridge, there is an extenfive landfcape, and piflurefque appearance of the 
rive' - , meandring among the meadows, and like a fport-mar/s fine pointer, 
docs not feem fatigued. It is alfo to be obferved, that the road from Mary- 
kirk to Fettercairn, is well made and finifhed ; and from the variety of gentle- 
men's feats that may be feen from it, muft give no little entertainment to the 
traveller. Kirktown-hill, Balmano, Hatton, Balmakewan, and Gallero, form 
a circle about him, and inclofe him on every fide. Leaving this view, he 
pafTes between the planting of Hatton and Balmakewan, till he crefles at

Luther on his left, and almofl always in his .view, untillhe comes within lit-

yet at not the diftance of a mile from the village of Mary-kirk, 
there is a mod extenfive profpeft. Looking to the weft, 
through the hollow of Strathmore, in a clear day, you can 
fee Lord Privy Seal's Obfervatory at Belmount caftle; and 
calling your eye ftill farther, fome appearance of hills in the 
neighbourhood of Stirling, at the diftance perhaps of 64 miles. 
In this parifh, there aVe no lefs than 9 rivulets, or brooks, 
and one river that defcend into and form a jundion with the 
North-Elk. There is no place where the inhabitants are bet- 
ter fupplied with good water than here. The fpring and mi- 
neral waters are accounted excellent. In and about the vil- 
lage of Mary-kirk, there are no lefs than 3 fpring-wells. 
Two of them arc in Mary-mill bank, and both perhaps equal 
in quality; but that which is called Lady-banks- well, (con- 
cerning which, many fabulous ftories have been related,) is 
cfteemed beft, on account no doubt of its larger ftream. 
Certain it is, however, that this water is uncommonly refrefh- 
ing and pleafant to the talte. In fevers, when patients de- 
cline all other kinds of drink, they call for Lady-banks-water, 
and are refrefhed by it; and fometimes it happens, that the quan- 
tity they take, is fome way or other inftrumental in removing 
the fever. At Balmaleedie, not far from the village, there is 
a well of the chalybeate kind ; and nearer to Mary-kirk, on 
the edge of the Burn, there is another, both much impreg- 
nated with mineral fubftance ; and which have been not a lit- 
tle chara&amp;erifed and recommended by phylicians of great 
eminence. The former, which is fuppofed lightcft, has been 
for fome years quite neglected ; and the latter, for fcorbutic 
diforders, and chronical diftempers, has been much reforted 
to, by the inhabitants of the village ; and it is believed, not a 
few have received from it great benefit. There is alfo at Bal- 
mano, a fine fpring-well, called St John's-well, which in an- 
tient times, was held in great eftimation. Numbers who 
a thought

thought its waters of a fanative quality, brought their rickety 
children to be wafhed in its dream. Its water was likewife 
thought a fovereign remedy for fore eyes, which by frequent- 
warning, was fuppofed to cure them. To (how their gratitude 
to the Saint, and that he might be propitious to continue the 
virtues of the waters, they put into the well prefents,'not in- 
deed of any great value, or fuch as would have been of the 
leaft fervice to him, if he .had flood in need of money, but 
fuch as they conceived, the good and merciful Apoftle, who 
did not delight in coflly oblations, could not fail to accept*. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of this parifh are Few in num- 
ber, and of no great importance. It is, however, to be ob- 
ferved, that the traditions which bid faireft to claim the title 
of antiquity are thefe. A few years ago, when part of the 
church was to be rebuilt, there, were found in the heart of the 
wall, a few (tones about 6 feet long. The ftones were in the 
form of a coffin. One of them was carved round the edge ; 
had the impreflion of a large broad fword, fufpended at no 
great diltance from the top, the whole length of the ftone. 
Oppofite to this fword, was engraved a figure of an eliptic 
form, from which proceeded a lance or fpear, nearly the 
fame length. Thefe ftones, it is fuppofedj were taken from

* The prefents generally given, were pins, needles, and rags taken from 
their cloaths. Th ; s may point out the fuperftition of thofe times ; and many 
no doubt, will boaft much, that they are born in a more enlightened age ; but 
while they may be entertained with the infignificant gifts of their anccftors, 
let them take care, that they themfelves be not among the number of thofe, 
who render to God no returns for benefits received ; or if they do, make it 
obvious by their conduit, that they pay little or no regard either to his pofi- 
tive or moral precepts. Such a conduct in the eye of reafon, will be ao» 
counted as ridiculous as the offering a pin, a needle, or a rag iri facrificc.

fome other burial ground ; and all we can conjecture about 
them is, that they have been placed in the wall when the 
church was firft built, or afterwards when the wall might 
have been repaired. Not far from the church, is a farm cal- 
led Spear- mill, winch is faid to have derived its name from a 
battle having been fought there with fpears *. The ftory re- 
lated of the battle is this. The North-Elk by a great flood 
had fwept away the mill of Canterland at Kinnardie. The 
proprietor of Canterland and Balmaleedie, not knowing where 
to build another, requefted of the proprietor of Aberluthnet, 
that he would allow him to carry the mill-dam, taken from 
the North-Elk, and the Burn of Aberluthnet, after turning 
his mill a little farther towards the eaft, until both in one 
current reached his property. This the proprietor of Aber- 
luthnet absolutely refufed, and the other ftrenuoufly infifted 
that it mould be done by force, if he would not confent to it. 
In a night or two after, the proprietor of Canterland caufed 
a ftrong oxen-plough draw a line from the Burn and mill- 
dam, in the direction he wifhed the water to run ; and after 
this, forthwith fet his people to work, to complete what he 
had already begun. The proprietor of Aberluthnet being in- 
formed of this, fpeedily alfembled his valTals and depend- 
ents, and with great violence attacked his opponent, who 
was well prepared to receive him, near the place where the 
mill now ftands. Both fides joined battle ; they fought with 
fpears, and after a bloody conflict, the proprietor of Aber- 
luthnet was defeated, the mill-dam extended, and the mill 
itfclf built where it prefently is. After the battle, it is faid,

* On different parts of this farm, feveral ftone coffins, and the bones of 
dead bodies have been found ; and it is fuppofed, the ltones in the church 
wall might have been taken from thence ; and that the (lone moft orna- 
mented, might belong to fome leader or commander that fell in battle.

they buried their dead on the farm of Spear- mill. But when 
this happened none can precifely tell. This farm is bound- 
ed on the eaft by the Burn of Inglis-den. The Burn alfo 
bounds the parilh, and divides it from St Cyrus. On this 
farm, it is likewife faid, a bloody battle was fought between 
the Englim and the Scots that the Englim general was flain, 
and n6 doubt they would add that the Scots gained the viftory ; 
but the date of this is alfo unknown. ' There is a fmall piece 
of ground a little up the Burn from Mary-kirk, called the 
Threap- acre. About the boundary of this ground, it is faid, 
there was once a difpute between the proprietors of Balmalee- 
die and Aberluthnet. The'former claimed the ground as his, 
and faid the Burn was the boundary ; the latter contended 
otherwife. At laft they agreed to fettle the difpute, by al- 
lowing the proprietor of .Aberluthnet to bring proper men, 
upon the fpot, who might declare upon oath the truth of 
the" matter. The arbitrators came at the time appointed, 
with the earth of Aberluthnet in their boots,^and folemnly 
fwore, they were then .{landing' upon the ground of Aber- 
luthnet. This fraud coming to the ears of the proprietor of 
Balmaleedie, he fen.t.Jris neighbour a challenge to meet him 
in the field, and anfwer for his perfidy, by v fmgle combat. 
.The" combatants-met, and the proprietor of Aberluthnet was 
flain; and it is not above 18 years fince the fto'nes were re- 
moved from the place where it is faid he was buried. It is 
alfo to be obferved, that, there were 4 Druidical temples 
here ; one at Hofpital.Shiells, another on the Burn of Bal- 
makellie, a third on the farm of Dyke-lands, and at no gteat 
diftance from the Deer- dyke, that in ancient times feparated 
this parifh from Garvock, when (as tradition fays,) it was a 
foreft ; and a fourth near the houfe of Hatton, at a little 
diftance from the public road ; but as the (tones of all thefe 
are removed, and taken away for building houfes, there ap- 
pear very few veftiges of them now. The laft thing that

occurs deferving any notice, is, that at Gallow-hillock, in 
the time of the feudal fyftem, there wa6 a gallows erected, 
on which thofe were hanged who difpleafed the proprietor. 
The hillock or artificial mound (as it may be called), is vifi- 
ble, but the gallows was long ago removed ; and happy — 
happy fhould we think ourfelves, that we live , in better 
times, when the greateft Lord in the land will not— nor dare

Comparative view of the value of land, mode of cultivation ; 
price of provifions j wages to fervants •, progrefs of man- 
ners, from the year 1771, to the year 1795, with a re- 
ference now and then, to more difiant periods. 

In 1 77 1, and for 10 years after, an eftate fold at L. 6000 
flerling, would in the prefent year 1795, nearly fell at twice 
that fum. In 1740, only at L. 3000 ; and in 1650, at lefs 
than 2 years rents of the fame ground the prefent year. 

In 1771, every farm was diftinguifhed by In-field, and 
Out- field lands. The latter far exceeded the former in extent, 
and was fometimes in tillage; but for the moft part in pafy 
ture, while the former was manured and conftantly in crop. 
But now in 1795, the diftinclion between In-field and Out- 
field is abolifhed ; and grafs- feeds are fown in almpft every 
part of the farm. 

In 1 7 7 1, every field contained a number of baulks, where 
nothing grew but natural grafs , and which were deemed fo 
ftrong and rugged, that it appeared then impoflible to plough 
them. In 1795s every baulk and obftacle is removed ; and 
the whole land in the field cultivated in proportion to the abi- 
lity of the tenant. 

In 1 771, in many places a quantity of land appeared crook- 
ed in the figure of the letter, S, very high in the middle of the 
ridge, and confequently very unequal in breadth. In 1795, 
the ridges are all ftraighted and equally broad.

In 177T, the land was generally very wet and full o£ 
weeds, and there were few attempts made to deftroy them. 
Since that time, every field has been not a little drained and 
crofs-ploughed j but all care has been taken to deftroy the 
weeds ; and afterwards by lime and dung to procure a good 
crop. 

In 1 77 1, the farmers generally ploughed with oxen ; having 
4, 6, or 8 in a plough. But in 1795, it is prefumed, they 
have too much laid them afide, and betaken themfelves to 
horfe-ploughs ; and apply 4 or 2 in a plough, as they think 
fufficient for the nature of the foil, the time, progrefs, and 
mode of dreffing it. 

In 1 77 1, beef fold at 2s 6d, and 3s per (lone ; mutton at 
2s 6d, and 2s 8d per do. ; butter 6d per lib. V cheefe 3s, or 
3 s 9d per ftone ; chickens idf each; hens from 5d to 8d 
each j eggs idf, or 2d per doz. falmon id per lib. ; and in 
former time's, each of'thefe articles proportionally lower. In 
1795, beef fells at 5s 4d, or 6s per ftone; mutton at 5s 4d 
per do. ; butter from iod, to 13d per lib. ; cheefe from 5s to 
6s per ftone ; chickens from 4d, to 7d each-, hens from is, 
to is 4d each ; eggs from 4d, to 8d per doz. falmon is fel- 
dom ufed but at the tables of the rich, and is 6d per lib. In 
the month of Auguft, young falmon begin to be fold at 2df 
per do. 

In, 1 77 1, oat- meal fold at 10s, or 10s 6d per boll; bear 
feldom exceeded the price of meal ; but fince 1780, oat- meal 
has been generally increafing in its price, and bear and barley 
have fold for more. Barley generally exceeds Chefter bear, 
is 6d, or 2s per boll. In 1795, oat-raeal has got up from 
1 6s, to L. 1 fter. per boll ; and bear and barley it is fuppofed,

here ; what is needed is bought from the baker in loaves and 
bifcuit. Turnips are more generally ufed for milk-cows and

rearing young cattle, than for feeding oxen for the butcher. 
Each farmer kills an ox or cow betwixt Martinmafs and 
.Chriftmafs, which is falted up for family ufe. Potatoes are 
only beginning to be planted in large quantities in the field, 
and only a few bolls are fold over and above what is needed 
in the parifh. The crop is worfe this year than any crop 
fince 1782, having fuffered much damage by the long con- 
tinued rains, but much mote indeed from the high winds 
that followed after. The corns in many places, then Hand- 
ing, have been almoft all fhaken : and it is fuppofed, that 
after the quantity of vi&amp;ual neceffary to fow the fields, and 
fupply the inhabitants with provifions, for a (ingle year is 
fecured, there will not be much over to pay the farms, or to 
fend to market. 

. In 1771, every family in the parifh brewed the fmall beer 
they needed, which coft them about 1-5'd or i6d per barrel ; 
and generally had fome of the ftrongeft wort made into a 
better kind,; but now this is entirely and by neceffity given 
over, and all their fmall beer is taken from a brewery at 23 8d 
per barrel. Whifky is the only fpirituous liquor that is ufed, 
or can be afforded here; which about 16 years ago, they 
could buy very good in quality, from is iod, to 2s 2d per 
pint; i.e. 16 gills; but now they pay 3s 6d for the fame 
quantity, but much .worfe in quality *.

* It is indeed worthy the attention of the Legiflature, to endeavour to 
correct an abufe which has been introduced into this kind of traffic, and which 
is now arrived at the moft alarming height. Whifky is a fpirit diftilled from 
malt, and when properly done, it is eftecmed by fome; as very little inferior 
to rum ; but for fome years, it has very much changed its tafle and flavour; 
and it is fufpefted, that either proper attention is not paid to it at the time 
of difHlling, or that afterwards it is mixed with fome perpicious iagredicnts 
very deftruclive to the bowels, or to the health or •onflitutien of thofe wht 
drink it.

' In 1 77 1, many of the lefs cultivated part of the inhabi- 
tants of this parilh appeared not very complaifant, or well- 
bred to ftrangers. An extreme fondnefs for religious difpu- 
tations feemed, in fome meafure, to conftitute a part of their 
character. The topics in which they were moft converfant, 
and which appeared to ingrofs no little (hare of their atten-

the agreement or difagreement about them, could neither 
promote the peace and happinefs of mankind, nor tend to ad- 
vance the intereft of true piety and virtue. 

In 1795, the- manners of the fame individuals appear to

Qm&amp;$M*-ti order to improve this parifli to the fulleft 
extent, it would be abfolutely neceffiry to have it all regularly 
inclofed, and drained, after the moft approved Englilh model. 
To promote this, the tenants mould have long' leafes, and in 
letting the ground, care muft be taken that the rent do not ex- 
ceed its real value ; and that neither proprietor nor tenant be 
impofed upon in the terms of contrad. By planting a num- 
ber of trees, of hard wood, along the inclofures, and allow- 
ing, at the end of the leafe, a certain number to belong to 
the tenant, this would not only inlure their prefervation, but 
be of the higheft advantage to both. Short leafes, high rents, 
and high wages to fervants, will inevitably (whatever may be 
faid to the contrary), in a fliort time, bring ruin upon smy 
country, where the ground is level, the foil wet, and the fea- 
fons not early. Every tenant labouring under thefe difadvan- 
tagcs, will endeavour by every mean in his power, to lelTen the 
number of fervants and cattle that cultivate his fields; but what 
is the confequence? In the feed-time, he never accomplices 
his work in its proper feafon ; and in hurrying it on, it is ge- 
nerally never done in the way and mariner in which it ought to 
be done ; and for the fame reafon, the harveft is later ; and by 
not engaging a fufficient number of reapers, it is protracted 
far beyond the time in which it could and ought to have beet* 
finilhed. This is obvioufly one great caufe of the prefent 
late harveft: but to thofe who ferioufly turn their thoughts to 
this important fubjett, it will appear, that other caufes have 
concurred to blafl: our expectations of a very plentiful harreft. 
" Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but it is God only 
K who giveth the increafe." In vain do we attempt to culti- 
vate 

attempts of evil men. The tale of woe; that would have enfued, is happily 
remrved ; ani we hope a watchful providence will remffye it for ever.

vate and Improve our fields, if we leave the great author of 
nature* the fountain-head of all happinefs, out of our fchemes 
of improvement. That a fettled difregard to the Superinten- 
dence of the Almighty has been increafing in every corner 
of the land for.feveral years, and that too, to the moft alarm- 
ing height, is as obvious as any demonftration in Euclid. 
Some there are, who feemingly pay God no homage at all 
others who pretend to believe in him as the author and giver 
of all the good gifts they enjoy ; but at the fame time, prefent 
him with nothing in return, but fuch oblations and fervices, . 
as would be accounted the higheft infult to any earthly bene- 
factor. Properly to explain and illuftrate this fubjecl: would 
take up more room than might be deemed neceffary or pro- 
per for a Statiflical Report. However, one thing is certain, * 
that God is difhonoured, his fubje&amp;s are hot fufficiently 
grateful and obedient to him. He requires a higher venera- 
tion, better obedience, and a more rational and refpec"tful 
fervice. Men may for a time infult and pour contempt upon 
his Majefty, but there is a period when they muft flop, *and a 
line and boundary which th'ey dare" not pafs over. When 
they ferve him with fidelity, he bleffes them with plenty ; 
when they leffen their regards, he is ftill indulgent, but mud 
leflen the ftreams of his bounty: but when they grow defpe- v 
rately mad, and reject and defpife him altogether, he then re- 
fumes his power, and is ready to deftroy, by his- AJmighty 
vengeance: We have feen the caftigations of heaven, fevere- 
ly punifhing for a long feafon, that irreligious and cruel na- 
tion we have been and are yet contending with ; and we 
might have feen too, if we had opened our eyes to behold the 
agency of providence, fome indications of Divine difpleafure 
againft that country that gave us birth, and which we are all 
bound to love and fuccour above, any other nation in the 
world : but how can we lore our country, if we are ftrarigers

to the love of God. Without this as a firft principle, we can 
have no real regard for any other objeft lefs venerable and 
lovely. But poffeffing this, we lhall love our King, our 
country, and all the various ranks of men in it ; and rejoice 
in feeing and promoting their virtue and happinefs. That 
this generous fpirit is not excited in proportion to its value, 
is vifible from the many inftances we have, of a great indiffe- 
rence to ferve or fuccour either the one or the other, as we 
are at all times, and by every reafon in the world, bound to 
do. It would be no impoffible thing to render a fingle parifh 
happy, did the men of influence and power in it, unite, by 
every generous endeavour and poflible exertion, to accomplifh 
fo falutary and god-like an object ; and the feme proportionate 
endeavour would, be no lefs effectual when extended to a 
nation or kingdom. But if men of fortune, influence and 
power, do not firft begin to lend a helping hand to this ne- 
ccflary woYk ; if they are not firmly perfuaded, that it is as 
confonant to the principles of right reafon and common fenfe, 
that they themfelves fhould firft begin to pay real homage 
and veneration to the Deity, in any mode or manner worthy 
of him, as it is for them to expect gratitude for great favours 
they have done, or faithful fervices and tokens of xefpect 
from their dependents, their children and fervants, it never 
can take place ; all the philofophers and politicians on earth 
can never eftablifh it. What would every perfcn well affect- 
ed to his country not give, rather than that that evil and • 
fanguinary fpixit, which has for a long, time ravaged France, 
{hould pervade and defolate this country, and deftroy the 
beautiful fabric of the Britifh Government ? Our country 
muft be faved ; it muft not become a field of blood j the pre- 
dictions againft it are not true. Let us Jbe but at the tenth

be well. Why have the French been fo long fuccefsful 
agamft all who have oppofed them, notwithstanding their 
internal commotions, and bloody difafters, but that their fall 
may be the more confpicuous and that all men may know, 
that this hath God done, to humble the arrogance of the 
impious and terrible, and fuch as would not have him to 
reign over them ? Why have we been fo very unfuccefsful in 
gaining battles, but that we alfo have a debt to pay ; the 
debt of repentance for many faults committed ; and the debt 
of gratitude for many bleflings and favours conferred upon 
us, which we have been almoft totally unmindful and regard- 
lefs of. This debt, however, muft be fpeedily paid, and not 
only fo, but in the beft manner we poflibly can. Raifing 
armies will not do, though with thefe armies we could de- 
ftroy all our enemies; for if God be angry, he can deftroy 
!?y famine, as well as by fword j and if this he is pleafed to 
withhold, he has other weapons equally terrible to execute 
his difpleafure. Neither will a day or two appointed for 
fading and humiliation do the bufinefs, unlefs they excite 
in us thofe difpofitions of mind, which are beft calculated 
to regain his favour. Let it become as fafhionable every 
Lord's day, for all people of figure and fortune, to attend 
the fancluary of God, as it has for feveral years been fafhion- 
able for fome to contemn and difpife it. Were this once 
begun, the reft of the work would be pleafant and foon 
completed ; and what the work is two fentences could ex- 
plain. At prefent, all that is necefiary to be obferved is, 
that if we are in earned to preferve every thing that ought 
to be accounted dear to us as Britons, we muft in the firft 
place, be all of us at leaft profeflbrs of religion, and attend- 
ants on the ordinances of the gofpel, and the reft of the

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5309261">BOTRIPHNIE</name> 

(COUNTY OF BANFF.) 

By tie Rev. Mr Alexander Angus.</head>

<p>

Name, Situation, &amp;c, 

I AM entirely unacquainted with the derivation of the 
name Botriphnie. It is probably Gaelic ; but there is no 
tradition remaining how long it is fince that language was 
fpoken in this part of the county. The extent of the parifti 
from nofth to fouth, is about 3^ computed miles, and from 
eaft to weft, about 3 miles. The parifti of Mortlich lies to 
the weft, Glafs to the fouth, Cairney and Keith to the eaft, 
and the united pai;ifhes of Boharm and Dundurcus to the 
north. The diftance from the fea is 9 computed miles. 

The appearance of the country is hilly ; but the valley is 
very fertile and beautifully diverfified with fmall ftreams of 
water, the banks of which are covered with birch and aller, 
the natural production of the foil. Lime-ftone is found here 
in great plenty, and in many places not above 1 feet from the 
furface; but it is little ufed in this parifti as a manure. 
There are few mechanics of any kind ; the men are generally 
employed in huftandry, the women in fpining flax ; partly 



of Botripbnie: 64^ 

the growth of this country, which they manu&amp;aute into 
coarfe cloth; and partly flax imported from Holland, which 
is made into finer yarn ; and fern from this to Paifley or 
Glafgow. At prefent, the price of fpinning is low, arid a 
woman cannot earn more than 2od, or 2s a-week. 

The farmers are in general poor. Confidering tha ftate of 
cultivation, the land is high-rented, the beft paying nearly 
20s, and the inferior 10s ; but, befides the fixed rent, the 
tenant pays the land-tax ; is obliged to work fo many days in 
harveft, to lead fuel in fummer, to carry fo many loads to 
the diftance of 20 miles ; a pradice which has a tendency to 
break the fpirit of the tenant, and to difcourage improve- 
ment ; befides, the tenants feldom having a leafe for more 
than 19 years. 

The rent of the parifh is about L. 1000 ; of which L; 850 
belongs to Mr DufFof Drummuir ; L. 100 to Lord Fife, and 
L. 50 to Mr Stewart of Auchluncart. The church was built 
in 16 1 7, and the manfe in 1776. The only funds for the 
maintenance of the poor, are our weekly collections, which 
will amount yearly, to about L. 6 fterling, and L. 3:10, 
the intereft of money belonging to the Kirk Seflion. 

The minifter's ftipend, including the glebe of 4 acres, does 
not amount to more than L. 80 fterling. 

The Seflion Records are not older than the incumbency of 
my predeceffbr, who was fettled in 1728, and was the firft 
Prefbyterian minifter after the Revolution. There is a regi- 
Iter of baptifms kept pretty regularly fince 1690. 

The parifti confifts of 630 fouls, of whom -males 301; 
females 329 ; the number of families 150 ; the average num- 
ber of births 14 ; no regiller of burials kept; 103 under 10 
years of age ; 85 between 10, and 20. There are no remark- 
able inftances of longevity; there are only about 3 perfons in 
the parifh above Bo. We have 15 Seceders; 3 Roman ca- 
tholics ;

i of the Epifcopal church. Population has dc 
creafed ,782, about 100. This decreafe is owing to the pover- 
ty of the country, and the advance of rents ; the poorer peo- 
ple retire to the villages and towns where they are employed 



by the manufadurers ; and many of the young men find 
more encouragement in the fouthern counties. 

I am perfuaded there muft have "been fome miftake in 
the account of the population of this parifh given to Dr Web- 
far in 1755. The numbers are ftated by him at 953. 

The lift I have taken is very exaft, and correfponds to a 
roll of examinable perfons, as far back as x68i, whish I 
found lately in looking over an old Seffion Regifter ; the 
number at that time, was 486, and it would not be too high 
a calculation to fuppofe, that there might be 100 under 8 
years of age. Since I have been here, that is, from 1774, 
the population has decreafed about 100. This is owing in 
fome degree, to the bad crops in 1782, and 1783, which re- 
duced many of the farmers, and obliged others to go to the 
neighbouring towns and villages. But befides this, mofs for 
fuel is becoming every day more and more fcarce ; and heri- 
tors reftri&amp; their tenants to a certain number of fubfets. 
The difficulty of providing fuel is one of the greateft obftacles 
to the progrefs of agriculture ; while our fouthern neighbours 
are employing their horfes and fervants in the different parts 
of hufbandry, we are drudging from the beginning of fummer 
to the end of ii, in providing at beft but a very precarious 
flock of fuel for the winter. Were the duty taken off the 
coals, we mould' then be able to provide them at a much 
cheaper rate than peats, and in one fixth part of the time*. 

It might be mentioned as another caufe of the decreafe of 
population, that the fervants wages have advanced very con- 

fiderably 

* The duty on ccals carried coaft-ways, has been taken ©rT fmce this ac- 
count was written. 



of Botriphnie, 647 

fiderably fince 1782, and the farmers, at leaft in this parifli, 
employ fewer than they did before that period ; and as the 
cattle have advanced much in their value, more of them are 
reared in this country, and of confequence, lefs grain is 
raifed, and fewer hands are neceflary for the cultivation. 

School of this Parifh.^- -There is a legal parifh fchool; the 
falary of the fchoolmafter, 12 bolls of meal ; L. 2 fterling as 
Seffion clerk ;.6d for every baptifm ; is for every marriage; 
and is 6d a quarter for every fcholar. The number of fcho- 
lars, from 20 to 30. The children are taught reading Englifh 
and writing ; a few of them instructed in the principles of 
arithmetic ; but the Latin language not fo commonly taught 
at the parochial fchools as formerly ; though in general, the 
fchooimafters are fufljciently qualified for that purpofe. This 
is of great confequence to minifter6 children, as their narrow 
livings could not afford to board tjiem in a town, while at the 
grammar fchool. 

My own family is very numerous : I have 2 fons and 5 
daughters ; and have been married 13 years. 

There is not an ale-houfe, or inn in the parifh ; we have 
an annual fair in the month of February; where linen yarn, 
commonly the production of home flax, is fold ; and alfo 
fome farming utenfils; where bargains are made for victual, 
and fervants are engaged. 

The farmers in this corner, generally employ hired fer- 
vants; cottagers are very little employed; they are generally 
tradefmen, and cultivate a few acres; which they hold of 
the tenant, and over and above their rent, are bound for fo 
many days work.

(Omitted in Statiftical Account of the Pavifli of Culrofs, Vol. x. P. IJI.) 

St Mungo. 

At the eaft end of the town, on the fea coft, (the high 
road only intervening,) there are the remains of a chapel 
called St Mungo's chapel, of which the tradition is, that it 
was on or near the place where St Mungo or Kentigern was 
born. He is faid to have been the fon of Eugenius the III. 
King of the Scots, and a daughter of Lothus King of the 
Pi£t,s. His mother Thamit, when near the time of her deli- 
very, in order to conceal her fhame, threw herfelf into an 
open boat, with a view to its being caft away, and, after 
being, for fome time, toffed about in the Firth, was driven 
afhore, at or near the place where the chapel is fituated, 
and there brought forth her fon. There were two chaplains 
for this chapel, who had their ftipend paid out of fome lands 
in Strathern ; but after the Reformation, thefe lands were 
difponed by the crown, to the college of Glafgow. St Mun- 
go was educated at Culrofs, under the tuition of Servanus 
or St Serf, who lived in an hermitage, in the place where 
the monaftery was afterwards built.

St Serf. 

Anecdotes of St Serf, from Winter's Chronicle, a M. S. in 
the Cotton Library : Winter lived in the end of the 14th, 
and beginning of the 15th century : he was a Canon re- 
gular of St Andrew's, and Prior of the Monaftery of 
Loch-leven. An excerpt from his Chronicle is publifhed 
by Pinkerton, in a collection of old Scots poems, which 
gives the following account of St Serf. 

St Serf, was fon to the King of Canaan, and refigned his 
paternal inheritance to a younger brother, that he might be 
at liberty to travel. About the death of Pope John III, 
A. D. 511, he came to Rome, and according to the legend, 
was raifed to the papacy, which he held 7 years : (This, Pin- 
kerton thinks to be a fable, and gives it as his opinion, that 
St Serf was a native of Italy.) Setting out from Rome, and 
travelling through prance, he arrived at the oppofite more to 
Britain, where he embarked with his retinue of 100 men; 
and after a profperous voyage, arrived at the lfland of Inch-, 
keith, between Leith and Kinghorn •, there he was vifited by 
Sancl; Adaman ; then Abbot of Icolum-kil ; (Inch-colm I fup- 
pofe,) and intreated to come to Fife. In compliance with 
the holy man's requelt, he kft Inch-keith, and arrived at 
Dyfart, and proceeding from thence by water, came to Kin,- 
niel. What follows is in Winter's language : 

Syne at Kinniel he came to land ; 
There our the water he kefl his wande, 
That fuddenly grew in a tree, 
And bare of applis great plente ; 
.And that flede aftyr ay, 
Morglafs was called mony day. 
Syne our the water, of purpofe, 
pf Forth he parted till Culroflc ; 
^uhar that he thought a kirk to found. 



Appendix. 65! 

In this defigri, he was oppofed with great cruelty by Brude 
fon of Dugard, who was at that time King of the Pitts in 
•Scotland: but Brude being overtaken with a fevere ficknefs, 
was recovered by the prayers of St Serf; upon this he made 
his peace with the Saint, and made him a grant of all Culrofs, 
with all the profits of it freely, commended himfelf and his 
ftate to the Saint's prayers, and entertained him and his com- 
pany molt honourably on the fpot. 

Their fyrfl Sancl Serf tuk his reflit (refidence), 

To lif on that as he mycht get ; 

And there he brought up Sancl Mongow, 

That fyne was bifliop of Glafgou.

To the Inch of Loch-leven ; 

The King Brude of devocion

Of that Inch, and he dwelt their* 

Till fevyn yers our pafllt were. 

I'hen follows an account of St Serf's travels to Tullibody 
and Tullicultry, where he wrought many miracles, and con- 
cludes with a long conference he had with the devil, in which 
many points of theology were propounded by the enemy* 
and difcuffed by the Saint, with great propriety and good 
fenfe. So that his fubtle antagonift was forced to acknow- 
ledge, that he kend him for a wife man. In the conclufion 
we are told, that St Serf returned to Culrofs where

The monaftery which was founded in the year 121 7, by 
Malcolm Thane of Fife, lies northweft from St Mungo's, at 
.the head of the town, on a rifing ground, commanding a 
beautiful and extenfive profpeft of the Firth; confiderable 
remains of it are yet to be feen ; on the north fide of it was 
the abbey church, which had a tower or fteeple in the middle 
of it, which continues ftill entire, as alfo the part of the 
church Which is now made ufe of for the parilh church. The 
abbey church was dedicated not only to the Virgin Mary, 
but alfo to St Serf; who was confidered as the tutelar faint 
of this place, in honour of whom, there' was an annual pro- 
ceffion on his day; viz. 1 ft July, early in the morning of 
which, all the inhabitants, men and women, young and old, 
aflembled and carried green branches through the town, 
decking the public places with flowers, and fpent the reft of 
the day in feftivity. The proceflion is ftill continued, though 
the day is changed from the Saint's day, to the prefent King's 
birth-day. 

The Earls of Argyle who were formerly wont to refide at 
Caftle Campbell, a ftrong hold of theirs on the fouth fide of 
the Ochils, are faid to have been heritable bailies of the abbey; 
by them it was difpofed to Colvill of Ochiltree, in whofe fa- 
mily the office continued, till the heritable jurifdi&amp;ions were 
taken away, anno 1743. 

The Argyle family had a chapel adjoining to, and commu- 
nicating with the church, a part of which ftill remains ; and 
fome of the family were buried there. 

A convent was feat to this abbey, from the abbey of Kin- 
lofs, with Hugh the fir ft abbot. John Hog was abbot of 
this place, 14th April 1484, when Culrofs was ere&amp;ed into 
a burgb of barony. The laft abbot of this place was Alexan- 
der fon to Sir James Colvill of Ochiltree, who was admitted 
a Lord of Seffion, anno 1574- Sir James, brother to Alex-

ander, was raifed to the dignity of Lord Colvill of Culrofs, 
at which time, the King gave him a grant of the diffolved 
abbey. 

At the Reformation, the rental of this abbey, amounted to 
L. 768 ; 16 : 7 of money; 3 chalders, 3 bolls wheat ; 14 chal- 
ders, 10 bolls, 2 firlots barley; 13 chalders, 12 bolls 3 firlots 
3 * pecks oats ; 1 chalder 2 bolls fait ; 10 wedders; 22 lambs ; 
7 doz. of capons ; 28^ doz. of poultry ; 7! ftone butter 70^ 
ftone cheefe ; and 8 truffes of draw. At that time, there 
w&amp;re 9 Monks in the convent of the Ciftertian order. 

About a quarter of a mile to the weft of the abbey church, 
are the ruins of the old church, which was before the Refor- 
mation the parim church, and which, with the church-yard 
around it, is ftill ufed asJaurial ground.
