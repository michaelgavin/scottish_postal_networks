<p>Situation, Extent, EJlaies, Set. 

CHIRNSIDE is the name of a confiderable village 
and parifh, in the (hire of Berwick, vulgarly call- 
ed the Merfe, but, more properly, the March, upon the 
E. border of Scotland. 1 It is alfo the feat of a prefbytery ; 
and, as fuch, it is dated In the lift of the prefbyteries *, 
inftituted in the reign of James VI. 1581 when' the Dio- 
ccfan Court, or Synod of Jedburgh, now called that of 
Vol. XIV. A Merfe

Siatiflical Account 



Mcrfc and Tiviotdale, confided of only four prefbyterfes ? 
viz. that of Kelfo, Dunfe, Chirnfide and Jedburgh. 

It has no natural and well marked boundaries. Thte 
large ftream of Whittadder, or Whitewater, terminates it 
upon the S., and a deep morafs, called Bellymire, is its 
confine, in the oppofite quarter. The elevated and ex- 
panded hill of Chirnfide, and the contiguous one of Ming- 
ion, when taken together with their wide fkirts, may be 
reckoned as comprehenfive of the whole parifh. The fi- 
gure is oval, and its longefl line,, extending eaftward from 
Whittadder bridge to the extremities of Foulden and Ay- 
ton parifhes, is computed to meafure 31 Englifh miles, 
or under 4. Its greateft breadth will hardly reach to 3. 
Upon a- calculation, the number of acres in the parifh 
■will amount to about 6523. The whole land, if we ex- 
cept 5 or 6 fmall portions, confifts now of 5 eftates ; two 
■of which, Chirnfide and Idington, are feparate baronies, 
and both of confiderable antiquity *. 

The lands of Ninewells are next in valuation after 
Idington. The 4th eftate, called Eaft Mains, and hold- 
ing of the barony, is the property of John Molle, Efq., 
a lineal defcendant of an old family of that name in Ti- 
viotdale, and parifh of Morbattle. The 5 th is that of 
Blackburn in the Mire, the property of Mrs. Bruce, the 

relict 

* The former, to which the largeft territory belongs, had, probably, 
become an appendage of the lordfliip of Home, when the chief of that 
family, Lord Warden of the Eaft March, after being engaged in the re- 
volt of Francis, Earl of Bothwel, had returned to his duty, and obtain- 
ed, as his fliare in that forfeited chieftain's fpoils, a grant of the Abbey 
«f Coldingham, anno 1596. The donation would involve claims to, or 
at leaft facilitate the acquifition of lands in the neighbourhood of that 
well-endowed priory. Hence, the lauds of Ninewells appear, from trie 
charters, not to bold cf the barony of Qhirnfidc, but of the lordftip cf 
Home, 



Of Chlrnjidc. 3 

tclitl of David Bruce Efq., who refided in Fife. Of thefe 
heritors, 3 have prefent refidence ; William Hall, E%. of 
Whitehall, the principal proprietor, and patron of the pa- 
riih, Jofeph Home, Efq. of Ninewells, and the above na- 
med heritor of Eaft Mains. The barony of Idington, in 
the beginning of this century, poffefled by a Sir Andrew- 
Lauder, of the Valleyfield family, has been, for above 50 
years back, the property of the Hays of Drummelzier, 
whofe prefent -reprefentative is Robert Hay, Efq-, refident 
at Dunfe Caftle, the ufual feat of his family. 

Name y &amp; c. — The etymology of the name Chirnfide, is 
of fomewhat difficult explication ; yet if we take its firft 
fyllablc to be Gaelic, as the other is Saxon, or Englifh, 
its import and propriety may be underftood. The word 
-cairn, well known to denote in Erfe, the rude fepulchral 
monument of {tones, raifed by the Saxons and Danes, in 
honour of their warriors who fell in battle, is written, in 
•fome fpecimens we have of that language, with 'a ch ; and,, 
-at large, ch.artie or chern *. 

A 2 1 The 

* In this orthography, if the jproper one, In Erfc, the change of the 
«pen vowel a or t, into an i, which is more mute, may he eafily ac- 
counted for, from the abbreviated found being moft affected in common 
difcourfe. Chernfide would be readily pronounced Chirnfide. But ther* 
is a difficulty in underfhanding how the harfh and uncouth pronunciation 
of the cb could be admitted in that word, when it is generally avoided 
in the dialect of the country. The fad is, that, although the hook- 
learned, and better fort, do adopt it, the common people almoft univer- 
fally agree in its reje&amp;ion. They pronounce Sbirnftdc, as (turning the 
tb into an Jb) they do in ffiance, fhoice, {hair, fhopin, fheefe, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
And even although they often hear the Englifli pronunciation of church, 
,they can make no more of it than furtb. The name of Sbirnfide, cs 
Cbtrnftd,, therefore applied to the village, may be prefumed to fignify 
a town, or place hard by the t b er „, or kern; the tb in the Saxon al- 
phabet being founded rftcp Uk c a k.

j| Btailflkal Account 

The veftige of a cairn, although not now in accumula- 
tion, but the raifed ground, rather hollowed out in the 
middle, is obfervable on the eafjern, and higheft fummit of 
the hill ; near to which the row of the village, on that 
Fide, begins* Idington Hill, which, with a fmali interval, 
is a continuation of the fame ridge, (hows yet more appa- 
rently the place and remains of two cairns. The heaped 
ffcones of one of them were but lately carried off *, and it 
is known, that, in their firft demolition, about 40 years 
ago, a ftone coffin, its figure faid to be an oblong fquare, 
was taken up entire, and conveyed to a gentleman's place 
In the neighbourhood. In the track of Lammermuir, 
between Chirnfide and Dunglafs, feveral of thefe cairns 
were, of late years, very confpicuous, as they are foun4 
mod numerous upon the E. coaft of Scotland, adjacent to 
that of Northumberland, and of Yorkfhire, often invaded 
and occupied by the Danes and Saxons. 

Chirnfide Hilly and Profpe&amp;s from it 3 &amp;c— Among the 
feveral eminences which disjoined, from the edge of Lam- 
rnermuir, on the N., project into the Low Country of 
Berwickfhire, Chirnfide Hill is a moil remarkable one. It 
is diflinguifhed from others of them, by its elevation and 
femicircular afpeel: to the S., joined with the great ex- 
pan G on of its fummit, and its gradual declination to 
Whittadder water. It commands, as moft of them do, 
the view of a country, the richeft in foil (with the ex- 
ception of the Carfes), of any in Scotland ; and, we 
may add, in its prefent (late of culture and fertility, not 
inferior to the beft improved lands of England ; unlefs 
we take into the account the forced gardens and nur- 
feries around the metropolis, and fome meadows, glutted 
with manure^ or formed out of fwamps in the fenny coun- 
ties.

ties. The landscape beheld, is that of a plain, waved 
with long ridges, running chiefly in one direction, and 
of more than 25 miles extent from the Bay of Berwick 
to the Tiviotdale Hills, on the W . ; while directly S. 
and at almoft the fame diftance, the famed hills and 
chaces of Cheviot form a boundary truly grand. About 
60 or 70 years ago, this profpect, although ftriking and 
noble over the country, was a naked one, and had little 
or nothing of the beauty arifing from extenfive agricul- 
ture, enclofed fields or plantations. If fome groves or 
ilrips of trees marked, here and there, tjie feats of the 
gentry or nobles, befides thefe, and a few enclosures, 
joined with them, hardly any thing but wafte land, or the 
poorer! culture, was difcoverable. Nature, indeed, wore 
a robe that indicated a deep foil. The uncultivated 
grounds produced immenfe tracks of heath, overfpread 
with thick furze, or tall whins, and, in fome drier places, 
with broom ; which, in the fpring and til rough the fum- 
mer, fhed the golden gleam of their flowers, and their 
fragrance, all around. 

The eye of a fpeclator, on Chirnfide Hill, now has in 
profpee~t a country, of the extent defcribed, all of it in 
remarkable cultivation ; the corn fields and pafture lands, 
almofl every where, enclofed and divided by hedges and 
ditches. Large plantations not only appear around the 
gentlemens' feats, but reach, in feveral places, to the ex- 
tremities of their lands ; fo that they feem to be con- 
joined to each other. Of fuch a pleafant fcene, we have 
here an immediate exhibition. The plantations of White- 
hail, forming a quadrangle, with fome contraction on its 
E. and W. fides, and running on in lines of half a mile, 
advance up the hill, from near the banks of "Whittad- 
der to the croft lands of the village, now turned, in 

part,

W. fide of that plantation, and where the hedge-row of 
Ninewells approaches to it, there is, feen, in the open, 
xng, a fection of Whittadder, to which Blackadder-water 
there near its confluence, comes forward as a tangent 
A little above both thefe plantations, and where a grove 
of trees intercepts to a fpeftator, at the manfe and other 
houfes in the fame declivity of the hill, the dHlina view 
of Whittadder, that clear ftream is caft into curious and 
pidurefque appearances. In one ftation, it glitters be- 
tween the Items of the trees, refleding intermiffive and 
tremulous beams of light. In another, it mows, like a 
bright edging or half coronet, to their green tops. In 
a. third, where the trees do not interpofe, it is thrown 
into a mining curve. The high banks are feen, in con- 
tiguity to thofe of Blackadder-water. The plantatioa 
and enclofures around Allanbank-houfe confpire with 
thofe of Blackadder to complete the villa, and (hut the

* The Hill of Chirnfide, befides the views and plantations, pofTeffes, 
almoft the whole of the extent, a natural fertility of foil, although with 
very confiderable difference and variation ; and it contains alfo great and 
valuable ftores of free-ftone and marl. The former lies, in many places, 
not more than a or 3 feet under the furface. Its colour is between red 
and white, and the grain fuch as renders it not too hard to be wrought 
by the chifel, yet very durable. Its chief bed appears in the middle of 
the fouth fide of the hill, where the old path-way afcending it, is, ia 
a manner, turned, the moft part of its length, into a rugged pavement. 
As quarries of ftone rife towards the hill, the marl banks are formed, 
snoftly, in the declivities and dips it takes towards Whittadder; the 
iloping grounds on the fides of which are entire accumulations of its 
ftrata; being all either of the clayey kind, or the more lumpiih and 
iioney. Of fhell marl, no traces appear ; nor is it found in the neigh- 
ioirhood, nor any where in the fliirc, but in very finall quantities. The

Village^ Agriculture^ Sec. — The line of the village runs, 
as it has done for various generations, in two rows of 
houfes, £. and W., over the broad fummit of the hill, to 
the length of more than half a mile. Another row of 
them, not fo compact, defcends the hill in a S. direc- 
tion. Departing from the former, at an opening near 
the middle, called the corfs, and properly the crofs, it has 
the church for its termination.- A little afide from the 
other houfes in this line, called the Kirkgate, (lands the 
manfe, with the glebe-ground on three fides of it, at the 
diftance of about 100 yards, or more, from the church, 
in a lower fituation. Before the divifion of the lands of 
the barony, into the feparate {hares of its proprietors in 
the 1 740, and for many years aftei? that period, the vil- 
lage houfes made that mean appearance common to aH. 
others in the country. Reared at the expenfe of the land- 
holders, and furnifhed gratis to the farmers, or, at a very 
{mall rent, to other tenants, they were of fuch conftruc- 
tion, in their materials and dimenfions, as, in comparifoii 
with thofe now built, we would call the bell of them 
hovels, or huddles of ftone, clay and wood. Until the 
late Mr. Hall, clerk of Seffion, erected his two pavilions 
as office-houfes to a future manfion, and the deceafed Mr. 
Home of Ninewells, in the year 1745, built the prefent 
Jwelling-houfe of his family, and fome repairs were made

* The church, indeed, had its low walls and its fteeple of a tower- 
Jike form, built with free-ftone, bedded with lime ; and its two ailes com- 
pofed of rough afhlar. The caflle, or ftrohg houfe of Idington, now 
quite demolifhed, was of the compilement of all the old towers, partly 
©f free and whin-ftones, and fome lime joined with clay mortar. The 
houfes of the inferior heritors and portioners of land differed little from 
thofe of the farmers, into the compofition of which free-ftone or lime 
hardly entered. The manfe, as it ftood at the deceafe of the late mi- 
nifter in the 1755, humbly refembled them in its form, covered with 
thatch, and with a deep curr.e-ceil ; in the fecond floor, it had no more 
than 36 feet of wall for all its length, unlefs what was called an outer- 
houfe, or kitchen, made up of cat and clay, was reckoned a good part 
of it. Before the barony of Chirnfide was divided among the heritors, 
in confequence of a decree pronounced by the Court of Seflion in the 
1740, it is to be obferved, that there were no outfield farms, excepting 
thofe belonging to the three mills in the parifh. The village, like others 
in the country, comprehended all the houfes and cottagers appertaining to 
the feveral proprietors, great and fmall. Adjacent to the manfion-houfe of 
fome of the former, there was what was called the mains farm, or that of 
his domain or houfehold. Hence, as the land was in time parcelled out 
into feveral farms, fo many of them diftinguifhed only by their pofition in 
different quarters, are known here, and in other parilhes, by the common 
defignation of mainfes. In the barony, at the period mentioned, there 
were only three of thofe farms, and another in that of Idington. Du- 
ring the continuance of the blended property of the feveral heritors, the 
further extenfion of farms and {leadings was prevented by the common 
property they had in the outfields. Of thefe, the only ufe which could 
be made, was that of a pafturage for all the cattle and fheep of the vil- 
lage. Upon the remembrance of fome old people ftill living, the par- 
ticular account of them is faid to have been 63 fcore of fheep, and 13 
of black cattle ; and the whole number of horfes is reckoned, not fo 
exactly, at 60. The value of one fheep's paflure was 8 d. ; of an ox or 
cow 30 d. ; and of a horfe 2 s. 6 d. Befides the common moor adjacent:

claimed upon it the pafturage of fome lambs or Jbecp,

We may further judge of the general poor condition of 
the arable land (except the S. croft, which was let in acres) 
that, in the fworn valuation of it, the beft, or infield 
part', was rated in the decree of divifion at 5s. The 
eltimate was fo minutely exad, as to include various 
rates, from that highell one to the loweft, at lid. the 
acre. This laft, indeed, refpefted the moft barren and 
fcalpy point of the hill, fo incumbered with large whin 
Hones, as to be thought incapable of culture. For the 
old arable, or S. croft, which was, as in other places of 
the village, tilled land, the tenants of acres, or portion- 
crs of an acre, paid from -6s. and 7s. to 10s. ; a rent as 
high in thole times, as when now they pay 30 s This is 
not to be confidered as occafioned altogether by the low- 
er value of money, and its -greater circulation among the 
inferior ranks of people. An acre of land could not 
then, by any known art or induflry, be made to pro- 
duce what it now does ; not fo much from the increafed 
fertility of the foil, as from the more advantageous ufes 
to which its fertility can now be turned ; by a crop of 
potatoes, or of red clover, or turnip, being joined to 
jone of corn, even in the fame little field *.

dolent and oblhnate adherence to their old cuftoms, would find it very

fluft, with a common or borrowed plough, to perform more thriftily if

to the mares of the greater and fmaller proprietors, it is 
evident, that impediments were laid in the way of any 
improvements in agriculture, or increafe of ropulation. 
The decree of divilibn was the firft Hep that led to views 
of the former, as it put it in every heritor's power to call 
his eftate into the bell mape he could for melioration. 
The many banks of clay marl had, indeed, attracted the 
attention of one or two of the gentlemen proprietors, and 
fome feeble trials of it, as manure, had been made by 
them; but from wan£ of proper knowledge of its quali- 
ties^ or of fufficient perfeverance in the labour it requir- 
ed, nothing, of confequence was effectuated. What was 
done by the late Mr. Hall, within his enclbfures, ferved, 
however; as a pattern and encouragement to other heri- 
tors, to engage in the experimental Work ; and it happen- 
ed, fortunately, not only for the better agriculture in the 
pariih, but of the neighbourhood, that two gentlemen, 
the late Mr. Home of Ninewells, and Mr. Molle bf Eaft 
Mains, found it convenient, to take their whole lands in- 
to their own management ; a circumftance requifite, when 
new methods of culture, or new manures, are to be tried 
in any part of the country, before the tenants can be fup- 
pofed to aflume them into practice. Thefe proprietors 
became real farmers of their eftates ; and rending con- 
stantly in the country; not only improved their own 
knowledge in agriculture, but foon taught the tenants, 
near them, to correct, various defects and errors attend- 
ing its ordinary courfe. This was done with the more 
effect, as the enterprifes of thefe gentlemen were gradu- 
ally carried on ; and, in point of expenfe, little exceeded 
what the farmers, who had any confiderable flock, could 
■afford. From them, leffons Were taken of more aflidu- 
»u S and earlier ploughing ; offtraight, and clofer ridges;

of water furrowing; of feed well winnowed, or changed, 
and the more effectual working of the lands in fallow. 

The teds of marl, fo precious in eftimation by the 
gentlemen, did not correfpond to what the tenants expect 
ed from the ufe of it, as a manure. 300 loads of it re- 
quired to an acre of ground, was found an infuperable la- 
bour : however great its ultimate benefit was underftood 
to be, its lumpj and hard fubftance did not diflblve, fo as 
to incorporate thoroughly with the foil, in lefs than 4 or 
5 years ; a return too tardy to be waited for, by thofe 
who had their annual rents to pay. Only a or 3 of 
the ableft farmers in the country, who had long, and 
eafy tacks, ventured to continue, in a certain extent, the 
ufage of it ; others, who had come under engagements to 
marl 2 or 3 acres, in the courfe of a year, either failed 
in the performance, or importuned their landlord for a 
relaxation from it *.

* The difcovery and proof of the prolific power and quick effect of 
lime, efpecially upon new lands, gave hopes of its being adopted ft 
place of marl, to the equal contentment of the proprietors and tenants, 
Although the lime was not to be got nearer than from the Berwick kilns, 
or thofe on the other fide of the Tweed, both of them at the diftance of 
30 or 11 miles, yet the quantity of it necefiary to an' acre being only 19 
or 1 2 cart loads, taken up in fhells, which, if well burnt, produced the 
double in flack lime, the difadvantage of the carriage appeared to be 
compenfated. But, Hill, the purchafe-money being added to the car- 
riage of the lime, rendered the expenfe of both too heavy for the te- 
nants; who, not yet allured of all the benefit of the lime manure, were 
not difpofed to engage in it, but upon certain terms, with their m af- 
ters. When leafes were entered into between them,, a compromife 
commonly took place about the lime to be laid upon the lands ; a 
fixed quantity of which being carried home by the former, was to be 
paid for by the latter. Much to the advantage of the tenants, who lived 
at no greater diftance from the lime kilns than Chirnlide, 'as this agree- 
ment was, the benefit of it was not taken to the extent it might hav* 

been :

If the more abundant crops of corn, confequent to the 
melioration of the foil, had not been followed with a rife 
of the value of that commodity, the tenants in the county- 
of Berwick, would hardly have been in any better cir- 
cumftances than thofe in the pooreft Lowlands of Scot- 
land. It has been obferved, what fhifts they were often 
put to, even when agriculture was in the loweft ftate, a- 
bout difpofing of their ground to any advantage. The 
average price of every kind of it, was confiderably below 
that of the Lothians. The cuftom had long obtained of 
having a larger firlot, than the ftandard one ; and, as the 
quantity of corn was increafed by better cultivation, and 
manure, they found it necefiary to allow the gratuity of a boll 



to 



been : fo common and natural is the fear and doubt about the fuccefs of 
any new fcheme to thofe who, by the failure, may incur irreparable lofs. 
Some tenants would run no hazards until they faw fuller proofs of the 
fertilizing quality of the lime. Others, blundering in their manner of 
applying it, threw it upon wet ground^ or buried the fubftance under 
deep furrows. But thefe miftakes being corrected, and the fructifying 
power of the lime becoming more and more vifible, the tenants were 
fatisfied with fmalle'r allowances of it in gratuity ; and the more enter- 
terprifing of them hefitated not to purchafe it. The change made by it 
upon unopened lands, excited a demand for large outfield farms, in pre- 
ference to the confined infield. The beft of the former, and what in- 
cluded fome of the latter, generally rofe from 3s. to 5s. The S. croft of 
Chirnfide, appropriated to the acre-men, gave from iz to 15s. If fome te- 
nants, who, before the efficacy of lime was known or fuffkiently proved, 
had leafes of 19 years, and at a low rate, granted them, and yet, for 
want of flock, or of a fpirit of enterprile, did not become fo wealthy as 
they might have been, we need not admire, if we reflect again upon 
what has been faid of the low prices of corn and cattle, thofe difcou- 
jaging circumftances to the hufbandman, and which could not be reme- 
died, but by the gradual advancement of commerce. It may be added, 
that it is fit, and providentially well ordered, that no new difcovery or 
improvement, even in the molt neceffary arts, fhould be carried rapidly 
to its perfection, but that, by a progreffive knowledge and ik.il! in it, 
net 1, but a or 3 generations may have fome (hare, in the benefit.

to the fcore, for the encouragement of merchants ; which 
has been bat lately l aid afide. It has been flnce th 
bat the gentlemen farmers, and the tenants, were too 
liberal in this conceffion, fince that country, which had 
the a reports of Berwick and Eyemouth, could, and 
did, in fome years, furnilh from 46,000 to 60,000 bolls of 
corn to the market, would have been conilantly applied 
to, without fuch inducement by the corn-merchants at 
Edinburgh, and other towns. It had, however, a good 
cffed ; zs inflead of commiffions being only given to cor- 
refponderits at the fea-ports, to purchafe certain quanti- 
ties of grain, the agents of the merchants came, and, re- 
ading in Berwick for fome time, dealt themfelves with 
the farmers upon the fpot. This market, before but par- 
tially opened, gave frefh vigour to the operations of the 
plough, and prompted, efpecially, the preparing and ma- 
nuring of more land, for wheat crops, that brought round 
fums into the hands of the hufbandmen. Their gains 
were, as yet, no more than what their great expenfe, in 
the purchafe of lime, and their other labour, required: 
But the honeft ground of that wealth, to which they af- 
terward attained* was now laid on that perfevering in- 
dustry, j 0 ; ne d with much economy in their manner of 
living, which they continued to practife and exemplify. 

Chirnfide Hill was as much, and rather more, adapted, 
to pallurage, than to agriculture ; and it has been men- 
tioned, what fcores of iheep, and black cattle, traverfed 
the common field. Confined within the bounds of each he- 
ritors polTeffion, after the divifion of the lands, it requir- 
ed fome time, on the part of the gentlemen farmers, be- 
fore either their pafture, or their breed, could be amend- 
ed. Purpofes of this, particularly with refpe£t to the 
ftieep, were entertained ; but, as yet, the enclofures, ex-

tcpt thofc of Whitehall, were few, and not properly pre- 
pared to receive them. The few wedders and ewes, kept 
by the gentlemen for domeftic ufe, had inftruded thera 
in the profits to be made of this ufeful animal ; than 
which, if duly fed, and attended to, no other can be turn- 
ed to more account. The laying down of lands, manu- 
red, and in good condition, for pafture, was one of the 
greateft obje&amp;s in hufbandry j becaufe, by means of it, 
land could be relied from exhaufting corn crops, and yet 
produce what was equal to the bell value of them. This 
could not be doubted, when experience Ihowed what 
fields, of a more early, and fweeter grafs, than the natu- 
ral kind, could be obtained, by the fowing of white clo~ 
ver-feed. The ufe and advantage of the red clover, mix- 
ed with rye-grafs feed, had alfobeen proved in the luxu- 
riancy of its crops, that might be cut for the labouring 
cattle, or made into hay. The neighbourhood of Nor- 
thumberland, where much attention had been paid to the 
breed of horfes, alForded the opportunity of improving 
that of the country, when now the ploughing with 
oxen began to be difufed, and, in the lighter lands, the 
more expeditious and tradable two-horfe draught, to be 
adopted. In general, it appeared, by the improvements 
in hulbandry made by tjie gentlemen farmers, that its 
progrefs was fuch, as to combine the proper and advanta- 
geous breed of all the live ftock upon farms, and efpecial- 
ly that of Iheep, with the growth of corn. Whence might 
be added, the profits of the diary, to thofe of the barn- 
floor i and, in particular feafons, the defefts of the latter 
lje, in fome meafure, compenfated by the benefits of the

Statiftical Account 

In confequence of all thofe improvements, agriculture 
and hufbandry, in the two baronies of the parifli, were 
faft advancing to that fignal ftage at which they are now 
arrived. Not only all the infield, but almoft the whole 
outfield and moor-land, was, from the year 1770 to the 

1780, 

tr,ied with much fuccefs. A vegetable that could be eafily reared, and at 
little expenfe, which, defirable at the tables of the rich, afforded a whole - 
fome and cheap food to the poor, and might be ufed in place of bread, 
appeared to deferve the attention and labour of the hufbandman in a great 
degree. But the production of it in large quantities, was foon found t» 
reduce the value to little or nothing. As it could not anfwer all the pur- 
pofes of corn-meal, it could never be made fuch an object to the cultiva- 
tion of land, or the public in general, as the latter. Crops of potatoes 
came, therefore, to be regarded as fubfidiary only to thofe of grain ; fo 
ufeful, indeed, that they could not be ^wanted in the moft plentiful years ; 
and, in thofe of fcarcity, would keep lower the price of meal, when poor 
families, having the refource of potatoes, would require fmaller quanti- 
ties of it. The fine light mould of Chirnfide crofts, was well adapted to 
their production ; and accordingly, all the common kinds, were advanta- 1 
geoufly cultivated by the acre-men ; while the farmers found it of equal 
benefit to themfelves and their cottagers, to have a proper fupply of them, 
in every feafon. In this ftage of agriculture, and from about the year 1750, 
or 1765, the S. croft land had rifen from 12 and 15, to 16 and 20 (hil- 
lings. The price of a fummer's grafs for a cow, in an enclofure, was a gui- 
nea; open, but improved fields, laid down in grafs, were rated at IS (hil- 
lings : Still the value of land was advanced, not .only iin fields of 10, 20, or 
30 acres, but in extenfive farms. A great encouragement to it arofe from 
the cultivation and growth of field turnips ; by means of which a food, 
cheaper, and more nouriihing than hay, could be procured for the winter 
maintenance of (heep and black cattle. Befides this important ufe, no 
plant was found to meliorate the land fo much, by delivering it from 
all weeds. It might bs cultivated to advantage, either in broad caft or 
in drills. The repeated hoeings requifite to reduce the immenfe vege- 
tation of the plants, fo that thofe allowed to remain might grow to a 
ufeful fize, might be reckoned the only confiderable expenfe attending 
the culture of the turnips, fed on which, more milk could be got from 
the cows in winter ; the (heep and black cattle, kept in good condition, 
or fome of the latter being taken up and ftall-fed, might be fattened and

178?, either enclofed, or put into an improved condition. 
Knowledge and Mil, in the two great departments of 
farming, were gradually fo promoted, that in any offer- 
ed farm, whether by a firft entry to it, or by a renewal 
of his former leafe, every farmer of ordinary under- 
ilanding could judge of the reafonablenefs of the rent, 
and conditions propofed to him. What flocking was re- 
quired, what expenfe for lime, what mare might be 
taken by him in the coft of enclofures, and to what ac- 
count his proper management of the lands in culture, 
by the plough or in pafture, might be turned, were 
matters not of vague, but nearly of a juft and certain 
computation. By all the principal farmers, as well as 
the gentlemen, the powers of the feveral forts of 
ploughs, the Scotch, the Englifh, the feather ed-fock, 
and the plain, the drill, and others of later invention, 
were known, and fuch of them ufed as fuited the dif- 
ferent grounds to be laboured *. 

The chief difficulty in the letting, and taking of land, 
at the rates, to be immediately mentioned, appeared to be 

Vol. XIV. C relative 

* In the courfe of the period mentioned, when numbers of rtew farms 
were taken upon the outfield and moorland?, through the country, live 
ftock of every kind rofe to a high value, on account of the vafll demand 
for them. The yoke of oxen advanced from icl. and ill. to I5I. and 
1 61. ; and the fcore of fheep, of the beft Lammermuir breed, to about 
the fame fum. The price of horfes came to furpafs all conception. Thofe 
fufficient for the plough and cart could not be bought lower than IjL 
or 1 61. ; and the faddle ones of fize, bore much the fame price. This 
phenomenon continued, and, in late years, grew more wonderful, by the 
fHll greater rife of the horfe-market. It is afcribed to many' of the 
ableft farmers difcontinuing their ufual breed of horfes, while they be- 
ftowed fo much attenion to the increafe of their fheep and black cattle.

ground were to be opened, and manured with lime. Ex- 
perience had proved, that the foil, efpecially if light, 
might be fo ftimulated, as in 2 or 3 years, to lofe its fer- 
tility altogether, and could not admit of repair, but by 
being laid down in grafs pafhrre, for a confiderable time; 
reftriftions, therefore, were to be prefcribed to the tenants, 
with refped to this, by fpecial articles in their leafes. 
The limiting the quantity of fuch hurtful culture, and 
how long the land was to be refted, in cafe the leafe was 
to be extended to a n ».nber of years, afforded fome ground 
of difcord. The keeping up of the fences, either already- 
made by the landlord, or to be afterward reared bycom- 
paa with the tenants, at a mutual expenfe, like wife oc- 
cafioned herniation on the part of the latter. But where 
thefe points did not impede agreements, large farms 
were let in the parifh at feveral prices, from the low- 
eft at 12s. to the higheft at 20s. the acre, ; the inter- 
mediate rates, and thefe not reckoned the deareft, being 
about 16s. The fouth croft land rofe from above 2cs. to 
gcs , and that of the north to 25s. 

Having thus traced the progrefs, both of the value 
and improvements of the whole lands in the parilh, du- 
ring a courfe of 45 years, and mown how they kept 
pace with each other, the refult of the inveftigation pre- 
fents the comparative and ftatiftical eflimate of land 
property. The farms which, in the beginning of that 
period, gave, at an average, 3s. the acre, now give 12s. j 
and thofe at the medium of 5s. now afford 20s. ; whence 
the increafe of the real rent appears to be quadruple. 
That this advancement, apparently vaft, was no greater 
than the produce of the lands in their cultivated Hate,

.admit, we have this inconteftible proof, and which does 
much credit both to the landlords and the tenants :— In 
all the large farms, taken in the parifli, for 20 years 
back and more, there are only 2 or 3 inftances in which 
a change of the tenants (12 in number, when thofe of 
the mills are reckoned), has taken place; and in one 
of thefe inftances, there was a furceafe of the fami- 
ly of the tenant. With this fmall exception, the pre- 
fent tenants are either thofe who have fucceeded to 
former leafes of their fathers, or, being in poffeffion of 
their own for many years, have renewed them again . 
If it be afked, What are their circumftances ? The an- 
fwer is, They are not only thofe of credit and wealth, 
but that fome of the farmers are in fuch a degree of 
both, as will probably raife the rank of their families. 

But a miftake is here to be taken notice of, too rea- 
dily entertained, either by the invidious or the fuperfi- 
cial fpeculators, on what has been ftated above, of the 
quadrupled value of land property ; who, notwithftand- 
ing what has been proved, that the tenants have profited 
highly by this event, raftily conclude, that the proprie- 
tors are the only, or greatefh gainers in confequence of 
it. So far is this opinion from being juft, that it may 
be affirmed, on the contrary, that had the landlords, ei- 
ther here or in moft other parts of the S. of Scotland, 
forborn their exertions, and fpared their expenfes of 
improvement, their rents, in the progreffive courfe of 
trade and population in the Britifli dominicns, xvould 
have been, by this time, more than doubled to them. 
But it is to be prefumed, that fome of them, when they

in the manner, and to the extent, that has been repre- 
fented, there an increafed population mull take place. 
For, whether the proprietors retain and improve their 
own lands, or let them to tenants, the greater the ex- 
tent of the culture is, the more hands are required to 
carry it forward. To this afiertion, it will be objeaed, 
that the heritor may call around his manfion-houfe plea- 
fure-grounds, or extenfive fheep-fields, which employ 
lew labouring people; but, befides that the inftances of the 
firft cafe are rare, and confined to the greateft proprie- 
tors, it is to be confidered, that unlefs mere wilderneffes 
be created by them, in place of fine lawns, or walks of 
pleafure, fuch works, as the latter, cannot be accomplifh- 
ed without a vaft deal of previous cultivation, and calling 
in labourers of feveral kinds. As to their fheep-fields,, 
if t ue flock much exceed one convenient for domeftic fer- 
vices, they muft have the knowledge, and exert all the 
k attention, of real hufbandmen, to find this fole ufe of their 
lands always profitable ; for even the beft fubftitution of 
the management will prove defective. Thus, in the or-, 
dinary courfe of things, it muft come to pafs, as it ought 
to do, that the proprietors of lands, to whom it belongs 
to begin all new improvements, and to verify in practice 
their good effects, will not find it for their intereft, or 
their pleafure, to aft the part of real farmers, for a length 
of time, and beyond a moderate extent. It is their pro- 
vince to fhow, what may, and fhould be done ; but as the 
utmoft reach of their labour is limited, and muft be flow 
in the progrefs, the exteniion of agriculture over any 
large diftridt of a country, muft be looked for, and can

pn ly come from the letting of farms to tenants ; that 
elafs of people, who, accuftomed to all the care, induftry, 
and labour required in hufbandry, will be able to produce 
more from their fields, aad make more of what is produ- 
ced, than any landlord can do. 

It has been faid, and often repeated and believed, that 
the letting farms of large extent to tenants, as well as 
the retention of them in the hands of the proprietors, 
was a great and public grievance, and the caufe of the 
depopulation of many of the old villages in Scotland. But 
that, furely, cannot be called a grievance, which, in its 
aim and hTue, was productive of the greateft public 
good. The queftion was, How the outfield lands 
were to be brought to a ftate of culture ? Thofe lands 
that lay without the reach of dung, and to which 
none could be afforded, and that for fucceffive ge- 
nerations, had yielded only fuch miferable crops, as 
were not worth the labour. Without a migration of 
tenants to them, or the proprietors becoming the farm- 
ers, there was not a poffibility of their being meliorated. 
But what tenants could, or would go forth to an en- 
terprife new, and jultly accounted hazardous to them? 
None, certainly, but thofe who had fome more Hock, 
and either fuperior Ikill or more boldnefs, than others. 
Even to fuch, the removal from the. known infield cul- 
ture to the bare outfield, would appear a fort of exile, 
and a riMng of their fubftance. They had, therefore, 
many allowances made to them by the landlords ; — 
leafes as long as they defired ; and when the manure 
of marl and lime was introduced, other advantageous 
concemons that have been mentioned. Yet, upon the 
divifion of the barony lands, there were only three of 
fuch farms fet off by the late Mr. Hall. In confequence 
of 2 or 3 of the tenants in the village removing to thefe

tioned ; efpecially when it is conlidered, that their room 
would be fupplied either by other tenants, or the ac 
■ count of their families equalled by the addition made to 
the numbers of Mr. Hall's day-labourers, called groat 
men; of whichaconfiderablenumberwas retained through- 
out the year, for the purpofes of ditching, hedging, and 
fence-building, and other works carried on in the exten- 
five plantations of Whitehall. The 2 other heritors, 
who farmed their own eftates, found it necelTary, for 
fimilar reafions, to keep their people about them ; f 0 
that, for a courfe of years, the village continued to have 
nearly the fame number of houfes and inhabitants. Nor 
Were thefe diminimed by the prefent proprietor ; who, 
engaging in operations of hufbandry, extended over al- 
moft the whole of his lands, required fo many plough- 
men, or hinds, and work people of feveral forts, that 
they and their families were not reckoned, at a grofs 
compenfation, to be fewer than 93 or a ice, kept up 
during a currency of 10 or 12 years. This circuinftance 
merits fpecial attention, when we come now to give an 
account of the population of Chirnfide, increafed much 
beyond what could be expected frcm any particular ad- 
vantage in its local fituation (excepting its falubrity, and 
its free ftcne quarries), and furpaffing that of any other 
fuch village in the fliire *. 

The 



* Advanced cultivation of the fields brings along with it an augmented 
population to every village, or townfhip, in adjacency to it, unlcfs ther$ 



of Chirnfidc. 



The Statement now to be given of the prefent popu- 
lation of the village and parilh of Chirnfide, will fuffi- 
ciently verify what has been afferted of the unquestion- 
able effed of the land culture, to advance it in a fignal 
degree, in any other fuch country place, which has the 
advantage of a natural good foil, and where the land- 
lords are not referved in granting feus, or many years 
leafes of grounds for houfes ; although that village were 
bat indifferently favoured, by the fituation, for the intro- 
duction of any very confiderable manufacture. This 
confideration deferves more regard than what now ap- 
pears 

Be, what obtained too long in many places of Scotland, an averfion on the 
part of the heritors, to grant grounds for houfes and areas neceffary to 
them, either in the mode of feu tenures, or of long leafes, reckoned equi- 
valent to them. The objections to thefe tenures, as either difadvantage- 
ous, or inconvenient alienations of their property, were not foon overcome 
among the landlords in general. But offers and folicitations for them be- 
coming more frequent, it appears, that, in the year 1767, 9 of chem had 
been admit. ed by Mr. Hall, and his predeceffor, in the form of long leafes; 
yet it was not till the year 177c, that a progreffive addition, both to the 
rented houfes of the village, and thofe in leafes, was gradually carried on, 
to the 1790, which may be reckoned that of the prefent eftablilhment of 
the village as to the number, and condition of its houfes; although, in the 
two following years, fome new ones were built. In this manner, while 
the principal heritor added to his houfes in property, a certain number at 
intervals of time, and granted fuch kafes of grounds, as have been men- 
tioned, to purchafers, a new town may be faid to have been built between 
the two, in the ccurfe of zr or %% years ; the former being reckoned to 
have erected 20 houfes, and the latter z6. Thofe of the proprietors build- 
ing are, fcveral of them, accommodated to the reception of a or 3 families, 
and i or z capable of concaining as many more ; fs that there cannot be now, 
as formerly, any computation made of the number of families from that 
of the houfes. All the new ones are neatly conftru&amp;ed of free ftone, fome 
of them having z, and others 3 (lories ; 31 , or more of them, are covered 
with red tiles, and 5 with blue flates ; and a few, for which other heri- 
tors have afforded ground, have the lately approved covering of the corded 
thatch.

pears to be paid to it ; when our fpeculations of ad"* 
vancement in opulence and population are turned, al- 
moft wholly, upon the multiplication and encourage- 
ment of cotton-mills, and other .fuch manufactures, as 
correfpond not only to the domcftic ufe and confumption 
of their articles, but fuppofe the greateft imaginable 
foreign demand for them, the benefit of which cannot 
be long aflured to any particular nation, from the rival- 
fiiip of it in o^her countries, the change of fafhion in 
clothes and drefs, and the variable, and often Unaccount- 
able fluctuation of commerce from one feat of it to an- 
other. The only commodities that have a never-failing 
confumption, and a perpetual requifition for them, are 
the firft gifts of Providence to man, the fruits of the 
earth, improved and extended by his labour, and the 
cattle multiplied over a thoufand hills. In the pofleflion 
of thefe, the natural llrength of any nation is placed, 
and the riches derived from them are fure. The Bri- 
tilh ifles, peculiarly fuited to the attainment of this in* 
ternal and permanent opulence, require only to join to 
it, and their home manufactures, the fiflieries of their 
feas, to have a population unimpaired by long unhealth- 
ful foreign voyages, and unconfumed by the flifperfion 
of their inhabitants, in colonies, over every climate of 
the earth, which, not thriving, are the burials of them ; 
and when profpering, either draw more benefit than they 
give to the parent countries, or throw altogether oiF their 
connexion with them. But if, in the world of Europe, 
as it has gone for fome centuries, and may proceed, 
there be fome political neceflity, that fuch commercial 
and colonial enterprifes mould be promoted, yet, fure- 
ly, the ardour for them, whether it arifes from a fup- 
pofed augmentation of public credit, and branches of

/enue, or party gains, ought not to be pumed fo fat 
as to be injurious to the internal welfare of the people 
at large. It will be endangered, and fuffer feveral ways* 
if a proper balance between agriculture and commerce 
be not attended to, and, as much as poffible, maintained. 
If, for the fake of working up a multiplicity of ma- 
terials for the purpofes of the latter, the bulk of 
oar common people be drawn into the cities and ma- 
nufaduring towns, fo that the country villages, whence 
muft come food and pro virions for the whole com- 
munity, are left with a fcarcity of labourers in huf- 
bandry, the farmers mull then either pay fuch ex- 
travagant wages as the defective number of thern will 
infift upon, and consequently raife the prices of their 
corn and cattle, or elfe be induced to diminiih the land 
culture, and look for their profit to their live flock, 
which can be managed with the fewer! hands. In years 
unfavourable to the growth of corn, this abatement cf 
its fowing will be fenfibly felt. A loud cry, for its 
dearth, foo'n comes from the manufacturing towns. The 
journeymen threaten to leave their work, or to have 
higher wages. Perhaps, too, a manufacture unfuccefs- 
ful, or not anfweririg the expectations of its matters, 
breaks up. The dilbanded workmen crowd into cities, 
already in tumult, and increafe the unhappy commo- 
tions. 

But, here, dropping this dif agreeable part of the fub- 
fect, we only fubjoin, that every landlord, who, by his 
encouragement of agriculture, and affording room for 
the ellablifliment of houfes, cherifhes the village in- 
duftry and population, is worthy of much praife. He 
promotes that labour abfolutely necefTary to the life of 
man, and which, while it multiplies the fpecies, tends

to preferve them, in a Hate the leafl liable to be cor- 
rupted ; and proves a counter check to the employment 
of the great body of the common people in thofe arts 
which the prevalence of luxury, and the unbounded ex- 
tenfion of foreign commerce require, but that are not 
earned on in any nation, without the morality of the 
lower, claffes being vitiated to fuch a degree, as may 
foon become deftruclive of its welfare.

Sheep, Black Cattle, &amp;c — It is almoft unneceffary to 
ftate the number of fheep, black cattle and hoifes, either 
in the barony, or whole parifh of Chirnfide, compa- 
ratively, with what it was 30 or 40 years ago; for 
it is not in the fuperior number, but in the better 
•breed and condition of thofe animals, that the great dif- 
ference appears. It is fuch, indeed, in boththefe refpefts, 
throughout the parilh, as to be in proportion to the pre- 
fent general meliorated ftate of the land, compared with 
its former fterility. Befides the improvement of the breed 
of the fheep by commixture with the larger kinds of 
Cheviot, and the North Riding of Yorkihire, which the 
gentlemen farmers, and the tenants of the richefl lands 
have procured, even the original Lammermuir fort has 
grown much in fize, and in the value of their fleeces, by 
their better pafture. Of the firft, none are fold lower 
than 30 s., and the fecond give a guinea, and above it. 
Neither of them are expofed, as formerly, to be ftarv- 
ed, for want of fodder in the winter ftorms ; but both 
have, befides fome quantity of hay, the more ample pro- 
vilion of the field-turnips made for them. Of the two, 
fo bred and nourimed, we can reckon in the barony a- 
bout 80 fcore ; while the flocks in the extenfive farms of 
the two Idingtons and of Blackburn, may be computed 
at near a half of that number. The black cattle in the 
barony, including in it, as before, the farms of Nine- 
wells, are not fewer than' 14 fcore. The oxen are either 
of the Fife breed, or thofe got at the tryfts of Falkirk 
and Crieff. Some of them, when put into good condi- 
tion, are fold, at the Dunfe and Berwick fairs, to Eng- 
lifti drovers ; others are difpofed of at home, either for 

working cattle, or for the butcher. The flail and tur-

nip-fed are, fome of them, of the large Englilh breed. 
The cows are of various kinds ; but moftly (excepting 
a few Highlanders) of the Dutch or .large fize. The 
number of horfes taken up, in the 1792, as liable to the 
ftatute labour, and comprehending in it 16 mares with 
foals, amounts to 173; and to it, notwithftanding the 
prefent enormous price of horfes, we may, at a guefs, 
add 15 or 20 more for the faddle. 

Upon the whole of the agricultural improvements, 
and the population of the parim, it is to be remarked, 
not only that the latter is founded upon, and grows 
from the former ; whether in any country village or 
townfhip, or in the other parochial diftricts, but that 
the increafe of the population of both will be more or 
lefs, according as the improved land about the village is 
either readily let in finall portions, feued, or in leafes of 
many years, by the proprietors, or with referve, or a 
reftri&amp;ion to yearly tenants. Wherever the artificers 
and tradefmen thrive, they will naturally defire to make 
purchafes upon the molt liberal footing ; and they will 
prefer having them, and give the moft for them in the 
places of their habitation, and where they have already 
acquired houfes and yards. They, by this means, are 
fixed upon the fpot, and their pofterity will not migrate 
from it. In the admimon of yearly tenants of acres, or 
portions of them, a preference is always due to the 
married, before the unmarried. The former, indeed, 
are moftly thofe who require to be accommodated with 
pieces of land ; and it deferves particular notice, how 
much the meliorated ftate of it enables the meanefi: of 
them, who are induftrious, to fubfift their families. Out 
of an acre, although rented at 30s., a day-labourer, 

without 



Of Chimfide. 29 

without any other expenfe but that of the ploughing, 
and without abftrafting above 2 or 3 days of his earn- 
ings throughout the year, can raife, in crops of corn, 
potatoes, turnips or clover, what is, at leaft, of 5 1. va- 
lue to him, and what he could not obtain with that mo- 
ney. The maintenance of his cow, through the winter, 
that molt neceflary article attained by him, is done equal 
to 25s. or 3 cs. of that fum. All the other labour his 
little field requires, is performed by him, and his wife 
or family, at fpare hours. The difference between him 
and the artificer is, that he does no daily work at home, 
and yet is confined, within a certain diftance, for his 
employment ; and therefore he engages himfelf, at a 
low daily wage, for the whole year, unlefs he can de- 
pend upon having jobbs of weekly work in continu- 
ance. Excepting the fmiths and weavers, the other ar- 
tificers and trades people can eafily change their abodes, 
where they have not made purchafes of houfes ; as they 
have, fo generally, done in Chirnfide, from the encou- 
ragement given them, joined to the facility and cheap- 

nefs of the quarries *. , • ■ -

* If to this fixed population of the village be added, that of dividing 
the large farms into fmaller ones, with leafes only of a moderate extent 
the population iu the parochial diftrifts will emulate that of the village ; 
and in the refpe&amp;s that have been mentioned, its increafe will be prefer- 
able to it. That the proprietors fee this public advantage to be confiftent 
with their particular intereft, appears by the fubdivifions already made in 
feme of the greater farms of the parifli. Like all other matters that have 
a natural courfe, this meafure cannot fail, gradually, to be followed; fo 
that, as it was found neceflary, in the firft improvement of land, that ei- 
ther the heritors themfelves Ihonld take large quantities of it into their 
pwn hands for melioration, or elfe let it extenfively, in leafes of many 

years

Of Chlrnjidc. 



That the ancient Caledonians did not confume with 
fire, but limply inter their dead, and that the monu- 
ments of their graves were only the heaped clod, or the 
grey Hone ; whence fubfequently came the accumulated 
cairns, in conformity to the traditional ordinance of the 
Norwegian, or Danilh god of war, Woden, has been, 
commonly admitted among antiquaries. But it is con- 
tended by fome of them, that the South Britons had 
adopted the cuilom of burning the bodies of their dead, 
from their continental neighbours in Armorica (the in- 
habitants of Bretagne) in ancient Gaul ; who are faid 
to have praclifed it, even before the Romans ..invaded 
Britain : yet, although this be a very difputable point, 
it is not doubted, that the ufage of the .conquerors had 
been partly followed, not only by the natives of the 
fubjugated countries is the S., but alfo by thofe who 
dwelt between the 2 Roman walls ; fome of whom being 
frequently in leagues, and profefled amity with that ci- 
vilized people, learned, as their hiflorians affirm, many 
of their cuftoms and arts. .Hence, it is alleged, that 
fuch numbers of their fort of fepulchral urns have been 
dug up, in places where the Romans are not known to

near the place where fuch fepulchral remains, as thofe defcribed, were 
found, fome Roman troops, if not an army, had taken, not only their paf, 
fage, but a temporary ftation ; efpecially, as it would require fome fpace of 
time for burning, in their manner, and collecting the bones 0 f their dead 
orflain; who, when of rank, were diftinguifhed, by having fome more

* But, independent of the veftige of a Roman highway, which is not 
difcoverahle in any part of the county, hut very apparent in the neigh- 
bouring, and more inland one of Tiviotdale, about Jedburgh or Caerton 
Common, we have the beft authority, (that of Tacitus, in his life of Agri- 
cola), to affert, that this famous commander of the Roman legions marched 
in this tract of the eaft coaft, when, after having invaded Scotland in one 
campaign, he entered it again with more powerful forces. His land ar- 
my, fays that hiftorian, was conducted by him fo near the fea, as to keep" 
light, as much aspoffible, of his fleet, that failed along the coaft. This could 
not pofiibly be done by him in thispafs of the country, to any advantage, if 
he marched his army northward, at a greater diftance from the fea, than 
that of Chirnfide Hill. In a mile or two beyond it, the hills of Lamnier- 
muir arife, and are fo caft, as to allow only of fome peeps of the fea. With- 
in its diftance, almoft every eminence fhows it in more extended views ;' 
befides this paffage into Eaft Lothian being Ihorter, and lefs mountainous.' 
But, we fhall fuppofe, that he kept ftill clofer to the fea, which is moft 
probable, and directed his march on this fide of the Tweed, fo near as the 
towns of Ay ton and Coldingham now ftand, yet it is hardly to be thought, 
that he would have no detached party of his troops, to cover the flank of 
his army on that fide, when he was entering into a pafs of the country, 
unavoidable and difficult. If fuch a neceffary detachment was made only 
at a or 3 miles diftance, to obferve the enemy, their route, a little weft- 
ward from the main body, would either bring them to Chirnfide Hill, or 
very near its border. Accordingly, in favour of this fuppofition, what do 
we meet with, hardly fo far as the throw of a javelin from its fouth extre- 
mity, but, on the other fide of Whittadder that bounds this parifh, and on 
the ground of the Allanbank eftate— a place called Cheftcr-knows, a 
name of aufpicious import to the antiquary, when he inveftigates the 
progreffion of the Roman arms in Britain. ' In that place, he might have 
beheld (as the writer of this account did 30 years ago), the confpicuous re- 
mains of an ancient, or very old military entrenchment. Mounds of 
earth, in fignal elevation, and evidently artificial, appeared to the eye, at a

Having here no remains of the Danilh, or Anglo- 
Saxon antiquities, but thofe of the cairns above men- 
tioned, we come to obferve what appearances there are 
of the feudal kind, efpecially as found in the eaft border 
of the two kingdoms. In every barony fo fituated, and 
of the nobler and more extenfive fiefs, there was gene-

confiderable diftance. On a nearer view, the ground occupied by them, 
riling towards Whittadder-bank, facing the north, and almoft perpendicu- 
lar, difcovered it to be well chofen for defence, on that quarter; while a 
double, or triple line of ramparts, fecured it upon its declivity, and where 
it was acceffible. They run E. and W., and in a ftraight direction* 
There appeared to be veftiges of two other lines, although much funk, and 
then partly invaded by the plough, which run from the extremities of the 
former towards the bank of the water. The whole entrenchment forming* 
a fquare, but here properly made dblong, on account of its contiguity to 
Whittadder, might have induced any antiquary to pronounce it, upon a 
furvey, a Roman one. Its ramparts are now very much dcmolifhed, yet 
not quite overthrown, by the repeated attacks of the hufbandman. It is no 
ilretch of fancy, but very natural to fuppofe, that a detachment of troops, 
moving from Cheftef-kuoWs north and eafhvard, in order to rejoin their 
main army, and having to pafs Belly«mire, in the direcr. aad proper line 
of their march, would be attacked by their enemies in the defiles to be 
made, at that deep bog, and fuffer confiderably in the encounter, although 
they might gain the victory. This (upon the fuppofition made), appears 
to have been the cafe with the Romans ; who, having repulfed their ene. 
mies, with the lofs of lbme of their captains, had tittieto find out the ridge 
of gravel upon the bank of the mire, and there formally depofit tbefr 
Urns. Before the .firft mentioned expedition of Julius Agricola into Scot- 
land, committed to him by Titus Vefpafian, about the 8oth year of the 
Chriftian a;ra, this country was but very imperfectly known to the Ro- 
mans, and any intercourfe With the natives, either in war or peace, hardly 
began, until he led his army as far as the Frith of the Taus, or Tay, and 
afterward exploring the coafls with his fleet, afcertained Britain, (via. Eng* 
land and Scotland), to be one iflaud.

ced angle of the latter, or where the bridge or caufe- 
waj over either of them led to the caftle, there was 
often a fort (fuch as that known at Dunfe, immediately 
below the town, connected with the caftle), called the 
Bar-nay, or Barnekin. Still more advanced, and, as 
the rife of the ground favoured the pofition, ftood the 
tower of watch, overlooking the country around it, but 
facing the quarter of the enemy. It either ftood fingle, 
and was of a conftruftion fit for fome defence, or being 
built commodioufly clofe by, or in adherence to the 
ftrong-houfe of fome of the vaflals, which therefore was 
called, corruptly, the Peel, and properly, the Pile-houfe, 
could be more eafily guarded from a furprife. In feve- 
ral places, the church fteeples, or bellfries, were fo fa- 
bricated as to ferve for the fpeculatoria, or alarm tow- 
ers. On this account, although they were otherwife 
refpe&amp;ed, they were frequently fet on fire by the fupe- 
rior enemy. Of a ftru&amp;ure no lefs firm, and often with 
thicker and ftronger walls, but lower, was ere&amp;ed the 
baftile, or prifon of the barony, or parochial diftricl ; 
and, upon fome eminence not far from it, was fixed the 
grim and terrific fpe£tacle of the gallows, or gibbet. 

In this parifli, there is a place called Old Caftles, hav- 
ing Belly-mire clofe on the north fide, with much bro- 
ken ground, and fome difcoveries of the foundations of 
buildings about it, which poij|t it out as the lite of the 
baron's caftle in fome early days. But as to any parti- 
culars relative to it, tradition is entirely filent *. 

• Yet a' probable reafon may be afllgned for this. The Earls of Dun- 
liar, who joined to their title that of March, and were early, and often ap- 
pointed wardens of the eaft border, had not their redlence here, but in Eaft 
Lothian ; although the barony of Chirnfide, moft probably appertained

The lafl mentioned veftige of feudal antiquity \ras 
that of the baftiles. Thofe prifons, having a Norman

eredion by the conqueror. They were more numerous 
in the marches of the borders than any where elfe, for 
obvious reafons, and they were alfo made much ftronger.

to them, and came afterward to be acquired by the family of Home. Both 
thcfe lords had, befides it, various fortreffes of far more importance to them. 
Between the two great proprietors, it is likely the baron's caftle here had 
been neglected, and allowed to fall to ruins. This is the more presumable, 
as its fituation, on the fouth fide of the bog, expofcd it to be affaulted more 
eafily by the Englilh invaders. The erecting another fort, on the oppofite 
fide of the mire, now called Ferny Caftle, appears to have been no way ne- 
ceffary, unlefs it was to fupply the defedt of the other. A tower, however, 
reported to have been built by an Earl of Dunbar, and conveniently fitu- 
ated for obfervation, hard by the church-yard, kept its place : its demoli- 
tion was not fo long ago, nor fo' entire, but that the late beadle of Chirnfide, 
and other old people, had feen its ruins, and its grooved ftones carried off, 
by the mafons. Whether the Earl of Dunbar and March, who, along 
w ithX.ord Douglas, met the Englilh warden of the marches, Lord Ne- 
ville, at Belly-mire, in the year 1586, for the purpofe of concluding a truce, 
as mentioned in the border hiftory, may be reckoned to have been that 
carl, who, according to tradition^ built or repaired the tower of Chirnfide, 
is uncertain; but the fact recorded gives occafion to obferve, why the 
place of a bog was appointed for fuch a meeting. It is accounted for, by 
confidering the violent and particular animofity, with which the parties, at 
war in the borders, were inflamed againft each other. Their conftantand 
mutual defiances, and incurfions, kept up refentment ; fo that when the 
wardens were to meet for negotiating a truce, the infractions of it among 
their armed trains, were always to be apprehended. To prevent their 
coming to blows or fcuffles, they were kept at fome diflance from each o- 
ther, by a {lough, or interfection of the ground, chofen for their meeting, 
until, at leaft, all the preliminaries were fettled between the wardens. 
Hence, Hauden ftank, and the Boundcn-road, are often mentioned as the 
places of their conventions, for treaties; and yet, even thofe precautions 
did not always prevail for their peaceable termination.

in the parts of the 2 kingdoms, liable to reciprocal and 
continual ravages. Towards their being tenanted, not 
only the prifoners of war, who were kept for mutual 
exchange, or until they gave pledges for their ranfom, 
but the many marauders and banditti, in time of peace, 
when taken, alfo much contributed. Although hang- 
ing was the common and ordained fate of the latter, 
there were parties of them protected by fome chiefs of 
the hords in the receffes of Cheviot Hills, whom it was 
found proper to fpare, from the dread of the moft at- 
trocious and bloody revenge of their deaths. On ac- 
count of thefe circumftances, the baftiles, on the eaft 
border of Scotland, and efpecially thofe in the Merfe, 
were built in the ftrongeft manner, and fo placed, as to 
fecure them from any open afTault, or concealed furprife, 
by an enemy fo near at hand, and ready to attempt the 
refcue of the prifoners. Of all the grounds in the pa- 
rim, that now called the Baftel-dikes, where ftiaped 
ftones, and fuch as are uied for cornices and lintels of 
doors, have been often turned up by the plough, is na- 
turally the moft fenced and inacccftible. It runs out in 
the weft end, like a promontory, upon the broad ftream 
of Whittadder, which there makes a turn upon its north 
banks, that are, at leaft, 150 feet high, and have little 
more declivity than an upright wall. Much broken 
J and, interfered with rivulets, fecures it on the north 
lide ; and it is only open on the eaft, where there is, 
firft, a floping defcent, and then a fteep path-way down 
to Idington Mill upon the water. The caftle, or ftrong 
houfe, of that village and barony, was alfo a clofe guard 
to it. This defcription of our old parochial baftile, leads 
to a remark, which, I know not whether it has been

always flood, they conftituted a chain of fortreffes, run- 
ning, partly on Whittadder and on Blackadder banks, 
from almoft the one end of the county to the other. 
Thus, we can reckon a line of them, at fliort diftances, 
in this neighbourhood, viz. Kello-baftel, in. Edrom pa-

# To conclude the antiquities, there are only two names of places in the 
parifh, befides Chirnfide, which require etymology, or explication. The 
firft is that of Pepperlaw, a (leading, or place of farm-houfes, fituated on 
an eminence, making part of the bank of Belly-mire. The name, although 
odd, is intelligible, when written, or pronounced, as it ought to he.. The 
Pepperlaw, which denotes the hill upon the fide of a muddy rivulet, fucH 
as iffues from a bog, or mire ; the word Pepper, being German, or Saxon, 
fignifies black pepper; and therefore, is applied to a dream of a black co- 
lour. It has indeed, its interpretation, in the name of Blackburn, given 
to the village, on the eaft fide of the mire, near which runs a brook of the 
fame fource, and complexion. An eafy fwamp, is, in fome places, called the 
Pepper , and, there is one well known by that name near Newbeath, in 
Eaft Lothian. The other name wanting derivation, is Idington, about: 
which I can only offer a flight conjecture, not having had opportunity of 
feeing its orthography in any old papers ; which, yet, I fufpedl may be 
Eddington, denoting a place where there are eddies, or deepening of the

to be an objeft to the farmers, and much lefs to the 
corn-merchants ; the former now buying their corn- 
iacks by dozens ; and the latter, by feveral hundreds to- 
gether, from the large fales of them opened in Berwick, 
Dunfe, and other places s which are fupplied from the 
manufaftures of Dunbar and Haddington, and alfo from 
London. It would appear, from the little attention paid 
here, and all over this country, to the growth of hemp, 
that there is naturally more folicitude about the filling* 
than the fabricating corn-facks ; yet this is not a fuffi- 
cient reafon for having no manufadure of them at all. 
Our old band of 12 weavers, however, is exaclly kept 
up ; if we add to the 10 prefent matters, 2 apprentices 
belonging to fome of them. Their looms, indeed, are 
not near fo much employed in the fabric of woollen 
cloth as formerly, when the wealthieft farmers t as well 
as the common people, were generally clothed from the 
webs made of the yarn fpun by their wives and female 
fervants. In the decline of this thrift, jnany years ao-o, 
the manufafture of linens, coarfe and fine, in various 
degrees, has chiefly occupied the trade ; and 1 or 2 of 
them wove linen equal to the beft Holland. They flill 
have reputation in this branch, to which that of the 
lint-fpinners, in the village, alfo contributes. Several 
of them are both expert and diligent, and, ufing the 2 
hand- wheel, will often accomplifh 2 flips of more than 
middling yarn in a day. The fale for it is ready, if not 
to the weavers at home, to the agents for the faftories 
at Edinburgh, appointed at Dunfe and other places.

the fpring, is over, and a fufpenfe of employment en- 
fues, there is always a call for fuch of them as are not 
engaged for fummer-fervice, to affift in the planting of 
potatoes, and performing the work of hoeing them, and 
the repeated weedings of the turnip fields. 

To what has been faid of the improved knowledge of 
the farmers in all the operations of the plough, we have 
to add, the advantage and convenience they find in the 
number of hinds, or bred ploughmen, expert and able 
to perform any agricultural work required of them, 
who appear, in the hiring market-days, at Dunfe and 
Berwick. Even when a half-year fervant is only want- 
ed for carting, and other common work upon a farm, 
there are few lads here at the age of 18 or 20, ufed to 
country fervice, who cannot occafionally fupply the 
place of a hind ; and, in lighter land, at leaft, manage 
the plough with propriety and neatnefs. It is owing to 
this early ufefulnefs of the young men bred in the coun- 
try to the farmers, that their wages, feveral years paft, 
were much raifed, and generally complained of, efpe- 
cially by thofe who could not employ them with equal 
advantage. When, at firft, the farmers were averfe to 
grant their demands, the fpirited and flouteft betook 
themfelves to Northumberland, where the tenants, pof- 
feffing long leafes, and having coal and lime at hand, 
were able to afford the greatefl encouragement to la- 
bourers of every kind. It mult be acknowledged, that 
many of them learned there to do their work more 
completely ; and fuch of them as returned here defer 
ved the wages they aiked. It is near 30 years fince no 
good labouring fervant could be got for lefs than 61. or 
above it, and now they are not hired below 81 or ol - 
which is jufl about the triple of their wages 40 years

ago, and wanting but a fourth of the improved value of 
the land, proves, that, in a free country, fuch as Bri- 
tain, the labouring people can never fuffer long by fmall 
wages, unlefs induftry generally ceafes, or is relaxed ; 
and that they will always, as they are well entitled, have 
their hire advanced, in proportion to exertions made in 
the ever-profitable labours of the fields. 

It is not to be forefeen, or eafily imagined, what accef- 
fions a country village may receive, in confequence of the 
grants of long leafes,or feus, to purchafers. Befides thrice 
the number of mafons and fmiths, four times that of 
Wrights and moemakers, and more than double that of 
tailors, without reckoning their apprentices, Hated in the 
preceding table, together with their matters, we have ot 
4 gardeners, 1 that keep nurfery grounds ; and among 
the merchants, I that is a dealer in corn, for himfelf, 
and alfo an agent, refident : and what there was yet lefs 
reafon to expect, in the number of publicans, i who has 
fucceeded fo well in that occupation, as to have erected, 
at a very confiderable expenfe, large buildings, for a 
brewery and malting, joined with a bakery. This en- 
couragement, in the vending great quantities of ale and 
wheat bread through the country, appears to be the re- 
compenfe due to his undertaking and induftry. Here 
we cannot help again recollecting, what was the cafe in 
the old village, where every fixpence worth of wheat 
bread was brought from Dunfe or Berwick ; when a 
houfe for a baker, and a feller of ale, built by the late Mr. 
Hall, was foon deferted by the tenants, and allowed to fall 
down, and the prefbytery's entertainment could only be 
found at the bellman's habitation. Yet, in thofe days,

Religion and Mdrals of the People.— The people, in ge- 
neral, are in religion fincere, and as little addicted to fu- 
perftition, or enthufiafm, as in any country parifli. Even 
fb far as the nominal religious divinons obtain among 
them, they operate not to rancour, or any obfervable de- 
pravation of the Chriftian temper and fpirit. Although 
Antiburghers and Burghers, to a certain number, have 
been known among them, almoft even fince the origin of 
Seceflion, and a Cameronian meeting-houfe has been late- 
ly erected in the middle of the village, the bulk of the 
people continue attached to the Eftabliflied Church. The 
individuals of families, that follow thefe fectaries, are con- 
fiderable in number ; but whole families of them are very 
few. Among the former, efpecially of the Burgher, or of the 
Relief claffes, there are feveral who frequent thofe congre-

Not contented with being, what fome of his fraternity were, in other 
places, the firft merchant is fmall wares, he formed the fcheme of carry- 
ing on his particular trade in afuperior manner. Well known in the coun- 
try, and having credit at Berwick and Dunfe, lie took from Mr, Hall % or 
3 acres of land. He purchafed % of the ftouteft horfes he could find ; and 
taking his travels ao miles up the country into Lauderdale and Gala 
Water, and paying for his eggs as he went along, he engaged fuch a num- 
ber of cuftomers in the line of his march, as furnilhed a complete load of 
them in his four large creels. Piled up nicely, they generally amounted 
from 1600 to 1800, and frequently exceeded that number. His market 
was Berwick, where the ftaple commodity for export to London, being 
eggs and falmon, his payment was fure and ready, for an article reckoned 
to make the annual return of above 6000 1. to the merchants ; while that 
of the other was eftimated at 8000 1. or 9000 1. To the benefit of this 
place, and that of his many cuftomers, who kept by him, he prefided in 
the trade for more than %o years, and got to himfelf confidcrable gain.

In the difcharge of Christian duties, and in the

ment, under the burden of them, are fuch as to require 
only fobriety and induftry, on the part of the men, to 
bring up their families in a creditable way. When thefe 
virtues are wanting, or fail in the hufbands, and the at-

their mates, unable to do more than their accuftomed

cry to a helplefs father ; they embrace his knees, when

accident brought a curious ftone into view. It had 
dropped from the top of a quarry, worked immediately 
under the defcribed Chefter-knows. Captain Home*s 
attention to it, was occafioned by the mafon's brum be- 
ing ftuck into it, and the Angularity of its having a hole, 
and its heavy weight, induced him to have it brought 
home. It is moftly of an orbicular form ; and although 
of a fubflance as hard as marble, it is perforated exaftly 
in the middle ; it is convex on all fides but one, which is 
flat i while its other furface is not only rough, but fret- 
ted, as if it had been artificially raifed into fmall notches. 
Its weight, yet untried, may be between i and 3 Hone- 
Upon confidering thefe particulars, it was fuggefted, that 
being evidently worked upon, and fitted to fome purpofe 
of art and utility, it might be the upper part of a mole- 
trina or hand-mill, for corn, fuch as was ufed by the Ro- 
mans in their campaigns. That it correfponded to this 
conjecture, is evinced from the aptitude of the perfora- 
tion, to admit an iron axis or fpindle, of near an inch 
thick, which, terminating in the focket of an under Hone, 
excavated for holding corn, and wide enough to receive 
into it this upper part ; and being moveable by a handle 
fixed to its top, could make the found ftone act as a grind- 
er of the grain, with all its power of attraction. Since 
palling this judgment upon the ftone, Captain Home has 
been informed, by the tenant of the ground, where the 
Chefter-knows are, that, in the courfe of his agricul- 
ture, he had met there with a large hollowed round 
llone, which, being funk 3 or 4 feet deep into the earth, 
was allowed to remain in its place. Whether this ftone up- 
on its being infpected, or dug up, may be the wanted tal- 
ly to that in Mr. Home's pofleflion, we know not ; but if 
the latter be itfelf judged, by the intelligent in fuch anti-

trenches upon the Chefter-knows can hardly be doubted 
to be the remains of an encampment, or temporary na-

Church, Manfe, Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c— That the 
church here may be 2 or 3 centuries old, appears from 
the architrave, or coarfe fluting of its principal door, 
and alfo from a ftone, of about a foot fquare, taken 
down at the rebuilding of the eaft aile, or old choir, 
having a few rude and faded characters upon it, which, 
juft legible, are thefe : Help the pvr (poor) ; and the. 
figures 1573, joined with them. That the church might 
be older than this fignature upon the choir aile, is not 
improbable, from the appearance its walls have of be- 
ing much pieced up in the inward fide. Its vaulted 
roof has been, many years fince, taken down, and con- 
verted into the prefent one of cupples, and blue Hate, 
with ferking of deals. It was, probably, among the 
£rft in this country fo covered ; the advantage of which, 
in point of interefl as well as propriety, when compared 
with the continual repairs of the thatched roofs, was 
long and late of being apprehended or admitted by many 
heritors. It is now in ordinary and tolerable condition, 
but has not yet received fuch decent reparations within, 
as are exemplified in feveral neighbouring churches *.

falary of the fchoolmafter is 100 merks Scots, or, which 
is near the fame, I month's cefs of the parifli. His 
houfe is prefently in good repair, and of fuch length, as 
affords a large room for the fchool. To his falary, are 
added, the emoluments of feflion-clerk and precentor* 
and that of an allowance for being collector and diftri- 
butor of the afieflments for the poor upon the parifli 
roll-— Thefe are levied, not at fixed meetings of the he- 
ritors, but occafional ones ; when intimation is made 
from the delk, that the former afieflment being expend- 
ed, a meeting of the heritors is defired, on a day men- 
tioned, to make a farther provifion for the poor. At 
their meeting, the account of the expenditure is prefent-

coniidered, and what alterations have enfued, or may 
be, from obferved circumftances, made in it ; fuch an

people not admitted upon the poor's roll. 

Notwithftanding the birth of Mr. David Hume hap- 
pened not at Ninewells, but at Edinburgh, this parilh 
may claim him as a native. He was bred up here from 
his infancy, and he never confidered himfelf as an alien, 
from the accidental locality of his birth. His monu- 
ment, erected upon the Calton-hill, at Edinburgh, where 
he died, is only infcribed with his name, and the year 
of his death. It is enough ; for (as this Ample figna-

found hollowed out, and of the capacity and lhape, proper to its being the

kUMBER II. 
PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443668">FENWICK</name>. 

(County of Ayr, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Irvine.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Boyd.</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent, Soil, Climate, X§c. 

FENWICK was erected into a new pariih in the 
year 1642, formerly being part of the parifh of 
Kilmarnock ; for this reafon, it went at firft by the 
name of New Kilmarnock. But, for fome time paft, it 
has been known by the name of Fenwick, from a fmall 
village of that name. If wick means the fame with 
uicus, the meaning may be, the village near the fen or 
bog. Wick, I believe, in fome places, meant an angle 
or corner. This would be defcriptive of its lituation, 
lying at the corner of what certainly once was a bog, 
and is Hill partly fo. The parifh church Hands at the 
diftance of 4^ miles from Kilmarnock, near the great 

G 2 road

StatiftUal Account 



road which runs through that town from Glafgow to 
Ayr, and almoil at an equal diftance from thefe two 
places. The parifh is about 9 miles long from E. to 
W., and 6 miles broad. When the disjunction took 
place, it was confidered as the moorland part of the pa- 
rim of Kilmarnock, and the foil in every part is mofly. 
In the lower part of the parifli, however, the lands are 
tolerably good ; and, in favourable feafons, yield not 
unfruitful crops of oats and bear, the only grain that is 
fown here ; when there is an open winter, as it is call- 
ed, and the following fummer is dry and warm, the 
crops are the belt. Long continued froft in winter, and 
rainy fummers, are exceedingly hurtful. The corns, 
in many parts of the parifh, are feldom fully ripened, 
and feldom yield meal for corn. This depends, how- 
ever, much on their fituation, either near the moors, or 
downward towards Kilmarnock or Dreghorn, where the 
lands are the beft. The air is far from being unhealthy. 
We cannot be faid to have any difeafes peculiar to the 
place. From their fituation, the grounds mull be damp, 
and the air moift, but no bad effefts follow. Some 
years ago, a fever prevailed in the village of Fenwick, 
but did not extend mueh farther. For many years, the 
/mall pox had not been in the parifh but in a few fcat- 
tered families. About the beginning of the laft year, 
1792, they began to make their appearance. They went 
through every corner of the bounds, and the numbers 
that had them were great ; but they were very favour- 
able. It was Half a year before one died, and only 3 
died in all. It is almofl unneceflary to add, that they 
all had them in the natural way. The prejudices 
againfl inoculation are great. Some even deem it a fin 
to give children any thing by way of preparation. 

Rivulets, 



Of Fenwick. 



53 



Rivulets, Surface, Fuel, &amp;c— Two confiderable ri- 
vulets, or waters, as they are called here, run through 
the parifli from E. to W. Both have their fources in 
the moor- grounds towards Eaglemam. They unite a 
little below Crawfordland Caftle, in the parifh of Kil- 
marnock, run through that town before it joins the 
water of Irvine, and at Irvine are emptied into the fea. 
They abound with trouts, and afford entertainment to 
thofe who are fond of fifhing ; and would be Hill more 
plentiful, were they not greatly deflroyed in the dry 
months by the hand. Salmon never ccme this way; 
which is owing, probably, to the waters being render- 
ed hurtful to them by the works carried on in Kilmar- 
nock. They very feldom do any harm to either grafs 
or corn. On their banks, there is not a bum. — This 
parifli, though high above the level of the fea, is not 
mountainous. To look at Fenwick, from Craigie hills 
in Kyle, it appears a large plain. The afcent from Kil- 
marnock, Kilmaurs and Dreghorn, is very gradual. At 
many fpots, almoft indeed from every farm and every 
houfe, the profpect. is mofl extenfive towards Kyle, 
Carrick, the Frith of Clyde, and the Ifland of Arran, 
with the tops of the hills in Argylefliire. From the i 
waters already mentioned, the lands have a N. or a S. 
expofure. The furface is green, and produces tolerable 
grafs. Though in fome'places there are large propor- 
tions of black heath, where the peats are cut, or grounds 
covered with heath and bent. The mofl: common fuel 
is peat. What coal is made ufe of is brought from 
Loudoun, from Kilkmarnock, and from Kilmaurs, at 
the diftance of about 5 miles from the church, and ra- 
ther to more above it. In the farmers houfes, very 
few coals are ufed. Formerly every tradefm'an had his 

peat 



54 



Statiftical Ac ecu nt 



peat ftack. But now they think it more profitable to 
ufe coals, than to fpend time in fummer at the mofs, 
and have onlj a few f or fummer ufe. 

Trades, ' Live-Stock, &amp;c.-Befides the village here 
called Fenwick-town, there is another, called- from its 
fituation, the Kirk-town. The laft Hands, for the moft 
part, upon the glebe, and contains about 42 , families , 
the fituation is wet. The other contains about 36 fa- 
milies ; the fituation is dry. The prevailing trades in 
the Kirk-town are Ihoemakers ; in Fenwick-town wea- 
vers. _ The laft is increafmg in houfes and inhabitants ; 
and, if trade continues, will increafe. Here alfo it is 
thought that a bleachfield might be fet up with confi- 
derable advantage. All the other inhabitants of the pa- 
rim are farmers, who plough fo much of their lands, 
and keep horfes or cows and ftieep in proportion to their 
farms. At prefent, there may be in the parifli 270 
horfes, many of them high priced , 2000 black cattle ; 
and, in the moor farms, 2300 Iheep, of the fmall moor- 
land kind, black faced and black legged. In other parts 
of the parifti, fome ftieep, from 6 to 8, of a larger kind, 
for the benefit of finer wool for family ufe. There are 
made butter-cheefes, after the Dunlop manner, or what 
is known by the general name of fweetmilk-cheefe. Andy 
in the feafon, they fell calves for the butcher, at very 
confiderable prices, boiaght up for the Glafgow market, 
befides what goes to Kilmarnock and Stewarton for the 
Irvine market. Butter and cheefe have both rifen of 
late very confiderably in their value, and t\e fale is al- 
ways good, when trade is good in Glafgow and Pauley. 
Though the corn crops are confiderable, yet the foil is

better adapted to pafture than to tillage, and might be 
made much more valuable. 

Agriculture.— A confiderable quantity of potatoes is 
railed, but moftly for the ufe of the family. The flax 
that is fown is alfo moftly for family ufe, little being 
fold ; and to fow, for the premiums, granted for that pur- 
pofe, is not known. The leafe oblige the tenant to lime 
a certain proportion of the land before ploughing ; but 
they all complain, that though it rifes to the appearance 
of a good crop, yet the corn either falls down and rots, or 
does not fully ripen, from the latenefs of the foil. Very 
little is laid down in grafs for hay ; their chief dependence 
for fodder being on the ftraw of their oats and bear, and 
and their bog-hay, which is often a laborious and tedi^ 
ous work. Rains here are much more frequent than in 
the parilhes farther down in the fame diftridt. The far- 
mers begin to labour, as foon as the weather in the fpring 
will permit, though, from the wetnefs of the foil, they 
muft be later than thofe who live in the drier lands far- 
ther down the country *. 

It is but a piece of juftice due the people of this parilh to 
obferve, that they are remarkably induftrious and attentive 
to their harveft-work ; by which means, they have often

the Hart of their neighbours, whofe limits "and climate 
would be much more favourable. When thej cut down 
their corns, they fet them up in fingle meaves, which is 
called gaiting ; by this means, if any thing wet, may foon 
dry. They let them Hand thus for fome days, but al- 
ways with attention to the Hate of the weather. If there 
is the appearance of rain, they fet all hands to work, 
even at midnight, and put them up in what are called 
Huts, built in the form of a rick of hay, and covered with 
two of the largeft and the wetteft meaves, called Hout- 
ings. They make their huts larger or fmaller, accord- 
ing as the fheaves are wet or dried. They keep the dry- 
nefs they take, even in very bad weather, except the 
houtings, which are neceflarily expofed; and, if well 
built, hardly any weather fpoils them. In this flate 
they Hand till the weather is good ; and whenever a fa- 
vourable opportunity offers, they are taken down, and 
expofed to the drought, if it be neceflary : what is dry is 
taken in, and what is unfit for the barn or barn-yard 
is hutted again. It is only when they need much work 
that there is any lofs of corn ; for the moft part very 
little. Laft feafon (1792), the advantage was great. 
We had, generally, all in the barn or yard, when others, 
who might, from more favourable circumftances, been 
thought to have been far before us, had a great deal to 
cut down, and the whole of their crops in the field for 
weeks after us. 

Plantations There are no woods in the parilh. In- 
deed very little timber of any kind ; fome few trees 
about feveral of the farm houfes, and fome young trees 
about the 2 villages, excepted. All the timber that is 
necsfiary for almoft any purpofe is brought at the dif- 

tance 



Of Fen wick. 57 

tance of feveral miles ; moftly from the woods at Lou- 
doun Caftle. It is to be regretted, that this has not 
been more attended to. In every farm, fome part 
might be planted, without either hurting the grafs 
grounds or the corn fields, which, if enclofed, and taken 
care of for a few years, would be of profit to the pro- 
prietor, for flielter to the cattle, and conveniency of the 
tenant. Mr. Forbes, merchant in Kilmarnock, who late- 
ly purchafed fome lands, has the honour of being the 
firfl who has done any thing in this way. But it is to 
be hoped, that his example will be followed by others. 

Population, &amp;c According to Dr. Webfter's report, 

the population then was 1113. The number of families, 
including the 1 villages, is about 244. The average 
number in each family will be 5, or rather more. Of 
thefe, the great majority are of the clafs called Burgher- 
Seceders, who left the Eftablifhment at the fettlement of 
the prefent incumbent. AKb a confiderable number of 
Antiburghers, of old {landing ; and thofe who call them- 
felves the Reformed Prefbytery, or thofe who adhere to 
the covenanted work of Reformation, whofe minifler, as 
he refides in the parifh of Kilmarnock, preaches in this 
parifh every fifth Sabbath. Itis"faid, that, in the laft 
century,- the Quakers began to make fome converts, but 
nothing of that kind is now known *.

In the parim, there are 46 weavers' looms, of which 
14 are muflin-looms ; and, I believe, there will foon be 
more. There are 16 fhoemakers ; 5 tailors, and their 
apprentices ; 3 wrights' mops ; 3 coopers ; and 1 fiax- 
drefler. We have 9 mafons, and 2 maltmen. It 
is now more common for the fons of farmers to 
be bound apprentices to fome of thefe trades than 
formerly. Many having learned the trades here, have 
gone to towns, and have fucceeded well. Some few have 
gone abroad. We cannot be faid to have any manufac- 
tures. One man may deal, to the extent of about 2ocl. 
a-year, in buying and manufacturing coarfe yarn into 
what is called brown linens, in flax-feed, and in giving 
out flax to be fpun by the women of the parim. Some of 
the fhoemakers work for the export trade carried on by 

the merchants of Kilmarnock In ordinary feafons, 

more meal is made in the parim than the inhabitants 
confume ; confiderable quantities go E. to Paifley, Glaf- 
gow, and the places adjacent, as the people have friends 
or connexions. Many, or moll of the farmers, fatten 
their own winter meat. A few fat cattle are killed for 
their ufe before harveft, and a few more are killed after 
it. But there is no market for butcher-meat. We get 
that from Kilmarnock. The meal is always 1 penny, and 
fometimes more, the peck, cheaper here than in the Glaf- 
gow and Paifley markets.

in the parifh more children and young perfons, than at prefent. There 
are many who live to an advanced age. One of Lord Glafgow's tenants, 
near po, comes to church almoft every Sabbath, through a bad road ; and 
in the year 17S4, Matthew Mowat, the bellman, died, aged above po. 
He had the charge of the parifli bell for above 80 years : His father and 
lie had held the office from the time that the parifli was creeled, till then.

* There is a houfe, the principal ftage for travellers between Glafgow 
and Kilmarnock, called the King's well. Tradition fays, that it got this 
name on the following occafion. One of the James's came W. to fettle 
forae. difputel at a place called Pothelly-hall, where are the veftiges, and 
no more, of an old tower. At the fpot where the houfe now ftands, his 
hqrfe drank out of a well, afterward called the King's Well, and alfo went 
into a quagmire, which ftill is known by the name of the King's Stable. 
On that occafion, he is faid to have earned to be hanged iS pf them who 
were in fault, upon an hawthorn tree, which is ftill pointed out, and, in- 
deed, has the appearance of being very old. It ftands fingle in a field of 
one of the farms above Pothelly-hall. Pethelly-hall, at that time, was 
inhabited by a family of the name of Cochrane, a branch of the family of 
Dundonald. They had confined the prifoners in a vault, till his majefty 
came. Being very hungry, as even kings will be, in a country thinly inha- 
bited, and ill fupplied with provifions, it is faid, that he went into an ' 
houfe, not fat from Pothelly-hall, and fat down. The gude-wife gave him 
bread and milk, the belt fare which fhe probably had. After he had made 
his breakfaft,fhe told him, that her hulband was one of his prifoners, and 
that it would be hard to hang a man, after having eat his breakfaft 
fitting in his arm chair. When he came to the place, he called firft 
for that man, and defired him to go home, and be a better bairn, before 
he proceeded to judge the reft. Another tradition fays, that the King's 
Well got its name from the things having happened there when his Majefty 
was on his way to attend the marriage of one of his own relations at Sorn 
Caftle, fome miles farther S. ; and that he fhouid have faid, from the dif- 
ficulties which he met with in palling through fuch bad roads, " that if 
" he were to play a trick on the devil, he would fend him to a bridal at 
" Sorn."

The firft minifter of this parilh was Mr. William- 
Guthrie, juftly famous in his time. He was ordained 
in 1644, eje&amp;ed in 1662, and died in the north in 1665.

Lord Glafgow is patron of the parifli. The church

was built in 1783; an excellent houfe, as all the new

middle of the Kirk-town, is not fb convenient. The 
itipend is 84 bolls and 4 pecks of meal, and 28I. fome

Far up in the moor grounds of the barony of Row-

his different eftates are. To this parifh, he fent 2 o gumeas, to be given

hundred years. The place is exceedingly remdte. And 
it is not likely that any, at that time, would have taken 
ilp their refidence there, had they not confidered it as a 
place where they were not in danger of being molefled. 
The matter of the family has been a John Howie for

Improvements may be faid to be only in their infan- 
cy \ here the tenant goes on in the fame old way that 
his father did ' before him. They are beginning, how- 
ever, to be at more pains with their farms in many re- 
fpefts'; and it is' to be hoped, that the fuccefs of fome 
may ftir up others. There are hundreds of acres which 
will not be touched till the country is every where in a 
higher ftate of cultivation than it is at prefent. But 
there are few farms where, with a little expenfe, much 
might not be added, if not to the corn fields, at leaft to 
the meadow and grafs grounds. But the farmer ufes 
the meadow which his predeceffors have made ready for 
him, and never thinks of adding any to it, how eafily 
foever it may be done. Some years ago, they began to 
work fome of the bent ground, as it is called, which

frad been limed, were luxuriant, but more ftraw than 
corn. Some fowed it the laft year that it was in tillage 
with grafs feeds, and the crop was good. But they 
erred in allowing the cattle to pafture on it too foon. 
The roots of the grafs were broken, the beft of the foil 
trodden down, and almoft the whole reduced to the fame 
ftate in which it was before. There is one, however, 
who is to be excepted, as not having followed the ge- 
neral practice. And if he who makes three blades of 
grafs grow where only one 'was produced before, de- 
ferves well of his country, his name ought to be men- 
tioned, as his example may be followed by thofe whofe 
grounds are like his. — Robert Brown bought a fmall 
farm in this parim, about 12 or 14 years ago. It had 
been managed in the ordinary way, part in grafs, and 
part in tillage. But there were 6 or 7 acres to which 
nothing had been done, and to which he wiftied to do 
fomething. His great object was fodder for hi# cattle 
in winter. He hired men to dig part of it with the 
fpade, and to form it into ridges ; he afterward limed 
it, and fowed it with oats. He had more corn than he 
expected, and the ftraw was plentiful. This encouraged 
him to go on ; he dreffed the firft over again, and all 
that remained in the fame way, fowed it with oats and 
grafs feeds. The crop was as good as could have been 
expected ; and, for the 2 laft years, the hay that was 
produced would have fold for 20L Sterling. Before he 
did any thing to it, to ufe his own words, an acre would 
not have grazed a fheep. He thinks that it will never 
be fit for the plough. In this, he may be miftaken. But 
he never allows any of his cattle to pafture upon it, be- 
ing fenfible, that even for grafs it would greatly hurt it, 
both by breaking the roots, and the /ward, as it is call-

cd, before it is well fanned together. Some have fol. 
lowed his example in part, but only in part, and there-

They have lately marred the lands, in the way in which 
they cut the peats, by a large hole, 2 o or 30 feet fquare,

It fuited their prefent convenience, without ever attend- 
ing to the confequences. This is far, however, from be- 
ing the cafe with all. They work, or they oblige others 
to work, the peat bink, with order and regularity. 

Perhaps it would be of advantage, to give longer leafes, 
even though the rent were to rife at certain intervals, or 
to engage to give the tenant a certain fum for every acre 
of ground which he had improved, if it was done in a fuf- 
ficient manner, whether for meadow, or corn grounds. In 
a few years, the lands might be made much more valu- 
able : But thofe who have been long accuftomed to a cer- 
tain mode of labour, and never faw better, are apt to 
think, that it is impoffible to make things better. </p>

of its having been ufed for a place of rendezvous, or

among our anceftors in remote ages. There is a very 
extenfive view from it, in all direftions ; and, for thefe 
purpofes, was the moft eligible of any to the Clanchatti. 
Daviot is faid to be a name given to this parifli, in me- 
mory of David Earl of Crawfurd, who built the fort, or 
ilronghold, to be hereafter defcribed. But by the man- 
ner in which it is pronounced in Gaelic, this etymology 
feems forced and unnatural j yet tradition has not pre- 
served any other *. 

Thefe parishes lie nearly due E. and W. on both fides

about 33 meafured miles ; their greateft breadth of 
ground, lefs or more, in cultivation, not exceeding 4 
miles ; their leaft fcarcely if. The external appearance 
not very inviting, and muft feem rather wild and roman-

Aboutthe church of Daviot, and for a miles above it, on 
both fides of the river, are a great many fand-hills, which 
appear evidently to have beentormed, at fome very remote 
period, by the current of contrary tides, by the flux and 
reflux of the fea, though they are, at leaft, 3 °° feet per- 
pendicular height above its prefent level, or flood-mark, 
at Nairn or Invernefs. Near the church of Dunlichty, 
and weftward for fome miles, the mountains and hills 
confift chiefly of folid rocks, exhibiting clear proofs, that 
earthquakes were formerly more frequent and terrible 
in this ifland, than either hiftory or tradition hath con- 
veyed to us, there being almoft every where, at the foot 
of thefe mountains, innumerable fragments of enormous 
fixe, that have been, by thefe dreadful commotions, fe- 
vered from their parent rocks. Among the mountains 
are feveral loehs, the principal of which are, Loch Ruth- 
ven, Loch Dundekhack and Loch Clachan ; all of them, 
the firft efpecially, abound with trout, of a molt delici- 
ous tafte and flavour, of the colour of falmon whendrefTed, 
and much admired. They are from 8 oz. to 3 lb. in weight, 
and bite fo keenly with a weftern breeze, that a fkilful 
angler may catch 4 or 5 dozen in the fpace of two hours.

1781, was 52I. 6s. But in 1784, there was an augmenta- 
tion of 25I. ; no part whereof is visual, and the parifhi- 
oners are not bound to perform any fervices to him.— The 
number of poor on the feffion-roll, is from 40 to 46 per- 
fons ; among whom, communibus annis, there is the fum 
of 5I. diftributed once every year, which fum arifes part- 
ly from the intereft of 36I. mortified money, partly from 
the colleaions made in the churches, and partly from de- 
linquents, penalties. Out of the penalties, certain fees are 
paid to the feffion-clerk, and kirk officers, amounting to 
al., or thereby, annually ; but they have the dues of mar- 
riages and baptifms in addition, which are no inconfider- 
able perquifites. 

The church of Dunlichty was rebuilt in 1759, an J has

when given to traclefmen who exhibit the lower!, efti- 
niates, without inquiring fufliciently into their chara&amp;er 
and ability. For fuch underbidders, befides incapacity per, 
haps, muft have temptations upon grounds lefs fair, to 
make insufficient work, and mar the undertaking. This 
remark is but too plainly verified, in the rebuilding of 
the manfe and offices of Daviot, to the great lefs of the 
heritors, and daily inconvenience and prejudice of the mi- 
nifter ever fince. 

Antiquities. — At the Mains of Daviot, a feat of the 
anceftors of the prefent Laird of Mackintoih, there were, 
till lately, the ruins of a fort or caftfe, built by the 
Earl of Crawfurd, in the beginning of the 15th century. 
This was, in thofe days, a place of great ftrength, be- 
ing fituated on the extremity of one of the fand-hills al- 
ready mentioned, had a dry ditch and draw-bridge, 
which divided and fortified it from the level ground 'on 
the W., and a ftrong wall on the other fides, where the 
height and natural declivity of the hill added much to 
its fecurity.- It was a fquare building, and enclofed an 
area of 360 fquare yards ; it had 4 circular towers, 1 in 
every corner, and containing each 3 ftories, all vaulted ; 
had fecret paflages in the middle of the wall, commu- 
nicating with large vaulted rooms for the main guard at 
the principal entry *.

were all entire about 44 year* ago ; and, had they fuffered no injury be!

fpecimen of the fuperior fcill of our ancient operative mafons. In 1748, 
a wadfet was obtained of the lands of Daviot, where the cattle flood;

Heritors, Population, Rent, &amp;c There are 10 heri- 
tors and proprietors belonging to thefe parifhes, only 2 
of whom now refide, and but 4 who have their familj 
feats m it. The improvements, therefore, either for 
ornament or utility, have made but flow progrefs here. 
Yet Mr. Mackintofh of Far has happily fucceeded in 
both. By enclofing, draining and planting, 4ie has made 
his paternal eftate both valuable and delightful, and it 
would be efteemed fo in the beft cultivated country. 
Colonel M'Gillivray projected improvements on the ef- 
tate of Dunmaglafs on a larger fcale ; but his prema- 
ture death has occalioned delay in fome considerable parts 
of the execution. This refpectable family is now re- 
prefented by a minor, nephew to" the Colonel. 

According to Dr. Webfter's report, the number c 
fouls in 1755 was 2176. By a furvey of thefe united 
pariflies, taken 2 years ago, they contain 400 families, 
including tradefmen and labourers who. are married; and 
the whole number of perfons was then 1697. Of thefe, 
430 are of the Scotch Epifcopal Communion ; all the 
reft, except 2 Seceders, are of the Eftabliflied Church. 
The Epifcopalians have a meeting-houfe, where one of 
their clergy preaches once in 3 or 4 weeks, but not re- 
gularly, and adminifters the facrament 4 times a-year, 
after the manner prefcribed by the Englifli ritual. They

And uncertain proportion. Few of the tenants occupy- 
more than one auchten part, the rent of which is from 
3I. to 5I. Sterling. Cuiloms and fervices, or money 
converfions in lieu of them, are always exacted, and paid 
over and above the ftipulated rent — This country a- 
bounds with mealers, or people who have houfes but no 
farm, They have generally a few meep, that are kept 
with their matter's flock ; and fome -are allowed grafs 
for a cow or a horfe. Every tenant has i and fome 1 
or 3, of thefe houfeholders, many of whom are the pa- 
rents, or wives and children, of a fet of people who 
abftracl: themfelves from Us during the greateft part of 
the year, and feek employment in other parts-* 

The ftate of agriculture here is but very indifferent ; 
for befides the great number of fmall holdings, fliort 
leafes, and a predilection among the people for ancient 
modes of farming, however awkward and unproductive^ 
feveral other caufes concur to prevent any great im- 
provements, at leaft for fome time. The foil, indeed^ 
is, in many places, fo good, as to yield tolerable crops, 
fcvtn- under the prefent untoward management. But, 
r. The climate is fo variable, and unpropitiousj as fre- 
quently to blaft the hopes and labour of the farmer by 
froft and mildews, in the courfe of one night or morn- 
ing, in the months of Auguft and September. The le- 
vel and beft fields are moft liable to this difafter. 2. The 
people in general labour with horfes inltead of oxen  
whereby they deprive themfelves of a better manure* 
which, if they had in abundance, would give them ear- 
lier crops, and a chance of efcaping thofe deftructive 
frofts, which affect them lefs or more every year*

thefe ciitical feafons ; a pradice which, though not pe- 
culiar to this country, is evidently detrimental to both. 
Some of the gentlemen here have therefore dropped 
thefe fervices, and accepted a reafonable converfion in 
lieu of them. 4. Our young men, how foon they are. 
fit for labour, go to the fouth country, or elfewhere,. 
for employment ; where they remain fome part of the 
fpring, together with all the fummer and harveft. This 
practice operates much againft improvements in agri- 
culture, is inimical to the general profperity of the 
people, and productive of thefe two evils to the farmers 
and tenants in particular, viz. extravagant wages to the 
few labourers,, who, from choice or neceflity, may hap- 
pen to remain at home ; and the introduction of fine 
clothes, and other luxuries, among the lower elafs. By 
the former, there is no proportion between the price of 
labour and the produce of it. By the latter, the fer- 
vants themfelves confume their wages in expenfive drefs 
and other fuperfluities,, while thofe partial emigrants, 
or, as they are called, the " South Country lads,-" live 
with their parent* or relations during the winter upon 
the common flock of the family. We have 60 perfons 
of this defcription, and upwards. 5. The laft caufe 
unfavourable to agriculture, is not fo general, but, as 
far as it extends, of equally bad or worfe effeft than 
fome of thofe which have been mentioned. The whole 
parifh of Daviot, and fome parts of Dunlichty, lie with- 
in the diftance of between 4 and 6 miles to the royal 
burgh of Invernefs, a large and populous town, to 
which all the tenants, in the above fpace, fend their 
norfea with peats or turf regularly twice a-week, the 
fpring and harveft not excepted. The whole fummer is 
fpent in cutting, drying and leading the peats, without

fever attempting any, meafure that might be in their 
power for meliorating their farms. The moffes, at fame 
time, are fo rapidly cut and deftroyed, that great dif- 
trefs for want of fuel muft foon enfue ; and many of 
the people feel this diflrefs already. It ought to be ob- 
ferved, however, that, under all thefe unfavourable cir- 
cumftances, thefe parilhes, in good years, produce crops 
fufficient for the inhabitants, and perhaps never felt a 
dearth but in times of general fcarcity. It is obvious, 
therefore, that they are capable of improvement. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatlons.— Epidemical or chronical 
'difeafes feldom appear in this country. The people, 
though not robuft, are very healthy ; and many of both 
fexes attain to the age of 80 years and upwards. There 
are, in thefe parimes, 20 perfons now living at and 
about that age. As to the general chara&amp;er of our peo- 
ple, they cannot be commended for induftry. The 
fmall returns for manual labour, may perhaps be the 
reafon, lince none, by the greateft exertions of this kind, 
can make rich. They are however frugal, and have a 
fenfe of honour and fhame, Li a high degree for their 
llation ; and remarkable for that acutenefs of judgment 
which has been peculiarly attributed to Highlanders. 
In their morals, they are not fufficiently flrid in ab- 
ftaining from the fmalier breaches of duty ; but felony, 
or any great crime, has not been committed among them 
for many generations. In their profeffion of religion, 
they are devout and regular, a little inclined to lay too 
much ftrefs upon certain local forms and cuftoms not 
legally impofed, but which, it docs not appear, has any- 
bad efFect on their morals. </p></div>

Parish of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016958">slamannan, or &amp; 
    laurence</name>. 



(CountV of Stirling, Synod of Lothian and Tweed, 
dale, Presbytery of Linlithgow.) 



By the Rev. Mr. James Macnair.</head> 


<p>
TN the year 1470, and feign of James II., it is faid, 
A that Lord Livingftone obtained a charter, under the 
great feal, of the lands of Slamannan. His Lordfhip's 
fucceflbrs, the Earls of Linlithgow, and laft of Callander, 
feued out thefe lands to different perfons, the fuperiority 
of which continued in that noble family till the year 
1 7 1 5, when they were forfeited, together with the patro- 
nage of the church, and became the property of the 
crown. But whether the forefaid charter contained a 
grant of all the lands, or only a part, may be uncertain, 
as the papers of many of the proprietors bear, that their 
lands were feued from Lord Torphichen. And as thefe 
lands are all fucken to one mill, and the reft of the lands 

4 to' 



Of Slamannan^ or St, Laurence, 



to another mill, though they are interfperfed together, 
it is probable, that Lord Torphichen once had a right to 
one half of the lands of Slamannan, and the £arl of Cal- 
lander to the other. 

Name. — Though this parifh bears both the names of 
Slamannan and St. Laurence, yet the firfl of thefe is now 
univerfally ufed. I find the laft only ufed in the old re* 
cords of feflion, and in the presentation hTued forth by 
his majefty,, who is patron of the church, where the, 
words are, " the church and parifh of Slamannan, other- 
i* wife St. Laurence j" from which I am apt to think, 
that St. Laurence was not the name of the parifh, but 
only of the church. It was originally a prebend ; and as 
a great many old places of worfhip were called by the 
names of particular faints, this might be called by the 
name of this faint. There is an excellent fpring of wa- 
ter a little to the fouth-eafl of the church, which ftill 
goes by the name of Laurence Well ; but what the ori- 
gin of the word Slamannan is, like molt other proper 
names, is very uncertain, and merely conjectural. Some 
fay, it derives its origin from the following circumftance. 
When the Earl of Callander and Linlithgow, to whom it 
belonged, firft fent up his fervant to plough part of it, 
(it being formerly a barren moor), he afked his fervant, 
how it would work ; to which he anfwered, it ■ would 
flay man and mare. Others again fuppofe, that from its 
vicinity to the Caledonian Wood, it had often been the 
fcene of battle, where many had been flain. And to 
ftrengthen this opinion, there is, upon the fouth-fide of 
the church, at a little diftance, a fmall hill, which is call- 
ed Caftle Hill, where, they fay, anciently flood a caftle. 
There are no remains of it now, only the farrn-houfe up- 
on 



* 



Statiftical Account 



on the weft fide of it, goes by the fame name. And 9 
little to the eaftward of this hill, there is another rifmg 
.ground, where there is the veftige of a trench, and which 
goes by the name of Killhills, becaufe of the number, it 
is fuppofed, that were killed there. Befides, there were 
anciently here, 2 cones of earth, about 50 yards diflant 
from one another, which are fuppofed to have been raifed 
as monuments of peace, like the 2 at Dunipace ; the one 
of them ftill Hands, and is evidently artificial ; the other 
was levelled, and the church of St. Laurence built upon 
it. Thefe circumftances, and the names of thefe places, 
together with others at no great diftance, fuch as Bal- 
caftle, Balquhatftom, &amp;c, give fome foundation for the 
fuppofition, that there muft have been many (lain here ; 
and hence, probably the name'Slamannan. Others fay, that 
the name is Gaelic, and iignines the Blind Man's Valley, 
there being a valley upon the north lide of the church 
from E. to. W., where the river Avon runs. But as in 
all the old writings, the word is uhiverfaUy fpelt Slaman- 
na, without the laft n, there appears a great fimilarity in 
the two laft fyllables to the word Dalmeny ; and I think 
it very probable, they may be of the fame original. Now, 
Dr. Robertfon, in his account of the parifh of Dalmeny, 
fays, that the w T ord Dalmeny fignifies black heath ; from 
which I am apt to think, that Slamanna muft fignify 
fome kind of heath, perhaps brown or grey, or long 
Jieath, for the parifh hath all originally been covered 
with heath. 

Situation and Extent This parilh lies in the fhire of 

Stirling, and is the moft foutherly parifh in it. Nigh the 
JST. W. end of the parilh, there is a point where the three 
fliires of Stirling, Dunbarton and Lanark meet j and at 

the 



Of Slamannan ^ or St. Laurence. 8 1 



the S. W. end, the Aires of Stirling and Lanark meet 
with the fhire of Linlithgow. It confills of the old pa- 
rifh of Slamannan, and a part annexed from the parifh 
of Falkirk. The original parifh of Slamannan is from 
4 tQ 5 miles in length, and from 2 to 3 in breadth, and 
lies upon the fouth fide of the water of Avon, which 
anciently feparated it from the extenfive parifh of Fal- 
kirk, which lay upon the north of the Avon ;• but about 
the year 1730^ there was a divilion made of the parifh of 
Falkirk, when the whole parifh of Polmont was taken off 
it, and alfo a part of it annexed to the parifh of Slaman- 
nan. The part annexed to this parifh lies immediately upon 
the north fide of the river, and is nearly of the fame 
.length with the old parifh; and about one mile broad ; fo 
that the prefent parifh of Slamannan; including the annex- 
ation, will be from 4 to 5 miles in length, and from 3 to 
4 in breadth. 

River and Lochs. — The river Avon; which runs 
through this parifh, from W. to E., takes its rife from a 
loch in the parifh of Cumbernauld, called Fanny Side 
Loch. It immediately receives a conliderable addition 
from a fmall rivulet which takes its rife from a mofs in 
the Eaft Monkland parifh, about 2 miles diflant, and 
which fome think is more properly the head of the Avon. 
Certain it is, there is a farm-houfe very near that mofs, 
where this rivulet comes from, which is called Avon- 
Head. There are alfo 3 lochs in this parifh ; one in the 
north fide of the annexation^ called the Ellridge Loch, 
which fupplies a corn mill with water i and falls into the 
water of Avon ; the other two are upon the S. W. fide 
of the old parifh, called the little and the great Black 
Lochs ; the one of which, namely the little Black Loch, 
runs E., and the other, the great Black Loch, which is 

Vol. XIV. L about

Statiftical Account 



about half a mile W. from the other, and lies upon the 
boundaries of this and the Eaft Monkland parifh, runs 
W. It hath lately been made a refervoir to the grefct 
canal between the Forth and Clyde, by the run of the 
water of Calder, by which it is carried into the Monkland 
canal, and from that, by a cut near Glafgow, conveyed 
into the large canal. There are fome trouts in the wa- 
ter of Avon, and alfo in the 2 Black Lochs, and fome 
perches and eels ; but none, I believe, in the Ellridge 
Loch. 

Valuation and Rent — The valuation of the old parifh, 
in the cefs-books, is 2349I. us. ?d. Scots, and the annual 
rent in the year 1771, was eftimated at 10401. 5s. Ster- 
ling. The valuation of the annexation is 1066I. 13s, id. 
Scots, and the annual rent, in the year 1771, was efti- 
mated at 527I. Sterling. There are, at prefent, in the 
parifh, 28 refiding and 25 non-refiding heritors ; and in 
the annexation, 6 refiding and 13 non-refiding ; fo that 
the whole number of heritors is 72. The moll of the 
refiding heritors farm their own lands, except a few, who 
have confiderable property ; in which cafe, they let part 
of it to tenants. And thefe knds have been in poflellion 
of the fame families for many generations, perhaps fince 
fir ft feued out; 

Soil. — The arable lands on each fide of the Avon, for 
about half a mile, are of a light free foil ; and, if proper- 
ly prepared, would produce very good crops, almoft of 
any grain. Thefe are interfperfed with haughs and mea- 
dows, which are of a rich loamy foil. The haughs pro- 
duce good crops of oats, and the meadows very good 
natural grafs, which is made into hay, and is excellent 
feeding for black cattle in winter. Some of thefe lands 

are: 



f Slamannatii or St. Latirence. 



, 6 re let at tl. the acre, but the mofl of them at half of 
that. The foil lying farther off the water for about a mile, 
is of a flrong hard clay, and does not produce fo good 
crops as the lands above defcribed. The rent of thefe 
fends may be about 7s. 6d. the acre. The foil in the ex- 
tremity of the parifli is of a very black mofly bottom, and 
produces bad crops ; as the lands lie interfperfed amongft 
mofles, the crops feldom come to perfection. The farm- 
ers make moft by railing young cattle and by milk, the 
grafs not being fit for fattening them. The 1 firft kinds 
of foil defcribed, may be, and fome of it is improved, but 
the laft not capable of much. 

The farms here are generally fmall, few of them be- 
ing equal to a ploughgate ; the moft of them only the 
half, and fome not fo much. The higheft rent of a 
ploughgate does not exceed 30I. Sterling. They uni- 
verfally make ufe of the old Scotch plough, and gene- 
rally have the one half of their ground tilled, and the 
other lying in natural grafs. They let it lie commonly 
for 3 years, and then plough it for other 3 years. It is 
generally milch cows they feed upon their ground, with 
a few young ones to fupply the place of the old ones ; 
but there are few or no ftieep, the foil being rather wet 
and mofly, and therefore not fo favourable for them. 
Their wives and daughters, together with a fervant, 
take care of the milk, of which they make a good 
deal of butter and cheefe, and by which the tenants ge- 
nerally pay the moft of their rent. 

Produce. — The foil produces pretty good flax, not very 
fine in quality, but ftrongand good of its kind, though they 
feldom raife more of it than is for their own ufe. There 
is alfo fome bear raifed, but the principal produce is oats. 
"Sometimes they fow grafs feeds with their boar ; but

little of the ground being enclpfcd, it is much deftroyed 
by the cattle in the winter, when they are allowed to. 
go at large. The want of proper enclofures, with plan- 
tations, is a great hindrance to the improvement of the 
country. Alfo they lie at a good diftance from lime  
but not indeed at fo great a diftance, a 3 that the roads 
are very bad. They are about 6 or 7 miles from the 
lime-works of Torphichen or Bathgate, and about the 
fame diftance from thofe of Cumbernauld. Another 
great obftacle to the regular improvement of the parifli 
is, that a great number of the proprietors occupy their 
own lands ; and though they and their families live very 
comfortably and independently upon the produce, yet 
they cannot fpare any money to lay out in improve- 
ments. However, there are fome of them who are both 
planting and enclofing more of their ground, and making 
their roads a great deal better. They have, efpecially 
of late, made a road through a mofs, called Mofs Candle, 
more than a mile in length, between this and Falkirk,, 
which makes the communication much more eafy ; and 
the propofed road between Edinburgh and Glafgow, by 
Bathgate and Airdrie, it is expected, will be of confi- 
derable fervice to this part of the country, 

Population, &amp;x According to Dr. Webfter's report, 

the population in 1755 was 1209. The number of in T 
habitants in this parifli at prefent is 1010; of whom 
there are 466 males, and 544 females : and of thefe 
there are 263 under 10 years of age ; 255 between 10 
and 20; 317 between 20 and^o ; 126 between 50 and 
7° 5 37 between 70 and 80 ; and 2 above 80. There 
are 223 families, including fingle perfons who keep 
lioufes by themfelves ; 312 married perfons ; 6 bache- 
lors, 



Of Slamannan^ or St. Laurence. 



Jors, or unmarried men ; and 20 unmarried women 
^bove 4c years of age ; there are alfo 17 widowers and 
42 widows. The inhabitants of the annexation were 
always confidered to be nearly equal to one half ©f the 
old pariih ; at prefent, however, they are a great deal 
lefs, being only 272, and the old pariih being 738. This 
js owing chiefly to fome of the farms in the annexation 
being of late purchafcd by Mr. Forbes of Callander, 
which are lying in grafs, and the houfes uninhabited.—, 
Since April 1788, there have keen about 139 births, 
and 47 marriages. There has been no regular regifter 
of the deaths kept ; but, by comparing the roll of the 
prefent year with the one taken up in 1788, J find there 
are about 70 who have died fince that time. Upon an 
average, therefore, the births each year may be about 

32 ; the marriages 10 ; and the burials 18 There arc 

no manufa&amp;ures carried on in this parifli, nor is there 
any village in it ; the few houfes which are near the 
church not deferving that name. The moft of the inha- 
bitants are farmers, except a few employed in the other 
neceffary bufinefles of life ; fuch as weavers, tailors, 
fmiths, &amp;c. But thefe are only employed in thefe 
branches by the inhabitants of the pariih ; and there- 
fore there are only fuch a number of them as are fuffi- 
cient for the parifli. There are about 4 fmiths, 10 ma- 
fons and joiners, 12 weavers, 12 flioemakers, 3 tailors, 
3 millers, and 1 lint-miller, 3 flax-dreflers, 3 public- 
houfes, and a few coal-hewers. Thefe laft are employ- 
ed by the Carron Company, and are fometimes more 
numerous than at other times. There were more than 
20 of them about 2 years ago, and at prefent there are 
not more than 5. There is 1 clergyman and 1 fchool- 
mafter ; but no furgeon nor writer. There are about 

15 heads

Statlftical Account 



15 heads of families connefted with the Seceffion, making 
&amp; all, with their families, about 78 perfons, but many 
or their families attend upon the parifli church *. 

Poor.-^The average number of poor upon the feffion 
roll is about 12. They are fupplied by the collections 
made on Sunday, together with the intereft of a fmall 
fund of about 150I., without any affeffment. They 
generally, get from 2s. to 4 s. the month, and one 5 s. 
Sometimes alfo families, when they are in diftrefs, re- 
ceive occafional fupplies as they need. But none of 
thofe who receive from the feffion are allowed to beg. 

Difeafes. — The moft common difeafe I have obferved 

iince I came to this parifh, appears to be the confump- 

tion, occafioned not fo much by the conftitution of the 

inhabitants, as by the coldnefs arid dampnefs of the 

houfes. The bad ftate of the houfes often brings on 

colds upon thofe that are young and tender, which, if 

not fpeedily removed, ends in a confumption. It is not 

unfrequent alfo for old people, when confined much to 

their houfes, and unable to take that exercife which is 

proper for the circulation of the blood, to be troubled 

with 



* The wages of an ordinary ploughman are 81. in the year, and fome 
of them 10I. They have rifen very confiderubly of late. A woman

feed in the fummer half year. A labouring man ufed to be hired at 6d. 
a day, and his meat ; but now they alk Sd. As there is no market-town 
in the parifli, the price of vivres is always regulated by Falkirk, which 
is the neareft market-town, and about 5 miles diftant — There is plenty 
of fuel in the parifli, both coal and peat ; but peat is molt generally ufed, 
as every perfon hath commonly a right to fome mofs connefled with the 
lands he poflefles, or pays only is. for as many as he can call in a day. 
The Carron "Company, who work fome pits in the parifli, fupply the

with great fwellings in their legs ; and not a few have 
died of the dropfy, which, it is probable, alfo originates 
from the fame caufe. What ftrengthens this opinion, 
is, that thefe complaints are more frequent among the 
lower clafs of the inhabitants, the few families who 
are in a fuperior ftaton, and have comfortable houfes, 
not being fubjeft to them. Otherwife the people are 
generally pretty healthy ; and I have obferved fewer 
fevers here than in the neighbouring pariflies . 

Church, Stipend, &amp;c The walls of the church were 

rebuilt about the year 1753 '■ but tn e old feating was 
Hill continued, which indeed is very old ; many feats 
being marked with the year 1632, and fome of them 
even fo far back as the year 1556. It Hands, there- 
fore, in much need of being renewed. When the an- 
nexation was joined to this parifti, they were allowed 
to build an aile, for their own accommodation, upon the 
N. fide of the church, at their own expenfe, and to up, 
hold it for 20 years ; and the heritors of Slamannan were 
bound to uphold the old church for the fame number of 
years ; after which they were all to bear any expenfe 
upon the church and church-yard walls, in proportion, 
to their valuations. But as they were otherwife annex- 
ed only quoad facra, they pay no part of the minifter's 
ftipend. The King is patron. The flipend is 50I. Ster- 
ling in money, 2 chalders of meal, and 1 chalder of bear, 
a manfe and glebe of about 15 acres. There is alfo 3 L 
6s. 8d. for furnifliing communion elements, together 
with the intereft of 500 merks, which is in the hands 
of the feffion. The manfe was built more than 30 years 
ago, fincc which time it hath not only been frequently 
repaired, but had a confiderable addition made to it. </p></div>

ders it very wet, and unfit for tillage xn winter and 
lpnng, and generally prevents the farmers from fowing 
before the end of March, or reaping before the middle 
or end of September. On a confiderable part of the 
farms lying on the more and wefter end of the parifh, 
where the foil is light and fandy, on a free-Hone bot- 
fom, oats are fown the beginning of March, barley and 
peafe ln April, and often reaped in the beginning of 
Augult. The farmers here, averfe to fallowing, green 
props, enclofures and winter herding, continue the fame 
plan of agriculture that was praclifed a century ago. 
Many of them, indeed, have fown fmall patches of clo- 
ver in their little gardens for feveral years paft • but 
pone of them, excepting 3, ever attempt to fallow, or 
fow green-crops or grafs-feeds in their fields : in confe- 
rence of which, thefe fields are over-run with weeds, 
particularly quickens (or joint-weed) ; and their crops 
are very light, in proportion to their fowing ; as they 
have not, at an average (lave on the mores), above 3! 
returns of barley, and 2~ of oats and peafe. lnflead of 
Kellachyc carts, with wicker-bafkets of a conical form, 
and the Scotch plough, of a bad conltruclion, many of 
the farmers begin to ufe fmall box-carts with fpoke-

M i Heritors, 

* As there has Been no mofs in this parifh for near a century paft, the 
men and horfes have been conftantly employed, during fummer, in cutting, 
drying, and carrying home fandy turfs, or divots, from the Mull-bui' 
which, at belt, is but a wretched kind of fuel, and often rendered ufelefs 
by a few days rain, after all the expenfe of time and labour bellowed up- 
on it. When the feafon is rainy, as often happens in this country, the fi- 
liation of the people in this, and the neighbouring parifhes, is truly 
plorable, during the next winter a^i fpring. From recollecting their fop* 
mer miferies and hardfhips for want of fuel, there is, at prefent, an uncom- 
mon degree of joy diffufed among all ranks, and efj.eically the poor, by 
the late important and truly patriotic aft of Parliament, which takes off 
the late duty on all coals water borne to the N. of St. Abb's Head ; a tax 
which was partial and impolitic in the extreme, and has proved moft ini- 
mical to the agriculture, manufactures and happinefs of the northern part 
of the Britifh empire. As the north of Scotland has long diftinguiflied it* 
felf in fending forth Its ihoufands of brave and hardy fons to recruit our 
armies on every appearance of public danger, it is now to be hoped from 
the many navigable friths with which it is interfered, the numlr o£ 
people with which its coafts and glens are inhabited, and tlvj free import 
tation of coals, that its manufactures and trade will rapidly increafe and 
foon enable it to contribute a great number of hardy feamen, as well as 

foldiers, to repel the enemies of Britifh liberty and property From the

* As even the fmall fura payable to the feffion-clerk on thefe occafions,' 
is an object to people ftruggling with poverty, it has been hitherto found 
impracticable to keep an exad regifter of baptifms, marriages and burials. 
The variation that has taken place in the population of this parifh, within 
the fhort fpace of 14 years, has arifen from the following caufes. The de- 
creafe from 17^0 to 1789, was occafioned, in a great mcafure, by the ar- 
rears of rent, and other debts unavoidably incurred by the tenants, through 
th: failure of crop 178a, which obliged them, in 1783, to difmifs every 
fervant they could poflibly fpare, and make their children endeavour to 
iupply their places, at a much earlier -period than they were wont to do 
before ; and ever fince that memorable sera, many of the young and flout- 
ed lads, have annually gone to Glafgow, and other places in the W. and 
S. of Scotland, where the price of labour is high, inftead ef marrying and 
fettling in the parifh, as was the cuftom formerly. This annual drain of 
young men, has raifcd the wages of fervants, and is feverely felt by the te* 
nants. 

The increafe of population from 17851 to 1792, was owing to the greaC 
encouragement given by Mr. and Mrs. Urquhart of Braclangwcll and 
Newhall to people who fettled on, and improved moor-ground.

Martin's, by the late Mr. Gordon of Newhall, whofe 
claflical knowledge, philanthropy, and engaging man- 
ners endeared him to all who knew him : Appearances 
•were fo favourable, that workmen had proceeded a good 
way in cutting through the rock, under ground, in 2 
different directions, in hopes of meeting a vein of ore ; 
•when his fudden and much lamented death, in January 
1778, put an end to the attempt. Some fpar, lime- 
Hone, and ftone-marl were found in digging through the 
above rock, in which a number of fpecks of ore were 
found embedded, ftich fhell-marl was difcovered, a few 
years ago, in a fmall loch near the manfion-houfe of 
Braclangwell, which the proprietor has ufed, as a ma- 
nure to his fields, with great fuccefs.— Salmon, trout, 
ikate, herrings, whitings, fmall cod, flounders of various 
kinds, cuttle-fifh, needle-nib, cuddies, and a variety of 
fmaller fry, are caught in the frith oppofite to this pa-

culture on a large fcale, by enclofing, planting, drain- 
ing, liming, fallowing, and fowing green crops on his 
mains of Poynterfield, which now add greatly to the 
beauty and value of that part of the eftate ; and very 
great improvements have been carried on in all thefe

hypothefis, that from the eminence on which thefe en- 
trenchments are moft numerous* there is an extenfive 
profpeft in all directions* to prevent their being furprif-

Hints refpeBing Improvements — It is almoft unnecef- 
fary to obferve, that the eftablilhing woollen, lint, and 
cotton manufactures in this country, would be of the 
greateft advantage to the inhabitants. Among many 
others on the Frith of Cromarty, there is an excellent 
ftation for a lint or hemp manufacture in this parim, 
at the ftore-houfe of Newhall, where there is a fine na- 
tural harbour, in which mips of a confiderable burden 
could lie unmolefted by any wind, excepting from the 
N. and N. W — As the foil of this parifli is well adapt- 
ed to raifmg lint and hemp, the farmers would no doubt

* The only building in this parifh, that has the appearance of great anti- 
quity, is the caftle of Craighoufe, on the fhore of Cullicudden, about a mile 
and a half weftward of the old kirk. It is 5 ftoreys high, built with run lime 
On a rock perpendicular towards the fea, which waflies it at flood-tide ; and 
being furrounded on the land fide by a ditch and high wall, it evidently ap- 
pears to have been a place of confiderable ftrength. All the apartment* 
of the one half of it, which is moft entire, are formed by ftone arches, but 
the floors of the other half, Which is evidently more modern, have bten 
laid on wooden joifts, part of which are ftill to be fcen on the walls. - 
bout 200 years ago, the caftle, with the lands adjoining, belonged to the 
Williamfonsof Craighoufe. The reprefentative of which family is a Count 
"Williamfon in Germany. The caftle and lands of Craighoufe, afterward

take the advantage of this favourable circumftance, if 
proper lint-mills were ereded, and premiums given to 
allure them to the attempt. Surely the truflees. for the 
improvement of manufactures, Sec. cannot fuppofe, that 
inducements of that nature are now fo necefiary in 
fouthern counties, where manufactures have been long 
eftablilhed, and where the method and advantage of raid- 
ing lint and hemp are well underftood, as in thefe north- 
ern diftricts, where they are hardly known, and where 
the people are in that low ftate of poverty and depref- 
fion, which has ever been found to check and fmother a 
fpirit of induftry and improvement. 

Befides thefe, converting all, or, at leali, one half of 
the victual-rents into money, at a moderate rate ; giving 
long leafes, with melioration for encloung the farms, and 
abolilhing thirlage, would have a powerful tendency to 
roufe a fpirit of improvement among the farmers, and 
render the fituation of the people in general much more 
eafy and comfortable than it is at prefent. Giving pre- 
miums to farmers for fallowing and liming their ground, 
fowirig turnips and grafs-feeds in their fields, would, 
no doubt, excite a fpirit of emulation and induftry 
among them. And as. thefe arc the great and truly pa- 
triotic objects which the lately formed Rofs-ftiire farm- 
ing-fociety has in view, it is not doubted, but every 
gentleman of property, in the counties of Rofs and 
Cromarty, will give it his hearty countenance and fup- 
port. Were they to contribute to the common ftock 
according to their rentals, and pay particular attention 
to fuch tenants as mould compete for premiums, though 
they mould not fucceed, a fpirit of improvement might 
be foon excited in this country, limilar to that which,

turn to themfelves or their heirs with tenfold intereft ; 
and a few years experience of the mode and profit of an 
improved fyftem of hufbandry would, in a fliort time, 

render the continuance of premiums quite unneceflary 

Having fairly made the experiment himfelf for 6 months 
paft, the writer earneftly recommends to farmers who 
plough with 6 or 8 oxen and a driver, to plough with 
1 large oxen in harnefs, without a driver ; befides faving 
the meat and wages of a driver, they will plough more, 
and better than 6 or 8 of their prefent fi?e of oxen ; they 
will not require fo much provender ; and, if yoked in a 
cart like horfes, each of them will draw a load that 4 
of their fmall garrons would not move. The writer 
cannot conclude this mifcellaneous branch of his fubje&amp;j 
without obferving, that it muft give the greateft plea- 
fure to every friend to his country, to look J or ward tQ

o and iej in Little Dalton ; and it feems probable, 
that the population has not deereafed fince the beginning 
of the prefent century. There is no town in the parifh, 
and the only place that deferves the name of a village, is 
Dalton, near the church, where the courts of the barony 
were formerly kept; but the number of inhabitants does 
not now exceed 30 or 40. The parilh is the property of 
7 heritors, of whom only 2 are refident. The air is 
healthy, nor are there any particular difeafes to which 
the people are fubjeft. One or two inftances of individu- 
als attaining the age of 100, have happened within thefe 
50 years. 

Rivers, Fijtnngs, &amp;c.~The parifh being bounded by 
the river of Annan on the E., confiderable quantities of 
falmon, and fea-trouts, are caught in the feafon, as the 
deep pools afford them a Ihelter. It has been fuppofed, that 
this river, at a very remote period, inftead of difcharging 
itfelf into the fea below the town of Annan, followed a dif- 
ferent courfe 5 and running due S. from Dormont, fell into 
the Frith near Cummertrees church, about 3 mile, to the

inland navigation from the upper parts of Annandale to

ment of this nature, is obvious. In particular, the in- 
land part of Annandale might, by this tract, be fupplied 
with coals, and with lime, for manure, &amp;c, of both 
which, the carriage by land from the coaft is exceeding- 
ly expenlive and tedious. Wood, iron, Hate, and a va- 
riety of other neceflary articles, which are imported, 
might alfo be carried at a much eafier rate, than they 
now are ; and the time confumed in land carriage, might 
be employed in encloling, and otherwife improving the 
country, a great part whereof having been common, 
though lately divided, remains ftill in an uncultivated 
Hate. It is therefore to be hoped, that when peace is 
re-eft ablifhed, and credit has attained its former liability, 
the propofal for fuch a canal may be attended to, and en- 
couraged by every man of landed property in the neigh- 
bourhood, efpecially as the late truly patriotic meafure, 
fo long defired, of permitting coals to be imported duty 
free, muft create a great demand for them ; and if the 
conveyance into the interior parts of the country was, at 
the fame time, rendered more eafy, the prefent wafte of 
time, in the calling and drying of peat, might in a great 
meafure be avoided and prevented.

is the patron of this pariih. The ftipend was augmented 
about 24 years ago, fince the fettlement of the prefent 
mmifter, and is now 74 1. Sterling a-year paid in money. 
There is alfo a legal glebe adjoining to the manfe, which 
was excambed for the old glebe, lying in the pariih of 
Little Dalton, where the manfe was alfo fituated, almoft 
2 miles from the church. This being found extremely 
inconvenient, an excambion took place about 30 years 
ago ; and a new manfe was then built, and a glebe laid 
out at a fmall diftance from the church.— The fchool- 
mafter has the legal falary of 100 merks ; he teaches 

reading, writing and arithmetic Only 1 indigent per- 

fon ftands upon the roll; which is very fortunate, as 
the want of a weekly collection, occafioned by the pecu- 
liar circumftances of the pariih, would prevent the ne- 
ceffitous from receiving any other fupport, except what 
arofe from the charitable difpolitions of their neighs 
bours. 

Agriculture, &amp;c — Improvement of the foil has made 
a confiderable progrefs in this pariih within thefe laft 
20 or 30 years. The contiguity to, and application of 
lime as a manure, has much contributed to this defirable 
purpofe ; many enclofures have alfo been made ; feveral 
tracks of common and barren land brought into culture ; 
and the appearance of the country in general greatly 
altered for the better. Oats and barley are principally 
raifed, and a fmall quantity of wheat, which requires 
rather a ftronger foil. Potatoes are cultivated with 
great fuccefs ; and the crops of grain are much more 
than fufficient for the co.iiumption of the inhabitants, 
who do therefore export and feL the overplus. Some 
turnips are alfo planted every year in the drill way, 

which,

which, being regularly hoed and cleaned, are a good 
preparation for an enfuing barley crop. There are no 
manufactures carried on in this parifli. The valuation 
is 2423 merks, 6s. 8d. Scots , the real rent about 170c!. 
Sterling. The extent, as nearly as can be computed, is 
4500 Scots acres. 

Mifcellaneous Oljervations. — The number of horfes; 
may be about 120, moltly bred in the parifli.. The 
quantity of black cattle cannot be ealily afcertained, as 
the owners are often buying and felling ; they are, how- 
ever, almoft the only flock raifed, as no more than 3 or 
4 farms keep any flieep. The people rear a confi- 
derable quantity of fwine, which are very profitable. 
The rates of thofe articles correfpond entirely with thofe 
mentioned in the accounts of the pariflies of Ruthwell 
and Cummertrees adjoining ; as do alfo fervants and 
labourers wages. Oat meal and oats are fold at Dum- 
fries market, and frequently fhipped for the port of 
Greenock. The whole barley raifed, except a fmall 
portion for home-confumption, is exported to Liverpool. 
— The new made turnpike-road from Annan to Dum- 
fries runs through a fmall corner of the fouthern part 
of the parifli. The other roads are kept in repair by 
the compofition for the ftatnte-labour — No ancient edi- 
fices, or natural curiofities, are to be met with in this 
parifh. A tower or fortalice, upon the lands of Hoi- 
mains, which was the feat of the anceftors of Mr. Car- 
ruthers of Holmains, lately proprietor of that eftate 
and was a considerable ftronghold before the union of 

the crowns, is now fallen into a total decay As there

other cafes, and when the weather is uncertain, require 
much attention, and confume a great part of the people's 
time in the fummer feafon. This inconvenience will, 
however, be in a great degree obviated, by the late ad 
taking off the duty from coal imported ; and the people 
of Dalton, being at no great diftance from the coaft, 
may now avail themfelves of this advantage The in- 
habitants of this parilh are in general of a good charac- 
ter, quiet, regular and orderly. No crimes, of which 
the law takes cognizance, hare been committed for many 
years. There are few or no Seceders. </p></div>

Tie 6cc\. Sterling. The exports are butter, cheefe, lambs, 
old fKeep, wool, meal, bear, &amp;c. The caufes of the de- 
cfeafe of population in this parim, may be thefe : For- 
merly this parilh was divided into fmall farms, and each, 
farmer kept feveral cottagers ; 'but now the farms are 
much enlarged, and the farmers, at leaft many of them, 
feem to have imbibed a ftrong prejudice againft all cot- 
tages, pulling clown fome of them every year. Another 
caufe of this decreafe in population, may be the want of 
fuel ; the parim affording no peat, and the coal, at the 
diftance of near 8 miles, very high priced at the hill, and 
generally very bad in quality, which makes fuel a dear 
article to the poor *. 

Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c. — The foil of this diftrict is for 
the moll part of a light black mould, with a clofe red 
clay, and tilly bottom, which makes it generally very 
wet, and the crops late in harveft. To remedy this, the 
farmers, for the molt part, fow early oats, commonly 
called Carnwath oats, and fome barley oats, which are 
ftill earlier than the former, but they mull be fowed up- 
on line rich land, otherwife they produce but a fcanty 
crop. Yet, after all, from its local iituation, and a large 
mofs to the eaftward, the early frofts in Auguil and Sep- 
tember, oft times, in one night, blail all the hopes of the 
molt induftrious hulbandman, by deftroying his crops. 

The farmers, in general, are induftrious. They plant 
a confiderable quantity of potatoes ; they likewife fow 
as much grafs-feeds and turnips as they can, which ge- 
nerally very well repay their labour. There are about

co acres of enclofed lands in the pari.; the reft is aIi

penfive and difficult bufinefs, as thorn hedges cannot be 
reared for fences, and ftones are not to be got for building 



Church, Manfe, Stipend, School, &amp;c._The church un 
derwent a complete repair in the year 1786, being then al- 
moft rebuilt. It is, at prefent, in good repair, and a de- 
cent place of worlhip. The manfe was built in 1770, 
but in fuch a fuperficial manner, that it has been under 
the neceffity of being repaired feveral times fmce it was 
built, at a very considerable expenfe to the heritors ; and, 
after all, it is but an indifferent houfe : damp, by being 
placed too near a bog ; inconvenient, being near half a 
mile from the church. 

As the parifh is fmall, fo the ftipend is equally fmall, 
being no more than 44I. 8s. iofd., with 50 merks Scots, 
for communion elements. The teinds feem to be exhauft- 
ed. This is a ftipend by far too fmall, as times now go, 
for the fupport of any clergyman. The glebe contains

William Brown, Efq. of Dolphington, about the year 
1650, mortified 4 acres of land for the behoof of the 
fchoolmafter of the parifh, on which land a good dwell- 
ing-houfe is now built. The faid William Brown alfo 
mortified 1000 merks Scots, the intereft of which was to 
be paid to the fchoolmafter, for educating poor fcholars ; 
the naming of faid fcholars to be by the faid William 
Brown, and his heirs : He likewife, at fame time, morti- 
fied 20c merks, the intereft of which was to be paid to the 
poor of the pariih. Laftly, the forefaid William Brown 
mortified 2 acres of land to the minifter ferving the cure; 
but this laft mortification has not been pofleffed by the 
minifter fince the Revolution. The late Mr. John 
Bowie, minifter of Dolphington, in the year 1759, mor- 
tified and difponed a farm lying in the parifh of Dunfire, 
prefently renting 27I. 12s. yearly, free of all burdens, to 
the minifter and kirk-feflion of Dolphington, to be dif- 
pofed of in the following manner; viz. 100 merks to the 
fchoolmafter for teaching 20 poor fcholars, and no more, 
the naming of faid fcholars to be by the kirk-feflion ; 
100 merks for educating any lad of a remarkably bright 
genius, to be allowed him for 6 years, and no longer ; or, 
failing any lad of this defcription in the pariih, the faid 
100 merks is to' be applied to pay apprentice fees ; 50 
merks for buying bibles, pfalm books, &amp;x. to poor fcho- 
lars ; or failing them, to be applied to any other chari- 
table purpofe the feflion {hall judge moft proper ; 50

thefe means, bringing both the labours and livings nearer to a Prefbyterian 
equality, may be practicable, I think, deferves due confideration ; for un- 
lefs fomething be done to meliorate the fituation of many of the clergy, 
who have only fmall parifhes, and, what is ftill worfe, whofe tithes are 
cxhaufted, and confequently can claim no augmentation, they will be-

merks to the miniftcr, with all the other profits arifimr 
from faid lands, to compcnfate him for his care and 
trouble as factor and principal manager. 

This parifh has the honour of giving birth to fome 
eminent men, particularly to the late' Principal Leech, 
man of the uuiverfitv of Glafgow, fo well known ha the 
htcrary world ; the account of whofe life having been fo 
lately publifhed, ^fuperfedes the neceffity of my giving 
any further account of him. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.— There are not many re. 
mains of antiquity to be found in this parifh.' I have 
only obferved the following : On the top of a hill, 'near 
the middle of the panto, are to be feen the remains of a 
camp, or fortified place. It enclofes near 4 acres of 
ground, and feems to have been firongly fortified with a 
wall of earth, and a broad deep trench cut out of the 
rock, for the whole top of the hill is a rock. It likewife 
feems to have bad fome flrong out- work, particularly on 
the corners, where the hill was mofl eafy of accefs. But 
there is not the fmalleft veftige of any ftoue-houfes, or o- 
ther permanent buildings having ever been erefied with- 
in the fortifications. I have been told by fome of the 
oldeft people in the parifh, that there was once to be feen 
the appearance of a refervoir for holding rani-water, for 
a fpring it could not have, without going to a very great 
depth ; and that this place ufed to ftand full of water af- 
ter any great rains, but is now almoft filled up. If one 
might hazard a conjure, I fhould fuppofe, that this 
place was never ufed as a Handing military camp, or Na- 
tion, but rather as a place of fecurity, for driving the 
cattle to, in any fudden emergency. This country, of old, 
was much expofed to the incurfions of the borderers from 

Annandale, 



rQf Dolph'mgton. 



Annandale, who ufed to come and plunder the country, 
and drive away the cattle ; and it is natural to fuppofe, 
that the people would endeavour to fecure their cattle, 
by fome means or other. 

I am led to conjedure, that this was the principal 
defign* not only of.this, butlikewife of .many other places 
of the .fame kind, fituated on the tops of the hills in this 
country, from this circumftance, that about 2 miles to the 
there is another place which goes by the name, of the 
Kip. This kip is fituated .upon .the higheft part of ano- 
ther hill, and has a moll cxtenfive profpeft all over the 
country, particularly to the N. E. It is compofed 
of a row of very large ftones, which mult have been 
brought from fome confiderable diftance, as the hill af- 
fords none. Thefe ftones are placed in a circular form, 
of about 50 or 60 paces in circumference, .and the middle 
.fpace filled with fmall ftones and gravel. This place I 
take to have been intended as an alarm tower, where 
fires ufed to be lighted to alarm the country, in cafe of 
any fudden invafion. As this place is within light of 
Tintock Hill to the S. W., where another place of the fame 
kind feems to have been raifed, and as it is alfo within 
fight of another a good way to the N. E., and that other 
in light of Dunbar, and the eaftern coaft, fo, by lighting 
£res from one place to another, in the fpace of a few 
hours, the country could be alarmed from the borders of 

England to the Forth, and fo on In feveral parts of this 

parilh, ftone coffins, full of bones, have been difcovered; 
particularly in one place, the farmer, in levelling and 
ftiaighting his ridges, came with the plough upon a re- 
gular burying-ground, containing a great number of 
ftone coffins of all dimenfions, from children to full grown 
men. Thefe coffins were not of one ftone, but of feve-

ral pieces, fet upon their edges, and covered with one

thefe almoft reduced to duft. When the church was 
repairing in 1 786, the mafons, in clearing the foundation of 
the north wall, discovered a perfon that had been buried 
within church, not in the ufual way, lying E. and W. 
but N. and S., covered with a large ftone, on which was 
cut, in a rude manner, the form of a big two-handed 
word, without letters, or any other figures, but nothing 
clfe ; his bones feemed to be uncommonly large. </p></div>

The face of the country, in all parts of the parifli, par- 
ticularly towards the E. and W. extremities, is remark-, 
ably uneven. The quantity of arable land, however U 
probably not lefs than in any equal extent of furface 
throughout the whole length of the Ochil Hills. From 
the free circulation of air among thefe hills, and the pre- 
vailing drynefs of the foil below, the climate, in molt 
parts of the parilh, proves very falubrious. The fituation 
of the minifter's manfe is, perhaps, as unfavourable to 
health, as any other honfe in the parilh ; for it ftands 
clofe by a lake of confiderable extent in low and wet 
ground. 

Hills, Woods, Rivers, Lake*, Stc—Of the many hills 
in the parifh, 2, Clatchart-Crag and Norman's Law, are 
remarkable ; the one for its abrupt precipitous front, 
the other for its height. Abdie is bare of wood, there 
being only one confiderable fpot in the whole extent of 
the parilh planted with trees. It is to be hoped, how- 
ever, that the proprietors will be induced to convert the 
inarable fummits of fome of the hills to ufe and beauty, 
by covering them with wood. The grounds, hvmany 
places, require ftielter ; and there is good reafon to be- 
lieve, that the feveral fpecies of fir planted in the neigh- 
bourhood with fuccefs, will thrive in the high lands of 
Abdie. No river runs through this parifli : It is, not- 
withstanding, well watered. It contains feveral lakes or 
lochs, the principal of which, in point of largenefs and 
beauty, is the loch of Lindores : this is a fine meet of 
water in the middle divifion of the parilh, of nearly a 
mile in length, and of unequal breadth : It belongs to 
Mr. Simfon of Brunton. Its perch and pike, its ducks

and other water fowls, contribute to the amufement of 
the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, whom the proprie- 
tor pohtely admits to the privilege of filing and fowling. 
Were the nfing grounds, with which this lake is fur- 
rounded on all fides, covered with plantations, clifpofed in 
a proper manner, a profped, it is believec*, would be fur- 
mfhed not inferior, in point of beauty, to thoie preferred 
by lakes, which have attracted much notice, and acquired 
celebrity. Ill fupplied, as the country at prefent is, with 
wood, no traveller, in paffing along the road which leads 
from Cupar to Perth, can furvey the loch of Lindores, 
when it opens at once on his view, without being both 
furprifed and pleafed. The fmall wood of Wood-Mill,

Antiquities*- -If gentlemens feats uninhabited, neglefted, 
or in ruins, may be included under this article, the parifli 
of Abdie has many antiquities, there being 8 manfion- 
houfes in it, Den Mill, Den Muir, Kinnaird, Ayton, 
Lindores, Wood Mill, Berry Hole, Ormifton, either to- ' 
tally deferted, or inhabited by tenants. The manfion- 
houfe of Kinnaird, mentioned by Sibbald as a large new 
houfe, is now in ruins. The manfion-houfe of Den Mill, 
built 1679, is in the fame ftate, and mows the havockof 
time, and the more wafteful and deplorable fteps of ad- 
Yeffity, fupinenefs and negled. Indeed, while one looks 
around him in the parifii of Abdie, and marks the many 
halls now filent, which, in a former century, were the 
feats of hofpitable feftivity and joy, he finds fome diffi- 
culty in admitting, that Scotland is, at prefent, in a ftate 
of higher improvement than it had attained in any for- 
mer period. The antiquities of Abdie extend beyond 
the sera of the feats now mentioned. On the fummit of 
Clatchart Crag, are the evident veftiges of a fortifica- 
tion, or place of ftrength. Sibbald fays it had been a 
itrong caftle. Traces of fortifications on a larger fcale, 
are more vifible on the top of Norman's Law, which, 
from thefituation, and height, and name, one is led to con- 
ftdcr as either the work of fome of the northern invaders,

Population — According to Dr. Webfler's report, the 
number of fouls in 1755, was 822. Since 1789, no ex- 
ad account of the parifh has-been taken. The minriter's 
roll of that year contains 494 of all ages. The decreafe 
of population mult be accounted for, from the enlarge- 
ment of farms, from diminifliing the cottagers, from the 
i^on-reftdence of the principal heritors. 

Agriculture — The farmers of this parifli pradtife the

* Near the village at Lindoves, are pointed out the fuppofed remains of 
a caftle, faid to have belonged to the celebrated M'Duff, Thane of Fife. 
Tradition adds, that in the view of its being demoliflied, much of the plate 
and wealth of it were caft into an adjoining lake, ftill known by the name 
of the Sillar Lajce. Attempts have been made to connect thefe traditions 
with fcenes immortalized by Shakefpeare, in his tragedy of Macbeth. But 
M'Duff, like Wallace, and other favourite characters, has had too many 
•places of refidence affigned him by the fond admiration of his countrymen. 
At no great diftance from the church, and on the way to it from the Ab- 
bey of Lindores, there are a few ftones called the Licker-Stones: Anti- 
quaries have conjectured licker to be a corruption and contraction of lec- 
turer, and with much mow of probability have obferved, that formerly, 
■when Bibles were fcarce, and the capacity of reading them was confined 
to a few, the people might affemble at fuch ftones to hear the fcriptures 
read to them. Not many yards N. W. of the Licker Stones, and nearer 
to the abbey, is a rifing ground called the Teind Know ; at which, tra- 
dition reprefents the ecclefiafticks belonging to the abbey, collecting the 
teinds, or tithes. A little farther N. on the grounds of Den Mill, and in 
full view of the manfion houfe, appears the Witch Tree, a large fpreading 
plane, of more than one century, which, had it fallen under the obferva- 
tion of 'a late traveller, might have faved the county of Fife from one of

fubjed: of embanking, to which this Article has led, is a 
very ferious and important one on the fides of the Tay. 
The current of the river, alas ! gradually wears away 
many acres of the fineft foil in this part of the country. 
Within the rriemory of fome perfons living, whole fields 
have been warned away, and thefe depredations have much 
increafed fince the running out of ftone heads on the op- 
polite fide, for the purpofe of proteding the lands be-

Mtfft of them rear occafionally black cattle, and draught 

horfes for fale. 

There are no fheep-farms, properly fb called, within 
the parifii, though feveral of the farmers keep fmall 
flocks of ftieep, as in the contiguous parilhes, for palhi- 
ring their high grounds, amounting, in whole, to about

ftudied. Were the grounds fubjefted to agriculture, 
properly enclofcd, the farmers might return to the prac- 
tice of keeping greater flocks, as many parts of the parifli 
feem well adapted for iheep-fields. What fpecies fuc- 
ceeds beft, cannot be certainly affirmed, as no proper ex- 
periments have hitherto been made. Notwithftanding 
the evident and acknowledged improvements and melio- 
ration of the foil, Grangers coming from the valley in 
which Cupar ftands on the E., or from Strathearn from 
the W.» muft conftder Abdie as in a ftate of inferior cul- 
tivation. Allowance, however, ought to be made for the 
untowardnefs of a hilly country ; and they are here in- 
formed, that the farmers have little accefs to the quick- 
ening example and animating influence of proprietors. Of 
10, the number of heritors, only i refides on his grounds, 
whofe fields have of late become highly improved. 

''trade in Stones — Since the year 1788, 3 quarries 
have been opened on the riling ground immediately 
S. of the town of Newburgh, at which the rock is 
cut into pavement for the ftreets of London. From 30 
to 50 quarriers and cutters are employed in this work : 
as the demand for the ftones increafes, there is reafon to 
conclude, that the number of hands will be augmented. 
The ftones are Ihipped at the fliore of Newburgh, and 
carried to London chiefly by the veflels employed in the 
falmon trade. Already the returns amount to between 
500I. and 60 ol. Sterling.

ing its near neighbourhood to Auohtermuchty and New-

are few feparatifts from the church of Scotland in Abdie. 
Perhaps obfervation of the ill confequences arifing from 
.the levity, inconfiftcncy and folly of. too many in thefe 
pariflies, has contributed to confirm the bulk of the 
people in their adherence to the Eftabliflied Church, and 
refpecl: for its minifters.-— The fchoolmafter's falary is 
4I. iod., 2 bolls bear, 2 bolls oats, a houfe and fmall gaiv 
den. In fummer, the number of fcholars is about 30 ; 
in winter 40. They are taught reading, writing, arith- 
metic and Latin. — The ftock for the poor is about 600I* 
Sterling ; the refult of legacies, colle&amp;ions at the church 
doors and other cafualties. The neceflitous are few, and 
fufficiently cared for and affifted. 

Char after. — Peaceablenefs of difpolition, and fimplicity 
of manners, have long been regarded as diftinguifliing 
features in the character of the inhabitants. They who 
.know them fpeak warmly of their kindnefs and civilities, 
and praife their perfevering induftry. More detached than 
other pariflies, in which there are large villages, or towns, 
from intercourfe with ftrangers, they retain the modes of 
thinking and a&amp;ing of their fathers : If, therefore, they 
have not the vivacity, neither exhibit they the artful- 
nefs of the prefent times. 

Advantages and Bif advantages. — The proximity of the 
port of Newburgh is favourable for the exportation, or 
ready fale of the grain. Cupar, Auchtermuchty, and 
Newburgh, are markets at hand for their cattle and

jheep. Its various lakes, and the ft reams iffuing from 
them, render Abdie an eligible lituation for maltfters, 
manufacturers, bleachers. That it is well adapted for 
rhat kind of machinery that is moved by water, appears 
by the mills at prefent working in the parifh : they are 
meal mills 5 ; fulling mills 2 ; lint mills 2. On confider- 
ing thefe circumftances, and the vicinity of the populous 
towns named above, one may well be furprifed that no 
manufacturing work of any extent has yet been eftabliffi- 
ed in Abdie. The fituation and command of water is 
inviting, materials are at hand, and labourers would not 
be wanting. — Good is balanced here with fome evil. From 
the unevennefs of the grounds, many places are difficult 
of accefs ; the roads are in bad repair ; fome of the 
marfties cannot be eauly drained ; the harveft on the 
high grounds is often late. By the induflry of the inha- 
bitants, the examples and improvements of the age, and 
the police of the country, many of the difadvantages that 
now prefs upon our obfervation, may be removed at fome 
future period; but the hills, and coldnefs, and difficulty of 
accefs to many places, muft remain. And from the pre- 
fent flate of property, there is little reafon to expe&amp;, that 
the gentlemen, in whofe hands it is placed, will foon re- 
ftore, and return to the feats of their predecelTors, to 
fpread a portion of their wealth over the barrennefs of the 
mountains, and to gladden the vallies with their prefence. </p></div>

Soil, Mode of Hendry, Sive of Farms &amp;c _ The 
foil is various, in molt places fhallow, upon a tiUy bot- 
tom, or on rotten rock. ' In the inland part of thofe pa. 
nfhes, the foil is pretty deep, and rather of a mofly na 
ture. The belt land is near the fea on flat points, where 
the foil is loamy. Oats and be*r, both of a poor quali 
ty, are the only fpecies of grain raifed. The arable land 
is always m tillage ; under the alternate crops of thefe 
or where manure can be got in greater quantity, the ro! 
tation is two crops of bear and one of oats. With a 
or 3 exceptions, the fide plough only, with one flit, is 
ufed. In a rich tender foil, it anfwers extremely well 
for giving the laft ploughing for the bear crop 3 but 
where the ground is firong or flony, it feems very im- 
proper, efpecially in oatland. The returns, in middling 
foil, and ordinary feafons, are fuppofed to be 3 of oats, 
and between 4 and 5 of bear. In general, the oat crop 
turns to poor account. In a favourable feafon, the bear 
crop is better than might be cxpefted, from the ftate of 
hufbandry above defcribed. Potatoes are raifed by each

ter the plough, but hand-hoed. The little time th-.it can be 
fpared from other work, cauics. a frnaller quantity to be cul- 
tivated than would be,' were horie-hoeing underftood. 

There being no limeftone here, or in the vicinity, and 
very little fea-ware got for manure, and even that of the 
worft kind; the common manure is the dung of the 
cattle, mixed with afhes and dry feal in the byres, which 
is carried to the dunghill, and laid in alternate rows with 
moiFy turf. To increafe the quantity of afhes, turf pa- 
red from the moors, where there is fome mixture of peat 
mofs with grit or clay, is burnt for fuel in the houfes, 
with a few peats. * Marl of different kinds is found in 
both parifhes, but little of it ufed for manure, owing to 
the difficulty of taking it up in rainy feafons, and perhaps 
ftill more £0 to the little time many of the people can 
fpare from working, and leading their mailers peats, and 
partly to their ignorance cf its value as a manure. Very 
few of the farms exceed 12 or 13 acres of arable 
land. A farm of 16 or 18 acres is confidered as a great 
one ; and many of them are from 8 to 5 . The rents va- 
ry confiderably, according to the quality of the land, the 
opportunity of rearing cattle, making butter, and other 
local circumftances. In 2 or 3 inftances, the rent is near- 
ly 20s. the acre ; but, in general, even good land does 
not exceed ics. or 12s., and in many places is far below 
that rent f.

Labouring Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c— Horfes only are ufed 
for the plough. Thefe differ in fize and value with the 
lize of the farms, and the circumftances of the farm- 
ers. The higheft priced fell, at prefent, from 81. to 9 1. ? 
the fmaller from 3I. 10s. to 4 1. IO s., when young. A 
great proportion of the horfes is brought from Strath- 
naverj when rifing 2 years old, and fold at high prices. 
Many of the beft are again fold when 4 or 5 years old, 
to the Caithnefs people, at the Lammas market. Mod 
of the farmers in Stennefs, and a few in Firth, keep each 
a cart ox for carrying out the manure. Thefe oxen fell 
from 2I. 1 os. to 3I. Sheep are far from being numerous, 
and probably not a tenth part of what they were 30 years- 
ago ; nor a twentieth of what, with proper care and ma- 
nagement, might be kept in the extenfive ranges of hills 
dividing thefe from the neighbouring pariflies. Confider- 
ing the prefent management, it is only furprifing, that 
the breed is not utterly exterminated. They are never 
herded, and feldom looked after, except for (hearing, for 
marking the lambs, or for the butcher, when they are 
hunted down by dogs, and often fadly torn.' In the winter 
feafon, many of them are carried off by the fea, or high 
tides, from the fkerries, to which they refort to feed on 
fea-weed. The ewes very frequently produce twins, 
but a great proportion of the lambs is devoured by 
dogs, ravens and eagles. After the bear feed is laid 

down, 

bear-meal from Us. to 16s. the meil, (li-§ ftone) ; cows from xl. 10s. to 
al. ios. ; fheep from 4s. to 5s, ; fwine from 5s. to 6s. ; geefe is. ; hens 4c!. ;

vicinity of Kirkwall and Stennefs gives a ready market for every article

down, the fheep are driven from the mores to the hills ; 
the hill-dikes (as they are called), are (lightly repaired j 
but thefe earthen fences are feldom fit to keep out horfes 
and cattle, and far lefs thefe wild ftieep. Every perfon 
is, by conference, obliged to fet the dogs on them when 
they approach his farm : And as, perhaps, more than 5 
.out of 6 of the farmers have no ftieep of their own, it 
may be eafily imagined, that the dogs are often allowed 
to tear them to pieces. 

Population.— According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
population in 1755, was 1108. The number of fouls in 
both parifhes, at the beginning of the year 1793, was as 
under :

Manners and Condition of the People. — The people, in 
general, are indultrious, when not depreffed by poverty, 
and overburdened with fervices. Few of them can be 
called rich ; but a very confiderable proportion of them 
are tolerably comfortable in their circumftances. With 
fo fmall farms, fuch as have numerous families muft be 
poor. When the crop fails, or turns out but indifferent^- 
Jy, feveral of them are greatly ftraitened. Of 5 inftances, 
where twin children have been born within thefe 7 years, 3 
of them were among the very pooreft people, and who re- 
quired parochial collections to amfc them in getting them 
nurfed. In the winter feafon, the prefent circumflances

of the country afford the people here lefs opportunity for 
exerting their induftry than could be wifhed, for their 
good, in every refped. In refpeft of morals, the people 
are pretty much on a level with their neighbours. As 
to religion, they are all of the Eftabliftied Church, and 
happily ignorant of the controverfies on fpeculative 
points, and of the peculiar tenets of the feveral fefts, 
whofe zeal for their own credenda, have occafioned fo 
much unchriftian animofity in other countries. Some 
years ago, feveral very decent people of the Quakers came 
to this country, and the pari&amp;ioners here attended them 
with pleafure, as they afked nothing from them. But 
afterward, coming to the knowledge, that the Quakers 
obferve not the facraments, they were greatly amazed, 
and anxious to know if they were Chriftians *. 

The Poor.— There are, at prefent, very few begging 
poor in thefe parities, feveral of them having died late- 
ly. There is no fund for their fupport, except the col- 
lections at church, and thefe are exceedingly trifling-. 
Thofe whofe circumftances permit it, are charitable, not 
only to the begging poor, but to families in diftreffed cir- 
cumftances, and efpeoially to fuch as are confined by 
licknefs 

Dif advantages and Hindrances to Improvements 

Thefe are owing partly to peculiar local circumftances, 
and partly to the habits of the people. It would natu,

&amp;a$ and circumflances, to afcribe them to the fmallnefs 
of the farms, and to the fhort leafes ufually granted by 
the landlords. This, however* would be a ram, perhaps 
an erroneous decifion. The want of flock at fetting up a 
farm, or being obliged 'to fell off cattle for payment of 
rent, difqualifies a man from doing juftice to his land ; 
and one with 5 or 6 acres of land* has frequently a bet- 
ter corn-yard than another in the fame field with 8 or 9 
acres. That the longeft leafes in the prefent circumftan- 
ces of the country, would be of little confequence, with 
regard to improvements, may be admitted, in a place 
Where proprietors of farms, and which have been in their 
families for feveral generations, obferve the fame mode 
of hufbandry, and are neither better lodged, clothed, and 
fed, than the tenants in the neighbourhood. Their feu- 
duties, to be fure, are heavy. Their farms, perhaps,, 
have been feued at the a&amp;ual rent, when the feus were 
granted^ But the rents of neighbouring farms have, in 
fome inftances, been doubled ; and yet the tenants live 
as well as the generality of thefe petty proprietors. Good 
grafs is much wanted,. All the cattle, except the milch- 
cows, are turned out to the hills and moors, where 
they make a ftiift to preferve life, but are ftinted in their 
growth j and the queys are often 5 or 6 years old before 
they have a calf. But there can be no grafs fown where 
there are neither enclofures nor proper herding ; and to 
leave land out of tillage, which has been in conftant tillage 
forages, produces only weeds. Belides thenumbers of fmall 
fwine that run at large from the time the corns are taken 
in till the bear-feed for the enfuing crop be fown, root 
up every grafs that might grow. 

Ploughing after harveft is very unufual. Small as the 
farms are ; this occalions a throng of work in the fpring.

Should any man be 8' or 10 days behind his neighbours, 
he will have woe enough in harveft. How foon the oats 
are cut down, they are hurried into the yard. All the 
cattle are left to their liberty ; and he whofe corns are 
unripe, muft cut them down, or exped to have them de- 
flroyed. By the middle of Oftober, hunger and cold! 
force home the half ftarved cattle from the hills ; the 
hill-dikes are too weak to keep them out ; and it is 
equally impra&amp;icable to poind thefe invaders, as to pre- 
vent their incurfions. They muft be hunted with dogs 
to the mountains, perhaps after a dozen of them have 
run through fields of Handing corn. The hopes of any 
improvement, or better management, are very re- 
mote. The great number of heritors concerned in one 
piece of land, will be found a great bar to improvements 
whenever they fliall be attempted. In one town of land, 
as it is called, confifting of about 60 acres, and with &amp; 
farm-houfes, befides cottagers houfes, 11 heritors have an 
intereft. A very few farmers derive fome- confiderable 
profit, by felling peats to the towns of Kirkwall and 
Stromnefs : Others are obliged to fpend moft of the fum- 
mer in cutting, winnowing,, and leading peats to their land- 
lords. But even thofe who are not bound to fuch fer- 
vices, and who are not advantageoufly fituated for pro- 
fiting by this article, often fpend the beft part of the fum- 
mer, about what fetches them a fmall trifle of money ; 
when, in all probability, the fame time employed in dig- 
ging and leading marl for their land would give them 
vaftly more profit, though not fo immediate. But the 
farm is neglected for a cow's hide, and a few fliillings, 
or a few ftone weight of meal, to help to maintain them

^fc of putting into their matter's hands, or the price of 
them, at their own option. They complain of the hm- 
drance to their farming,, and the injury to their horfes m 
poor pafture, and bad roads, in cafe of rainy weather ; 
and yet they choofeto pay the peats. Some of the people 
in Firth declare they make no profit by this article, and 
yet go on in the ufual way, left their neighbours mould 
account them thriftlefs* 

Many of the young people of each fex, with cottagers,, 
tailors and fhoemakers, who are unemployed in fummer 
in their handicrafts, are all employed in kelp-making. 
It is fcarcely poffible for a farmer to keep a man fervant, 
or even a boy, without allowing him a month or two of 
the fummer to go to the kelp ; at which work, in a dry 
feafon, they make far better wages than the farmers can 
afford. 

Nothing, however, contributes fo much to the hurt of 
this place, as the refort of the Hudfon's Bay Company's 
mips to Stromnefs, and their engaging kds from this coun- 
try. A few lads returning with fome money, make ex- 
cellent recruits for the Company's fervice j and the re- 
port of a war makes great numbers folicit to go out t© 
their fettlements. The farmers fervants and fans leave 
them, to fpend the prime of life in cold and drudgery in 
the N. W. ; from whence fuch of them as are not inca- 
pacitated by difeafes contrafted there, return to be farm- 
ers, their Ikill in that line not improved by their abfence, 
and their habits frequently not calculated tc-make themfuc- 
cefsful. Young men, who have learned any of the trades 
needed there, have good wages, and often come home with 
confiderable fums of money. But even they generally fet

commonly reduced to mean circumftances. Young lads 
however, who have married before they have an/flock' 
or can get fmall farms (as often happens), by going in-' 
to the Company's fervice, are able to remit a trifle to 
the lr families ; and when a man and his wife cannot live 
in peace together, the parties and the parifh are relieved 
from fuch difquiets, by the hufband's retreat to the Hud- 
fon's Bay fettlements 

Curiqfities and Antiquities — In the parifh of Stennefs 
arefeveral large ereft ftones, fome Handing fingle, and 
others in confiderable number, and regular figures. The 
greateft number is in a circular form, furrounded with 
a pretty wide and deep ditch, of confiderable circumfe- 
rence. Many of the ftones there are broken and fallen 
down : Their fize is not large. The largefl ftand be- 
tween the kirk of Stennefs and a caufeway over a narrow 
and mallow place of the loch of Stennefs. Four of thefe 
form a fegment of a circle ; and it is probable there has 
been a complete femicircle, as fome ftones broken down 
feem to have flood in the fame line. The highefl of 
thofe now ftanding is about 18 feet above the level of the 
ground. At a little diftance from thefe, is a (lone with 
a hole of an oval form in it, large enough to admit a man's 

head 

* The want of flax is alfo a great difadvantage to this place. Were it 
cultivated, and the flieep properly taken care of, there cannot be a doubt, 
but thecircumftances of the people would be greatly meliorated. At pre- 
fent, both, wool and flax muft be bought at very high prices. A lint- 
mill would be very ufeful, and a great encouragement to the raifing of 
flax, were any confiderable proprietor to encourage the cultivation of this 
ufeful article. But much good might be done by perfuading a few of the 
moft fenfible farmers to fow fome flax-feed. The trifling expeni'e of pur- 
chafing a little feed, and a hand brake, would operate as a premium. By 
this practice, another advantage might be expected, viz. additional worfc 
for the winter feafon, which would be for the benefit of the morals, as 
well as the intereft of the people,

qne fide, it is {lender, and has the appearance of being 
worn with a chain. 

Clofe by the above mentioned circle of Hones, are fe- 
veral tumuli, evidently artificial, fome of them raifed 
pretty high, of a conical form, and fomewhat hollow 
upon the top. About half a mile from the femicircu- 
lar range of ftones, is another beautiful tumulus, confi- 
derably larger than the former, around which has been 
a large ditch. This lafl is diftinguiflied by the name of 
Mefow, or * Mefe-how. 

Guthrie mentions fome Roman fibulae to have been 

found in Stennefs. 

Memorable Events.— -In the neighbourhood of Gar- 
mifton, in the parifh of Stennefs, in the fide of a peat- 
mofs, are feveral heaps of earth, faid to be the graves 
of thofe who fell in a fldrmilh, at what is called the 
Battle of Summerfdale, or Bigfwell. The following is 
reported to have been the occafion of this action. Up- 
on the 1 8th of May 1529, in the reign of James V. John 
Earl of Caithnefs, pretending fome right to Orkney, 
came over with troops to feize it, landed at Howton, and 
proceeded to Summerfdale in Stennefs, where they were 
beat back by the Orkney and Shetland people into a place 
called the Mofs of Bigfwald, where the Earl and moft of 
the people were killed, and the reft taken prifoners. Num- 
bers of their bones, and part of their clothing have been 
dug up, which was b^ack when firft got, but foon fell in-

Mifcellaneous Obfervations — There are 4 tryfts in the

f It is faid, that the Earl of Caithnefs and Lord Sinclair were killed at 
£htt lkirmifh ; and that a ftone is yet to be feen, upon a green fpot in 
Garmifton, near Bigfwald, which was placed over the grave either of 
the one or of the other. Wallace, in his account of the Orkneys, fays, 
" The Earl of Caithnefs and the Lord Sinclair, came with a great army by 
fea,. into Orkney, to have taken poffeiTion of it, as of a, country to which they 
pretended fome right ; but the people of the country, under the command 
of Sir James Sinclak (natural Con to Robert Sinclair, the laft Earl of Ork- 
ney of that firname), encountered the Earl with fuch courage, at a place 
called Summerfdale, that his whole army was wholly difcomfited; the 
Earl himfelf, with 500 of his men being killed ; and the Lord Sinclair^ 
with all the reft, taken prifoners." Wallace adds, " poor Sinclair their 
leader, drowned himfelf afterwards." 

The following refpite, in favour of Edward Sinclair, and others, for the 
daughter of the Earl of Caithnefs, found in a gentleman's papers in Shet- 
land, is a fufficient proof of this fact

is likewife a flate quarry, but not much wrought at pre, 
fent, and excellent flag, very ferviceable to thefe, and 
part of the neighbouring parifties, for roofing their houfes. 
They are laid on loofe, covered with a little thatch, and 
the whole kept tight by heath ropes. A road from 
Kirkwall to Stromnefs, runs through thefe pariflies ; 
which, though repaired every other fummer, where molt 
needful, is, notwithftanding, very bad in winter. There 
are two burns crofling this road, which fland greatly in 
need of bridges : The other burns crofling it have bridges 
of ftrong planks of wood, properly fixed together. There 
is a bridge at the ftrait, which joins the loch of Stennefs 
with the fea, of large and ftrong logs of wood laid acrofs 
the openings between the ftone pillars. It has never been 
properly finifhed ; and, having no railing at the fides, 
young children and weakly people run no fmall rifk of 
being blown over, and drowned. For 2 miles above this 
bridge, to a ftrait where there is a caufeway, the loch is 
brackilh. It extends up the country nearly 5 miles far- 
ther, is of confiderable, though various breadth and 
depth, and abounds with trout and eel. Swans frequent 
this loch, and the Bay of Firth, in the winter feafon. In

<p>
jSfame, Situation, and Extent, 

r-f^HlS parifh, though of large extent, does notfurnifh 
much matter for a ftatiftical account. It feems to 
nave got its name fromfome reputed faint, called Ninian,. 
of whom there is now no tradition remaining in the place. 
The form is a broad peninfula, lying N. W. from the 
ifthmus, where the large ifland of Mull is almolt cut into 
2 nearly equal parts, by a deer/bay from the Atlantic, 
called Lochnankell, or Lochnmgaul, which penetrates 
into the country fo far, as to be fcarce 3 miles diftant 
from the E. coaft of the ifland at Aros Bay, on the Sound 
of Mull. In the mouth of Lochnankell lie the Iflands of 
Ulva, Gometra, Little Colonfay and Staffs, all of which 

S 2 are 



4 6 Stotijtical Account 



are inhabited, and belong to this parifh, together with a 
clufter of fmall uninhabited iflands, called thelfles of Treif- 
nifli. Exclufive of all thefe iflands, excepting Ulva andGo- 
metra, this parifliis computed to be 12 miles long, and 12 
miles broad; furrounded on all fides by the fea, excepting 
at the ifthmus already mentioned, which,, together with 
Lochnankell, divides this from the parilhes of Torafay 
and Kilfinichin on the S. To the W. of Kilninian are 
the iflands Tiree and Coll ; the former at the diftance of 
about 6 or 7 leagues, the latter about 3 leagues from 
land to land. At a much greater diftance to the N. are 
feen the ifles of Canna, Rum, Egg and Muck ; and near- 
er hand, is the point, or head land of Ardnamurchan, be- 
ing the W. extremity of the main land of Scotland. To 
the E. the Sound of Mull divides this parifh from that 
of Morven. In the county cefs-book, the valued extent 
of the parifh of Kilninian amounts to 138 merks land, of 
which only 65 have been furveyed, and found equal to 
25,644 acres : So that the whole parifli cannot be much 
below 55,000 acres of ground. 

Surface, Soil, and Agriculture . — The general appearance 
of the land is hilly, and thefe hills are, for the moft part, 
covered with heath ; but there are no mountains of re w 
markable height. What is called arable land, lies, for 
the moll part, near the fliore. The more inland parts are 
tolerable good pafture,. intermixed with a large propor- 
tion of mafs and barren heath. The foil, in general, is 
but barren, being a light reddifli earth, or a mixture of 
mofs, with little depth, and much under watec The 
fpots which deferve a more favourable defcription, are 
in proportion, few and fmall. The ftate of agriculture 
is very backward, 6wing chiefly to the rugged face of the 
ground, and forbidding nature of the climate. Very few 

carts, 



Of Kilniniajic 14 T 

tarts, or even fledges, are ufed. Some gentlemen nave 
begun to ufe the two-horfe plough, but hitherto rarely 
without a goad's man. The common crop is a very ir^ 
ferior kind of oats, which the inhabitants call fmall oats. 
They begin fowing them about the 20th of March ; and it 
is the beginning of October, and fometimes later, before 
they are ripe. The common return is 3 feeds ; of which 
1 bolls go to make one of meal. Barley is fown about the 
end of April, arM is ripe about the middle or end of Au- 
guft. It returns from 6 to 10 feeds ; and when fown in 
old ground, manured with fea-ware, and laboured with 
the fpade, it produces fometimes 16 fold. Potatoes are, 
for the moft part, planted in beds by the fpade, and make 
the chief fubfiflence of the poorer fort, for 3 quarters, or 
10 months of the year. The returns are various, accord- 
ing to the manure and labour expended on them ; but 
that they are far Ihort of the returns from this root, in 
other parts of Scotland, is evident from this circumftance, 
that fome families, in this country, find it neceflary to- 
plant from 30 to 40 barrels of them yearly, for their 
own confumption. Till the late a£t, obliging diftillers 
of fpirits to take out a licenfe, the manufacturing of 
barley into whilky, was by much too common a prac- 
tice in this country ; but the number of frills have, fince 
that period, been greatly diminifhed, much to the advan- 
tage of the country, and, it is thought, without any lofs 
to the revenue. 

Climate, &amp;c. — The climate of this ifland is very rainy? 
and, according to the general perfuafion, it has become 
much more fo of late years, than formerly. Severe gales 
of wind, from the W. and N. W. are frequent. Our 
winters are, for the moft part, much more temperate and 

mild, 



•H2 Stati/licat Account 

mild than in the inland parts of Scotland . Thg . 

, feldom whoilv covered with fnow; nor are the frofts 
of any long continuance ; but our fummers are often to 
be complained of, as too rainy and cold, and effort con- 
amance. Yet the climate, upon the whole, is not unfa-, 
vourable to health t many perfons live to the age of be- 
tween 80 and 90, and a few have exceeded 90 years 
who died in the prefent incumbent's time. The moft 
common diftempers are, colds, rheut^atifms, and a 
pain in the breaft, or pit of the ftomach ; all of which 
may, perhaps, be attributed to the poverty of diet 
*nd clothing, not lefs than to the moiftnefs of the 
climate, as the richer fort are lefs frequently troubled 
with fuch complaints than the poor. The laft is fo com- 
vnon, as to have obtained, in their language, the name 
of the part afFeded, viz. beul a mhaothain. 

Roads and Bridges, &amp;c — .The roads througa this pa- 
nfh are, in many parts, very bad, and the improvement 
of them proceeds but (lowly. This may be partly the 
fault of proprietors, who pay much lefs attention to the 
making of proper roads, than the importance of fuch im- 
provement defer ves. But the frequency of hills, great' 
or fmall, as alfo of rocks or mofTes, which occur on moft 
of the lines of roads in this country, is the principal ob- 
ftm&amp;ion. The fund allowed, and the money collected for 
roads and bridges, is fo difproportionate to the extent 
and furface, and to the expenfe requifite for overcoming 
thefe natural impediments, that it will take many, many 
years, before they can be brought to any tolerable per- 
fection. At prefent, there is but one bridge in the whole 
parilh, though there are many torrents interfecling the 
roads, which a few hours of heavy rain will render im- 
palfable, till the Iky clears again. Another bridge is*

now begun to be built at Tobermory. But though we 
are behind many of our neighbours in bridges and roads, 
the people have, within thefe 30 years paft, made confi- 
derable progrefs in other ufeful improvements, particu- 
larly in enclofing ground, and building more comfortable 
dwelling houfes, for which there is a growing tafte. 

Lakes, Rivers t Coqjis. — There are 5 lakes in the pa- 
rifti, all of them abounding with excellent trout. Our 
rivers are not confiderable for the body of water ; yet, 
at the mouth of 2 or 3 of them, a few fine falmon are 
found in the fummer feafon. The mores are, for the 
moft part, high and rocky ; yet not without many open- 
ings and flats ? in fome of which are found banks of mell, 
crumbled into fand, which is much ufed for manure. In 
this, as in moft Highland countries, the cuftom is, to con- 
fine cattle in folds during the fummer and autumn nights ; 
and the fpots thus manured, are called Tathfields. Wheft 
a tathfield is thinly ftrewed with this fand, in the month 
of July or Auguft, it produces 4 or 5 crops of fuch oats 
as are raifed here, and would give more, if followed fur- 
ther j but if a greater number of crops is taken, or if 
the fand has been laid on without a mixture of other ma- 
nure, it foon impoverifties the foil. The fmall tenantry 
have fometimes, through ignorance or avarice, fo run out 
ground, by fuch management, as to render it almoft per- 
feaiy ufelefs for many years thereafter. What is moft 
remarkable in this ftielly fand, is, that, for a few years 
after it has been laid on, daifies and white clover appear 
in ground where they were never known before. On 
the coafts of this parilh, fome ling, cod, lkate, mackerel 
flounder, lythe, feath, perch, dog-fifh, &amp;c. are found' 
but not m any great quantities. The herring fometimes

appear at LachnankeU, but feldom make any long flay, 
pr are caught in quantities worth fending to market. Our 
coaft furnifties variety of fhdl-fifli, viz. oifters, lobfters, 
crabs, fpoutfifti, clam, limpets, wilks, &amp;c. There are alfo 
niany otters, feals, porpoifes, befides moft of the fea-fowls 
that are common on the weft coaft of Scotland, whether 
natives of this climate, or birds of paflage. 

Harbours, Boats, and Ferries — The principal harbour 
Tobermory, at which a village has lately been erect- 
ed by the Britifti Society for improving the coafts. 
North of Tobermory is the Bloody Bay, and S. of it the 
Bay of Aros. Thefe 3 harbours are on the Sound of 
Mull. On the weftern coaft of the parifti are the Sound 
of Ulva, the Bay of Soribay, Bru, or the Bay of Glack- 
nangallan : All thefe are reckoned fafe anchoring ground. 
On the Ifle of Gometra, are two harbours, one facing the 
S., and one the N. j and both reckoned fafe and good for 
coafting vefTels. On the N. fide of the parifti, are the 
creeks of Laorin, Lorkmingary, Pollaach, Croig, and 
Bay of Calgary, which laft opens toward Tiree. In the 
whole parifti, there are not above 3 or 4 boats of a large 
fize, which carry coaftwife for freight ; but fmall yawls, 
for fiftiing near the Ibore, and other purpofes of convenien - 
cy, are very numerous. There have been, forfome years 
back, fometimes 1, fometimes 2 packet-boats, which 
run from Greenock to the village of Tobermory, calling 
at the interjacent harbours: But as they are private pro r 
perty, and have no encouragement from the public, the 
time of their arrivals and departures muft depend on the 
bufinefs that offers. Mr. M'Lean of Coll has, at his own 
expenfe, eftabliftied another packet-boat, which goes re- 
gularly once a week from his cftate in this parifti, to the 
6 Ifland 



Of Kilninian. 145 



Ifland of Coll, returning next day. The ferries from 
sthis to the neighbouring parifhes, are 2 to Morven, i to 
Ardnamurchan, and I to the parifh of Kilfinichen. The 
communication with Tiree, and other iflands, is only by 
occafional boats or veffels. 

Live Stock The live flock of the whole parifli, as 

nearly as can be conjectured, without numbering them, 
-may be about 3000 head of black cattle, of all ages ; 
.400 horfes, including mares and followers ; 4500 lheep of 
•the South Country kind, befides a considerable number of 
the fmaller Highland kind. 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr. Webfter's report^ 
the population, in 1755, was 2590. The total number 
of fouls, according to a lift taken laft winter, amounts to 
3281. Total number of baptifms, from January 1. 1792, 
to January 1. 1793, was 96 ^ of which 45 were boys, and 
51 girls. Total number of marriages in that period, 32.: 
But, according to the parochial regifter, the annual ave- 
rage of baptifms is but 8q, and of marriages 22 *. 

Pojl Offices, Sheriff Court.— -There are 2 poll offices in 
*his parifli ; 1 at Aros, and 1 in Tobermory. The ar- 
rivals and departures are 3 times a-week. There is alfo 
a merifF-fubftitute court, lately eftablifhed at Tobermo- 
ry, for the regular adminiftration of juftice. This muft 
^urn greatly to the advantage of the ifland at large j as 

Vol. XIV. T b ^ or ^ 

 

* There is little doubt, however, that maiiy baptifms of the parifh have 
jio.t been entered upon the regifter, both becaufe of the acl impofing a tax 
on entries of this kind, and becaufe it is a practice with people, who live: 
at a diftance from the parifh minifter, to apply occafionaily to other cler- 
gymen, for the benefit of that ordinance. There is no account kept of 
burials, becaufe of the number, and great diftan.ces of the places of inter* 
mcnt.

Statl/lical Account 



before this eftablifhment, there was no maglftrate, ex- 
cepting juftices of the peace, nor an 7 regular court of 
law nearer us than the borough of Inverary, at the dif- 
tance of at leaft 60 miles, befides ferries. This would 
make a poor man fuccumbto injuries, rather than attempt 
to obtain legal redrefs. 

Rental and Heritors The whole valued rent of the 

parilh is 329I. 3s. Sterling. The real grofs rent, at 
prefent, is not below 3000L The Duke of Argyll is pa- 
tron, and principal heritor. His Grace has a chamber- 
lain refiding at Aros, who manages the bufinefs of his 
eftates in the whole of Mull and Morven. There are o- 
ther 5 heritors of this parifli, 2 of whom refide therein, 
and 1 nigh it. The Britifli Society, for improving the 
coafts, &amp;c, have a property alfo of about 2000 acres near 
their village of Tobermory ; but the far greater part is 
hill or mofs. The ground fit for tillage, lying in detach- 
ed fpots near the harbour, is not confiderable, either for 
extent or quality. 

Village of Tobermory — The above fociety began to 
form this village in the year 1788 j and a cuftomhoufe, 
and poll office, were eftablilhed there in the year 1791, 
The village now confifts of 15 houfes, built with none 
and lime, 2 ftories in height, with dated roofs, and of 
between 20 and 30 thatched houfes, 1 ftory high. The 
population is about 300 fouls. In this village are a few 
people, who follow the mercantile line, and ferve the 
fettlers and neighbouring diftricls in goods imported from 
the Low Country. A boa^-builder alfo, and a cooper, 
have fettled there, and find pretty conftant employment 
in the building of boats, and making of barrels for the 
£fhery : And there is a confiderable ft ore of fait kept 

there,

there, for fnpplying the bufs and boat fifliers, in the fiili- 
ing feafon. In the year 1792* there were 47 veffels and 
boats cleared from this cuftqmhoufe, for the herring-fifh- 
ery ; and as they were fuccefsful laft year, there is caufe 
to hope, that the number will be greater this feafon. 
There are, of other crafts, 1 fmith, 1 wright, 2 tailors, a 
flioemakers, and 3 or 4 fmail inn-keepers; alfo a corn-mill 
with a fufficiency of water to work machinery, to a confi- 
derable extent, in all feafons. Tobermory polTeffes the ad- 
vantage of a fafe, capacious harbour, fituated in the tract 
of the ihipping, which pafs from the weftern parts of Bri- 
tain to the northern countries of Europe, and has an 
eafy communication by water, with the fiihing lochs, in 
one direction, and with the Frith of Clyde, Liverpool, 
and other conliderable towns, in the other. This, it 
mult be allowed, is a favourable lituation, not only for 
the profecution of the fiiheries, but alfo for other branches 
of trade. Hitherto, however, no perfon of fufficient en- 
terprife has attempted to introduce into this fettlement 
any kind of manufacture *. 

T 2 Trade/men, 

* One great obftruction to attempts of this nature, was the tax upon 
coals carried coaftways; of the abolition of which, we have now happily a 
near profpect. Whatever good effect may be produced by the abolition of 
fo heavy and partial a tax, till the country feel the benefit of this intend- 
ed relief, it could not be expected, that any confidcraMe manufacture 
would prove fuccefsful, either at Tobermory, or any where elfe, through 
thefe weftern ifles of Scotland, becaufe their only fuel was turf or peats, 
cut and prepared, even in the beft feafons, at a great expenfe of time and 
labour, and liable to be totally loft or ufelefs, when the fummers prove 
very rainy, which is frequently the cafe, and forely felt. Befides this, the 
extreme barrennefs of the ground at Tobermory, and in the countries

this view, every thing .fhould he done to render the accefs hy land to this 
place lefs difficult, and the condition of the inhabitants there, more eafy and 
comfortable. As the circumftances of the country do not, at prefent, af- 
ford the advantages of a regular market, it is indifpenfably neceffary, that 
fettlers in this village, fhouldjhave fpotsof ground allotted to them, for fur- 
mfhing fome of the moft neceffary articles of daily confumption, and thefe 
fpots fhould be let at fuch moderate rates, as would be not only an 
inducement, but even an encouragement to perfons of fome fubftance and 
enterprife to fettle at this place. Inftead of this being the cafe at prefent, 
an univerfal complaint prevails among the inhabitants of the dearnefs of 
the rent, which the fociety exact for their ground there. It is not to be 
wondered at, that the gentlemen, who have the direction of the fociety's 
affairs, and who, perhaps, only know the Highlands from the curfory ob- 
fervations of a fhort tour made by themfelves, or others, in the fineft fum- 
mer weather, are apt to form too favourable an opinion of the general va- 
lue of land in this part of the kingdom. They have themfelves, it is like- 
ly, been in the habit of feeing land let every year, at the rate of from 20s. 
to 40s. an acre, perhaps at much more ; and it is natural for them, there- 
fore, to think, that fufficient allowance is made for the difference of qua- 
lity and fituation, when the lands about T»bermory are let at about 5s. an 
acre. This, however, will be found a miftaken notion ; and when thefe 
refpectable characters fhall have acquired a more intimate knowledge of 
the extreme meannefs of the foil about Tobermory, its barrennefs as to 
produce, and its difadvantages in regard to climate, and accefs to manures, 
as their great object is to relieve and aflift the people, there is no doubt, 
but they would judge 5s. an acre too great a rent to be demanded in 
the infancy of a remote eftablifhment, fo circumftanced. In corrobo- 
ration of what has been now advanced, let it be confidered, that a 
fmall Highland cow cannot be kept alive upon lefs than 6 or 7 acres of 
the common run of land about Tobermory, befides a great deal of la- 
bour andexpenfe, in finding winter provifion for her. And if to this is 
added, the cxpenfe which her owner muft be put to in enclofing his fmall 
lot of ground, not to mention that of building his houfe, it will appear, 
when every thing is laid together, that his fcanty accommodation Hands 
liiim dearer, in proportion to the returns he has from it, than the higheft 
priced accommodation of fettlers hear large cities in Scotland cr England,-

has been already faid of the foil, agriculture, and popula- 
tion of this parifh, it will be readily believed, that many 
of our people are poor ; and it is but too true. The lift 
of thofe who receive part of the public charity, is never 
under 70 5 and in fome years, it is between 90 and 100.

What is colleaed for them at church on Sundays, toge-

The annual amount of both of which, is from 12I. to

Beyond the limits of the parifti ;. : and in this pradice, 
thofe of other parifhes return the compliment. It is but- 
jaftice to remark here, that 2 of the heritors, viz. Mr. 
Maclean of Coll, and Mr. Macdonald of Boifdale, make an- 
annual allowance in money, to the poor in their refpec- 
tive eftates in this parifti, though not fufficient to main- 
tain them without other charities.

feveral of thefe, the precincts may ftill be traced ; and 
there are veftiges of fcoufes within the precincts, where,

according to tradition, thofe who took afylum in ths 
confccratcd ground, were lodged. At prefent, however, 
there are but two churches, or rather houfes for wor* 
ttip ; one at Kilninian, and one at Kilmore, at the dif- 
tance of about 4 computed, or 6 meafured miles from 
each other, with a hill intervening, and 2 torrents of wa- 
ter, not always fordable. Both thefe churches were built 
in the year 1754 ; and though too fmall for the congre- 
gations, are kept in tolerable good repair. The incum- 
bent, whofe living is 83I. 6s. 8d. Sterling in money, 
with a fmall money allowance in lieu of manfe and glebe,' 
preaches alternately in thefe churches, but muft go, once' 
in the quarter, to the Ifland of Ulva, where he preaches 
In the open air, for want of a church. It was alfo cuf- 
tomary for him to preach twice in the quarter at Aros, 
diftant 8 computed miles from his refidence, till the com- 
mittee on the Royal Bounty, about the year 1776, efta* 
blifhed a million in Mull ; by which the divifion of Aros, 
together with the outlkirts of the other 2 large parifhes, 
of which this ifland confifts, are fupplied in ordinances'. 
This mimonary has only 25I. Sterling of falary, without 
any accommodation whatever. So parfimonious is the 
provilion made for the adminiftration of religious ordi- 
nances', in this part of the country, that although every 
minifter has parochial bounds affigned him, extenfive 
enough to require the labours of 3 clergymen, yet the 
ftipends drawn by 3, would be no more than an adequate 
living for 2, efpecially conlidering the perfonal toil and 
expenfe to which they are neceflarily expofed, in the dif- 

chaxge of their function -The clergy are not the only 

people who have caufe to complain of this extreme and 
improvident frugality. Schoolmafters are no lefs affect- 
ed by it. At prefent, there is but one parochial fchool 



in

in this extenfive parifli. The falary is iol. Sterling, with- 
out any accommodation whatever, not fo much as a 
houfe for the fchool or fchoolmafter. The people, and 
fome of the heritors, infift on its being ambulatory ; and 
for the Ihort period, it can be continued in any one place, 
it mufl be taught in any hovel that can conveniently be 
fpared. It mull be obferved, however, that his Grace 
the Duke of Argyll has lately agreed to make fuch addi- 
tion to the parochial falary, as to afford iol. Sterling for 
each of 2 fchoolmaflers, to be ftationary upon his own 
property, which, it is hoped, will foon be carried into 
effea. The Society for Propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge, have 2 fchools on their eftablilhment in this pa- 
rifli ; one of which being on the Laird of Coil's property, 
that gentleman gives 4I. Sterling in addition to their fa- 
lary, befides furniftiing all the accommodation required 
by them ; their other fchool is in the Iflahd of Ulva, 
and they have promifed a falary for a third fchool at To- 
bermory, as foon as a proper dwelling and fchool houfe, 
with other neceflary accommodation, are provided for the 
matter, to be employed there. The want of this fchool 
is no fmall hinderance to the progrefs and profperity of 
that village *. 

Exports 

* Prices, Sec. — For many years back, there has been a gradual rife in 
the price of provifions and neceffariea of life, through this parifh and 
neighbourhood. There are old men alive, who have feen the boll of 
meal of this country growth and meafure, which weighs about 1 14 {tones, 
fold at 5s. or 6s., now it is feldom or never under aos. The meal is of a 
quality much inferior to what is brought from the Low Country. A weth- 
er, of the fmall country kind, which was formerly got at, from 3s. to 4s., 
is now rarely under 7s., and often exceeds that price. A cow of the 
fmaller kind, fit for flaughter, will fetch from 55s. to 3I. 10s. The wages 
of a man fervant a-year, from 3I. to 4I. 10s., cxclufivc of what flioes he ic-

Exports and Imports — The average quantity of kelp 
manufactured annually in this parifh, is from 170 to i8d 
.tons. The manufacturing cofts about 30s. a ton, and the 
kelp is fold, in this country, from 3I. 10s. to 6J. the ton, 
according as the market rules. The only other exports 
worth mentioning, are black cattle, fheep and wool. The 
black cattle, for the moll part, are fold lean at a fair, 
^vhich begins in this parifh on the 13th of May yearly, 
and is continued in the other parifhes of the iiland, upon 
3 different days thereafter, with a day always intervening. 
The imports into the parifh are many, particularly oat- 
meal, feed-corn, feed-potatoes, leather, fait, and a variety 
of merchant goods. The cuflomhoufe has not been long 
enough eftablifhed to afcertain the annual average quan- 
tity of each. 

General Chara&amp;er. — All the people of the parifh are of 
the Eftablifhed Religion, excepting 2 or 3 obfcure fami- 
lies introduced, a few years ago, from South Uift, who 
are of the Popifh perfuafion ; and fince their arrival a- 
mong Proteftants, have got fo much the better of their 
bigotry, that they now attend our publick meetings for 
worfhip, as often as they are held near their place of xe- 
fidence. The people, in general, are fond of religious in- 
struction, fober, honefl and induftrious, if they had a fub- 
je£t to work upon. They are alfo humane and chari- 
table, in proportion to their circumftances. But from 
this general chara&amp;er, there are many exceptions, as 
might reafonably be expected in fo populous a diftrict, 
and in a fituation fo uncultivated.

Advantages and Difadvanta,es. -The parilh being al- 
tnoft wholly grounded by the fea, the mores are of 
? «at utility, both by furniming fea-ware, for manure 
to the .round, and mell-n(h at low water, particularly 
in the fummer months, for immediate fuftenance, as 
well as by the continual accefs to look for fuch other 
fifli as are found upon this coaft. Though carnage, by 
water, may be reckoned a great advantage, to which all 
the parts of the parifti have accefs, yet the unimproved 
ftate of the country, and poverty of the inhabitants, pre, 
vent their reaping from it all the benefit that might be 
expeded. This infular fituation alfo lefTens the value of 
their exports and live cattle. The fmall proportion of 
arable to pafture land, prevents tbe people from living in 
a colleded ftate, In any confiderable numbers ; it alfo oc- 
canons the uniting of many fmaller farms into 1 large te- 
nement. So that, however great their attachment is to 
their native foil, many individuals, and fome families, 
find it neceffary to go every year for fervice to the Low- 
Country ; though not a few of them rctu'rn again to pafs 
the winter with their friends. As the herring buffes* 
on their Way out, frequently come to anchor in the har- 
bour of Tobermory, the young men of the neighbour- 
hood have the opporiunity, which many of them embrace, 
of hiring themfelves on board thefe veffels, for the fifhing 
feafon. Others go in open boats, and bring home what 
herrings they can catch, or purchafe, for fupplying their 
own families : and the furplus they fell to their neigh- 
bours. The young women are often employed in cutting 
the kelp ware, in fummer ; and afterward, many of them 
go to the reaping of harveft, in the Low Country. It is 
a pity, that a people, fo well difpofed for fupporting 
themfelves, by honeft induftry, had not greater advanta- 
ges for doing fo, with more comfort to themfelves. It

may be reckoned among the difad Vantages, that fome of 
the landlords give but very Ihort leafes, if any, to their* 
tenants. The confequence of which is, frequent remo- 
vals, frequent augmentations of rent, and frequent checks 
to improvements, befides the abjeft ftate of dependence, 
in which the tenant is held. Some of the lairds alfo con- 
tinue the old method of exacting fervices from their te- 
nants ; the bad effefts of which are obvious to the 
flighteft confideration, efpecially when the number of 
thefe fervice-days is not limited. Notwithftanding of all 
thefe difad vantages, there has been no emigration to Ame- 
rica from this parilh. 

Curiqfitiesy &amp;c. — We have but few curiofities, except- 
ing the caves and rocks in the Ifland of Staffa, fo accu- 
rately defcribed in Mr. Pennant's Tour to the Hebrides, 
that it is needlefs to enlarge upon them in this place. At 
Aros, upon the Sound of Mull, are feen the ruins of a 
pretty large caftle, faid to have been built by Macdonald,. 
Lord of the Ifles, who lived fome time there : But, at 
what period, or how long, I cannot afcertain *. 

Language. 



* It was evidently intended for a place of ftrength, built upon a fteep 
rock towards the fea, and looks, as if it had been fecured on the land fide, 
by a moat and draw bridge. In feveral parts of the parilh, are feen hug* 
pillars of unpolifhed fton-e, without figures or letters, from 6 to io feet in 
height above ground. In many places, I of thefe is feen alone ; in others, 
5 or 6 of them together, particularly on the height above Kilmore, and 
upon an open heath, in the farm of Teany, where they are difpofed into a 
kind of circular form. The fingle pillars are thought to be monuments 
of fome perfons of note, either flam, or buried there ; and the erecting of 
them muft have been a work of no fmall labour and ingenuity. The cir- 
cular ftones were, probably, places of worlbip, in the time of Druidifm. To 
this day, the word Clathan, r. e. ftor.es, U ufed in jnoft parts of the High-

the Gaelic, though the Engliih is daily gaining ground, 
.".nd would make more rapid progrefs, were fchools more 
-encouraged *. 

General Obfervations.—Vpon a general review of the 
defcription now given of the prefent ftate and circum- 
ftances of this part of the country, there feems to be 
little ground to hope for a fpeedy inereafe of its popula- 
tion or profperity, but rather the reverie, unlefs the 
evil-be prevented, by fome change of meafures, in thofe 
who are nearly concerned in the dire&amp;ion, and have a 
fpecial intereft in the common welfare of it. Were all 
•the heritors, for inftance, to adopt, and proceed upon 
more liberal and publick fpirited principles, by fore- 
going a fmall prefent profit to their families, for much 
greater advantages in reverfion, they might gradually ef-

lands, as a name for kirk, kirktown, or place of worfhip. At the weftern 
fide of the parifh, one of the Ifles of Treifhnifli, called Cairnburg, was of 
old confidered by the natives, as a place of great ftrength, and fometimes 
occupied by a fmall party, or garrifen. It is a high rock, of fome confi- 
derablc extent on the top, inaccefiible on all fides, excepting by one narrow 
pafs. Little Cairnburg is a fmaller rock near it, and feparate from it by a 
narrow found, to which the fame defcription applies, in every other re- 
fpect. Thefe rocks are faid to have been the boundary of the 2, govern- 
ments, into which the Hebrides were divided, when fubjccT: to the crown 
of Denmark, called the Nodorees and Sodorees, or Northern and Southern 
lfles : And if tradition fays truth, they fometimes contended for the pof- 
feffion of this fame fort of Cairnburgh, or Cairnbulg. 

* Moft names of places are evidently of Gaelic derivation, as " Tober- 
mory," the Virgin Mary's Well ; " Calve," an Ifland without the Eafon, 
and which covers one fide of it, fignifies in Gaelic, Harbour tide ; " Ulva, w 
»n Ifland feparate from Mull by a narrow found, fignifies, Ready Ford, or 
Pafs. So " Torloilk," is Burnt Hill, and " Aros" the Manfion, or Habita-

feet a great and happy change, upon their refpedtive 
eftates. Were every fpecies of feudal fervitude entirely 
abolilhed, and the lands let rather below than above their 
intrinfic value, and upon much longer leafes than is now 
the practice, and the tenants encouraged to raife green 
crops, viz. potatoes, turnips, fown grafs, &amp;c, and the 
heritors to be at fome expenfe in diffuling among their 
people a fpirit ©f virtuous induftry, and wfeful know- 
ledge, particularly by rewarding the moll worthy with 
longer leafes, or otherwife, and by erecting and cherilh- 
ing a greater number of fchools, the face of the country, 
in general, would foon afiume a different appearance j 
becaufe, in proportion as the people became more en- 
lightened and virtuous, and lefs afraid of extreme indi- 
gence, they would become more enterprifing, in ventur- 
ing upon new improvements. Wealth and population 
would increafe, the village would grow to a nourilhing 
ftate, and the benefit of it would extend more and more 
to the whole neighbourhood ; and, in fine, this ifland and 
parim, which are already no contemptible nurfery of 
ufeful hands to the kingdom at large, would become 
much more fo. </p></div>

rX-HESE parifnes are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean

N They confift of 5 farms on the main land, and 5 
iflands, viz. Luing, Sell, Shuna, Forfa, and He of Eaf- 
dale. The names of thefe iflands, like many of the He- 
brides, are fuppofed to be Danifh, and particularly thofc 
that end with the letter a ; likewife all names of places 
that terminate with ijh are of the fame origin, as Craig- 
nifh, Deignifh, Ardtornifh. The length of thefe pa- 
rimes, from N. to S., is about 10, and breadth 6 Eng- 
lifli miles, including the narrow founds that interfeft 
them. The foil and furface vary according to the na-

ture of the rock and ftone with which the furface *. 
Wn s. P is blac ^ ^ partredhazeU C ; a - 

Ihe black is by far the moft fertile, and generally co- 
vers either flate or limine. The red loam is com- 
monly mixed with whinftone, and though in good heart, 
is eafilj exhaufted. There is a third kind of foil which 
forms the greateft part of the arable of thefe iflands : 
this, though not fo folid as the black loam, nor fo po- 
rous as the red, is not much inferior in fertility to ei. 
ther. This foil appears to be a mixture of pulverized 
flate and lime-flone, xvhich, in quality and colour, re- 
fembles dark clay^ that hardens or relaxes in the fame 
manner, with a few days drought or rain. It produces 
good crops of oats and barley ; but not fo well adapted 
for potatoes, unlefs in drill, that the ground may be 
kept loofe and open by frequent ploughing. 

Produce.— Oats, barley, potatoes, and a little flax^ arc 
the only crops raifed in thofe pariflies. But, from ex~ 
periments lately made by Captain Campbell of Lochend ? 
ftcward to the Earl of Breadalbane in this country, i$ 
appears that turnip would prove a beneficial crop ; and 
we have reafon to believe, if the ground were properly 
enclofed, that peafe and beans, if not wheat, might be 
xaifcd to advantage. Clover and rye-grafs thrive re- 
markably well. Red asid white clover are natives of 
thefe iflands, -and turn very rich and luxuriant in con- 
fequence of lime or fhell fand. Green crops are more 
adapted to this climate than white, becaufe of the heavy 
falls of rain in July and Auguft. Oats and barley, if 
the ground be properly manured, are then very luxu- 
riant and prcmifing 5 but as they lodge early, they ne- 
ver prove fo fertile as in other places where rain is lefs 

prevalent;

prevalent during thefe months. The fleward has taken 
particular care to introduce the beft kinds of oats ; the 
early, Blainfly, and Cowpar-grange. But of the molt 
fertile of thofe, which is the Blainfly, it requires 5 fir- 
lots, Linlithgow meafure, to make 8 (lone of meal. The 
return of oats, in general, is from 3 to 4 feeds ;: barley 
5, and potatoes 8, when dibbled, but in drill 16. When 
the foil is properly manured, the return in oats and bar* 
ley is considerably better ; and therefore the tenants- 
upon Lord Breadalbane's property, are lately reftrifted 
to labour only a certairr proportion of their arable ; that 
is, 1 fields, inftead of 3 formerly ploughed ; which they 
muft foon find to be their intereft, as it greatly dimi- 
nimes their labour, and increafes the return. 

Manure The arable is divided into infield and out- 
field, or wintertown, Outfields are manured by teath- 
ing, or confining their cattle in fold during fummer and- 
part of harveft. Infields are manured with byre-dung^ 
and frequently with a compoft of dung, mofs, and 
earth, collected in the warm months. There is abun- 
dance of lime-Hone in the parilh, though not much ufed 
as manure. Tolerable good fiiell fand may be found 
almoft in every creek upon the fliore 5 and, of the bell 
quality, can ealily be obtained from Colonfa, Mull, 
or Arafaig, at the rate of 4s. or 5s. a ton. Fallowing 
is a mode of improvement fcarcely known in this coun- 
try ; nor is it adapted to the climate, for the frequent 
falls of rain would rather impoverifh than enrich the 
foil. 



Climate and Difeafes — The wind blows here, at leaft

ftantly conveys fog and vapour from the Atlantic, which 
make the air generally moift, damp, and penetrating/ 
but feldom proves fatal to the inhabitants, except a few 
children carried off by the croup in cold rainy feafons. 
The rheumatifm is the moft prevalent diforder in this 
country. It is fuppofed to be more frequent lince lin- 
nen fliirts have become the fubftitute of flannel or plaid - 
ing, which was once the general clothing over the 
Highlands of Scotland. It is evident that this opinion 
is not groundlefs, as flannel fliirts, in moft cafes, are the 
fafeft and moft effectual remedy, as well as the beft an~ 
tidote for this prevalent difeafe. Dropfies are like wife 
obferved of late to be more frequent, particularly fince 
potatoes have become the principal food of the lower 
claries of the people. And certainly, though this ufe- 
ful and wholefome root contains* no hurtful quality, yet 
change of diet muft gradually affect and change the con-» 
ftitution. While many, therefore, whofe food was more 
folid in their early period of life, and to whom this root 
was fcarcely known, but now live by this three-fourths 
of the year," no wonder though diforders fliould prevail 
which were formerly lefs common. But the danger, if 
there is any,. I apprehend, proceeds from the dreffing 
and imprudent management, rather than from the qua- 
lity ; as the common productions of nature, evidently 
intended for food, are always the moft wholefome, as 
well as the moft ufeful. Another diforder, commonly 
oalled the locked jaw, is very fatal to infants. It ge- 
nerally attacks before the 8th day after birth : if they 
efcape till the 15th day, they are thought out of danger. 
This difeafe is fcarcely known in other countries on the 
main land. But it is a fact, that one-third at leaft, of 
all the children, particularly among the quarriers, die 

within 



Of Kittbrandofi and Killchattan. 1 6 1 

within the time fpecified. It is fuppofed, that this lofa 
is owing to ignorant midwives. And it muft be con- 
feffed, that this complaint feldom appears where a bred 
midwife attends. Agues are not known here, and fevers 
feldom appear. When they do, they prevail in Lumg 
Ifland, the S. end of the parifh, more than in any" other 
part of it. No fufficient reafon can be affigned for this, 
unlefs that veffels, which are frequently obliged to an- 
chor there, from every part of Britain, Ireland, and the 
Baltic, may be the caufe of conveying the infeftion. 
The ravages of the fmall pox have abated, fince the 
majority of children are now inoculated with fiiccefs ; 
though fome ftill retain violent prejudices againflthis hap- ' 
py difcovery. Cancers likewife fometimes appear : Con- 
fumptions feldom. Thofe are the moft common difeafes, 
but the people in general are robuft and healthy. Many 
inftances of longevity might be produced, as fome are 
living, and feverals have died lately, from 80 to 100 
years old. 

Slate Quarries.— The Eafdale flare quarries are well 
known over the moft of Britain. They are within a 
few minutes failing to every veffel that panes through 
the Sound of Mull, round the weftern coaft of Scotland, 
whether bound for the Baltic, Ireland, Leith, or Lon- 
don. Thefe quarries are not confined to the Ifland of 
Eafdale only ; Luing and Seil abound with flates of the 
fame quality, and fafe anchoring ground contiguous al- 
moft to every quarry, where veffels of any burthen may 
fafely ride. The quarry price of flates is 25s. each 1000. 
The manufacturing of flates at Eafdale commenced near 
a century ago. For many years, the numbers of men 
employed were but few, as there was no great demand ;

nor had the undertakers fufficient ability to carry on the 
work to any great extent. But the Eafdale flate com- 
pany, who now manage the quarries, having obtained a 
long leafe, not only of the flate, but likewife of the 
marble quarry at Ardmady in this parifli, commenced 
the work upon a larger fcale. The marble quarry has 
been difcontinued, though fome think it might be ftill 
wrought to advantage. The flate quarries were more 
than fufficient, however, to employ all the hands that 
were engaged in the marble, the demand for flates be- 
ing greater than can well be fupplied, particularly fince 
the late war with America. The quarriers are of late 
increafed to about 300 men : All thefe, except a few, 
have families. Some of them are called quarriers, o- 
thers day-labourers or feuars. The quarriers are paid 
for the quantity of flates which they manufacture, an- 
nually ; fome of them ies. or 12s., and others 15s. a 
ioco, in proportion to the difficulty or facility of work- 
ing, and the expenfe that attends it. The day-labour- 
ers or feuars have 9d. or iod. a-day through the year ; 
and are employed, at the company's expenfe, in opening 
quarries and removing the rubbifli. From the com- 
pany's books, it appears, that about 5,600,000 of flates 
are quarried annually. Thefe may be manufactured, 
of any dimenfion, from flags of 3 or 4 feet fquare, to 
the fmajldi fize, if the quality of the quarry is good. 
The workmens wages amounted laft year to near 4cocl. 
Sterling. T hey feem to live very comfortably ; many 
of them can eafily fave money ; and though they lliould 
be in debt to the company, they are indulgent enough 
to allow them whatever is neceflary for fupporting their 
families. The company keep always a ftore of the ar- 
ticles moll neceflary for them, particularly meal, iron, 

coal,

e0 al, fed, and powder. Their confumption of meal 
cannot be under 2000 bolls a-year, all imported, as the 
neighbouring farmers can do no more than fupply them- 
selves *. 

Rental— The rent of thefe pariflies, exclufive of the 
quarries, is about 1600I. Sterling. More than two- 
thirds of the pariih are the property of Lord Breadalbane. 
The extent of his property here, is above 7800 Scotch 
acres. The extent of other fmall properties, cannot be 
exaaiy afcertained, as they have, not been furveyed ; 
but, I imagine, they do not exceed 3700 Scotch acres. 
The whole, therefore, is about 11,50c. The proprietors 
are 5 ; 3 of whom r elide f.

* The greateft complaint among them is the dearth and fcarcity of 
fuel. This they muft purchafe from the neighbouring farmers ; but, in 
rainy feafons, peats, which are the common fuel, cannot be faved nor 
procured in fufficient quantity, to keep them comfortable through the 
winter. The duty on coal was a general complaint, nor can the remo- 
val of it effectually relieve the needy in this remote corner, where peat 
and turf are fcarce. In procuring thefe, not only the poor and trades- 
man, but the farmer, is obliged to wafte the fummer feafon, which 
fhould be allotted to their various occupations, and improvement in a- 
griculture. Happily, however, the general ground of complaint is re- 
moved ; and if it fliould be ftill neceffary to continue this duty, why not 
impofe it at the pit? This would be more equitable than Subjecting 
thofe who, by their Situation, are always fubjected to the additional ex- 
penfe of freight and infurance. 

f Wages, and Price of Labour, &amp;c — Servant men from 5I. to 61. a- 
year, with flioes; women from al. to 3I. ; day-labourers is. a-day ; 
Wrights is. a-day, with victuals ; tailors 3d. a-day ; and mafons is. Sd. 
a-day. The price of provifion cannot eafily be ascertained, where there 
is no regular market. Every one, according to his ability, is obliged to 
purchafe from his neighbour who can fpare, and that fometimcs below, 
tyrfc frequently above, the real value.

St at if lie a I Account 



Upon Lord Breadalbane's eftate, there is little reafon of 
complaint, as bonnage, arrage and carriage, are moftly 
abolifhed, except fome afiiftance to his Lordfhip's fadtor. 
or fteward, in time of peats and hay. But the tenants 
of fome fraall proprietors, complain grievoufly of being 
obliged to ferve their landlords, without any abatement 
of rent, when moft neceffary, to manage their own work 
of the fame kind. And there is little profpeft of relief, 
as landlords think it too heavy a burden to engage the 
number of fervants requifite to carry on their work *. 

Kelp.— In. thefe parifties, about 30 ton of kelp ufed to 
be manufactured annually. Lord Breadalbane's tenants 
are allowed to ufe it as manure, or convert it into kelp, 
as they choofe. In this they are directed by the price, 
whether high or low. 

Lakes, &amp;.c. — In thefe iflands, there is plenty of fpring 
water, but no lakes, except a few that turn fome corn- 
mills. Two of thofe, though fmall, abound with fine 
trout. There is no river in this parifli worthy of no- 
tice. Public roads are daily improving. Statute labour 
is commuted. There are only a or 3 vefTels at fea from 

this. 

* There is another cuftom which tenants look upon as a grievance ; 
that is, a yearly tax, or ftent, to ferries, fmithys, and corn-mills. Every 
tenant, in proportion to the extent of his farm, pays annually fo much 
corn, meal, beef, and cheefe, to the ferrymen contiguous to them. They 
pay, in the fame manner, to the fmith for plough irons, and fhoeing of 
horfes, though they mould not find it their intereft to plough a fuirow. 
The moft of farms are likewife thirled to a particular mill, whether con- 
tiguous to them or not. The tenant is obliged to pay multure to the 
miller, that is, every 17th peck of the produce of his farm, even though 
he mould find it convenient to manufacture his grain nt another mill, »r 
fend it to market.

from the kirk-feffion yearly. All their funds for this pur- 
pofe, confift of about 6 5 1. of mortified money ; the inte 
? eft of winch, together with weekly colleftions at church 
amounts to 24I. or 25I. a-year. This fmall fum is evi- 
dently very inadequate to relieve them. They are al- 
lowed to beg, therefore ; and the inhabitants, who are 
charitably difpofed, affifl them as their circumftances caa 
afford. '' 

Schooh.--.ln this parifli there are 3 public fchools ; a 
parochial one, fupported by a ftent of valued land, and 
2 fchools, fupported by the Society at Edinburgh for

But farmers, whofe tenements confift chiefly of arable 
ground, detached and fcatrered, without fufficient enclo- 
fures, found it their intereft to quit them, except a few, 
whofe farms are more extenfive. But, if they had fuf- 
ficient enclofures, and a convenient market, Sir John 
Sinclair's plan of improvement, by railing turnip, and 
rearing ftieep, would undoubtedly foon prove very bene- 
ficial to this country. 

Fijberies, Sea-Fowl, Sec.— Great flioals of herring are 
obferved annually upon this coaft, in the months of Au- 
guft and September; and always going northward. They 
feldom ftay long, becaufe of the rapid currents by which 
the iflands are intended. There is plenty of other 
kinds of fifli, and fea-fowl, that are common upon the 
weftein coaft ; falmon, cod, lyth, and feth ; Ihell-fifh, as 
muffel, cockle, lobfter, fpout-fifh, and oyfters ; feals, and 
otters, are numerous. Small whales, likewife, from zo 
to 24 feet long, are frequently feen. A variety of wild 
duck frequent this country : The moft numerous of 
which are, the widgeon, that appear in great flocks from 
the end of harveft till the month of March. They are na-

lives of Norway and Sweden. They are not equal t. 
the large Scotch duck, in fize or quality *. 

Minerals — By feveral experiments made fome years 
ago, by Mr. Rafp the mineralift, veins of lead and filver 
ore, and likewife of iron, zinc, copper, and copperas, 
were difcovered upon Lord Breadalbane's property in 
this pariih ; but not in fufficient quantity to encourage 
the expenfe of manufacturing. 

Antiquities.— There is no antiquity worthy of notice 
in this pariih, except the ruins of 2 or 3 buildings, fup- 
pofed to have been erected by the Danes. They were 
not only ufed as places of defence and fafety in time of 
war ; but it appears, from their fituation, in view of one 
another, that they ferved as watch towers, to conve/ 
fignals, and alarm the coaft, at the approach of an enemy. 
Thofe forts are all erected upon riling ground, that com- 
mands an extenfive view to the right and left along the 
coaft, and might eafily convey fignals by fire. The ruins 
of fome of them ftill mow their ftrength to have been 
confiderable ; particularly one erected upon the top of a 

hill, 

• The moft remarkable fea-fowl to be feen here, is the puffin. It is a fpe- 
ciesofduck, of a gray colour. It ieldom attempts to fly, nor are the 
wings, which are very fmall and bare, capable to carry its weight to any 
cJonfiderable diftance. It is alrrioft entirely a lump of fat, and taftes of 
fifli. The wild goofe and fwan appear frequently during the winter, but 
go farther N. in time of hatching. All the wild and tame fowls, com- 
monly feen in other parts of Scotland, are frequently feen upon this coaft; 
and fome, that are more rare, particularly the jackdaw, with red bill 
and feet, hatches in this country. We have no foxes, though they were 
Tery numerous in thofe iflands about 4c years ago. Badgers are alfo ba- 
nifhed. But we have 3 different fpecies of wild-cat ftill remaining, that 
are very deftructive to lambs and poultry. Thcfe are the common wild- 
cat, the pole-cat, and martin.

hill in the farm of Ardinamir, in the Ifland of Luiug, 
part of the wall, from 8 to 10 feet thick, is ftill entire: 
And though many of the ftones have been removed to 
other buildings, the quantity yet remaining, is very 
great, and mows that the ftrength of the fort was much 
depended on. 

CharaBer of the People.-Xhe inhabitants, in general, 
are not inferior to thofe of any country in hofpitality and 
charity. Many exert themfelves, in private, to relieve their 
neighbours, when they are in need of aid ; and in pub- 
lic, wherever their help could be expefted, their contri- 
bution has been cheerful and* liberal. However, though 
hofpitable, they are jealous of Grangers reliding among 
them. A ftranger refiding in the country, many of them 
look upon as an intrufion and encroachment on their 
right This prejudice is a legacy left by the feudal fyf- 
tem, which length of time only can abolifh. All the 
inhabitants are Proteftants. There are no fedaries, ex- 
cept a few, who call themfelves Covenanters, whofe cha- 
rity is not very extenfive. Charity with them is con- 
fined to the houfehold of faith ; the members of which 
they are at no lofs to diftinguim, and evidently find them 
to be few. </p></div>

Name, Situation, and Extent. 

rpHE feveral parifhes into which the ifland of Mulf 
was divided in times of Popery, were all united 
sft the Reformation, and called the parilh of Mull. It 
was then a part of the prefbytery of Lorn. About the 
time of the Revolution, all that part of Mull N. of the 
Tarbart or Ifthmus at Arofs was eredled into a parifli, 
called the parilh of Kilninian. The reft of the ifland of 
Mull continued to be one parilh for upwards of 40 years 
after this period, and was called the parilh of Rofs. But 
being too extenfive a charge, a new parilh was ere&amp;ed, 
called the parilh of Torafay. What remained was in 
writings called the parilh of Kilfinichen and Kilviceuen, 
from two places of worlhip, the one in Airdmeanach,, 
called Kilfinichen, and the other in Rofs, called Kilvi- 
ceuen ;

scuen; but in the country, it is only known by the 
name of the parifli of Rofs, from a large diftria of it 
fo called. This very extenfive parifli is fituated in the 
S. W. part of the ifland of Mull. It is bounded on the 
E. and N. E. by a ridge of mountains, which feparates 
it from the parifli of Torafay j on the S., an arm of the 
Atlantic, which runs up to Lochaber, feparates it from 
the iflands of Colonfay, Jura, and Ida, and the main 
land of Argyllfliire j on the W., it is warned by the 
Atlantic ; on the N., an arm of the fame ocean, called 
Lochrankeall, feparates it from the parifli of Kilninian. 
In Lochrankeall, lie the iflands of Innis, Kenneth and 
Eorfa, belonging to the parifli, and the iflands of Ulva 
and Staffa, belonging to the parifli of Kilninian. From 
the parifli of Torafay to the Sound of Icolmkill, which 
is its greateft length, it will meafure about 22 miles in 
a ftraight line, exclufive of the Ifland of I. or Icolm r 
kill. Its greateft breadth, when it meets the parifli of 
Torafay, is about 12 meafured miles. 

Divijion of the Parijh. — The parifli is divided into 
4 diftricts, the ifland of I, or Icolmkill, Rofs, Brolafs,, 
and Airdmeanach. The 3 diftrids firft mentioned, lie to 
the S. of Lochfcridain, an arm of the fea that runs 12 
miles from W. to E. into the parifli ; and the fourth dif- 
tria, Airdmeanach, lies N. of Lochfcridain, and parallel 
to Rofs and Brolafs. The ifland of I lies in the Atlan- 
tic, and is feparated from the W. point of Rofs by a nar- 
rower channel, called the found of I. It is about 3 
meafured miles in length, and from half a mile to a mile 
in breadth. The diftricts of Rofs and Brolafs are near- 
ly of equal extent, and feparated from one another by a 
ridge of hills, of no great height. They ftretcb. in a

line from the found of J, to the parifli of Torafay, of 
about 22 meafured miles, which, as already mentioned, 
is the greateft length of the parifli. Their breadth is from 
3 to 6 meafured miles. Airdmeanach joins Brolafs at the 
head of Lochfcridain, and is about 12 meafured miles in 
length, and from 3 to 6 meafured miles in breadth. 

Soil and Surface — The parifli, in general, prefents a 
very barren afpeft. Part of it is fiat, but the greateft 
part is hilly, and better calculated for grazing than for 
railing of crops. The ifland of I is flat, confifting of 
heath, green pafture, rocks, and arable ground. The 
arable ground is very fertile. Rofs is flat, except where 
it marches with Brolafs. The greateft part of the fur- 
face is mofs and heath ; clayey and fandy foil make up 
the arable land, except where it marches with Brolafs, 
where the foil is thin and light. The grafs is in gene- 
ral foft and good, and even the heath of this diftricT: is 
reckoned good feeding for cattle. The arable land is 
fertile. Brolafs has a northern expofure, riling in a 
gentle afcent from Lochfcridain. The foil is light, dry, 
and reckoned barren. The greateft part of the furface 
confifts of heath and rocks. The part of this diftrift 
that faces the S., called Carfaig and Tinmore, produces 
good foft grafs for pafture. Airdmeanach faces the S., 
riling to a conliderable height from Lochfcridain. The 
foil and furface are fimilar to Brolafs. A part of this 
diftricl, called Gribun, faces the N., in which the arable 
land is fertile, and the grafs foft and good. Adjacent 
to Gribun is the fertile little ifland of Innis Kenneth. 
Li a parifli fo very extenfive, there are many thoufand 
acres ; but though it has been furveyed to a trifle, the 
incumbent could not get a copy of the furvey. 

Air. 



' Qf JQlfinichcn and Kilviceuen. 173 

fl,/*,/.,, &amp;c.-The air of the parifh is very 
tem pe ate, but rather moift, arifing from W « 
her farrounded by the Atlantic, or the h.gh htlls JvhtfH 
tneriunou j ' f Torafav. The inhabitants 

feparate it from the panlh of loraiay. . 
are healthy, and attain to great age. Even m Ro , 
^ieh is low and marihy, the inhabitant are ^ 
and long-lived. For though a great deal o ra n fid* 
Y et the gales from the mountains purify the air and 
LtribJe to the health of the inhabitants. Few di ^ 
are known except fevers, which are m general b ou h t 
from the low country, by labourers returnmg fi cm the 
harveft and other works they are employed m during 
the fummer and harveft. The ifland of I is an excep- 
tion The inhabitants are not long-lived. Few pais 
7 o years. The afthma is very frequent among them. 
This may arife not only from the damp vapours of the 
Atlantic, but alfo from the great quantities of fea-ware 
caft afliore, and allowed to rot, which dccaftons a very 
offenfive fmell, particularly in fummer. The havock 
made formerly by the fmall pox is now by inoculation 
moftly done away. The inhabitants of I, Rofs, and Brolafs, 
inoculate their children ; but the people of Airdmeanach 
have not as yet got over their prejudices, which occa- 
fions the lofs not only of many young children, but fome- 
times of grown perfons f 

Lakes and Rivers,— Three inconfiderable lakes in Rofs 
are the only ones in the whole parifh; the largeft of thera 
is not above a mile and a half in length, and about half a 
mile in breadth. In thefe there is no kind of nih ex- 
cept trouts. There are 6 rivers in Brolafs and Aird- 
meanach j but having no lakes for their fource, and the 
yun Ihort, they are not confiderable, except in time of

Sea Coaji.—ln a parifli of fuch extent, almoft f ur 
rounded by the fea, and indented by its arms, and to 
which belong many fmall Mands, befides the ifland of I 
it is not exaggeration when the coaft is computed to be 
at leaft a hundred miles. The mores ma 7 be called bold 
*nd rocky throughout almoft their whole extent. Upon 
the fouth fide of the parifc there is only one creek in 
Rofs, called Portuifgen, where a veffel of about 50 tons 
may anchor, but not in fafety if the weather be ftormy. 

Upon 



Of Jtilfinichen and Kilvicheuen. 1 f§ 



tJpon the Rofs fide of the found of I, there are two 
ereeks, the one called the Barachan, and the other Poll- 
tairve or the Bull pond, where veffels of confiderable 
burden may anchor irr great fafety, with proper pilots. 
There is a fand bank in the found of I,- near mid channel, 
fo that veffels pairing through it, mult keep within one 
third channel of the ifland of I. Loch-lahich lies E. of 
the Sound of I, at the diftance of about 3 miles. An 
ifland, or rock, at the entrance, muft be kept by a vef- 
fel entering the loch upon the flarboard quarter ; but 
with a leading wind a veffel may fafely enter between 
this fmall ifland and the Rofs land on the W., as this 
channel, though narrow, is deep, and free of rocks. After 
entering the loch, a fmall ifland at the bottom of it muft 
be kept upon the larboard. Between this ifland and the 
main land, velfels, in general, anchor, though there is no- 
danger in anchoring in any part of the loch. This loch 
runs about 2 miles from N. to S. into Rofs, and is one J 
of the fafeft anchorages about the ifland of Mull. A 
fmall arm of it running W., and called Lochcoal, is toa 
ftiallow for any veffel to anchor in. The whole of Loch- 
fcridain may be called a road, but the belt anchoring 
ground is at Kilfinichen, and another place at the heads; 
of the loch, called the Narrows, where veffels may ride 
in fafety from all florins. The head land of Burg itt 
Airdmeanach, and the whole of the north coafl of the 
fame diftrict, is very dangerous. The coaft is bold, full 
«f rocks, and no harbour. 

Fijh and Fijheries.— Great fhoals of various kinds of 
fifh furround all the coafts of the pariih ; fuch as her- 
rings, cod, ling, mackarel, laith, codling, feth, girnot, 
rock.filh, or fea-parch, &amp;c. Of flat fifh, there are floun- 
ders, 



Statiftkal Aaoutlt 



ders, plaice, foles, turbot, fcates, &amp;c. The fliell fifh are, 
oyfters, clams, cockles, mufiels, wilks, crabs, partons, 
lobfters, and various others. Seals frequent the coafts. 
i'urpo^fes often, and fometimes whales, come after the 
herrings. To render beneficial to the natives this boun- 
ty which providence freely offered them at their very 
doors, the Duke of Argyll, fomeyears ago, divided a farm 
inRofs, convenient for the white fifhing, into a number of 
crofts. Here his Grace fettled fome families of country 
people ; and to inftrucl them in curing the fifh properly, 
he brought, at a considerable expenfe, fome families of 
fifhers from Shetland, and other parts of the north, 
which he fettled among them. He gave them all the 
molt liberal terms : He distributed the crofts among 
them at a low rent ; provided them with boats and lines 
gratis, built a Itorehoufe for the fifh, and grinded meal 
for their ufe. In fhort, he provided them with every 
neceffary, that their attention might be folely taken up 
with the fifhing. But Hill the fifhing by no means an- 
fwered the expe&amp;ations that might be reasonably enter- 
tained of its fuccefs. The fifhers complained, with juf- 
tice, of the rigour of the fait laws, and the great diflance 
between them and Oban, the neareft cufiomhoufe, where 
often, by bad weather, they were long detained from 
their families. But what rendered their fituation flill 
worfe, was the low price of fifh, and the little demand. 
His Grace, to obviate as much as poffible thefe inconve- 
niences, got an overfeer from Shetland, gave the fifherS 
a certain fixed price for their fifh ; but, if it drew more 
at market, they were to have the overplus \ and, if lefs, 
he alone was to be the lofer. He alfo ftored fait for 
their ufe, for which the' overfeer alone was to be anfwer- 
able to the cufiomhoufe. But after every exertion, his 
„ v Grace's

Grace's benevolent and patriotic intentions are, in a man- 
ner fruftrated, and the profped of employing,, in this 
branch' of induftry, the many idle hands in the country 
with benefit to themfelves, and to the community, is 
nearly vanifhed. The fifliing anfwered not the idea en- 
tertained of the fuccefs that would attend it ; and after a 
deal of money funk by his Grace, it is now followed on- 
ly as a by-job *. 

Various caufes might be affigned for the failure of the 
fifliing in Rofs ; and the few that follow, the incumbent 
offers, with the greateft diffidence of his own ability to 
judge in fuch a cafe. The idea entertained by the fifh- 
ermen of the great flioals of fifli upon the coaft, and the 
great profit they were to have, were too fanguine ; and 
and when they were, in fome degree, difappointed, they 
were too foon difcouraged. The want of markets alfo, 
for other kinds of fifli that were caught in great plenty, 
was a misfortune that could not be helped, as there wa : s 
no town in the neighbourhood to take their fifli off their 
hands. Even the crofts, which the fifliermen had from 
the bounty of the Duke of Argyll, and which they could 
not want in fuch a country, hurt the fifliing. The firft 
years they took fome time to accommodate themfelves in 
houfes, &amp;c. ; and the feafon for labouring the crofts was

* This failure is the more to be regretted, as it may difcourage the 
Duke of Argyll from giving any further encouragement to a fcheme 
that anfwered fo ill upon trial. It Is particularly unlucky upon account 
of the country, as the fifliing would bring money into it ; and no 
people are better calculated for the fifliing than the natives. Accuftomed 
to boats from their infancy, by the almoft infular fituation of the pa- 
rifli, they pafs through the boifterous feas furrounding its coafts, with as 
much intrepidity, (kill, and fuccefs, as the natives of Shetland. They 
were even at the firft outfet as fuccefsful in fifliing, and, in a little 
time, cured equally well as thefe expert fiftiermen.

the beft for the cod fifhing in particular. Upon the prtf* 
duce of them, the natives could live, in fome meafure, 
independent of the fifhing, a d the north country filhers 
Were fupported by the Duke of Argyll, whatever be- 
came of the fiftiing. The eafons alio were fo very fe- 
vere and ftormy, that it was always too late before the 
cod filming could be begun. The firft year they began, 
it is true, the ill of April, and the next, it may be faid, 
it was the ift of May before a line was fet. But what- 
ever may be in thefe obfervations, the caufe affigned by 
the fifhermen, which was fcarcity of fill, may be the true 
one, though this might be remedied in good feafons, by- 
going to the coaft of Tay, which is only at the diftancc 
of 8 or 9 leagues, and where the people of Bara get plen- 
ty of fifh. 

It would be unpardonable to omit mentioning the en- 
couragement given to the white fifhing by Lieutenant 
Colonel John Campbell of the marines. 1 his gentle- 
man rents a farm from the Duke of Argyll, adjacent to 
the fifhing village. Being well acquainted with moll 
parts of Britain and Ireland, befides vifiting many foreign 
countries in the c-uirfe of his fervice in the navy, he law 
with regret, how much his countrymen neglected making 
the beft ufe of the advantages they enjoyed. He there- 
fore refolved to co-operate, as far as he could, with the 
' humane intentions of the Duke of Argyll. He fitted out 
a boat, manned it with natives, and, except a little fifh 
for his own table, received no other benefit. But though 
they were as fuccefsful as the other boats, they dropped 
the fifhing. Perhaps the abfence of the Colonel, who is 
called upon again to ferve his country, difcouraged them. 
This was a lofs to the filing in general : For the filhers 
looked upon him as their particular friend ; applied to 

him

him for their wants in the abfence of the Duke of Ar- 
gyll's chamberlain; and, in all their difputes, looked up 
to him as to an impartial judge. 

For the fatibfaftion of the curious, an abftrad is here 
given of the number and kinds of fifli caught for 2 years, 
the time the nQiing began yearly, and the time it was 
given up This abllrad was furnifhed by the overfeer 
appointed by the Duke of Argyll. In the year 1789, 
5 boats were employed, and 4 in the year 1790. Ihey 
fiuied in water from 25 to 80 fathoms deep.

Statljlical Account 



It has been already obferved, that 2 lochs, or arms of 
the fea, indent the parilh ; the one called Lochfcridair, 
and the other Lochlahich. Lochfcridair abounds in her- 
ring of the moft excellent quality. In the year 1792, hun- 
dreds of vefiels might be loaded, but want of intelligence 
prevented the bulfes from coming in till late in the fea- 
fon. The country people killed great quantities. At 
firft, the hundred was fold from 6d. to 8d : it fell gradu- 
dually to 2d. : at laft fome rotted from want of fait, and 
it was entirely given up for the feafon. In the year 
1793, many bufles were loaded in this loch. The her- 
ring of Lochlahich is not of fo good a quality, nor was 
any great quantity got there in any one year fince the 
incumbent was fettled in the parilh. From the fituation 
of thefe two lochs, Lochfcridair and Lochlahich., and the 
different quality of the herring caught in them, one 
would be apt to doubt the generally received hypothefis 
of the annual migration of the herring into the north 
feas, and the flioals returning again at a certain feafon. 
If the herring, fuppofe only from thefe two lochs, mi- 
grated to the north feas, as the herring of Lochfcridair 
mull pafs by Lochlahich, they would, in all probability 3 
mix before their return, and fome of the fat herring of 
the one loch would mix with the poor herring of the 
other. But this is never the cafe. But if the herring 
migrated, why not the herring of every loch equally 
good at firft, and make their appearance earlier in the 
northern than in the fouthern lochs ? Some fiftiers in 
the pacifli pretend to fay, that the herring never leave 
the lochs, but, after fpawning, go to the bottom, where 
they remain, till they gather ftrength enough to encoun- 
ter the ft reams *. 

Sea 

• Lefore the fubject of the fifhing is dropped, it may be proper to ob- 
crve thehardihip the country people fuffer from the fait laws, both as to 
* the

Sea Ware for Manure and Keip.— Upon every part of 
the coaft, there are various kinds of fea-weeds, 1 or fea- 
W are or wrack, as it is called, both for manure and 
kelp ' fuch as button wrack, lady wrack, black ware, 
tangle, &amp;c. Every kind of fea-ware is ufed for manure, 
and is found to anfwer the foil beft, probably from the 
great quantity of fait, fea-ware contains, and the cold na- 
ture of the foil. Sea-ware is the only manure that an- 
fwers moffy ground. Indeed, for this it is excellent : It 
produces crops from the deepeft mofs. Button wrack, 
aud lady wrack, are beft for kelp, and the only kinds 

ufed, 

the herring and white fifhing. Every kind of fifhing muft be partially 
carried on by them; that is, they can only fifli when not throng at their 
farming. But even this partial fifhing, they are reftrained from by the 
fait laws ; for it cannot be fuppofed, that a man will go 40 or 50 miles t» 
a cuftomhoufe for a few bafkets of fait, and return again to the fame cuC 
tomhoufe with the little fifh he has cured, or perhaps with his little 
fait, without any fifh at all. Country people alfo, never will go to a dif- 
tant cuftomhoufe for fait, till the herring appear in the lochs, for fear, as 
often happens, the fifhing may fail ; and that having no proper place to 
keep the fait, it may, in different ways be embezzled, and they incur aU 
the penalties of the fait laws. When the herring appear, the weather may 
be bad, the diftance to a cuftomhoufe great, the fait damaged in their open 
boats, and the herring, in a great meafure, difappear, or, at leaft, much 
valuable time loft before they return home to the fifhing. There is a cuf- 
tomhoufe in Tobermory in Mull ; but the Oban cuftomhoufe is as near the 
the parifh of Rofs. The cafe is nothing better as to fmuggled fait. The 
fmuggkrs will at all times endeavour, by high prices, to indemnify them- 
felves for the rifk they run ; and, in times of fcarcity, their prices are very 
high. The incumbent was told, that, in 1792, it was fold in fome parts 
of the country at a guinea the barrel: But, however low fmuggled 
fait may be in price, no fifh cured with it can be fold in open mar- 
ket. If fait were duty free, all thefe grievances would be done away, and 
farmers and cottagers would cure fifli, not only for their own private ufe, 
but alfo for fale. The incumbent does not pretend to fay, what would be 
beft for the herring buffes. In all, he fays, he had only in view the coun- 
I try people. 



lS 2 Statijlical Account 

tftd unlefs the prLc be very high. Except thefe tw» 
lauds, every other is very expenfive in manufacturing and 
produces but little kelp. The quantity of kelp made in 
the parifli, varies according to the price it draws. When 
*he price was high, and every kind of fea-ware ufed, 
there were from 13c to .. 50 tons made annually ; but the 
price felling greatly in 1791, there, were not probably 70 
tons made the following year in the who e pari h. Then 
the price was fo low, and the wages of manufacturers f» 
Kgh, that, in many parts, even the button wrack was 
ufed for manure. The price of no commodity in the 
country varies fo^much as that of kelp. It fometimes 
rifes to 81. the ton, and fometimes falls as low as 50 s. 
Various reafons are afligned for the late fall in the price 
of kelp ; fuch as kelp imported from foreign countries, 
and other fubftitutes ufed now where kelp was ufed for- 
merly. The buyers alfo complained, that, in manufac- 
turing the kelp, Hones and fand were mixed with it, 
which, befides the lofs of weight to the buyers, hurt alfo 
the quality of it. Though this abufe was by no means 
carried to the height complained of by the buyers, and 
only by a few individuals, yet it undoubtedly affeded 
the price of kelp. The buyer , however, ought to ob- 
ferve, that fand #icks to the fea-ware, and that fome 
slopes will mix with it in the manufacturing kilns, in 
fpite of all the care and attention of the manufacturers. 
The Duke of Argyll, upon being informed of this com- 
plaint, gave or ers to his chamberlain to intima e to his 
Grace's tenants, and all the kelp manufacturers upon hi* 
eftate, th t whoever was found guilty of adulterating 
the kelp, would find no (helter upon his eftate, and that 
they would be profecuted and punilhed as far as the law- 
would admit. This will have a good effect upon his.

Grace's eftate, and is worthy of imitation by the High- 
land proprietors of kelp fhores. Kelp is of great coufc- 
quence to the Highlands in particular, and of fome to the 
kingdom in general. 1 The manufacturing of it employs 
many of the natives ; the price it draws brings money to 
the country, which is again circulated through the 
kingdom at large, and keeps that money in the kingdom, 
which is fent to foreign countries to purchafe kelp, and 
fuch materials as may be fubftitutes for Highland kelp. 
If patriotifm does not roufe the proprietors, their own in- 
tereft ought. The commodities of the country are but 
few j aad of thefe the beft ufe ought to be made. 

Mountains and Volcanic Appearances. — The only 
mountains are thofe that divide the parifh from that of 
Torafay The moft remarkable of thefe is Beinmore, 
This is the highefl mountain in Mull, and rifes to a 
great height. Such as have been at the top, fay, the 
view is very extenfive, and that in a clear day Ireland 
may be feen from it. The headland of Burg rifes to a 
confiderable height from the fea, and is pretty much of 
a conical form. All the mountains and hills in the 
country are covered with heath. In many parts of the 
parifh, there are Bafaltic pillars, like thofe of StafFa, 
but not fo large, fo regular, nor fo elegant. M any- 
broken pillars appear in the headland of Burg, in a 
farm of Rofs, called Ardtan, and in many parts of Bro- 
lafs, and more particularly in Inimore facing the 5-, 
Channel. In this laft place, the rocks rife almofl per- 
pendicular from the fea to a great height. In the face 
of thefe rocks the pillars appear. In fome parts there 
are 4 ranges ; in othera 5 ranges of fmall pillars appear, 
ivith ftrata of rock between each range. The pillars 

are 



184 Statiftical Account 

are fmall, nor are the ranges very regular. Seams of 
coals appear in fome places. Taking the whole to- 
gether, the appearance is very pifturefque, particularly 
in times of ftorms and of rain, when the fea rages be- 
low, and numberlefs cafcades fall precipitately down the 
precipices and broken rocks above. Some travellers 
greatly admire the appearance of this fcene, and allege, 
that the pillars here, and at the other places mentioned, 
are the effects of volcanoes, or fome violent concuffion of 
the earth. 

Rocks and Stones. — There are rocks and ftones of va- 
rious kinds in the parifti, fuch as marble, granite, free- 
Hone, lime-ftone, moor-ftone or whin-Hone, flags and 
pebbles. A marble quarry was opened fome years ago, 
under the patronage of the Duke of Argyll, in the 
illand of I, which is his Grace's property. A confi- 
derable quantity of marble was quarried, and fent to 
Leith and London ; but, after much money was laid out, 
the quarry was given up, for fome time at leaf!:. The 
marble is faid to be of excellent quality. The whole 
coaft of Rofs, upon the found of I, is granite for feveral 
miles. No ufe is made of it, except in building farm- 
houfes and walls. There is lime-ftone in Carfaig and 
Gribun ; but both thefe coafts are fo dangerous for Clip- 
ping, that no ufe is made of it. Free-ftone is alfo found 
in Carfaig of excellent quality. Some of it is ufed by 
feveral gentlemen in the county for their houfes. A 
great proportion of the rocks of Rofs confifts of flags, that 
might ferve to excellent purpofe for arching of bridges. 
The only ufe they are put to in the country is lintels 
for doors and windows, and building farm-houfes and 

walls B 



Of Kilfinkhen and Kilviceuen. 185 



Walls. Pebbles are found in the ifland of I, of which 
feals and fleeve-buttons are made. 

Mines.— Coals appear in different parts of the parifh. 
There is a feam about 3 feet thick in a hill called Bein- 
an-Ini. Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope, early in 
this century, purchafed the hill for the fake of the coals. 
He began to work them, but his affairs getting into 
diforder, he was obliged to Hop the work. Sir James 
Riddel of Ardnamtirchan, who is now proprietor, made 
a trial fome years ago j but, after fome coals were dug, 
he alfo gave up the work. Different fkilful perfons 
have been viewing it fince j but what opinion they had 
of it, is not publickly known. The quality of the 
coals is faid to be good. A feam of about 18 inches 
thick, appears upon the fea coaft of Rofs, the property 
of the Duke of Argyll. No trial has been made here ; 
and the reafon probably is* that the feam would not an- 
fwer. His Grace fent a fkilful perfon to view it. The 
incumbent dug fome of the coals, and they burnt very 
well. Coals alfo appear in Brolafs and Gribun, the 
property of Captain M'Lean of Kinloehalvin. 

Lightning.- — In high countries, the hills and moun- 
tains attracting the lightning; it feldom does any hurt 
in th$ low ground ; and the damage it has done in this 
parifh deferves to be mentioned only as an exception 
from this general rule. Many years before the incum- 
bent was fettled in the parifh, a gentleman in Rofs lofl 
2 horfes by lightning. Many of the people of his farm 
received a fhockj but were not hurt. Not many years 
ago, .a filly was killed by lightning in another farm in 
Hofs, upon the found of I. Some of the people of the 

Vol. XIV. A a 



1 $6 Statijlkal Account 

farm received a mock, and fuch as were ftanding at 
work were thrown flat on the ground In the begin- 
ning of harveft i 7 86, fome of the herring fimers in 
Lochfcndain received a mock by lightning, but felt no 
inconvenience from it afterward It is faid, that at 
the fame time fome fheep were killed by it in Burg, the 
headland of Airdmeanach. 

CW.— Among the many caves in Airdmeanach % 
only deferve to be mentioned. One is called the Lad- 
der's Cave. There is a paffage to this cave of about 89 
feet, open above, and where 2 men may walk abreaft. 
A breaft-work is built at the entrance of the cave as a 
defence. To this breaft-work a ladder was ftanding for 
people to get over it to the cave ; from which circum- 
ftance it took its name. Within the cave, there is room 
for about 80 armed men. Here is a large flag, which is 
faid to be ufed as a table, and fome other conveniencies. 
In this cave, tradition fays, people took fhelter in times 
of trouble. The other cave is in Gribun in Aird- 
meaneach, and is ftill much more capacious than the 
Ladder's Cave. It took its name, as tradition goes, from 
a gentleman of the name of M'Kinnon going in to fearch 
for the bottom, which was then thought impollible to find, 
as the cave was fuppofed to go quite acrofs the country. 
M'Kinnon went in, and was never heard of again. But 
the cave's being bottomlefs, or going acrofs the coun- 
try, is without foundation, as the incumbent faw a man 
who alleged, that he was sft the further end, and fearch- 
ed with his ftick, but could find no paffage further than 
he was. So that if there is any truth in M'Kinnon's 
ftory, he muft have been killed by people who took 
ihelter in the cave j and as the people of the country 

were 



Of Kilfinkhen and Kilviceuen. 187 



were afraid of going in fearch of him, the ftory fpread 
that he bewildered himfelf in the cave, and was loft. 
People might alfo find it their intereft to propagate this 
ftory, and give a horrid idea of the cave, as it was ufed 
for a place of fhelter in troublefome times. There is a 
cave in Inimore, called the Nun's Cave. It is Angular 
in nothing but its being the habitation of nuns Tra- 
dition is filent as to the time they lived here ; whether 
before the duTolution of the nunnery at i, or whether 
they Iheltered themfelves in this fequeftered place upoa 
that revolution's taking place. Several croffes are cut 
in the fides of the cave, but the initials of names are 
modern. 

Quadrupeds and Birds. — The only wild quadrupeds 
in the parifli are deer, foxes, and rabbits. The rabbits 
may be called ftrangers, having appeared firft within 
thefe few years. The deer have always been natives. 
In harveft, they often leave the mountains^ and eat the 
corns in the low grounds of Rofs and Brolafs } and, in 
fevere winters, they have been known to mix with the 
black cattle, aid take their fliare of the corn with 
which they were fed. The mountains being now flock- 
ed with fheep, may, in the courfe of a few years, banifh 
them from the ifland of Mull. There is all the va- 
riety of land-birds found in the parifh, that are gene- 
rally met with in other parts of the Highlands ; fuch as 
eagles, hawks, kites, wild geefe, pigeons, moor fowls, 
black cocks, tarmagans, &amp;c. &amp;c. The fea fowls are as 
numerous as the kinds are various ; fuch as cormorants, 
(carts, teels, fcale drakes, ducks of various kinds, &amp;c. 
The migratory are fwans, fwallows, cuckoos, lapwing,

Population.— The return to Dr. Webiler in 1755 was 
1685 fouls *. There was a partial lift taken of the in- 
habitants by the incumbent in March 1782. This lift 
was only exacl: as to the ifland of I, in which there were 
then 277 fouls. The increafe of population in that 
(mall aland, from the period mentioned to February 

1 791, 

* There are no certain data by which a companion can be drawn 
between the ancient and prefent ftate of the population of the parifli. 
Tradition is uncertain, and there was no regifter of any kind kept un- 
til the prefent incumbent was fettled in the year 1780. Some would 
conclude, that the population in ancient times was greater, becaufe 
feme (pots in tillage are now covered with heath ; and fome would draw 
a contrary conclufion, from lands being brought to tillage now that never 
were fo before. But both conclufions are fallacious. Thefe circum- 
ftances depended entirely upon the poffeflbrs of the farms. When a 
gentleman poflefTes large tracts, he allows lands formerly in tillage to lie 
lee for pafture, which is foon covered with heath ; and fmall tenants, if 
they are ftraitened for arable ground, bring into tillage ground that ne- 
ver was fo before. To confirm the great population of ancient times, 
it is faid, that 7 fcore men, from the diftridls of Rofs and I alone, were 
at the battle of Inverkeithing ; but thefe 2 diftri&amp;s would furnifh fuch 
a number to-day without , materially hurting agriculture. The only 
reafon for thinking that the parifli was more populous in former times is, 
the fmall fpots of farms into which the country was divided. But what- 
ever might be the population of thefe times, it is certain, that there is 
a great increafe of inhabitants fince the commencement of this century. 
The deftruclive rage with which the civil wars were carried on in the. 
time of Charles the Firft, and a famine and peftilencc, in the time of 
King William, almoft depopulated the whole parifli. In the reign of 
the latter Prince, people were dying for want upon the high road, and 
buried where they breathed their laft, as the few furviving relations had 
neither ftrength nor means to carry them to the common burying places. 
Upon the whole coaft of Brolafs, it is faid, 2 families only furvived, and 
very many parts of the other diflricls were wafte. King William's days 
are ftill remembered with horror.

1 791, a fpace of near 9 year-, was 46" fouls. The pr 
pulation of the reft of the parim, particularly Rofs, in- 
creafed in the fame proportion *. The incumbent got 
the inhabitants numbered in February 1791 ; the re. 
turn was 3002. This return muft have been exaft, as 
the name of every perfon was written down. In fuch 
an extenfwe parifh, where the incumbent could not exa- 
mine every perfon upon the fpot, the different ages 
could not be ascertained ; only in the iuand of I, where 
the fchoolmafter marked the particular ages of the uh 
habitants, 323 in number, and are as follows: Under 
10 years of age, 79 ; between 10 and 20, 73 .; between 
23 and 50, 138; between 50 and 60, 23 ; between 6m

* The reafon of the increafe of population in this parifli is common 
to it with the reft of the Hebrides. Few leave the country, if thej 
ran procure a houfe, which is eafily built, with a fpot of ground for crop, 
and a cow's grafs. All marry young, and being healthy, their progeny 
is numerous. The parents alfo, that their children might fettle in the 
country, and near them, often {hare their lands with them, whether 
male or female. There is another reafon why population mould increafe 
upon the Duke of Argyll's property. From his eftate, fmall tenants are 
never removed, while they behave properly. It is no fecret in the coun- 
try, that his Grace continued their farms to fmall tenants, at the former 
rent, though large augmentations were offered by gentlemen who were 
better able, and would pay their rents more punctually. From the fame 
principle of humanity, it has alfo happened often, that his Grace, though 
with lofs of rent, ordered farms to be divided into fmall portions, to ac- 
commodate numbers that would otherwife be deftitute, and obliged, 
with weak and helplefs families, to leave the country.

and extent of the parifh, a few baptifms might be forgotten. This is the 
Tkfy to be wondered at, as parents often, in the more remote fkirts, meet

tifed, and where, in a rainy day, he could not mark the names in his 
memorandum book for the parilh regifter. There are 1 3 burial places in

without farms, their pra&amp;ice would not maintain thera 
one-third of the year. There are 6 houfes for retailing 
gf fpirits. There are no lawyers. 

Emigration A few families have emigrated to Ame- 
rica within thefe few years, and feveral families went, i» 
1792, to the Low country to cotton works, &amp;c. All 01 
thefe left the country for want of employment. Mofi 
of the families that went to the Low country in 17924 
xeturned back in 1793, for the fame reafon they left the 
country, want of employment. No people are more 
attached to their native country j and it is only neceffity 
that obliges them to leave it. 

Animal and Vegetable Productions. — The animals in the 
parifh are black cattle, horfes, Iheep, and goats. Thisparifh, 
as well as the reft of Mull, is dillinguifhed for a hardy 
breed of black cattle, that are eafily fattened. Their flefla 
is fine grained, juicy, and well tailed. The flieep, till 
lately, were of the fmall Highland kind, with very fine 
wool, and fweet delicate flefh j but now the hills are all 
itocked with Low country Iheep, whofe wool is coarfe 
in comparifon of the Highland Iheep, and their flefli not 
fo well tailed. The horfes are hardy, full of mettle, and 
fure footed upon the roughefl roads. The I horfes are 
- hardly fuperior in fize to the Shetland ponies, but now they 
are getting fome equal in fize to their neighbours upon the 
continent of Mull. The parifli alfo reared a number of 
breeding mares, which not only fiipplied itfelf in work- 
ing horfes, but a confiderable number were alfo fold out 
of the country. The cafe is now altered. The hills 
that formerly ferved as nurferies for mares are now con- 
verted into Iheep walks ; and if the rage for Iheep flock- 
ing

ing goes on, not only this parifh, but the reft of Mull 
muft buy labouring horfes. There are but few goats. 
They are entirely baniflied from the Duke of Argyll's 
property. The ancient fouming of the parifti was 3068 
Itead of black cattle, from 3 years old and upwards, 
ftirks and 2 year olds, not being reckoned foums. The 
Bumber of fbeep was the fame with the black cattle. 
There were near 1000 working horfes, befides mares and 
followers. The fouming now is lefs, and varies every 
year. Indeed the number of every kind is quite uncer- 
tain. Every gentleman farmer, at leaft, does more juf- 
is.ee to his cattle than formerly, and ftocks his farm ac- 
cording to his own tafte and conveniency. There are at 
prefent near 3000 Low country fheep in the parifh, arid 
ftonfequentlyx the numbers of cows, horfes, and Highland 
ffieep^ have decreafed in proportion. Formerly no farm 
was ftocked wholly with one kind, but every farm had 
a certain proportion of cows, horfes* mares, iheep, and 
goats ; but now the farms are* in general, wholly ftock- 
ed with the kind that fuits them heft. 
' The vegetable productions are oats, barley, and pota- 
toes. There are two kinds of oats ; great oats, and what 
js called fmall oats. The incumbent was the firft, about 
10 years ago, to fow great oats, but ftill very few fow' 
it, though it anfwers very well in good years. The 
fmall oats is a very poor kind of grain, a boll of it hard- 
ly yielding 4 ftones of meal j but it is hardy, and the 
grain being light, it is not apt to be fhaken in bad years. 
It is alfo better calculated to feed outlying cattle in win- 
ter, than great oats. A confiderable quantity of barley is 
xaifed, which is, in general, very good, except the barley 
of Icolumkill, which yields but from 11 to 12 ftones of 
meal the boll. The principal food of the inhabitants is po- 
tatoes. 



Of Kilfinichen and Kilviceuen. 193 

tatoes, of which great quantities are raifed. The parifb, 
however, never ferves itfelf entirely, even in the bed 
years ; and in bad feafons, great quantities of meal arc 
imported. In fummer 179.1, upwards of 2000 bolb of 
meal, befides potatoes, were imported. That year was 
much feverer than fummer 1783, and, together with 
feveral bankruptcies that happened then, reduced the 
inhabitants to great difficulties. The year 1793,1s pret- 
ty plentiful ; and though the Duke of Argyll, dread- 
ing a fcarcity, ordered meal to Mull, and to be diftribu- 
ted at prime coft, yet fuch was the plenty in the pariih, 
that only the incumbent, and 2 or 3 other gentlemen up- 
on his Grace's property in the pariih, had any occafion 
for it. Perhaps, by a better mode of agriculture, the 
pariih might, in general, ferve itfelf, particularly Rofs 
and the ifland of I. The fowing begins generally about 
the 20th of March, and is finifhed by the middle of 
May, except the ifland of I, which is not over with the 
barley fowing till after the middle of June : But fuch is 
the heat of the foil, that they cut down their crop ear- 
lier than any part of the reft of the pariih. In good 
feafons, the crop is cut down in September :-In bad feafons, 
fome of the crop has not been cut down till November. 

Manure and Mode of Cultivation. — The different kinds 
of manure made ufe of through the pariih, are lliell fand, 
with which Rofs abounds, dung from the houfed cattle, 
and fea ware, of which mention is made already. Cattle 
alfo lie upon fome field in every farm in fummer and 
harveft, which is called teaching ; and where ferns are 
found, they are laid upon the fields in July and Auguft. 
As there are no cart roads in the par-ifn, the manure is 
laid out upon the ground in creels upon horfeback,

which waftes a deal of time. The plough made uie of 
in the parifli is probably the fame that was ufed for cen- 
turies back. It is very uncouth, and drawn bj 4 hor- 
fes a-breaft. The reafon probably was, that they knew 
no better ; for the incumbent, feveral years ago, got a 
two-horfe plough, and many are following the. example. 
The want of a proper plough-maker is a great lofs. At 
prefent every one makes his own plough. Captain Mac- 
Lean of Kefilochaluine, a refiding heritor, has got a Low 
country ploughman, who holds the plough, and drives 
the horfes. It is hardly pomble, in molt parts of the 
parifh, to carry on any regular fyftem of farming, the 
ground is fo broken, and full of loofe flones. But a 
great deal might be done, by turning the loofe flones off 
the ground, and rendering other parts acceflible to the 
plough, which now are not. Many parts are foft and 
mofly. Thefe parts are digged with Highland fpades, 
with great toil. However, the crops thefe places yield, 
feem, in fome meafure, to cpmpenfate the trouble. The 
mode of fowing barley in I, in dry feafons, and in fandy 
foil, is pretty lingular.. The barley is fown before the 
ground is ploughed, and then they plough the ground 
over it. This prevents the grain being bared, by high 
winds drifting the fand off it. This mode was undoubt- 
edly introduced by neceffity, and anfwers very well. 

Potatoes are planted in the lazy-bed way, dibbled and 
drilled. In winter, as much fea-ware as can be collect- 
ed upon beeches and in creeks, is laid upon ground for- 
merly in tillage, or upon mofs. This ground is made 
into ridges, and the fea-ware covered from the furrows 
by earth, or mofs. Here, in fpring, potatoes are dibbled, 
which are dry and wholefome. The fea-ware cut or 
gathered upon the mores in fpring, is laid upon the 

ground^ 



Of Kilfinichen and Kilviccuai. 195 



ground, the potatoes are laid upon the fea-ware, and co- 
vered with earth from the furrows. The potatoes 
growing from this mode of management, are generally 
wet and fpongy. Potatoes are planted in dung in this 
iaft mode. Few in the parifh drill their potatoes. 

Meafure and Price of Grain. — The w T hole produce of 
Rofs, the ifland of I, and the reft of the Duke of Argyll's 
property, is fold by the peck. A peck by which barley is 
fold, and fometimes oats, is ftreaked, and contains up- 
wards of 10 Scotch pints. Another peck by which oats are 
fold heaped, and meal ftreaked, contains 6 Scotch pints. 
Potatoes are fometimes fold by the barrel, and fometimes by 
the peck. In other parts of the parifh, different meafures 
are ufed. It is among the great defiderata in the king- 
dom, a uniformity of weights and meafures. Without 
this, it is impoffible to form a comparifon between the 
price of grain, and the feller is as much in the dark as 
the buyer. The boll of fmall oats fells from 8s. to ics. 
The meal it produces in Rofs is about 4 ftones weight. 
The barley of I is fold Lorn 16s. to 2~s. It meals about 
12 flones. The reft of the barley of the parifh is gene- 
rally fold at 2gs. the boll, and meals about 16 Hones 
weight. Potatoes in good years fell from 2cd. to 2s. 
the barrel: At feed-time, in bad years, fuch as 1791, 
they rofe to 55. the barrel. Meal imported into the parilli 
Is from 1 6s. to 2cs. the boll of 8 ftones, and cannot often 
be got in the parifh at that price, fo that fuch as want are 
obliged to fend a boat, or horfes for it, to a diftant quar- 
ter, at a conuderable expenfe. The meal imported into 
the country is from Clyde, and befides prime coft in that 
part, commiiuon money, freight, and whatever profit 
the mealmongers choofe to charge, is added. So little

correfpondence is between the parifli and Ireland, thaf 
meal, though cheap there, is never imported to the pa- 
riih from fliat country *. 

* Wages, &amp;c— The wages of houfehold labouring fervants have in- 
ereafed very rapidly within thefe few years . In l7 „ 0| the common 
vages in the year for rr.en iervants were from aL zs to zl ids., with 4 
pau of brogues. Wages increafed gradually to Whitfunday i 7 p 2 , when 
the common rate, to the next Martinmas, was al. 10s, with a pair of 
brogues ; and from that term to Whitfunday i-j 93 , the wages were 3 1., 
with the fame number of brogues. This rapid rife in wages was owing 
to the great demand for hands for manufactures, and other works, carried 
on in the Low Country of Scotland, ar.d in England. Such was the rage 
that feized young fellows to leave the country at that period, that it was 
with the utmoft difficulty fervants could be got at any wages. The com- 
mon practice is to go off in April or beginning of May, fome to the 
Low Country of Scotland, and fome to England. They generally come 
home again to their parents and relations in November, and feldom en- 
gage in any work till the feafon for leaving the country returns again. 
Numbers alfo go to the harveft, and return again in the latter end of 
October or beginning of November. This cuftom is productive of more 
evils than one. It fpreads a fpirit of giddinefs, idlcnefs, and immorality, 
through the parifh. Thefe emigrants alfo bring home difeafes that prove 
fatal to many ; fuch as fevers, fmail pox, mealies, &amp;c. This advance of 
wages is very hurtful to the improvement of the country, as few country 
farmers can afford fo much. It is true, the wages are not in appearance 
greater than in the Low Country ; but they mult appear, as they in 
reality are, much higher, when the fituation of the country is taken in- 
to confideration. The ground is interfperfed with rocks and large Ioofe' 
ftones, unfavourable to- the plough, fo that a great part is digged. Ma- 
nure, &amp;c. -is carried on horfeback, as there is no road for carts; and 
even in the fhorteft days, no work is carried on with candle-light ; fo 
that, upon the whole, a fervant, where a proper fyftem of farming is. 
carried on, will perform double the quantity of work. If wages con- 
tinue on the increafe, the country muft be turned to large grazings, 
where few tenants are neceffary, or divided into fmall fpots, when eve- 
ry man will be r.ble to cultivate his fhare with his own hands. In the 
fjrft cafe, moffy and heathy grounds will, in the courfe of a few years, 
return to their firft ftate, after all the trouble taken to bring them to' 
tillage and to grafs ; and in the fecond, the people muft remain fo poor, 
thit they can neither enclofe nor improve their lands properly.

Proprietors and Rent.— There are 6 proprietors in the 
parifli ; 3 of whom only refide in it. In 1 791, the rent 
of the parifli was 2711I. us. but it has been fluc- 
tuating fince. The Duke of Argyll's rents were not aug- 
mented for a number of years prior to that period, and 
fome augmentation was laid on a few farms. Other he- 
ritors, 

The wages of fervant-maids are very low; from iSs. to 21s. and % 
pair of brogues, is the common rate for a year. Their wages have not 
increafed for many years. Numbers of them, as well as of the men, go 
to the Low Conntry to the harveft, and aim engage in family fervice, 
and other works. There are other fervants common to this parifh with 
the reft of the Weftern Ifles, and different from thofe already mentioned. 
There are mealers, workmen, moor-herds, and grafs-kcepers or chafers. 
The mealers are a kind of fubtenants, and employed only by gentlemen. 
They take the arable ground of a farm at fo much meal yearly. Be- 
tides raifing the crop, they carry on the other work of the farm with 
whatever affiftance can be given them by the tackfman. They have the 
grafs of % or 3 cows, and fome fheep. They furnifh half the labouring 
horfes. They are fed by the tackfman every day ; he employs them at 
any work, except what concerns the crop. Few now are employed as 
mealers. The only difference between mealers and workmen is, that 
workmen, inftead of meal, deliver 3-fourths of the crop to the matter, 
after it is cut, and keep the fourth to themfelves. The mafter furnifhes 
all the labouring horfes. 

The particular fituation of the country has given rife to grafs-keepers 
or chafers. In many parts, there are no kind of march walls ; and 
where there are march walls, they are fo bad, that they are no fencc  
The confequence is, that every farm is obliged to keep a man to look 
after the marches, without any other employment. This man gets for 
his trouble a houfe, a cow's grafs, and grafs for a horfe, fome fheep, and 
grotand for crop. Moor-herds are employed to look after their matter's 
cattle in moors and hills; and his terms are generally the fame with 
grafs-keepers. All thefe kinds of fervants, viz. mealers, workmen, 
grafs-keepers, and moor-herds, have families. There are hardly any em- 
ployed as day-labourers ; when they are, their wages are from 8d. to is. 
a-day, befides their victuals. Tailors charge the fame. Broguemakers 
charge 4d. a-pair, when they are victualled, and 6d. a-pair, when they 
are not. Wall- builders and ditchers have fo much a rood.

Services.— The Duke of Argyll exacts fervices of no 
kind of his tenants ; the reft of the heritors do. Services 
are always ftipulated, and confift chiefly in cutting peats, 
and leading them home to the proprietors houfes. As 
coals are now duty free, it is probable, that whatever 
other fervices may be exaded, there will be none as to 
peats. 

Antiquities — In this the ifland of I takes the lead. 
Writers mention this ifland under three names, viz. Hii, 
Iona, and Icolumkill. Bede calls it Hii, but the proper 
name is I * which in the Gaelic fignifies an ifland, and 
is called fo by way of eminence to this day. Bede's 
iniftake proceeded from his ignorance of the Gaelic. In 
monkifli writers, it is called Iona f, which fignifies the 
Ifland of Waves. In more modern times, it was called 
I-collum-kill ; that is, the ifland of Colum-kill, in ho- 
nour of Columba. The name Iona is now quite loft in 
the country, and it is always called I, except when the 
fpeaker would wifti to lay an emphafis upon the word, 
then it is called Icolumkill \. 

. The 

* I is founded like ce in Eriiilifli. 

f Iona is, in Gaelic, fpelt I-thonn ; but as the th is not founded, La- 
tin writers fpell it Iona. The name is very charadleriftick of it in times 
of ftorm. 

\ Eede writes, that I belonged to Eritain, being feparated from it, as 
he fays, but by a narrow arm of the feaj and that the Picls, who in.*

The Druids undoubtedly poffefled I, before the in-r 
trodu&amp;ion of Chriftianity. A green eminence, clofe to 
the found of I, is to this day called the Druid's burial 
place *. A cottager, fome years ago, planting potatoes 
in this fpot, and digging earth to cover them, brought 
up fome bones, which the people of the ifland imme- 
diately concluded to be the bones of the Druids. The 
tradition is ? that the firft Chriftians baniflied the Druid*, 
and took poffeffion of their feat. The Druids alfo had 
a temple at the head of Lochfcridain, in a farm called 
Roflal f. This temple is but fmall, and feveral of thft 
ftones have fallen down. Here, as the name of the place 
indicates, they held courts of juftice. 

I feems to be early the feat of a religious fociety of 
Chriftians. Scots hiftorians fay, that Fergus the II. 
ere&amp;ed a religious houfe, with a ftately church, in Iona 
where his fucceffors were buried. Bede, in the paflage 
already quoted, countenances the opinion of Scotch 

monks 

habited that part of Britain, made a prefent of it to the Scotch monks, 
who converted them to the Chriftian religion. By the Picts, who made 
the prefent, Bede muft mean the Picts inhabiting S. of the Friths of 
Forth and Clyde ; for Britain extended, according to ancient writers, 
that far only, all N. of that, or the wall of Agricola, being called Albin 
or Scotia. But there is not the fmallcft probability that I ever belonged 
to the Pidls, as the venerable writer aflerts. The leaft knowledge of 
geography will convince any one of this. Bede was indefatigable in 
his refearches after whatever concerned tht firft planting of Chriftianity 
in every part of the ifland of Britain, but looked upon profane fubjedls 
only 'as fecondary objects. The Pids were feparated from I, not by * 
narrow arm of the fea, as he fays, but by a wide and tempeftuous ocean- 
He fays, in other places, that I is in Hibernia ; by this he means Albin 
or Scotland, which in thofe ages was often called Hihernia.— Book. III.

monks being fettled in I, about the period affigned ti 
Fergus the II. by the Scotch hiftorians. The firft Chrif- 
tians that poffeffed th\emfelves of I were, in all proba- 
bility, the Culdees. They were a kind of monks, un- 
der certain regulations ; and as thej afFecled retired 
places, as their name * imports, they could not in any 
country find a place more happily fuited to their pur- 
pofe. One place in I is ftill called the Culdee's Cell f . 
It is the foundation of a fmall circular houfe, upon a 
reclining plain. From the door of the houfe, a walk 
afcends to a fmall hillock, with the remains of a wall 
upon each fide of the walk, which grows widerN to the 
hillock. There are evident traces of the walls of the 
walk taking a circuit round, and encloling the hillock. 
The figure the Druids and Culdees made in I is uncer- 
tain, Hiftory may be faid to be filent concerning their 
tranfa&amp;ions in that ifland, and even tradition carries 
down but faint traces of their having exifted there. It 
was referved for Columba to raife the fame of I to the 
great height it attained to in his own and after ages j 
though, no doubt, the merit of his fuccefiors contri- 
buted not a little %,

Trefent State of I. — The ruins of I, by the generous 
,care and attention of the family of Argyll, are kept, 
perhaps, in better prefervation than moft ruins of the 
kind in Scotland. Since the Reformation, one of the 
Earls of Argyll roofed the cathedral fleeple, and built 
up moft of the doors with Hone and lime, to prevent 
cattle getting through the ruins. Duke Archibald of 
Argyll built a wall round the whole abbey, to prevent 
the building's being hurt. But this wall being thought 
inefficient, the prefent Duke of Argyll built it anew ; 
got a lock and key to it, and made it an effectual fence.

ljved, but alfo among the Iriih, Pi£ts, and Saxons. Re died, in an ad- 
vanced age, in the beginning of the 7th century. His life is written 
in a prolix and confufed manner, by Adamnan, who was Abbot of I. The 
celebrated abbey which he founded, had very extenfive jurifdiclions, 
and, for many ages, held. the chief fway ampng the Scottifli and Piclifh 
monafteries. It was liberally endowed by the piety and munificence of 
the kings and great men of the kingdom of Scotland. Buchanan mentions 
feveral iflands that belonged to it. TheYertile ifland of Tirii once did, as 
the name indicates, and the divifions of it being ftill- called Monk's por- 
tions. The fame fpirit of piety, which fo liberally provided for the fup- 
port of the monks, reared alfo ftately buildings, both for devotion and 
accommodation, as their ruins ftill mow. Such was the reputed fanctity 
of the place, that not only the kings of Scotland, but fome Irifli kings, 
and the petty Norwegian princes of the Ifles, ordered their remains to 
be buried in this hallowed ground. Their tombs, with infcriptions 
pointing out to whom they belonged, were entire in Buchanan's days ; 
but there is no infcrtption now, though the place is pointed out. All. 
the great families in the Weftern Ifles had their burial places in I; fome 
of their grave-ftones are very well carved. The burying ground fur- 
rounds St. Oran's Chapel. A few hundred yards from the abbey, is the 
nunnery. It was alfo liberally endowed. Some lands in Mull are ftill 
called the Nun's Lands. Here the abbeffes were buried. One infcrip- 
tion is ftill legible. Till within thefe few years, all the females were 
buried at the nunnery, and all the males at the abbey. With few 
ce^ions, it is ftill the cafe ; fuch is the force of cultom and prejudice.,

He alfo got a leaf to the main door of the nunnery 
church, with a lock and key, and built up the other 
doors. His Grace prohibits his tenants from removing 
ft ones from the place where they fall, and charged his 
chamberlain to fee thefe orders ftriaiy complied with. 
But, notwithflanding the care taken of them, parts of 
fome of them have fallen, and time has levelled others 
of them with the ground. Some of them have done fo 
within thefe few years, and feveral more within the 
memory of fome people Hill living, particularly fome 
elegant arches near the nunnery, and the abbot's houf«, 
which is faid to be a very handfome building. But 
moft of the buildings are Handing, and feem to have 
received no injury but from time, which was probably 
the cafe with the whole of them. The cathedral, or 
St. Mary's, is almofl entire, with the fteeple. It is on- 
ly within thefe few years that part of the E. end of the 
tranfverfe fell, and fome of the head of the crofs. £t. 
Oran's Chapel is ftill Handing, but in a tottering con- 
dition. The Virgin's Chapel was Handing till within 
thefe few years, when part of it fell. Moft of the cloif- 
ters are ftill Handing. The Bimop's, which is'fmall, is 
alfo Handing. So that there is Hill remaining of the 
abbey what will give a pretty complete idea of what 
it was. 

At the nunnery, there are fewer remains. The Nun- 
nery Church is quite entire ; one end of it is arched, 
and is very beautiful. Here alfo Hands, what was call- 
ed the parifti church. It is yet entire, but tottering. 
There was a court, with a piazza, to the W. fide of 
the Nunnery Church, and round it the cloifleis were 
fauilt ; but there are hardly any remains of them, but on 
the S. fide of the court.

To the N. of the abbey is a loch, as it is called, but 
probably an artificial pond. It has a paved caufeway * 
through the middle, which is ftill entire. It is faid, the 
edges of this pond were all planted. Porta-chunich 
ought to be mentioned. Here, as tradition goes, was 
the place where Columba firft landed in I, and left his 
currach ; from which the place has its name. An ar- 
tificial mound, of the form of a boat with the keel up, 
is faid to be the dimenfions of Columba's currach. This 
mound meafures near 50 feet in length. Upon this 
beech the pebbles are got. 

It is faid, there Was a monaftery in the ifland of Innia- 
Kenneth, but no traces of the buildings are to be feen. 
A fmall church, faid by Buchanan to be a parifh church, 
ftill remains. What is pretty lingular, a fmall bell, ufed. 
at the celebration of mafs, is ftill lying on the altar. 
There are in the parilh many of the round towers faid 
to be Danilhi They are upon the fea coaft, and in fight 
of one another. They feem to be "watch-towers to give 
notice of an enemy's approach, which was done from 
the battlement by a fmoke in the day time, and a fire 
at night. They are very fmall ; moft of them would 
not contain 20 men. 

There are in many parts of the parifh, long ftones 
{landing on end. They are called Carra f$ and feem to 
be fet up at the head of the graves of eminent men, or

kiln when weftern Europe lay buried in the ignoraw* 
and barbarity brought on by the cruel ravages of the 
lavage nations that overturned the Roman empire : and 
from this feminarv iflued pious and learned monks and 
laymen, who again revived learning, and propagated 
Chriftianity through many kingdoms of Europe.- Co- 
lumba's writings are faid to be numerous : a catalogue 
of them is given at the end of Lhoyd's Archa^ologia!— 
St. Aidan, from I, in the 7th century, at the requeft of 
Ofwald King of Northumberland, converted that king- 
dom, and founded the bifhoprick of Lindisferne, or Holy 
Ifland, which was afterwards tranflated to Durham by 
Malcolm the III. of Scotland. Bede* (B. III. chap. 3.) 
gives him the greater! character for mildnefs, piety, and 
other virtues, and blames him only for being a quarto- 
deciman. St. Finan and St. Colman, both from I, fuc- 
ceeded him in the bifhoprick. In St. Colman's time,, 
the difpute about the celebration of Eafter began, which 
obliged him to leave the kingdom of Northumberland. 
The famous St. Cuthbert was Columba's difciple. The 
"writings of Adamnan, abbot of I, are in the hands of 
the learned. Campbell and Veremond, &amp;c. flouriflied 
in I ; and many more, whofe very names would form a 
large catalogue. 

Since the Reformation, the parilh has produced none 
eminent for learning, if we except- the Beatons of Pen- 
nicrofs, who were doctors of phyfic. The family is 
now extinct ; but they are ftill fpoken of in the country 
with admiration for their fkill in phyfic. It is faid, that 
one of them was fent for to attend one of the kings of 
Scotland j and that the people of the country nocked to 
kim for advice as to their health, during his abfenee,

when he gave them this fliort rule : " To be cheeiful, 
 temperate, and .early rifers *." They had a large 
folio MS. in Gaelic, treating of phyfic, which was left 
with a woman, the heirefs of the Beatons, and feen by 
fome now living ; but what became of it, the incumbent, 
after all his inquiries, could not find. It is perhaps loft, 
as the heirs of this woman are quite illiterate f. 

Advantages and Hi/advantages.— The parifh being 
moftly furrounded by the fea, and indented by its arms, 
is a very great advantage. By this, the inhabitants 
have an opportunity of catching great numbers of va- 
rious kinds of fifh for family ufe, and generally more 
herring than is fufiicient for the confumption of the pa- 
rim. The fea breezes alfo are fo warm, particularly in

f It has been warmly difputed, whether there was a library at I ; and 
much has been written on both fides of the qucftion. The doubt has 
arifen entirely from prejudice. There can be no doubt, but the many 
learned men that flourifhed at I, had the claffics among them, and all the 
books on divinity and fcience thefe ages could afford. It can be as little 
doubted, that, like other focieties- of learned men, they committed their 
own thoughts to writing, as well as the tranfaclions of their countrymen. 
It is afked, What became of this library ? In the 9th century, Kellach, 
abbot of I, was obliged to fly to Ireland 'for fhelter againft the Danes, 
If the barbarians had th« library in their power, no doubt they would 
deftroy it. But after this period, Scotch hiftorians mention the library of 
I, and their borrowing books from it. At the Reformation, the MSS. 
•f I were in part carried to the Scotch colleges of Doway, or to Rome, 
at leaft the chartularies, and fuch as were efteemed moik valuable by 
the monks. It is faid, that fome of the MSS. were carried to Inveraray, 
and that a Duke of Montague found fome of them in the diops there, 
ufed as fnufF paper. If any of them were in the library of the family 
of Argyll^ the perfecutiou that family underwent, in the time of Charles 
the II. accounts for none being there now.

lequence, not only as to fifcing, but for the eafy pro- 
curing of fea-ware and fhell, and which are the general 
manures of the pariih. The cattle alfo, in winter and 
fpnng, go to the fhores and eat fea-ware, which is no 
fmall advantage in times of fnow. But the parifh la- 
bours under many difadvantages , There are no bridges 
and no roads, except what is made in Rofs by the fta- 
tute-labour. This is a misfortune that is feverely felt, 
both by the inhabitants and by Grangers. This, and 
the want of ftage-houfes upon the road, makes travel- 
ling difagreeable, and often dangerous. The refiding 
heritors have made fome enclofures upon the farms 
where they refide ; the reft of the parifh is open, ex- 
cept the Duke of Argyll's property, where fome farms 
are nearly enclofed, and fomething done upon all of 
them. This want of enclofures makes herding very ex- 
penfive to the tenant, and hurtful to the cattle, as they 
are often hounded with dogs, and cannot pafture at eafe rf 
It is true, fome farms in the parifh cannot be enclofed, 
but at an enormous expenfe ; but thefe are few in 
number. The parifh being out of the track of fhipping, 
and in a manner fequeflered from the reft of Mull by 
high mountains, except one pafs through Glenmore, 
leading to Torafay, (and even this, without a road or 
bridge) is feverely felt.

Argyll, and a piece of ground for potatoes and other 
crop. The parochial fchool is ftationed in Rofs, near 
the only church in the parifli ; but fueh is the wretched 
ftate of this fchool, that the fchoolmafter is a man who,

CharaBer of the Inhabitants, &amp;c.—The people, in ge-

to follow any branch of bufinefs that they fee clearly is for 
their advantage. The ground they have to labour, and 
the method of labouring, mow. their induftry and perfe- 
verance. The number of poor they fupport, mows their 
humanity ; as alfo 2 mipwrecks that happened within 
thefe 6 years. In both inflances, the poor failors were 
treated with kindnefs and humanity. One of thefe vef-» 
fels was wrecked in Rofs ; and it is very remarkable., 
that a quantity of cork, very ufeful, and much wanted 
in the country for their nets, fcattered over a ftrand of up-, 
wards of a mile in extent, was not touched by the in- 
habitants, though many were too poor to buy it, even if 
'they had an opportunity. It has been mentioned aU 
ready, the attempts made by the Duke of Argyll to em- 
ploy the idle hands in the country, in fifliing and quar- 
rying of marble. He has now fent flax among them to 
be fpun ; and as both men and women fee their interefts 
very clearly, it is to be hoped, that his Grace's humane 
intentions will, by degrees, have the effects he meant.

Name, Situation, and Extent. 

ri T  HE name feems to have been the fame in ancient 
-* as in modern times, and is probably of Gaelic 
origin. It is deduced by fome from ceann, head or end, 
and fanus *, high ground, or the declivity of a moun- 
tain. In this fenfe, it is fuppofed to refer to the ter- 
mination, or rather the interruption, on the W. corner 
of the parifli, of thofe hills which run acrofs the coun- 
try, towards Stirling, from the Red Head in Angus f. 

Thi^ 

• Hence, probably, the name of Fauns, in Lauderdale, fo celebrated 
for its oats, originated. 

f Others refolve Kinfauns into Ceann er Ken, and fan, an obfolete 
*rord, fignifying hollow. This deriyaUon implies, the head of the flat

This parifh begins about a- mile and a half below Perth, 
and runs for 3 or 4 miles along the northern banks of 
the Tay, forming an irregular figure of above 5 male, 
long, and between 2 and 3 broad. 

Surface and SoiL-The furface is confidently diver- 
fined by level and rifing grounds, by wood and water. • 
The lands on the banks of the Tay are flat. On the 
weftern boundary, at, a fmall diaance from the river, 
rifes a ridge of hills, whofe tops are covered with ex- 
tenfive plantations. Of thefe hills, Kinnoul is the moll 
remarkable. It lies partly in the pariih of that name, 
and partly in the parilh of Kinfauns ; and prefents to 
the S. a large abrupt front of rock, of a ftriking appear- 
ance, especially from the old pofl-road, which went clofe 
to -its bafe. On this fide, the afcent is exceedingly fteep, 
and its height is 632 feet above the level of the Tay. 
The fummit projefts in rugged cliffs of a feamy texture, 
which being gradually loofened by the froft and rain, 
have fometimes fallen in large manes, with prodigious 
force, into the plain below. About 27 years ago, a 
farm houfe, near the foot of the hill, was almofl deftroy- 
: cd by one of thefe mafifes of rock,- and a woman inftarit- 
Jy killed. On account of this accident, the farm-ftead 
was removed to a proper diftance from fuch a danger- 
ous fituation. The hills afford variety of delightful

or plain ; and is alfo applicable to the fituation of the country. At the 
foot of the hills now mentioned, the parifh lies in a valley or hollow, 
which gradually opens, in an eafterly diredlion, into the plain of the 
Carfe of Gowrie. Thefe are the moft plaufible opinions refpecting the 
origin of the name ; and as opinions only, they are given. But, even 
thefe fuggeft, that certainty is not always to be expected, in deductions 
from a language which, it is allowed, often affords fcope for fancy and 
conjecture.

others, with fand. The lands under cultivation are' j* 
general, good and fertile : the uncultivated parts are 
moftly covered with plantations y fo that there is not muci* 
wafte ground within the parifh. 

Air — The air is exceedingly pure and healthful. Tho 
drynefs of the grounds, and the ftrong currents of weft, 
erly wind which often blow, as through a funnel be- 
tween the hills of Kinnoul and Moredun, probably con- 
tribute to purify the air, and to render it falubrious.

epidemical infeclions either common, or remarkably 
fatal.

*fay and Salmon Fijhings. — Befides a few rivulets 
within the parilh, the Tay wafties its fouthern boundary 
for 3 or 4 miles ; and is here navigable for Ihips, cutter 
built, of 100 tons : Dutch or flat-bottomed velTels o$ 
above 20© tons can go up to Perth. Having received^ 
in its courfe, the Dochart, Lochy, Lion, Tumble, Gary, 
Bran, Ifla and Almond, all confiderable rivers, befides 
many inferior ftreams, the Tay carries here a body of 
frefh water, far fuperior to any other river in the 
ifland *. The neap tides rife 6 feet ; the fpring ones 
from 9 to 1 Oct. But could the channel be contra&amp;ed 
by an embankment, efpecially upon the large plain, 
which is overflowed for about 10 miles, between Inchyra 
and Invergowrie, the tide would rife much higher, and 
flow with greater rapidity ; whilft large tracks of ya- 
luable land would be recovered for the purpofes of agri- 
culture. This undertaking, however, is of fuch mag- 
nitude and enormous expenfe, that it can only be the 
work of ages. 

The Tay abounds with excellent falmon, and fine trout 
of different kinds, particularly 2 fpecies of fea-trout, 
the white and red ; the latter of which is reckoned the 
ftronger flavoured, the former more delicate. They 
weigh from 2 to 6 lb. The large bull trout is fome- 
times found from 16 to 30 lb. and upwards. The fal- 
mon fifliings in the Tay are an objedt of confiderable 
importance, and furnifli a valuable article of trade to the

The filhings upon the Kinfauns eftate alone, extending 
between i and 3 miles along the N. fide of the river 
©nly, and which are almoft entirely in this parifh, did 
not, in 1740, bring iool. yearly of free rent. In 1763 
they rofe to ioool. ; in 1782 to 1400I. ; and they are 
now (November 1793) let in a new leafe for 2560I. 
Befides thefe, there are other fifhings within the parifh., 
to the amount of 450I., making altogether upwards of 
3000I. annually. There are from 70 to 80 men, and 
about 40 boats, employed on thefe fifhings. The fal- 
mon are carried to market frefh, pickled, and falted. 
Very few, of late years, have been falted ; a good many 
are kitted or pickled ; but by far the greateft quantity 
is run up frefh, in ice, to London, where they are now 
often?eaten almoft as frefh as on the banks of the Tay. 
The plan of preferving the fifh in ice was firft fuggefted 
by George Dempfter, Efq. of Dunnichen, the late pub- 
iic-fpirited member for the neighbouring diftrict. of 
boroughs, and has been attended with the greateft fuc-

either to the proprietors or tackfmen. They did BOt then begin to fiflv 
till the feed-time was finiflied ; and, fy confequence, the moft valuable 
part of the feafon was entirely loft ; whilft fcarcely any other market 
was known befides home confumption, whicli did not then bring id. the 
pound. Since that period, the bed of the river has been- cleared of all 
obftructions to the nets, and the fifliings have been disjoined from the 
farms ; circumftances,which rendered them an interefting concern, and 
worthy of attention. A demand from the Catholick States, along with 
flie Mediterranean, for falted fifli, was ont mean of raifing their price. 
This was followed by a brifk trade from the London market, which has 
greatly increafed the value of the fifli to the tackfmen, and of the rents 
to the proprietors.

Roads.— An excellent turnpike road, opened lately fro n* 
Perth to Dundee, enters the parifh on the W., and runs 
nearly its whole length. The leading principle in its for- 
mation, is to avoid pulls, which has been fo effedually 
accomplifhed, that it goes almoft upon a level between 
thefe towns. The diftance has alfo been reduced; fo 
that travellers, while they pafs along an eafy road, and 
through a fine country, fave nearly as much in horfe or 
chaife hire, as is equal to the expenfe of the tolls. The 
propofal of a turnpike road met with univerfal approba- 
tion, fo obvious were its advantages. The crofs roads 
in this parifh are already tolerable, and will probably be 
itill improving, by having the ftatute work chiefly ap- 
plied to their repair and fupport. The flatute labour 
is here fometimes commuted, fometimes taken in kind. 

Farms and Agriculture. — The farms, in general, rum 
from 50 or 60 -to 100 acres. A few are larger. Ex- 
cepting gentlemens enclofures, for their own ufe, there 
are Icarcely any in the parifb ; nor indeed do they prevail 
in this tradl of country, lying immediately along the N. 
fide of 'the Tay, or through the Carfe of Gowrie. As 
thefe lands are nearly on the level of the fea, and fhel- 
tered from the N. by a ridge of neighbouring hills, their 
climate is naturally warm, and their harveft early. The 
foil in this parifh and diftricl:, is more adapted for pro- 
ducing grain of all kinds, than for paflure. Very little 
of it, therefore, is employed for this purpofe. On the 
lighter grounds, fome flax, turnip, and potatoes, are 
raifed for private ufe ; but, upon the whole, this is a 
corn country. 

Our fyftem of agriculture, as in moft other parts of 
Scotland, has been exceedingly improved within thefe

10 or 30 years pall. The diftin£tion of outfield andinfield 
no longer exifts ; moft of the grounds are cleared of ftones, 
broom and| furze; the ridges are reduced and ftraightened, 
wet lands drained, and a far fuperior tillage introduced. 
Artificial grafTes have long been fown to great advantage ; 
lime, and other manures, have been applied; and fummer 
fallow is become more frequent ; all of which, with a 
proper rotation of cropping, have produced the bcft ef- 
fects. It is, however, ft ill to be regretted, that though 
th*efe improvements are well und^ftood, yet they are 
fometimes, particularly in cropping regularly, but par- 
tially obferved. The rotation reckoned heft, is, ill, 
Fallow, drefled with lime, or dung, or botli ; 2dly, 
"Wheat ; 3dly, Peafe, and green crops, to prepare the 
ground for, 4thly, Barley, fown down with grafs feeds ; 
5tb.lv, Hay ; 6thly, Qats. This fucceflion preferves the 
land in high order, and makes the returns much larger. 
Another courfe, alfo in practice, is ? iff, Peafe ; 2dly, 
Wheat ; 3dly, Barley ; 4thly, Grafs ; 5thly, Oats. This 
anfwers tolerably well in light lands, but is unfuitable to 
clay. Farms are generally caft into 5 or 6 divilions, and 
one of thefe allotted fo each kind of grain, a hay crop and 
fallow ; but, of late years, wheat has greatly exceeded 
this proportion, and, inftead of being a fifth or lixth, 
is nearer a fourth or third of the whole produce. 

Eight bolls of wheaff and barley upon the acre, are 
/ccnfidered as a tolerable crop ; 9 and 10 a good^one ; but 
12 bolls of wheat upon fallow, and the fame quantity and 
more of oats after grafs, are frequently obtained. Beans 
in drill yield xo or 12 bolls, fometimes a good deal more. 
They are 3 times hand-hoed ; the expenfe of which is 
^bout a guinea an acre. But, it is to be obferved, with 
refpecr. to returns in general, that it is not eafy to fix

nature of the foil and feafon ; and, in a very particular

llowed*. • 

There k fcarcely any land in the parim below 20s. 
the acre. The greater part gives 25s. and 30s. 5 a good 
deal rents from p S . to 40s., and fonie of it is as high as 
5 os. Two remaining years of a leafe of a farm, belong- 
ing to Lord Gray, were lately bought up at 3 1. 10s, and 
upwards, the acre. The prefent medium rent of land 
may be about il. 8s. or 1L 10s. the acre. 

A great deal more grain is raifed in the parifh than 
ferves itfelf. Wheat and barley are exported to a con- 
fiderable amount j and the farmers can now fometimes 
fpare a few oats and peafe, with a good deal' of hay for 
the market. Thefe are, indeed, the ftaple commodities 
upon which they muft depend for their rents, and the 
fupport of their families. 

The grain in this part of the country, is generally of 
an excellent quality, and the prices are proportionally 
high.. Wheat, for the 2 laft crops, fold from 2Ts. to 
24s. ; barley at 18s. ; oats at 15s. and 16s. ; peafe at

The general contents of the parifh, are about. 37^ 
Scotch acres ; of which 2520 are arable, excepting a very 
fmall proportion. The remaining 1260 acres, are under 
plantations. Thefe run along the tops and front of the 
hills, and confift moftly of Scotch fir,, with larixes, beech, 
oak, and other foreft trees intermixed. 

Horfes and Black Cattle.— As no black cattle are em- 
ployed here in operations of husbandry, not many, ex- 
cepting cows, are reared. Some young ftots, or win- 
terings, as they are commonly called, are bought in for 
eating up the fodder in winter, and are fold, or fent off 
to grafs in fummer. Horfes are, for the moft part, 
bought ; few are reared. Befides what gentlemen keep 
for their own private ufe, the number of fheep is but 
fmall. Cows and cattle, at prefent, amount to 400 : 
there are i85 horfes, and about 90 fheep. 

Population. — There is good reafon to believe, that this 
parifli is not now fo populous as formerly. The rapid 
fuccefs of the manufactures, which, has drawn the people 
from the country to the towns, is one great caufe of de- 
population. Uniting fmall poffeffions, or crofts, into 
farms, is another ; and the difufe of cottagers, as farm- 
ing fervants, has alfo contributed to the fame effect. It 
has become much the practice, of late years, to employ 
unmarried men as- farming fervants ; of courfe cotta- 
gers, and their houfes, have, in fome degree, difappear-

partly from favings when the times admitted. From 
thefe funds they are provided, without any affeffment,

Language.-— The language of this parifli and corner is 
Saxon intermixed with Scottifh words and expreflions ; 
attended, however, by little or no provincial accent or 
dialed. Though this part of the country is not at a 
great diftance from the Highlands, yet neither Gaelic 
words nor accent are known amongft the natives be- 
low Perth. Very few names of places are Erfe ; but a 
great number are Scotch or Saxon. 

Antiquities. — In the Caftle of Kinfauns, is kept a 
large old fword, probably made near 500 years ago, and 
to be ufed by both hands. It is fiiaped like a broad 
fword, and is 5 feet 9 inches long, 2i inches broad at 
t.he hilt, and of a proportionable thicknefs, with a round

* Betides thefe dated fupplies, liberal private charities are given oc- 
cationally to families in diftrefs. This temporary relief is productive of 
,the beft confequences, by preventing the laborious poor from falling into 
total ruin, and becoming public burdens. As long as the common people 
can be prcferved from being known objecls of charity, a decent pride 
•excites their iuduftry ; but this foon difappears, when once they are re- 
gular penfioners on a parifli roll. The effects of harveft 178a were,

Tins terrible weapon bears the name of Charters 
fword; and probably belonged to Sir Thomas Charteris, 
commonly called Thomas de Longueville, once proprie- 
tor of the eftatc of Kinfauns. Sir Thomas Charteris, 
alias Longueville, was a native of France, and-of an an- 
cient family in that country. If credit can be given to 
accounts of fuch remote date, when he was at the court 
of Philip le Bel, in the end of the 13th century, he had 
a difputc with, and killed a French nobleman in the 
king's prefence. He efcaped, but was.refufed pardon. 

Having, for feveral years, infefted the feas as a pa- 
late, known by the name of the Red Beaver, from the 
colour of the flags he tarried on his mips, in May 1301 
or 1 3c 2 (by AdaimWs Chronology), Sir William 
Wallace, in his way to France, encountered and took 
him prifoner. At Wallace's interceffion, the French 
Iking conferred on him a pardon, and the honour of 
knighthood. He accompanied Wallace on his return to 
Scotland, and was ever after his faithful friend, and aid- 
ing in his exploits. Upon that hero's being betrayed, 
and carried to England, Sir Thomas Charteris retired 
to Lochmaben, where he remained till Robert Bruce 
began to affcrt his right to the crown of Scotland. He 
joined Bruce ; and was, if we may believe Adamfon, 
who refers to Barbeur, the firft who followed that king 
into the water, at the taking of Perth, January 8. 1313. 

Bruce rewarded his bravery, by giving him lands in 
the neighbourhood of Perth, which appear to have been 
thofe of Kinfauns, and which continued in the family of 
Charteris for many years. It is to this ancient knight, 
( ?nd to the antique fword above mentioned, that Adam-

About 40 years ago, upon opening the burying vault 
under the aile of the church of Kinfauns* erected by this 
family, there was found a head-piece, or kind of hel- 
met, made of feveral folds of linen, or fome ftrong fluff, 
painted over with broad ftripes of blue and white ; 
which feems to have been part of the fictitious armour, 
wherein the body of Thomas Longueville, or Charteris, 
had been depolited *. 

The eftate of Kinfauns afterward belonged to a gen- 
tleman of the name of Carnegie, of the Northelk family ; 
from whom it paffed to that of Blair, whofe heirefs was 
miarried to John Lord Gray, father of the prefent Lord. 

There is alfo in the houfe of Kinfauns, which Hands

a ftaff of the fame metal, 8 feet high. It has the date, 
1688, cut in the middle, and was wont to be placed on the 
top of the caftle. This Was a mark, or badge, of an he-

Sanation and Chara&amp;er of the People. — A remarkable 
change has taken place within thefe 30 years paft, in the 
lrefs, manners, and cleanlinefs of the people ; the natu- 
ral confequence of the influx of money. The great rife 
of wages has confiderably meliorated the fituation of 
fuch as depend upon their labour for the fupport of their 
families. And were the houfes of cottagers, and of thofe 
in the inferior ranks of life better, it would be a van: 
addition to their comfort. Some excellent ones have 
been lately built by proprietors. Jf fome inftances of 
more ftraitened circumftances occur amongft the poorer 
people, yet they do not feem to produce difcontent. It 
is not known that any have died of want. None, for 
many years back, have been deftitute of employment ; 
and there have been no emigrations. No perfon, in the 
memory of the oldeft man alive, has been tried for any 
crime, or banifhed. 

The people are rather above middle lize ; they are 
healthy, and of a good looking, decent appearance. Their 
attendance upon public worfhip is regular ; their ideas, 
of religion are rational.

effeas of the river, is its furnifliing, from the coafts of 
the Frith of Forth, a regular fupply of coal, which is the 
fuel of this country, and which, till of late years, was

There the boll is only 40 ftones. Within thefe few 
years, however, a moft unaccountable dearth and fcarcity 
of coal has taken place in this corner, as well as in other 
parts of the country: But it is to be hoped, that the 
late act. of parliament, taking off the duty coaftwife 
will, in time, help to remove this hardftup, by introdu-

by the fea, which feparates it from the ifland of Arran, 
fuppofed to be from 5 to 6 leagues over. The parifh is 
divided by a fmall water that runs paft the church, on 
theS. fide of it, into Lochfine, into 2 unequal parts. The 
fouthern divilion is called Kerriff or Kerry, which is a 
Qaelic word, that fignifies a quarter or fourth part of

*on, and the church Ending upon it, the whole pari* 
often goes b 7 the name of the parifh of the Kerry! and 
* fully as well known i n tne neighbourhood by that 
name, as by lt3 real one, but it is never written fo. 
The northern divifion is called Otter, which is alf 0 a 
Gaelic word defcriptive of a fallow place, over which 
runs a gentle current ; and accordingly this divifion of 
the parifh is fo called from a moft beautiful fand bank 
.which juts out into Lochfine, in a ferpentine form, near 
the feat of Mr. Campbell of Otter, proprietor of the 
/hole divifion but one farm. This bank is 1800 yards 
long, from water-mark to its remote!! extremity at low 
water, and forms, with the land on the S. fide, an oblique 
and on the N , an obtufe angle. In time of fpring tides 
it is entirely covered at high-water, and about 3 hours 
after the turn of the tide, the whole appears to within 
a few yards of its extremity j and from its length, nar- 
rownefs, and form, makes a very uncommon and plea- 
fant appearance. It feems to be an encroachment of the 
fea upon the land, which, from its nature, could give 
it little oppofition, being low, level, and channelly. On 
the N. fide of the bank, where feems to have been the 
ancient channel of the loch, the water is very deep : on 
the S. fide, where, according to conjecture, the furface 
has been peeled off by the united force of ftorms, and a 
ftrong current, it is very mallow ; ebbs a great way out 
in time of fpring tides, and gives opportunity to the in- 
habitants in the neighbourhood to gather oyfters, fpout 
fifli, mmTels, and other various kinds of fhell fifh, which 
are there to be found in great perfection and abun- 
dance,

Soil and Surface.— Any variety that is to be found in 
the foil of this parifli, is evidently the natural confe- 
quence of different fituations. In fome few flats, out of 
the reach of running waters, and not far diftant from 
the fea, yet fo far as not to have ever been overflown by 
it, is to be feen a fine black mould lying upon a gravel 
bed, not deep, but abundantly fertile, and when pro- 
perly laid out, produces excellent grafs. In force low 
flats, near the level of the fea, and in all flat valley.", 
where running waters have, in the progrefs of time, 
traverfed the ground by fliifting their courfe (which 
in this country they continually do where they run 
through arable land), the foil is light and channelly, re- 
quires manure very frequently, but gives a fure and 
fertile, though not a very heavy crop. Near the S. 
point of the parifli is to be found, in a few places, a 
thin ftratum of black clay covering a gravelly bottom., 
and gives a crop light or heavy, according as it is deep 
and dry, or light and four, but never ripens early. All 
the inland farms are cold and bleak, not fo fit either for 
pafturage or tillage as thofe upon the coaft. The crops 
upon them are generally as heavy, but not near fo fer- 
tile, and are always confiderably later in ripening than 
thofe upon the low grounds. All ground upon a decli- 
vity (or what is commonly called hanging ground), is 
very poor foil, the fubftance being waflied out of it by 
the rains. 

The furface is rugged, and the fliore equally fo, being 
all rocky, a few bays excepted ; yet it produces little 
fea-weed for kelp. The only kelp which the prefent. 
incumbent ever heard of being made in the parifh, is a 
little that is yearly manufactured about the S. point,

Hills, Lakes  Rivers, Woods, &amp;c. ~r Although there 
are many hills in this parim, there are none of remark- 
able height ; the moft confiderable are thofe which di- 
vide this from the parifh of Glendarual. They are all 
mofly, and eonfequently barren. Heath and fog being 
their principal produce, is, in general, withered and 
weather-beaten. The moll of them, however, produce 
one fpecies of grafs, though not in great abundance, 
which is very ufeful for cattle in the latter end of the 
feafon, particularly in fpring, when provender generally 
turns fcarce ; I mean moor- bent, which is fo hard and 
durable in its nature, that the fevereft winter has fcarce- 
ly any other effe£t upon it, than to difcolour it a little. 
Sheep are very fond of it in fpring, and efpecially win- 
terers, that is, cattle which are not houfed at all, but 
are fed without in clofes all the feafon over ; and it is 
fuppofed to give them ftrength and vigour, fooner than, 
the finell grafs upon the low ground. 

There are feveral fmall lakes, the largeft of them not 
much exceeding half a mile long ; and all abound in yel- 
low trout of no great fize. There are 4 waters, and as 
many beautiful bays ; but thofe to which nature feems 
to have been moft partial, are the bays of Kilfinan and 
Achlick, more efpecially the former, fuppofed by many 
to be one of the prettieft lituations upon Lochfine. Up- 
on thefe waters, there is, in times of rain, plenty of 
yellow trout, weighing from 1 to 6 lb. weight. It is 
faid, that, fome years ago, falmon of 16 lb. weight was 
often killed upon the waters of Kilfinan, and grilfe very 
frequently, i. e. falmon that is fuppofed to want a year

kinds have been feen upon it of late years, however j 
at leaft for 12 years paft, fo far as w« could hear of: 
and what made them difappear, or makes them fo my 
as to forfake their ufual haunt; we are not able to ac- 
count for; unlefs it be, that the ancient art of exagger- 
ating is lofmg ground, and not to be found in fuch per- 
fed ion now a-days, among the rifing generation, as it 
was poffeffed by their fathers. 

There is a confiderable quantity of natural woods in 
the parifli. They confift moftly of oak, afh, birch, el- 
der, hazle, &amp;x. But the natural plant of the foil feems 
to be afh } for both the planted and the fpontaneous 
growth of it comes to a degree of perfection and lize, 
that no other tree does ; and its quality is, by thofe who 
manufacture it in towns for the purpofes of fine work- 
man (hip, allowed to be fuperior to any thing of the kind 
that grows in the Low Gountry. This,- however, may 
be a fign of the poverty of the foil, and the coldnefs of; 
the climate ; it being a well known fa£t, that flow growth 
makes timber fine in the reed, and hard and durable in its 
nature. In the interior part of the parifh, plantations 
thrive pretty well, and alfo in the N. diftricl: of it, 
which lies upon Lochfine ; as appears' by that beautiful 
grove which furrounds the manfion-houfe of Mr. Camp- 
bell of Otter : but, on the S. point of the parifh, where 
the experiment has been of late fairly tried by Mr* 
Lamont of Lamont, they do not pf omife fo well, owing** 
no doubt, tO the faline drift that is conveyed by the

cially for feveral years pail. This, we believe, is ow- 
ing to the high hills of Arran, thofe of Sliabh Goil, and 
many others, with which we are furrounded,. although 
at fome diftan.ee, which break the clouds, and bring 
down the rain upon us. Thefe rains generally come 
with a S. wind, a S. E., or a S. W. wind. With a W. 
wind, we have generally heavy and frequent fliowers 
but no conftant rain. An eafterly wind is generally 
dry, and fo is a northerly ; and it is rare to fee any rain 
'at all with a N. E. wind. The rains often fall very co- 
pioufly in the months of Auguft and September, and do 
material injury to our crops, which eonlift moflly in 
oats, barley, hay, and potatoes *. 

Injlances" 

* Few epidemieal difeafcs are known among ns, excepting the fmall- 
pox, mealies, and hooping cough. Fevers were, fome time ago, very 
frequent and mortal in this pariflr, but much lefs fo for feveral years paft. 
The happy caufe of this feems to be, that the people have, in a great 
meafurc, difcontinued the foolifh practice of vifiting the fick in great 
crowds, efnecially upon Sundays, which, in the baft age, was, in this 
country, confideredas the particular bufinefs of the day. The intention, 
310 doubt, was good, it being their defign to adminifter comfort to the 
diftreiTed ; but, inftead of [alleviating, they feldom failed to add to his 
fufferings : by thronging the boufe, and corrupting the air, they fed the 
diforder, and weakened the patient : And what was alfo very natural to 
look for, when they retired, it frequently happened, that fome of the 
company carried the contagion along with them. In thofe days, th« 
univeifal_belief of the lower ranks of people, appears to have been, that 
there was a fatality in all circumftarrces in life, that the rr.oft trivial cir- 
cumftances had been foreordained, and that confequently, no perfon 
could either accelerate,- or efcape his fated death. In proportion as they 
have dropped that id a, and begin to be fenfiMe, that man is l^ft, at leaft 
in many things, to the freedom of his own will, and that, as a free agent,

Jnjlances of Longevity '.-Few inflances cf longevity 
are recorded in this parilh; but this cannot be attribut- 
ed to the climate, which is abundantly wholefome. It 
requires no great penetration, however, to find out, at 
leaft a very fuppofable caufe, which is, that the laft ge- 
neration have been exceedingly addided to drinking, 
owing to their having carried on a ruinous contraband 
trade with the Ifle of Man, to an aftoniihing extent ; the 
bad effeds of which are difcoverable in the parilh to. 
this day. It was only in the fouthern diftrid of the pa- 
rifli, viz. the Kerry, that this trade was carried on, an4 
confequently they were then more wealthy, in general, 
than their neighbours in the northern divifioiij but

multiplying his misfortunes, they become more cautious in approaching 
any contagion which feems to them to be connected with danger. 

In the courfe of 40 years bade, epidemical ftiches made their appear- 
ance 3 feveral times in the parilh, and carried off a great number d 
people. The fecond vifit of this diforder, was about the year 177a, and 
was very general and deadly over the whole country. The laft was ia 
the year 1784, when the diforder entered at the north end of the parilh ; 
and being very mortal, continued its progrefs through almoft every farm 
of that divifion, called Otter, but did net crofs the water at Kilfinan. Bv 
all accounts, the diforder was exactly the fame at both thefe laft periods, 
and was fo very violent, that, in general, the patient was either carried 
off, or recovered within 48 hours, after his being feized. People of a 
plethoric habit, and efpecially y^ung people, were moft frequently at- 
tacked. 

The bleffed difovery of inoculation has been early pra&amp;ifed in this pa- 
rilh, and, at all time*, with great fuccei's; yet, it is much to be regret- 
ted, that few of the lower ranks can be perfuaded to take the benefit of 
it. From 3 to 7 years is generally the longeft interval between the vifits 
of the roeaflcs in this parilh. The laft was in the year 1789, when a 
very remarkable circumftance attended it ; upwards of 30 adult people, 
BialcS and females, from 20 to C)o vears of age, have been feizecl with the 
diforder, while the greatcft number of the young children have efcaped a 
fome of them even in the very houfes, and lying ia the bofoiu of thciJ? 
parents when confined.

fince that period, of the inhabitants of the Kerry, the 
greateft number have been bankrupt by misfortunes ; 
others, by the habits they acquired, came to poverty ; 
and being obliged to quit their farms, are fucceeded by 
a complete fet of new tenants from the neighbouring pa- 
rimes ; while the moll of the inhabitants of the northern 
^ivifion, occupy the fame lands upon which their forefh- 
,thers lived comfortably for many generations before them. 

A few inftances of longevity, however, might be men- 
tioned : Archibald M'Laughlane, a native of Otter, and 
who died in the Kerry, near 30 years ago, was 118 years 
of age; and in the harveft immediately before he died, was 
reckoned the bell hay cutter upon the farm of Kiliinan, 
of which he ©ccupied a part. When young, he was a 
manoffuch known bodily ftrength, that, although he 
v was not quarrelfome himfelf, whenever a fquabble en- 
fued near him, which at that time was frequently the 
cafe in the churchyard of Kilfinan, at marriages and fu- 
nerals, whenever he got notice, he immediately re- 
paired to the fpot, and his prefence never failed to 
jtlrike fuch terror, that both parties were very glad tQ 
ceafe from the ftrife. On this account, he was often 
called, as a by-name, Craobh na fiochaidh, i. e. the 
peace-maker. Donald M'lntyre, who died in Novem- 
ber 1792, was a native of the parilh of Dalayich, in the 
prefbytery of Lorn, and 96 years of age ; and although 
he had no education, was a very intelligent convertible 
man, of uncommon memory, knew more of the hiftory 
pf Scotland, than many who had a regular education; 
could repeat a very great number of the poems of Offian, 
JJllin, Oran, with a great part of the hiftory of thofe he- 
roes very corrcaiy. He retained his faculties unim- 
paired, till the very laft : and, within 6 days before he 

died, declared, he never was confined for half an hour

^arch for which his family feat, the caftle of Towart, 
was taken and deftroyed by the Marquis of Argyll . 

Mode of Cultivation.-^ tenants in this parifh are 
fo much attached to the ancient mode of cultivation, 
that modern improvements in hu&amp;andry can fcareely be 
feid to have found their way to our latitude. The foil 
-fe^ms much better calculated for pafturage than tillage : 
■Hence it is the intereft of the tenant to plough his ground 
very fparingly ; and yet, in general, they adopt juft the 
oopofite rule, for without allowing it time enough to re- 
cover itfelf after much fatigue, they always plough more 
thau double the quantity they are able properly to ma- 
nure. Few of the tenants, indeed, underftand farming,

•1 here is plenty of excellent limeltone in the parilh, and 
convenient enough for the moft of them ; yet it is rare 
to fee a kiln burnt for the ufe of the ground. It may be 
faid indeed, that the inconveniencv of peats, and the op- 
preffive tax, until of late, upon coals, i s the caufe 
of this ; but allowing ,this to be a good reafon, why 
is not every farm covered with fhell-fand, which i s 
found upon the coaft in great abundance, and of the very 
beft quality ? AH the farmers in the pariOi allow it to 
be far preferable to lime, yet very few make ufe of it. 
The very fea-weed, which is thrown in by the norm 
upon the more, is often allowed to rot, where the tide 
has left it, although it is found to be as good manure for 
barley, as any that can be made ufe of. Of late years, 
indeed, there is one kind of improvement begun, and likel 
ly to become very general ; I mean, reducing the number 
of horfes in their ploughs, and ufing carts inftead of 
cars. Formerly they had 4 horfes in each plough, the 
moft of them now plough by 3, and many by 2 ; and it 
is certain, befides the faving, that the ploughing is 
much better than it ufed to be. The only green crops 
that are r&amp;ifed in the parifh, are a few peafe, and pota- 
toes in abundance. Summer fallowing is entirely un- 
known to them. As to thefe matters, it is thought they 
judge very right, for the foil is fo weak, as not to bear 
fui iimer fallowing, and the climate is no way favourable 
to green crops. The only trial that is known to have 
been made of railing wheat, was by Mr. Lamont of 
Lamont, who fowed about 3 firlots thefe two laft feafons 
part, and it anfwered pretty well. There is not the 
imalleft reafon to doubt, that in many parts in this pa-

rift, the foil is capable of carrying wheat, if we knew 
how to prepare the ground. 

Implements of Hujhandry. — The Scotch plough is moft- 
lj ufed in this parifh, and, in fome few places, mult con- 
tinue to be ufed, where the ground happens to be very 
unlevel, and full of large ftones under the furface. The- 
tenants have no idea of the advantage of clearing away 
thefe Hones out of their ground ; nay, fome of them af- 
fert, that there is an advantage in having them in it, be- 
caufe thsy give heat to the ground, and fo contribute to= 
manure it. Theychoofe, therefore, to run the rilk of break- 
ing their ploughs feveral times in a feafon, and have the toil 
of digging yearly about a Hone, where their plough does 
not reach, rather than remove it once for all, which, in 
raofl cafes, would not be a very laborious operation. A 
few, however, make ufe of the Englifh plough ; and it is 
to be hoped, that the reft will foon follow their example. 
It is, indeed, farprifing, that any farmer mould want it,- 
as it is plain to a demonftration, that it lays the ground 
infinitely better, and ploughs with much more eafe to 
man and horfe, than what the Scotch plough does ; and 
the greateft part by far of the ground in this parifh, is 
fo fmooth and level, that it fuits it extremely well *. 

Manures j 

* Until of late, all the peats, manure, corn, Sec. were carried upon 
cars or fledges, but now inoft of thofe who can afford it, have got carts, 
although, indeed, few have got cart roads to the peats. Thefe are upon 
the whole, however, a great improvement, and one principal caufe of 
their being able to reduce the number «f their horfes.

Manures, ObJIachs to Improvement, &amp;c The prin- 
cipal part of the manure that is made ufe of in the pa*, 
rifti, is what comes from the bjre and liable, and is of 
various kinds, as all the cattle are houfed, fummer and 
winter, excepting with a few graziers and fhepherds*, 
who never houfe any but their milch cows, and in winter 
their work horfes. The fummer dung, the farmers ge- 
nerally mix in Auguft, with fome rich earth, or mofs, 
and perhaps a few ferns, and, where it may be conve- 
niently had, fome fea-weed ; and laying thefe ingredi- 
ents -upon one another* ftratum above ftratum, each in 
its turn, they make up a mound which forms a compoft' 
midding or dunghill. Tn November, this compofition is 
carted away to fome ley ground, which is ploughed in 
January or February, and a fecond time in May ; and 
being fown with barley, produces a good crop. A]l 
the reft of the dung gathered throughout the year,' 
is divided between bear land and potatoes ; which laftv 
article is generally a fure crop in this country, and, to- 
gether with a ftore of herrings, which they provide in 
harveft, k the principal part of the people's fubfiftence 
throughout the year. The potatoes here are thought to 
be of a fuperior quality to thofe which grow in the Low 
Country, efpecially fuch as are to be feen about towns. 
It is difficult to fay, whether the poverty of the- tenants, 
the fhortnefs of their leafes, ignorance of farming, or a 
ftrong attachment to a fea-faring life, particularly to the 
herring fifning trade, operate moft powerfully to the de-. 
friment of agriculture. But one thing is evident, that all 
thefe caufes contribute, each of them their mare, to produce 
this bad effeft ; and they are all the natural conference 
of one caufe, viz. a vain attempt of rrafping, at the fame 
time, at the profits of hulbandry, and the gains of a fea- 

farirfg

Siring trade. It is afferted by the farmers, that, with- 
out the money they make by fifliing, and other fliifts,' 
they would not be able to pay the rent of their lands ; 
that the produce of the farms is not nearly equal to the 
purpofe. This may, indeed, be true, in the way they 
manage them ; for, having two objeas in view, they are 
not able to pay proper attention to either ; confequently 
neither the one nor the other fucceeds with them ac- 
cording to expectation ; but it is equally certain, were 
they to apply totally to either, whether farming or fifli- 
ing be their choice, that they would fucceed' better. 
Experience proves the fact : for all thofe who attend 
properly to their farms, and depend upon them alone for 
livelihood, are the moft wealthy tenants in the parifli. 
The tenants, in general, are poor; and the principal 
caufes of their poverty, befides thofe that have been 
mentioned, are, ift, That too many families are often 
crowded into one fmall farm, and poffefs it in common ; 
2dlv, That they generally overftock their farms ; i. e. 
they keep upon a farm a great many more cattle than it 
is well able to fupport, which is a very common, and a 
very great error ; for it reduces the breed to a diminu- 
tive fize ; and, being ill fed, they are, in a manner, ufe- 
lefs to the proprietors ; 3dly, They plough much more 
of their ground than they are able properly to manure. 
It is not at all rare to fee 5 or 6 tenants living upon the 
fame fmall farm, and pone fling it in the old mode of 
run-ridge ; each of thefe keeps a cottager ; and there are, 
perhaps, as many other fmall tenants, who have each a 
few acres of arable land, with grafs for 2, 3, or 4 cows, 
cut out for himfelf, without any enclofure but a nomi- 
nal line of march drawn between himfelf and the reft of 
the farm ; and thefe fmall farms, fo cut off, are here 
Vol. XIV.* H h called 



2 4 2 Statlftical Account 

called butts ; in other places, they are termed crofts.- 
Thus, very commonly from 8 to 1 5 families live upon* 
one fmall farm, fo that they muft, by confequWe, live 
very poorly themfelves, although they pay but a very 
moderate rent to the landlord. The landlords, however, 
ieem now clear to adopt a very different mode of letting 
their lands, which is, to conjoin 2 or 3 farms together,, 
and let them as one poffefTion to one tenant ; by which 
means, they will receive a much greater rent, and the te- 
nants will live more comfortably. Although the genera- 
lity of tenants are thus fmall, yet there is in the parifh 

1 tenant who pofTeffes 3 farms, 2 who poffefs 1 each, and 

2 who poffefs 2 each. 

Seed 'Time and Hqj-vejt, See. — The farmers begin to fow 
oats in this parifh in the beginning of April. When 
they have done with their oats, which is generally be- 
fore the end of the month, they begin to plant their po- 
tatoes ; and as this is an operation that feldom confumes 
much time, for they are all planted with the plough, 
they begin the fowing of barley in the beginning of May, 
and it is always the end of that month, or perhaps the 
beginning of June, before they have done. Next comes 
on the making of peats, which, together with leading 
the fame, (a very troublefome and tedious job), con- 
fumes the moft of the remaining part of fummer. Bar- 
ley harveft commonly begins about the middle of Au- 
guft, and oats are moftly cut in September and Octo- 
ber. In wet late feafons, the harveft may not perhaps 
be entirely finiftied until the 1 2th of November. In the 
year 1787, it was ftill later. The foil of this parifh, as 
well as that of Glendarual, feems peculiarly adapted for 
producing flax; and the farmers alfo feem inclined to •

«ay fome attention to the raifmg of fuch a crop, but are 
difcouraged from it, for the want of a lint-mill. Befides 
this, fome of the proprietors reftrid their tenants to a 
fmall quantity ; as they think (and I believe juftly) 
that flax, more than any other crop, fcourges the ground. 

The average produce of oats is thought rather better 
ihan 3 feeds, but not equal to 4.

siderable augmentation is expected. 

Prices of Grain and Prcvifions. — The prices of all 
kinds of grain are, in this parifh, at all times ruled by 
the prices in Greenock, one of the dearefl markets in 
the weft of Scotland. The price of oat meal is feldom 
below 13s. 4d. Sterling, or above one guinea the boll. 
The barley is moftly fold to the diftiller to be manufac- 
tured into whilky, and brings generally, in the Kerry 
or S. divifion, from 19s. to 21s. Sterling; and in- Otter, 
from 20s. to 24s. the boll. In the Kerry, the grain is 

H h 2 inferior^

inferior, and the meafure lefs than that of Otter. I 
the Kerry the Bute meafure is made ufe of, and in Otter 
the Kintyre or Campbelton meafure. The one is to the 
other as 17 to 1 6, i. e. the 16 pecks in Otter are equal 
to 17 pecks in Kerry ; and the 3 firlots, or 12 pecks, in 
Otter, are equal to the Linlithgow boll *. 

Ma:iufaBure 

.* The parifh was very feldom, if ever, known to produce grain ful"- 
ficient for its own confumption ; but as the quantity imported yearly 
mufk neceffarily differ, in proportion to the favourablenefs or unfavour- 
aMcnefs of the fea.fon, and the fertility of the crops, it is impoffible to 
fay, with accuracy, what the real amount of the imported grain may be, 
much lefs to guefs at the average. In feme remarkable good ftafons, 
very little is required ; in very bad ones, a great deal is neceffary. The 
deficiency is fupplied by Irifh meal, imported firft to Clyde, and from 
thence by the packets to this parifti, or by Dumfries meal carried coaft- 
wife to the fame place, and by the conveyance above mentioned, hither. 
Thefe packets, which go irregularly from this pariih to Greenock, are, 
upon the whole,' much againft the intereft of the country. In the firft 
place, they are a temptation to all ranks arid degrees of people, to pur- 
chafe many ufelefs articles, which they could very conveniently difpenfe 
with ; and thus they are daily draining the country of its cafh. In the 
next place, they are the means of railing the price of every article for the 
ufe of the table, fuch as veal, lamb, hens, eggs, &amp;cj, all which things 
are fent from here to Greenock, being always a high and ready market. 
This is particularly againft tradefmen, and all others whofa tables 
depend entirely up«n the market*, having no farms of iheir own 
fupply them, To difpofe of thefe articles is a fufficient excufe, and . 
the conveniency of the packet a ftroog enough inducement to a num- 
ber of young perfons of too much curiofity to pay frequent vifits to 
Greenock and Port-Glafgow, idle away their time, fometimes fall int6 
bad company, and often fpend more money before they return, than the 
value of the cargo they carried abroad with them. At beft, they do but 
exchange the ufeful commodities they had to difpofe of for things trifling 
and fuperfluous, which ferve to keep up the extravagance of dreff, and 
are of no real advantage. Had the parifh been, indeed, a place of trade, 
or manufacture, packets would certainly be ufeful, and even neceffary; 
"but- this not being the cafe, neither likely to be fo, either lefs or more^ 
it is difficult to fay what good end they ferve ; and their hurt to the 
country is vifible in many refpecls.

ManufaBure and Ffoeries. -There is a Cmall 
tity of kelp made yearly in the S. end of the parim, 
upon the eftate, and near the feat of the famdy of La- 
ment of Lament, for which the proprietor gets a year- 
ly rent. Few hands are employed to make fo fmall a 
quantity. The herring-nming takes up a great part of 
the time, and employs almoft all the young men, and 
many of the married men, in this parifh, during the fea- 
fon of it ; which commonly begins in July and end. 
about Chriftmas. There are 21 open boats belonging 
to the parifli, each manned with 4 hands, and constant- 
ly employed in catching herrings, in Lochfine, on the 
E. coafl: of Kintyre, or the coafl of Arran, in Clyde, 
Lochlong, or wherever elfe they may appear upon the 
coafl ; and for feveral feafons pall have been pretty fuc- 
cefsful. Their common haunt is the E. coafl of Kin- 
tyre and Lochfine, but they are to be found occafionally in 
the other lochs mentioned. They generally make in a 
feafon from 50I. to 100I. each boat ; and fome of the moll 
fuccefsful ones, perhaps, above 120I. ; fo that they have

Wages and Price of Labour ,— Servants wages are high. A man fervant 
gets from 7,1 10 s. to 4I. 4 s. in the half year, with victuals and faces. 
A maid fervant from jl. Is. to zl. 2s., with victuals, fhoes, and fome 
other perquifites, the half year. A day-labourer gets frem 6 d. to 8d., 
with victuals, the day ; from I s, to 14 d., without victuals. A woman 
working by the day gets from 4d. to 6d. and victuals, and from 6d. 
to 8d. without vi&amp;uals. A tailor gets 8d. the day, with victuals; a 
fhoemaker 8d. for the pair fhoes, and visuals; a wright is. and vic- 
tuals ; a carpenter and a fawer the fame. "Weavers, as in all other places, 
arc paid by the yard, and according to the finenefs of the cloth. Befideti 
wages being fo high, labourers are remarkably fcarce, efpccially in har- 
veft ; and this is owing to the hcrring-fifliing, which is at that feafon at 
its height, and which the people here always prefer to any other kind 
of work, being lefs toil, and more gain — Services are not abolifhed 
in the parifh by any of the rtfiding heritors. They are feldom, how- 
ever, exacted with fuch rigour as to do material injury to the tenants.

from icl. to 24I. to the mare, the boat having an equal 
dividend with each of the hands. Thefe are only the 
moll fuccefsful, and who attend the Timing clofely from 
the beginning to the end of the feafon. There are 
many others who follow the trade., but having alfo a 
fmall mare of a farm or a butt, give only a partial 
attendance ; and the mares of thefe are generally found 
at the end of the feafon to be very inconfiderable. Be- 
fides the number of Hands thus employed at home in 
this trade, there is a great number, of both married and 
unmarried men, who go to the North Highlands aboard 
of the bounty veffels, and their wages in general are 
from il. 5s. to %h 16s. a month, with a barrel or half 
a barrel of herrings, according to the time they are out. 
The veffels they go aboard of, are thofe which fail from 
Greenock, Port-Glafgow, and Rothfay. 

Inns. — There are 1 1 inns or public-houfes in the pa- 
rim. Two of them are Hated, but all of them in very 
bad repair, and fo exceedingly ill kept, that a traveller 
can fcarcely get a decent bed, or a comfortable break- 
fall, in the bell of them. 



Roads and Bridges — There are only 3 fmall bridges 
In the parifli, and the roads are exceeding bad ; notwith- 
ftanding a good deal of money has been from time to 
time expended upon them, they are in fome places even 
impaflable. This is partly owing to the very great 
length of the line, and the extreme difficulty of making 
it, and partly to the employing hitherto of country 
people for making them, who did not underlland the 
foulinefs. By thefe ignorant undertakers, a great deal 
has been blocked out, and no part properly finilhed ;

and when thofe parts which were thought to be made, 
were negleded for a few years, and allowed to fall into 
difrepair, they became the worft of the whole, at lean, 
fofter than what has remained untouched. The lengtl 
of the principal line, from the public road at the head 
of Lochfine, to the S. point of this parifli at Aird La- 
mont, may, at a moderate computation, be reckoned 
above 40 miles. Of that more than the half is now 
completely finimed through the pariih of Kilmorich and 
the united parimes of Strachur and Stralachlan, and 
they are now working towards the borders of this 
pariih 5 as there is a proper undertaker now em- 
ployed, we hope the remaining part will be finimecl 
next feafon* It is alfo intended to look out for an un- 
dertaker to contract for the bridges, which will be many 
m number, but none of any great fize ; without which 
the roads, however good, would be entirely ufelefs, as 
there are many fmall waters impaffable to wheeled ma- 
chines. Befides this great line, there is another crofs 
road through this pariih, which is now nearly finifhed. 
It comes off from the great line from Inverary to 
Campbeltown near Lochgilphead,, crones Lochfine at the 
ferry of Otter, traverfes this pariih near the N. end - 7 
that of Glendarual at the low or S. part of it ; enters 
the pariih of Inverchaolan at Lochftravon-head, and 
comes to the Clyde at Dunoon, a village on the Cowal 
fide, about 6 miles from Greenock. 

Harbours. — There are no real harbours on the coait 
of this pariih. The befl anchorage places are in the 
Kyles of Bute, which, as was already obferved, is a 
narrow found that divides this pariih from that ifland. 
In a variety of places upon either fide of that found, a.

veflel of almoft any burden may ride fafe enough at an~* 
chor from any wind that blows. There is pretty good 
anchorage alfo at the ferry of Otter, already mentioned, 
, although not fo well fheltered as the Kyles of Bute. 

Ferries. — There are 3 ferries ; one, already mention- 
ed, at Otter, near the N. end of the parifh, acrofs Loch- 
fine to the parifh of Kilmichael, in the diftricl: of Argyll. 
At this ferry, the loch is fuppofed to be near a league 
broad, and the fare is 3d. Sterling each man ; gd. each 
horfe. It is badly attended on either fide as to hands and 
boats ; and at the inns very ordinary accommodation is to 
be had, when the traveller happens to be ftorm-ftaid. This 
is very furprifing, and much to be regretted, as it is 
very much frequented, being on the very public line of 
road from all that part of Argyllfhire lying on the N. 
W. fide of Loehfine, to Cowal, Greenock, Port-Glafgow, 
and all the adjacent parts of the Low Country. The 
other 2 ferries, are one from Bute to this parifh, acrofs the 
Kyles, and the other from this parifh acrofs Loehfine on 
the line of road from Rothfay, in Bute, to Tarbert, a 
village on the W. of Loehfine, about half way from In- 
verary to Campb'leton. This line is not near fo pub- 
blick as that through the N. end of the parifh ; and the 
ftate of the ferries is much the fame, only the houfes 
are rather worfe. 

Church, Stipend, &amp;c— The church was repaired, or al- 
moft rebuilt in the- year 1759, and is now little more than 
half-feated ; but had it been entirely and properly finifli- 
ed within, it would only accommodate two-thirds of the 
congregation, even in fummer, when they come out in 
the-greateft numbers. In winter there is room enough,'

fis it is, for all that can attend ; owing to the parifh be- 
ing lb' long and narrow, and the roads fo bad, all the 
people in the extremities, and the old and feeble through- 
out the whole, muft be content to ftay at home. When 
we confider, that, fome time ago, the parifti was much 
more populous, and the church fcarcely fo well feated, 
it is difficult to guefs how the congregation could be at 
all accommodated ; unlefs we fuppofe, they did not then 
affemble fo regularly as now. Indeed, if we judge from 
the proportion which thecolkaions of thefe times bear 
to thofe of our own time, it favours much the fuppo- 
fition ; befides that we have the teftimony of many old 
men to confirm the fame. The church ftands in need 
now of a fecond repair, which it is to be hoped it will 
foon have. The living is 5 chalders oat meal, Dutch 
weight, 8 ftone to the boll ; 1 chalder barley, Linlith- 
gow meafure; with 27I. 15s. 844. Sterling in money, 
including the allowance for communion elements. Mr. 
Lamont of Lamont is patron. The manfe was built in 
the year 1746, and has never been a fufficient houfe. 
It has got a partial repair in the year 1781, and ftands. 
now very much in need of another ; although it is to 
be hoped the heritors will rather build a new one, than 
repair fo bad a houfe. The glebe, including the garden, 
area of the manfe and office-houfes, is 3 acres, 1 roods, 
and 12 perches. Three-fourths of an acre of that are 
mofs, which the prefent incumbent has attempted to 
drain and improve at confiderable expenfe, but which 
he defpairs of ever feeing arable *.

Poor and Schools— The number of poor upon the fefci 
fion-roll at prefent is 29. But there are a great many 
others, who, although they are not confidered fo very 
indigent as to have a claim upon the funds, yet go about 
begging among the tenants as often as the reft, and arc 
as liberally fupplied. The only permanent fund in the 
parifti, for their fupply, is ics. Sterling, being the year- 
ly interell of money mortified for their behoof, in the 
y.^ar 1737, by a Mr. Lamont of Kilfinan, who granted 
his bond to the feflion for payment of the above fum, 
yearly, in all time coming ; together with the various 
colleftions made at church on Sundays, at marriages and 
baptifms, with fmall dues for proclamations, fornication 
fines, and fees paid for the mort-cloth. But their prin- 
cipal fupport is begging : and if the late excellent re- 
gulation that required all poor to keep within their 
own pariflies, had been properly adhered to, and Itran- 
gers kept off, our own poor might be tolerably well pro- 
vided for. The funds have been hitherto in the ma- 
nagement of the feflion ; but it is uncertain how long 
they will continue fo, as the feflion teems now very 
defirous to devolve this trouble upon the heritors ; which 
is indeed but reafonable, as they are the perfons who 
are liable for the maintenance of the poor *.

dental misfortunes happening to any of them, that might difable them 
from going about in queft of fubfiftence, they are confidered of from time 
to time, the treafurer being appointed to give them fuch fmall donations, 
as will be a temporary relief ; and the expenfes of their funeral, to* 
certain extent, are always defrayed out of the funds, when they happen 
to die without leaving a fubjecT: of their own adequate to the purpofe. 
The pref'ent incumbent, foon after his admiffion, obferving there was 
very little cafh in the treafury, and confidering, that 10 s., with any 
collections, &amp;c. that could be expected, was too precarious a fund for 
fuch a number of poor as the roll exhibited, fuggefted to the feflion a 
plan of augmenting the trifling fum which they then had in the trea- 
fary, by fuch yearly favings as might be found convenient, until the 
capital ftould amountto 100I. The feffion having readily adopted this plan, 
the obje&amp; is now nearly accom.plifaed ; and, after the firft general meeting 
of the feffion, the poor may receive near double the fum they were in 
ufe of getting. Thefe favings were made only in good and plentiful 
feafons ; and when there happens a fcarcity, or when the price of meal 
is very high, as it is this prefent year, there is a meeting extraordinary 
held to diftribute among the poor according to their need.

For the fummer ditto, 28 ditto. 

In fummer laft, viz. in i793 there have been only 4 fcholars. 
There is another fchool that has been planted in the parifh feveral 
yeras ago, by the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge ; but as

1793 fouls. The prefent incumbent could find no re- 
cord in the parifh to mow its ancient ftate of population 
at any period whatever ; not even a catalogue either of 
communicants or examinable perfons *. It is certain, 
however, from the teftimony of people now living, that 
the parifh. has been more populous than it now is. The 
evident caufes of its decreafe, in point , of population, 
are, The introduction of pafturage, inftead of farming, 
and conjoining 2 or 3 farms together into one pof- 
feffion. By this union of farms, there are pofTeffions in 
the parifh whereon refided formerly from 12 to 16 fa- 
milies, now inhabited only by 1 or 2. The fmuggling 
bufinefs being at an end, contributed alfo to depopulate 
this parifh ; the moft of thofe who dealt in it being 
bankrupt, were obliged to leave the place in order to 
pufh their fortune fomewhere elfe. 

If the prices of cattle had continued as high as they 
have been for fome years pari, there is reafon to be- 
lieve, that the whole of this parifh would foon be con- 
verted into fuck paftures as thofe above mentioned ; but 
the prices having this year fallen confiderably, and with- 
out any profpect. of riling very fuddenly, owing to the 
prefent ftagnatian in trade, and the banks having given 
up difcounting bills, it is highly probable, that the ra- 
pid progrefs of depopulation will alfo receive a propor-

flbr/fc, W, Sheep—The horfes are of various 
kinds ; fome of a Low Country breed, fome of - the real 
Highland kind, and many of a crofs breed between the 
two. There were fome Arabian ftone horfes brought 
to the neighbourhood, and one of them to this parifh, 
fome years ago, which hurt the breed very much ; for' 
being of a delicate kind, they do not anfwer either the 
climate or the keeping, fo well as other horfes. By far 
the greatefi number, and thofe that fuit the country 
belt, are real Highlanders ; but they are here rather 
fmaller in general than the ordinary fize, owing to the 
bad keeping. Scarcely the half of the number of horfes 
needed in the pariih are reared in it, but bought at the 
markets on the N. fide of Lochfine, by jockies, and fold 
here to the farmers. Their prices are various, from 
5I. to 15I. 

The cows are neither fo large nor fo handfome as they 
are in molt of the neighbouring parimes, efpecially on the 
N. fide of Lochfine ; and this is alfo owing to overlook- 
ing the farms, and houfing them at night : for they are 
all in the houfe at night, young and old, I mean with 
the common tenants. Some alfo keep a few Low Coun- 
try cows, believing that they give more milk ; and this 
too hurts the breed. The average value of tidy cows 
may be about 3I. 10s. ; of dry cows about 2I. 10s. 

The Iheep are almoft all of the black faced kind, and 
are rather diminutive too, owing to the fame caufe that 
was affigned for black cattle being underfized. Of them, 
however, there is not a very principal flock in the pa- 
riih, as all piftures here are mixed paftures ; the gra-

llers keeping a number of liorfes, black cattle, and 
flieep, together. The fmall white faced Highland kinds 
are all gone, which fome think is to be regretted, as 
they were undoubtedly better mutton, and their wool 
infinitely finer than that of others. They were not 
found, however, fo profitable, it feems, as they did not 
draw fuch long prices when brought to market.

Coal and Fuel. — The fuel made ufe of in this parifli 
by all the common people, and moftly by the better fort, 
is peats ; which, as they lie generally at an exceeding 
great diftance, and the roads to the mofles bad, are re- 
markably trouble fome and expend ve. The mode, of 
carrying them home is, by many, in bags in back loads, 
by fome in creels upon cars or fledges ; and by a few, 
where the ground is more level, or where the roads 
happen to be better attended to, upon carta. The mak- 
ing, preparing, and leading of thefe peats confumes the 
greateft part of the people's time in fummer ; and too 
often, in fpite of all their labour and attention, they 
lofe the moll of them, from the wetnefs of the climate, 
and the foftnefs of the roads. The lairds, and others 
who can afford it, have generally fome coals befides 
their peats, and fome burn very little but coals. Thefe 

coals 

7 



Stattftical Account 



coals are carried by water from Glafgow or Irvine ; and 
notwithftanding the freight being very high, they are 
reckoned, upon the whole, efpecially now that the duty 
is taken off them, cheaper than peats ; and it would 
undoubtedly be the intereft of the tenants, who have 
moftly boats of their own, to carry coals from Glafgow, 
rather than lofe their time, and fpoil their horfes work- 
ing at peats. The freight from Glafgow *is generally 
between 2s. and 2s. 6d. the fingle cart ; but thofe who 
take a great cargo, and employ gaberts, get them a little 
cheaper. 

Antiquities. — There is nothing remarkable of this 
kind to be feen in this parifih, excepting cairns, duns, 
and borradhs. Thefe cairns, of which there are but 
few in this parifh, are large piles of flones heaped to- 
gether, where battles are fuppofed to have been fought, 
and where heroes fell, and are buried. In many parts 
of the Highlands, where they are to be feen, tradition 
is very diftinct concerning them, and generally the name 
of the perfon or perfons put to death flicks to the cairn. 

Duns are very numerous, not only in this, but in all 
parifhes in the Highlands. They are a row of large 
flones put together, generally in a circular form, on the 
top of confpicuous hills, not far from, and always in 
' fight of one another. In this parifli, where as many of 
them are to be feen, in proportion to the extent of the 
place, as any where we know ; they are generally on 
hills of a conical figure. They are fuppofed to have 
been places for kindling fires on, for the purpofe of 
warning the country, and fummoning the people to af- 
femble for the common defence, on the fudden appear- 
ance of an enemy. 

Borra 



Of Kilfinan* 25 7 

Borra or borradh, is alfo a pile of ftones, but differs 
from a cairn in many refpefts, viz. in external figure, 
being always oblong in internal conftruftion, and in its 
fize and defign. There are 2 veftiges of them in this 
parifh, which, although they are moftly now dilapidated 
for building of houfes and walls, yet fo much remain of 
each, as to mow diftindtly what they once were. The one 
of them, which is the largeft, is about i4r mile N. from 
the parifh church, a little above the great line of road, 
on the top of an eminence, near a mofs. This immenfe 
pile of ftones was, till laft fummer, near 40 yards long, 
of confiderable breadth, and amazing depth. At the 
bottom, from the one end to the other, there was a 
number of fmall apartments or cells, end to end, each 
made up of 5 or 7 large flags. Each cell was about 6 
feet long, 4 broad ; and fuch of them as remained to be 
feen in our time, about 5 feet high. One large flag 
made up each fide ; and another, which was generally 
of a curved figure, to throw off the water, covered it for 
a roof : the en4 fometimes was made up of a, and an 
open between them wide enough for a man to fqueeze 
himfelf through : fometimes there was only 1 flag in the 
end, and only half as high as the fide flags, fo that the 
entry was over it ; and in thefe there were only 5 flags; 
They were generally built on an eminence, where the 
fall of the water was from thence on either fide ; and 
when that was not the cafe, the cells were at fome dif- 
tance from the bottom of the pile or borradh. The 
cells were not always in a ftraight line from end to end, 
but they were always fo regular, as that the fame com- 
munication pervaded the whole *.

think they were burying places for the afhes of heroes and great war-

About 3 miles S. from the church, and not far from 
the fea, is to be feen the foundation, and a fmall part 
of the wall of a chapel, furrounded by a church-yard, 
on a fmall field called Ardmarnock, i. c. St. Marnock's 
Field. In this church-yard was found, fome years ago, 
a ftone very prettily cut, and a long infcription on it, as 
the people who faw, think, in Latin : but they were fo 
fenfelefs as to make ufe of the ftone in building a houfe 
on the farm. About 300 yards above this chapel, on 
an eminence, a cell, and part of another, appears in the, 
end of a pile of Hones or borradh, exactly fimilar to, 
but much fmaller than the one I have been defcribing, 
From what remains of this cairn or borradh, it feems

riors, and human bones have been often found in them. Others believe 
them to have been concealed beds or Ikulking places for robbers and 
plunderers. The objection to this is, the confinement in fuch fmall 
apartments, and the probability of their being found out by the fmoke 
of their fire, and, in cafe of being found, the certainty of ieing put to 
death, as there could be no poffibility of efcape. Another opinion, fully 
as likely, is, that they were places of defence for herds, who were fent 
at a diftance with the cattle, for the fake of clean grafs, to defend them 
at night from wolves, and other wild beafts, which at that time over- 
ran the country. For my own part, I muft acknowledge, that I am not 
fatisfied with any of thefe conjectures, but think it much more probable, 
that they were places of concealment, not for plunderers, but for booty. 
It is a well known fait, that it was a very general cuftom among the 
inhabitants of the Highlands, and that too at no very remote period, 
that a party of one clan Ihould arm themfelves, and repair to a dif- 
tant country, plunder and carry off the effects and cattle of fome other 
clan ; and if they were fortunate enough to efcape the purfuit, and to 
bring them to their own country in fafety, they immediately flaughtcred 
them, falted them in their own hides, and concealed them the beft way 
they could. Is it not likely enough that the places above mentioned 
were contrived for this purpofe ? Indeed, any perfon who has feen 
ihem, muft, I think, allow they were as fuitable for this defign as could 
well be imagined ; for being furrounded with wood, as they all were, 
and covered over with heath or grafs, they appeared fuch a natural pre^ 
tuberance, that they could not be fufpefted as artificial

from the fample that is to be feen, were alfo fmaller 
than thofe in the other mentioned *. 

There are a few Druidical ftones to be feen in the 
parilh, with fome traces of thofe circular rings of Hones 
fuppofed to have been their places of worlhip. It is 
unneceiTary to mention, that thefe Druidical ftones are 
moftly very long, and Handing perpendicular. One of 
thofe in this parifh is among the higheft, perhaps, in 
the country; 

On a rocky point, on the cbaft of Lochfine, about a 
mile below the church, is to be feen the veftige of a. 
building called Caijleal Mhic Eolhufa, i. e. M'Ewen's 
Caftle. It was a wide, but irregular building, neither 
fquare nor circular, perhaps nearer a pentagon than any 
other plan : it does not appear td have been built with 
any kind of mortar ; but from the quantity of rubbifh, 
it muft have been of a confiderable height. This M'Ewen 
was the chief of a clan, and proprietor of the northern 
divifion of the parifh, called Otter. His poffeffion of it 
muft have been of very remote antiquity ; for there is '

* There is a tradition in the country, which has wonderfully obtained uni- 
vsrfal credit ; that the entire cell that is to be feen in this borradh was the 
place where St. Marnock ufed to mire for the purpofes of devotion, fafting, 
and pennance, and iikewife where he heard confeffions ; which very much ex- 
cited my curiofity, as well as that of many others, to fee it.. But upon vi- 
fiting the place, and viewing the cell, I could not but wonder at the unac- 
countable credulity of thofe who could believe fuch an unlikely ftory. For 
the very fize of it is fuch, that St. Marnock mud have been a very little 
man, as well as the peifon conferring, to find room in it, unlefs in a very auk- 
ward pofture. It is therefore moft likely, that the idea had been adopted from 
its vicinity to the chapel above mentioned, dedicated to St. Marnock. For my 
own part, I am much more difpofed to think, that, inftead of its being the 
cell of a faint, it is more likely to have been the den of a thief ; I mean a 
place contrived by plunderers, as I have faid above, for concealing their bootj r .

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — All the lands in this pa- 
rim are thirled to certain mills, to the extent of the 16th 
part of the oats, the nth part of the barley. They 
are alfo obliged to have their fmith-work done by cer- 
tain fmiths ; which has a bad effect, as it tends to make 
thefe tradefmen lazy and inattentive ; indifferent whe- 
ther they do their work fufficient or otherwife, being 
fure, that the people cannot employ any but themfelves. 
In the northern diftricl, they are obliged to pay full 
multure to the miller, even for the barley they fell to 
diftillers out of the parifh ; which is a very great hard- 
fhip to the farmer, when there is not one in the lands 
perhaps to buy it. There are no manufactures carried 
on in this parifh, and probably never will, on account 
of the fcarcity of the fuel, which is one of the greatefl 
difadvantages the inhabitants lie under. Another dif- 
advantage is the want of a regular poll and poft-office 
in the neighbourhood, having none nearer than Inve- 
rary, which is near 30 miles from fome parts of this 
parifh. This puts us to the expenfe of employing a 
runner once a- week ; and the neighbouring parifh of 
Glendarual is in the fame Situation. Glendarual is a 
very centrical place for a poft-office, for the whole of 
the low part of Cowal, and in the middle of a ftraight 
line of road between Inverary and Rothfay. It would 
be a very general good to plant a poft-office there, and 
the commerce between the two places could afford not 
only to pay the poft, but would probably return fome 
revenue to government.— Superftition is lofing ground

in this parifh pretty fell, although not in the fame pro- 
portion, perhaps, as it has done on the N. fi£ of Loch- 
fine We cannot afcribe this to a more likely caufe, 
than that formerly it may have prevailed more in thefe 
parts, and that the clergy have on that account though 
it neceffary to be at great pains in rooting it out. There 
is one pernicious praftice that prevails much W this 
parifh, which took its rife from this fource which ^ 
that of carrying their children out to baptifm the fir£ 
or fecond day after, birth. Many of them, although 
they had it in their option to have their children bap- 
tized in their own houfes, by waiting one day, prefer 
carrying them 7 or 8 miles to church, in the worft wea- 
ther in December or January, by which folly they ton 
often facrifice the lives of their infants to the phantom 
of fuperftition. It is not recorded, that any native of 
this parifh has been executed for any crime whatever. 
There have been 2 fuicides about 20 years ago. The 
language moft commonly fpoken in this parifh is the 
Gaelic, although not in that degree of purity and per- 
fection as on the N. fide of Lochfine. Almoft all the 
names of places are derived from it, and are, in general, 
defer iptive of their appearance and fituation. The peo- 
ple in general are of a middle ftature, rather thicker in 
proportion to their height than the inhabitants of the 
Low Country. They are more attached to a feafaring 
life than to hufbandry ; and although pretty o£ten at 
fea, they are in general fober. There is plenty of filh 
of various kinds to be found in Lochfine j fuch as cod, 
from 1 to 5 lb. weight ; whitings from 1 to 3 lb. ; had- 
dock from 1 to 4 lb. ; plenty of feath of different fizes,

tarmagan is a bird, although very tame, or rather ftu- 
pid, yet is never to be found but in very high hills, 
and where the grafs is pretty clean. He has a wonder- 
ful averfion to fheep walks. There are various kinds

Eghtful profpeft of Gordon Cattle, of the river and part 
ef Murray, of the Murray Frith, and the mountains of 
Sutherland and Caithnefs *. 

Bellie extends from S. to N., near 6 measured miles, 
and from E. to W. almoft 4. It is bounded on the N. 
fry the Murray Frith, and on the W. by the river Spey. 
A eonnderable part of this fpace, to about 4 miles from 
the fea, is contained within the ancient banks of this ri- 
ver, which are very high. What thefe banks enclofe 
may be eonndered as the range or territory of the Spey 
at this place, though it has greatly Ihified its channels 
in different periods. At Gordon cattle, which is be- 
tween them, but near that on the E., thefe banks are 
near a mile diftant from each other- They gradually 
widen in their approach to the fea, and where the river 
falls into the frith, are near 2 miles afunder, Between 
the bank on the E., and the prefent bed of Spey, is a fine 
extenfive plain, with many farms, and a great number 
of inhabitants, the river having kept near the W. fide 
for time immemorial, though it has frequently made, 
lavages,, that have rendered many embankments and 
bulwarks requifite. This bank is for about a mile be- 
low Gordon cattle, handfomely drefled in imitation of 
nature, and adorned by fine plantations of trees and 
Ihrubs, with very pleafant walks. Here is a very great 
number of large clutters of hollies, which have procured 
it the appellation of the Holly Bank, as below it. is ftyled

T will not attempt to defcribe this moft fuperb and ele-

travellers, who never fail to return highly gratified . 
Here many a coftly drain has been employed to form the

* The ancient refidence here was called Bogra-glibu, or windy bog, there being 
a very free circulation of air from the Frith and the W. ; and the ferry-boat is 
ftill the boat of Bog. This habitation was long known all over the N., by 
the name of The Bog, for an obvious reafon. Spalden, if I remember right, 
Seldom ufes any other term for it. The caftle had doubtlefs been built here 
with a view to ftrength, by ditches and inundation, when property was not

wholefome and equitable laws. I need not fay how necefiary it was in thofc

properly a plain for rendezvous or weapon-fliaw, which was often pradlifed here, 
and Aber, a bay or junction of two waters ; the burn of Fochabers here n-

Soil and Agriculture. —The 'ground, which has been 
recovered from the Spey, is, in general, by a very long 
courfe of frequent manure, and, being in fmall farms, 
abundantly fertile. We have a good deal of loamy foil. 
There is not much clay land: That upon the coaft i* 
fandy. In general, we depend very much upon the 
dews of heaven. In a droughty July, our crop near 
the fea, though promifing, dwindles amazingly. We 
enjoy, however, upon the whole, a happy climate: Our 
agricultural fyftem has nothing very different from that 
of our neighbours all around. We have very few ea- 
clofures, except at Gordon caftle, (where an extenfive 
farm is totally enclofed), and at Auchenhalrigg. We 
cannot bcaft much of our other modes of melioration, 
though we commonly do the beft we well can. The 
people are induftrious, and labour hard ; and you will 
not fee any thing like a farm, where you do not be- 
hold afield of fown grafs, apiece of turnips, and fome 
potatoes. The potatoe is much cultivated by thofe wh» 
have but fmall fpots of ground, and proves very ufeful. 
The fea-weed is much ufed as manure, to the dillance of 
3 or 3 miles along the coaft ; and no work is fuffered to 
interrupt the purfuit of it. Our crops of grain confifl 
chiefly of barley, oats, peafe, and rye *. 

There 

have three annual fairs, one of them for black cattle ; and a weekly market 
for butter and cheefe, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. but it is not much reforted to. 
There are feveral retail fliops, and an ordinary number of the ufual artificers. 
There are two goods inns, well frequented. We have a friendly fociety pretty 
numerous. Its funds are accumulating, and will, in a little time, anfwer 
yery benevolent and ufeful purpofes. 

* The average wages for common labourers are- 6 d. a-day in winter, and 8 L 
infummer. For harveft work, women receive 6d., and men iod. Acam- 
jnon artificer gets iod. or is. a-day. With thefe payments, they generally 
have their victuals. A good man fervant for the half year feldom has lefa 
than 3L, and _the women, for ths fame period, receive about aos. And 
fchcfe point at continual increafe. 



Of Bellle. 



There are in the parifli upwards of iooo black cattle^ 
moftly of the common country breed, many of which are 
fent away in the fummer to graze, pafture grafs being 
fcarce upon the coaft. We have about 346 horfes, many 
of therri rather fmall fifced* and fomething above 2200 
fteep, generally a mixture of the Linton breed. Gordon 
caftle will readily be fuppofed an exception to all thefe, 
where the cattle, horfes and fheep are large. Many 
plough with a pair of horfes. Indeed, it is the moft 
frequent practice, the ground being light and eafily ma- 
naged : Some put a yoke or two of black cattle behind 
them. There are but few ploughs, comparatively * 
drawn by oxen entirely. A cart among the country 
people may generally be reckoned for every horfe ; 
Carts drawn otherwife, are not many in comparifon. 

Manufactures and Fijherits. — One manufacturer of 
fome eminence, has long refided on the burn of Focha-* 
bers, and manages very confiderable bufinefs in weaving 
ftockings of cotton, thread, and worfted, and fome pieces 
for waiftcoats and breeches. He alfo deals a little in the 
thread trade. Another, who is alfo a merchant, carries? 
on a manufacture of lint* thread and tobacco, to fome 
amount. There is a capital falmort fifhery here upon the 
Speyj chiefly the property of the Duke of Gordon* froti\ 
which his grace derives a rent of 1500I. a-year$ from 
Mefirs. Gordon and Richardfon. It extends from Spey- 
mouth about 5 miles* and terminates in a complete row 
of cruives acrofs the riven There is a large lofty edifice 
near the fea for the gentlemen that hold the leafe. 
There are buildings for the dverfeers, coopers, &amp;c, 
and that furnifli every accommodation for the fifhery. 
They have got a very good ice-boufe* An hundred and 

L 1 2 thirty

Statiflical Account 



thirty men, or more, are employed in this fifhefy. 
There is alfo a falmon filling upon the coaft, called 
Hell filhing. Some thoufands of falmon are fent to Lon- 
don early in the feafon, covered with ice : Afterward 
they are exported in kits Iteeped in vinegar, of which 
many hogfheads are yearly laid in for the pnrpofe. Thefe 
kits contain about 36 pounds of falmon each. When the 
great city is plentifully fupplied, and the price much re- 
duced, it becomes convenient to fait the falmon, and to 
fend them fco the foreign markets. The natural effe&amp; 
of this demand, is dearth of falmon here. Indeed, the 
expenfe of living has increafed very confiderably with- 
in thefe 20 years in almoft every article. In this we 
are not lingular. 

Proprietors. — The Duke of Gordon is our only refi- 
ding heritor, and, indeed, fole proprietor of the parilh, 
except of one farm belonging to the Earl of Findlater. 

Population, &amp;c. — The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755, 
was 1730. The parilh of Bellie now contains 1919 
fouls, viz. country part 984, and the village 935. Of 
thefe, there are 859 males, and 1060 females. This 
difproportion has not been occasioned by emigration, for 
of that we have had very few inftances, but from the 
military genius exerting itfelf on particular emergen- 
cies. We have of married couples 272, and of young 
people about 10 years old, and under, 437, viz. 205 boys, 
and 232 girls. Though it be known, that a fuperior 
number of males is born into the world, thefe little 
differences will happen in particular corners, by remo- 
vals and other caufes. For 14 years paft, 10 couples, at 
3l medium, have been married yearly, and 31 children 
2 regiftered,

yegHtered, viz. 1 6 males, and 15 tad** The latter 
article cannot be exa&amp; as to the number born m the pa- 
rilh it being difficult to bring feme, even of our own 
people, to infert the names of their children, with all 
the care that can be taken. There are in the panfh 458 
dwellings ; 250 in Fochabers, and 208 in the country. 
The average number in thefe habitations is a little more 
than 4. With regard to longevity, there is nothing 
here peculiar. We are bleffed with a mild, pure, tem- 
perate air. Some live to 70, fome to 80 years of 
age, though few, in comparifon, it may be fuppofed. 
A few are now alive on the very borders of 90. A 
man died at 90 fome little time ago, and another at ic8, 
or upwards. There are no difeafc incident, in any 
uncommon way, to this corner. The fHhermen, from 
their employment, are fometimes feized with palfies in 
the lower parts, and fevere rheumatifm. Thefe mala- 
dies are guarded againft by the care taken of them, and 
the quantity of fpirits allowed them. 

Ecclefiajlical State i &amp;c— By far the greater part of* 
the people are of the eftabliihed church. We have, 
however, a very confiderable number of Roman Catho- 
licks, with a prieft of the church of Rome, and a large 
chapel. 

There are a few Proteftants of the Epifcopal perfua-* 
fion •, and 4 or 5 Seceders relide among us. We all live 
very cordially and happily together. The body of the 
people, it is but juftice to fay, are of refpe£table chaw

and marriages. There is a fociety fchool about 3 miles 
from Fochabers, of the utmoft confequence to very great 
numbers of poor creatures, who could not poffibly attend, 
or be accommodated in the parifli fchool. 

We have not many common beggars, yet a numerous 
lift of poor, among whom are diftributed the collections 
in the church, which (efpecially when Our great family 
is at home) are of much benefit, the dues from the

family, receive meal and money, which give a very com- 
fortable fubfiftence. They are old workout men. Pri- 
vate donations are given ; and the people, in general, are 
charitably difpofed. 

Curiqfity and Antiquity. —The only rare plant in the 
parifh, is the Satyrium Repens, which grows in plenty 
within a mile of Fochabers. 

There is a field of a little more than 3 acres, a little 
to the N. of the church of Bellie, to which tradition has 
given the name of the Danifh Camp, Large remains of 
the entrenchments have been preferved. It is upon the 
old E. bank of the Spey, and the river had then flowed 
at the bottom, which had occafioned the choice of the 
poft. This camp may have been connected with the 
battle between the Scots and Danes, in the neighbour- 
hood of Cullen. From the fquare figure of the encamp- 
ment, it mould rather feem to have been a Roman camp, 
though it be difficult to fay when the Romans were here, 
unlefs Agricola might land a detachment in his traverfQ 
on the coafts of Scotland. 

Bridge over the Spey. — I cannot conclude this {ketch of 
the parifli of Bellie, without taking notice of the necef- 
fity of throwing a bridge over the Spey at Fochabers. 
This is, upon the moil folid grounds, the ardent wilh of 
all w^o know this pafiage. Fochabers is a very confi- 
derable thorough-fare ? and Spey is well known to be 3 
large and rapid river. Numberlefs travellers of all de- 
fcriptions from every part of Britain, pafs this way, who 
are frequently detained by floods and boifterous winds, 
and fometimes crofs with danger. The poft-boy is, at 
times, detained^ though they waft him, over when they

would not run the rifk with any other perfon. Not long 
ago, he was Hopped 3 nights in the courfe of one week. 
They fometimes ferry over the mail, when they dare 
not take the horfe into the boat. A bridge here would 
be pf the utmoft confequence to the country, in driving 
cattle to and from the markets, of which many fine 
droves travel this way, and are often reduced to great 
hardfhips. It would be extremely beneficial in bringing 
lime from Banfffhire to Murray, where it is exceedingly 
wanted ; and it would be of unfpeakable importance to 
his Majefty's troops, who almoft always march by this 
route ; efpecially would it be of the laft moment, when 
the public fervi.ee requires difpatch. The univerfal 
fenfe of the propriety of this meafure, has already been 
ftrongiy evinced by very confiderable fubferiptions, to 
which, it is to be hoped, liberal additions will yet be 
made; Public aid, however, is indifpenfibly neceffary : 
and we may humbly prefume, that aid will very gene- 
roufly be granted, when the Hate of national affairs can: 
properly admit of it. </p></div>

Name, Situation, Soil, and ProduB. 

YNRON, even in the prefent century, has under- 
gone feveral alterations in the orthography of its 
name. In fome old writings Tinrome and Tynrome are 
ufed promifcuoufly. About 60 years ago, Tinran was 
occafionally adopted. And finqe that period lynron has 
been generally marked in any writings as the proper 
name of the parifh. Thofe who pretend an acquaint- 
ance with the Gaelic language, fay it is of Gaelic ex- 
tradion, fignifying, " A hill with a nofe," If this be 
the cafe, Tynron unqueftionably owes its name to a hill 
near the bottom of the parifh, called the Boon, in the 
front of which there is a piece of ground jetting out, 
partly refembling a nofe upon the. human face. Tynron 
is fituated in the weftern part of Nithfdale, a diftricl: of 
Vol, XIV. M m Dum~

Dumfries/hire. It is long and narrow, lying between 
the parifhes of Glencairn and Penpont : Glencairn run- 
ning along the S. W. fide about 8 Scotch miles ; Penpont 
upon the N. E. fide about 9 miles. The parilh of Keir 
is a boundary at the lower end ; and at the N. W., or 
uppermoft, it touches the parifli of Dairy, lying in the 
jftewartty of Galloway. It is generally computed to be 
10 Scotch miles in length, and about i\ in breadth, at an 
average. *The greateft part of the parifii is a ftrath, 
little valley ground and hills riling up on both hands. 
The hills are moflly green^ and being well clothed with 
grafs, are remarkable for feeding a larger number of 
fneep than the fame quantity of land in any ftrath 
around. The greatell part of the parifh is chiefly cal- 
culated for railing and feeding of Iheep ; although, of 
late years, the tillage of lands has considerably increaf- 
ed, on account of the neighbouring lime- works of Clofe^ 
burn and Barjarg, which have been carried on with fpi- 
rit and fuccefs. The foil is rather thin and fandy, and, 
from the greater part of the arable lands being fituated 
on the edge of hills, the crops are neither luxuriant nor 
early. Oats are chiefly raifed. Potatoes alfo in great 
abundance. There is a confiderable quantity more of 
grain than is equal to fupply the inhabitants. Since 
the large demands have commenced for black cattle in 
England, the landholders have been encouraged to raife 
them in greater quantities. And thofe farms which fed 
fheep only about 40 or 50 years ago, feed now fome 
black cattle alfo upon their lowell lands, where the grafa 
is ftrongeft, and moll fhelter to be found. The farmer 
Suds his interefl in this mode of management, as, in this 
way, he feldom milfes of drawing confiderable profits 
from, one part of his flock, agreeable to what is mod

in vogue for the feafon. The number of fhcep in the 
parifli is rather above 8000. They are all of the black- 
faced moor kind : The woel of very ordinary quality : 
The chief attention hitherto has been paid to the quan- 
tity : And what they call the well-clad flieep is greatly 
preferred to the other kind. The flieep. dealers from 
Cumberland have hitherto given a decided preference to 
the rough fhaggy-woolled fheep ; and at the Englifh bor- 
der markets they have met with the readiefl fale, and 
brought the higheft prices. They are reckoned of a 
fturdy conftitution, and beft able to meet the feverities 
of winter. The late treaties and ftriclures Upon the 
improvement- and melioration of wool in Scotland, 
brought home upon the mind in a convi&amp;ive way, by a 
fuccefsful practice on the part of fome enterprifing cha- 
racter, are only equal to the purpofe of removing liroug 
and obflinate local prejudices. The number of black 
cattle cannot be fo well afcertained, being a ftock often 
changed. There are no more horfes kept than what 
are neceffary for carrying on the agricultural and other 
farm labour. 

Population. — The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755 was 
464. There are at prefent refident in Tynron near 500 
fouls. Several of the inhabitants live to old ace. An 

o 

old lady died in 1787 at the advanced age of 112. With-* 
in thefe laft 20 years, 4 or 5 perfona have died above 
So years of age. And there are feveral living at pre- 
fent in the parim who are nearly arrived at fourfcore 
years. There are very few inftances of people dying 
in the middle time of life. And when the difeafes in- 
cident to childhood and early youth are fafely get ever, 
good health and long life are generally enjoyed. At an 



276 



Statijlical Account 



average, there are annually 10 births, 3 marriages, 4 
deaths. The population is rather increafing. Since the 
tillage of the parifti is of late years upon a more en- 
larged plan, more labourers are needed ; and there are 
feveral fmall new houfes built for the accommodation of 
fuch. 

Chara&amp;er and Manners. — The inhabitants are a fo- 
cial, humane, benevolent people, living in habits of in- 
tercourfe with thofe around them, and exercifing them- 
felves in acls of charity upon proper objects. They gave 
very evident proof of their being pofleffed of this latter 
quality in 1782, in opening a very liberal fubfcription 
for purchafing meal for the ufe of needy houfeholders. 
To fome it was given out without money, and, in order 
to render the charity more extenfive, to others at a re- 
duced price. The happy effects of this charity were 
fenlibly felt, and the gratitude of the poor is at this day- 
alive on account of it. 

Donations to the Parijh and the Poor. — The moft: re- 
markable donation that has been in the memory of the 
6ldeft man living, or indeed that appears from any writ- 
ten documents, was made in the year 1754* by Mr„ 
John Gibfon, originally a native of the parifli, and who, 
in his younger years* was rather in ftraitened circum- 
ftances. Some of his more wealthy friends finding him 
poffeffed of a confiderable fhare of genius, and fond of 
cultivating and improving it, adminiftered to him the 
means neceffary for this end. After a fhort time fuc- 
cefsfully fpent in attention to his ftudies, he iflued forth 
into acKve life ; and, by the moft perfect integrity of 
manners, and the moft unwearied application to bufinefs*

fc e increafed both in reputation and wealth In the lat- 
ter part of his life, he was married to a lady in London 
by whom he had no children. He bequeathed to her all 
hi property during her perfonal life ; and after her death 
which happened in the year i 7 6* 1500I. was appoint- 
Id by will to defcend to the Society for Propagating 
ChriLn Knowledge in Scotland. This Society, by 
their acceptance of this donation, bound 
pay annually to the parilh of Tynron 35 1- ^g. 
Twenty-two pounds of this fum being paid by the trea- 
surer of faid Society to a fchoolmafter, appointed by 
Mr. Gibfon's latter will, to teach a fchool at or near 
Tynron kirk : the fchoolmafter found qualified by the 
prefbytery of Penpont, and certified to be fo, to inftrud 
in the principles of the Chriftian religion ; to teach to 
read and Write well, to caft accounts, to fing pfalms at 
church and in private families, and alfo to teach any 
other parts of learning as mall be thought proper, and 
to be elefted to his office by the minifter and elders for 
the time being, and the heritors refiding in the parifh*. 

Ecclefiajlical 

* The prefbytery examines this fchool annually ; and upon their certifi- 
cate of the fchoolmafter's due election, diligence and faithfulnefs in the dif- 
charge of his duty, he draws the falary above fpecified. The remaining , 3 I., 
by the will of the donor, is appointed to be diftributed annually, by the kirfc, 
feffion, among I* poor, fober, and induftrious perfons, refiding u the parifh ,

four or five of the beft fpinnets among the twelve. This donation has an ex- 
cellent effeft in encouraging induftry among the poorer clafs, at the fame time , 
that it greatly tends to relieve their wants. A ftrift attention has been paid 
hitherto in acling up to the will of the donor, both in the letter and fpirit. 
And every thing at prefent, both in refpeft .of the fchool and the gift to the

ZccleMJltcal 5W.- T he church was built near till 
beginning of the century, and the half of it, by the 
roof giv ing way, obliged to be rebuilt about 40 years 
ago. A flight repair has been made upon both walls 
and roof in the I? 8 7 , and is now pretty comfort 
able, except upon a fall of fnow, which penetrates 
through feveral crevices in the roof. The manfe and 
offices were all built anew in the i 7 8 5) and are in the 
beft repair. The living, including the glebe, is about 
100 1. The Duke of Queenfberry is patron. 

There are about 20 Seceders in the parifli the half 
belonging to the Antiburgher, and the other half to the 
Cameronian congregations. There is one man attached 
to the Relief fociety. 

Rent, &amp;c— The valued rental of Tynron, as it Hands up^ 
on the valuation roll of the county of Dumfries, is 4110 
merks, 6s. 8d. Scots. The real rental may be ftated at 
1500I. Sterling; but this is not given out to be an ac- 
curate ftatement, as there is a difficulty in doing this, 
from many farms being in the perfonal poueffion of the 
heritors ; and thofe belonging to the Duke of Queenf- 

berry, 

poor, is upon the beft and moft agreeable footing. A very commodious houfe 
of two ftoreys in height, in purfuance of the fuggeftions of the donor, was 
taifed in the 1765, in the near neighbourhood cf the parifli church, by th« 
late Bulce of Queenlberry, and another public-fpirited heritor. One large 
apartment is ufed as the fchool-room, and the reft of the houfe appointed for 
the accommodation of the teacher. Befides this donation to the parifli, tlure 
have been (mailer ones made by well difpofed charitable peifons, for the ufe 
Of thofe Handing upon the poor's roll. Befides the weekly collections made for 
the poor, amounting to III. or 12I. annually, there is a fmall piece of landed 
property belonging to them, yielding 7 1. of yesrly rent. The number of 
poor's names on the roll is 12 0r 14. They have a pretty comfortable fub- 
fiftence, and not one of them is known to go beyond die bounds of the parifli 
as an itinerant beggar.

berry, inftead of augmented rents, are let out for 19 
years, at very moderate rents, and a graffum taken at 
the commencement of the tack. There are 11 feparate 
properties, and 8 of the heritors are refident. The half 
pf the parilh belongs to the Duke of Queenfberry. 

Rivulets The only ftream of water worthy of notice 

is the Shinnel, riling at the upper extremity of the pa- 
rim, and running along through the middle, till it At&amp; 
charges itfelf into the Scarr, when it lofes its name. 
There are feveral fmaller dreams, that in this country 
are called Burns. They all abound with the burn trout, 
which affords excellent amufement to the angler. 

Fuel.— Peat is commonly ufed in the upper end or 
moor part of the pariih ; and the lower part depends 
chiefly upon coals brought from Sanquhar, above 16 
miles of land carriage. The coal is purchased at a fmall 
price. The chief expenfe lies upon the carriage. 

Curiofitics. — What is moft worthy of notice in this 
refpect is the hill already mentioned, fuppofed to give 
name to the parifli, commonly called the Doon of Tyn- 
ron. This hill rifes up in a pyramidical form. There 
is a fmall piece of flat ground, on the top of which, 
tradition fays, flood a caflle. It is certain, however, 
there has been a confiderable building upon it, although 
few traces now remain. It is coniiftent with the know- 
ledge of many of the inhabitants now living, that when 
the half of the parifh church was rebuilt about 40 years 
ago, many free ftones, for that purpofe, were brought 
from this place y which muft have been carried thither at 

a great 



Statiftical Account 



a great expenfe, as the neareft quarry of the kind is abov» 
4 miles diftant, and the hill very inacceffible. This 
building has been one of thofe places of ftrength with 
which the country formerly abounded, and has been encir- 
cled by feveral large mounds of earth, which are ftill 
very vifible. There is an extenfive profpect of the fur- 
rounding country to be enjoyed from the top of this 
hill. An old Roman way runs through the parilh ; 
and at this diftant day from its formation, is in many 
places quite uncovered with grafs. Its direction is from 
E. to W., along the face of the hills. There are feveral 
tumuli of Hones. There is one tumulus of earth of cen- 
fiderable fize. None of them have been opened. In 
the Shinnel, there is a deep fall of water called the Aird 
Linn, which is occafionally vifited by thofe who delight 
in grand and {hiking objecls. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The price of labour is 
much raifed of late years. An ordinary farm man, 
fervant draws 81. or 9I. a-year. A maid-fervant from 
3I. to 4I. Harveft wages a-day 8d., with vi&amp;uals, or 
is. without them. But the general pra&amp;ice is hiring 
labourers to remain in the houfe during the harveft 
weeks. The roads are much improved fince the com- 
mutation of the ftatute-labour. Much inconvenience is 
felt from the great diftance of a weekly market, the 
neareft being Dumfries, which is above 16 miles; </p></div>

Situation and Extent 

£r TPHE parlm of Govan lies chiefly in the county of 
Lanark. Renfrewfhire cuts off a fmall propor- 
tion of it on the S. fide. Notwithftanding the erection 
of the village of Gorbals into a feparate parifli in 177 1, 
by the commiffion court, and the fubfequent disjunction 
quoad facra of the lands in its immediate vicinity by the 
preftytery, the pariih of Govan is ftill about 5 miles in 
length from E. to W., and between 3 and 4 in breadth. 
The river Clyde, which is there navigable, by veflcls 
drawing 7 feet 6 inches, and runs through the whole 
length of the parifli fromE. to W., divides it nearly into 
2 equal parts. The lands on the fides of the Clyde, form 
a moft beautiful plain, extending in breadth a mile and

an half, and upwards, the greateft part of which lies or* 
the S. fide ; and as the plain continues feveral miles be- 
low Govan, has a good deal of plantations upon it, as well 
as a confiderable number of elegant villas, and is aH 
along interfeaed by the Clyde, upon which veffels are 
conftantly patting either to or from Glafgow, it. forms 
from the high grounds on the S. and N., one of the moll 
delightful landfcapes that can be imagined. 

State of Ferry.— This divifion of the parifli, however, 
though a remarkable addition to the beauty of its fcene- 
ry, is felt as a great inconvenience by the parilhioners 
on the N. fide of the Clyde. There is no bridge over 
this river below Glafgow ; and its banks are frequently 
fo overflown by heavy falls of rain, that all communica- 
tion by the ferry boat, about ih miles below that place, 
is either entirely Hopped, or rendered extremely trouble- 
fome and dangerous. At any time, indeed, paffing from 
the one fide to the other, is inconvenient to old and in- 
firm people, and to thofe who find it neceflary to crofs 
the water at funerals ; becaufe, though there was once 
a quay on the N. fide, it has been completely fanded up, 
fince the commencement of the operations mentioned 
in the account of Glafgow, for improving the navigation 
of the river ; and the ferry, which is become private pro- 
perty, has been long in a very neglected Hate. As fome 
gentlemen in the parilh, however, who are no lefs dif- 
tinguilhed by their public fpirit, than by the extent of 
their pofleffions, have, of late, been turning their atten- 
tion to the improvement of the ferry, and are endea- 
vouring to procure a boat of the fame kind as at Ren- 
frew, the inconvenience complained of, it is hoped, will 
be foon, in a great meafure, if not entirely, removed ;

and the corn and flit mills, in its immediate vicinity, 
rendered eafily accefiible from the S. as well as the N. 
fide of the Clyde. 

Public Works, Sec The Kelvin, over which is built 

the great aqueduct bridge, defcribed in the account of 
New Kilpatrick, empties itfelf into the Clyde, at the 
Ferry now mentioned, and forms one of the moft confi- 
derable additions it receives during the whole of its 
courfe. From that noble monument of attention to in- 
ternal improvement in this part of Scotland, till the Kel- 
vin join the Clyde, it is the eaftern boundary of this pa- 
rim ; and its feveral windings are not lefs than 3 miles 
in length. Its banks exhibit a beautiful variety of land- 
fcape, and are entirely covered in fome places on both 
fides, with wood of different kinds, in a very thriving 
ftate, which has been moftly planted within thefe 40 
years. Not to mention the public works carried on 
long the E. fide of Kelvin in the fpace already defcribed, 
there are on the W., which alone falls to be taken no- 
tice of here, 3 yarn bleachfields, and 2 for the bleaching 
and printing of cloth ; 3 corn mills, 1 for the making 
of fnuff, 1 for the making of paper, 1 for the grinding 
of ink powder, pot afhes, &amp;c, 1 for chipping, and 1 for 
rafping yellow and logwood. Snuff was not manufactu- 
red here before the year 1750. Till that period, from 
1634, what is now converted into a fnuff- mill, had been 
ufed for grinding corn, and is faid to have been the firft 
of that kind upon the water of Kelvin. The rafp and 
phip mills were both ere&amp;ed by their prefent proprietor, 
Mr. John Duncan, in the year 1760, and were the firft 
jn the W. of Scotland. 

Befides thefe works on Kelvin, there is a confiderable

bleachfield on the S. fide of the Clyde, in the immediate 
vicinity of the village of Govan ; and a cotton mill, which 
gives employment to about 100 perfons of different ages, 
and is driven by a fleam engine, has been lately built 
about 2 miles nearer Glafgow, almoft upon the weftern 
boundary of the lands annexed quoad Jacra to the parifh 
of Gorbals. 

Fi/h.So full an enumeration of the different kinds 
pf fim found in the Clyde has appeared in the account of 
Glafgow, that a detail of thofe found in it, as it panes 
through this parilh, would certainly be deemed fuperflu- 
ous. The falmon filhery is here a considerable object of 
attention. The annual rent it has lately brought to th$ 
heritors, is 49I. Sterling. 

Minerals, &amp;c. — In the ground on both fides of the ri- 
ver, there is plenty of free Hone of different qualities : 
and of fuch clay as is ufed in making brick, there is, in 
feveral places, great abundance. The coal work, men- 
tioned in the Statiftical Account of Gorbals, is inthe 
land disjoined from Govan by the Prelbytery. Coal has 
been wrought for many years, about a mile and an half 
N. from the Ferry, and a new pit has lately been open- 
ed at nearly the fame diftance from it in the oppofite di- 
rection. But notwithftanding this, a cart containing 12, 
cwt. cofts in the village of Govan, at leaft a milling more

Agriculture, 

* Thirty years ago, the doctrine of mechanics in general was not fo well 
underftood in this country as in later times, and the fpecies of machinery ufed 
in the raiting of coal, had not reached that perfection to which it lias now at- 
tained; yet a cart, containing fomewhat lefs than 12 cwt., for which 5s. muft 
row be paid, could then be purchafed at fo low a price as is. 6d. The value

Agriculture— There is perhaps no parifh in the W, of 
Scotland, where agriculture is better underftood, or has 
been carried, within thefe 40 years, to greater per- 
fedion than in Govan. The foil is various, but by no 
means naturally fertile. That neareft to the river „ 
moftly a light loam. In the higher grounds, and to- 
wards the foot of the rife, the tendency is generally more 
or lefs to clay and till } and the middle of that part o£ 
the plain, which lies on the S. fide of the river, though 
a confiderable proportion of it be now highly improved, 
appears to have confifted originally of a barren fand, 
covered with heath. In the S. and S. W. parts of this 
parifh, befides what has been lately made to yield very- 
rich crops, or is planted with Scotch fir, there is flill 
more than 100 acres of mofs, upon which the hufbandman 
is feldom to be feen, but in the feafon for the catting of 
peats ; and of thefe, the quantity that is yearly prepa- 
red, is very inconfiderable ; becaufe, being of a quality 
greatly inferior to thofe brought into Glafgow from 
other quarters, there is no demand for them in that mar- 
ket ; and they are ufed by the inhabitants of the S. dU 
yifion of the parifh only for kindling their fires. 

The lands of Govan are generally well enclofed and 
divided ; and a confiderable proportion of thofe on the 
S. fide of the river is farmed by the proprietors them- 
felves. With the induftry and aftivity of the farmers, 
which are nowhere more confpicuous, feveral other cir- 
cumftances have evidently concurred, in bringing this 

parilli 

of money has, no doubt, during that time, been greatly diminiflied, and coal 
was formerly wrought nearer to the village than at prefent ; but whether either, 
or both of thcfe circumftances, 'along with the additional depth of the coil, 
will fufficiently account for the extraordinary rif; of the price of fuel in this 
parifh, fhall be left to others to determine.

parifli to its prefent ftate of improvement. Its vicinity 
fco Glafgow, which, till lately, has, for a number pf 
years, been increafmg with aftonifhing rapidity, pro- 
cures a fure and ready market for its produce, and fur- 
mfhes a moft convenient and plentiful fupply of the beft 
manure ; and as no lefs than 4 branches of the King's 
highway run through the parifh, the carriage to Glaf- 
gow of the articles it produces, and of the manure 
brought from thence, particularly on the S. fide of the 
Clyde, is attended with no fort of difficulty. But the 
circumftance, which, of all others, contributed moft to 
the agricultural improvement of Go van, was the trial of 
Tuli's Syftem of Hufbandry, by Mr. Grofs of Parkhoufe, 
late fheriff of Lanarkfhire. Till that gentleman began 
$iis experiments about 40 years ago, farming here had 
made very fmall proficiency, and local advantages were 
but little improved. His liberal enterprifing mind wifh- 
ed to give the theories of that time a fair and complete 
trial, and thereby to promote the good of his country, 
though little profit fliould, in the mean time, accrue to 
fcimfelf. Of the thorough working and cleaning of 
ground, he was anxious to learn the full effe&amp; j and to 
thefe he applied with unremitting affiduity. In procefs 
of time, he found, that thefe, without manure, were not 
enough for raifing good crops of any kind \. but by the 
crops which, for a confiderable number of years, he had 
raifed fucceffively upon the fame ground, entirely with- 
out manure, he directed th§ attention of his neighbours 
to what is chiefly beneficial in farming 9 and forae of 
them gratefully acknowledge the benefit they derived 
from his induftry and perfeverance at this day. He was 
the firft who tried the effect of drilling in this part of 
the country, and found it, upon the whole, to turn out 

exceedingly

^exceedingly well. In this way of fowing turnip, of 
which, from a too well founded apprehenfion of feeret 
confumption, the quantity raifed annually in Govan is 
inconfiderable, he is pretty generally followed, and in 
the planting of potatoes, univerfally. He always gave 
a preference to broad drills* ; but in that has not been 
followed, though a gentleman, who is one of the moll 
intelligent farmers in the parifti, and who was particu- 
larly acquainted with the ftieriff, is clearly of opinion, 
that they not only yield as profitable crops as the broad f* 
drills, but are greatly more beneficial to the ground. In 
this parifli, there is not lefs than 250 acres planted with 
potatoes every year ; and of thefe, the average produce 
is 35 bolls the acre. The ordinary rotation of crops is 
potatoes, wheat laid down with grafs-feeds for 2 years, 
and then oats. Some fow barley, others oats after 
wheat, and lay them down with grafs. Beans and peafe 
are not brought into the rotation, except in the higher 
grounds, where the foil, generally tending to clay, is 
more favourable for their production. The belt J farm- 
ers have, fome feafofis, 13 bolls of wheat upon an acre ; 
but that is considerably above the average quantity. 
Flax is fown only for private ufe. The harveft is ufual- 
ly early ; and frequent mowers during the fummer are, 
in the low grounds, always fucceeded by the richeft: 
crops. 

The draught horfes in this parifh, are moftly above 
the common fize. The mode of farming generally prac- 
ticed renders this necellary. Not to fpeak of the heavy- 
carts of dung brought out of Glafgow, the plough ufed

in the greater part of the parifli is drawn by 2 horfes * , 
and it has, of late, been found, that 2 harrows, fo con- 
flru&amp;ed and joined together, as to take an equal hold of 
ihe ground, may be drawn by 2 fuch horfes managed 
fey one man, and do nearly as much execution as 4 un- 
connected with one another, drawn by 4 fmaller horfes, 
which require 2 men From the richnefs of the pafture, 
in general, it is likewife found expedient to keep milch- 
cows, of a pretty large lize. The number annually fat- 
tened in the parifli, is not great. They are of a fmaller 
fize, and are ufually brought from the Highlands. There 
is only 1 flieep farm in the parifli, which confifts of about 
108 acres. The inundations of the Clyde prevent it 
from being profitably kept in tillage. 

As a confequence of the fpirit for farming that has 
been introduced into Govan, it is entitled to notice, that 
the implements of hulbandry are all of the moft approv- 
ed kind. Inftead of pofleffing that averfion to innova- 
tion, which prevails in many other parts of Scotland, 
the farmers, in general, fo far as the writer of this has 
had an opportunity of obferving, difcover a laudable e- 
mulation to be foremoft in improvement of every kind. 
Of the threfhing machines invented by the ingenious 
Mr. Meikle, the firft in this part of the country was e- 
reaed more than 4- years ago, by a Mr. John Paterfon 
of this parifli ; and a confiderable farmer in the neigh- 
bourhood having feen from his, their great utility in the 
abridgement of labour, has lately followed his example. 

The valued rent of the whole parifli is 4962I. 17s. 7d. 
Scotch. Its real rent, owing to a number of the heri- 
tors farming their own lands, is not accurately known ; 
but from the very advanced Hate of improvement, muft

j&amp;ecefiarily be high, probably upwards of 6000I. Ster- 
ling. It is divided in very unequal portions, among 
63 proprietors, a few of whom only have held their pof- 
feffions for any confiderable length of time. In the pa- 
riih, feveral of the greateft proprietors refide almofl con- 
flantly. Its vicinity to a place of exteniive trade and 
manufadures, added to its healthy and pleafant fituation* 
makes it very defirable for fummer residence. 

Population, &amp;c Befides the village of Govan, which 

contains 224 families, there are 2 more in the parifh fo 
confiderable, that in the one, which is a little N. from 
the Clyde, there are 115 families, and in the other, upon 
the road to Eaftwood, 35. Few of the houfes in any of 
thefe have been lately built. The old houfes, in gene-, 
ral, are ill aired, and extremely incommodious. Clean- 
linefs is by no means fufficiently attended to by the low- 
er clafles of the people ; and the water which, till lately * 
was fuffered to ftagnate on both fides of the publick 
road through the village of Govan (which is about a 
mile in length), was highly offenfive to travellers. The 
villagers feemed, however, from their being at no pains 
to drain it, not to confider it as any nuifance ; and 
though the effluvia arifing from it, could not be of a fa- 
lubrious quality* it has been long remarked, that the 
people are generally exceedingly healthy;, and that many 
of them reach a very advanced age. 

In 1755, when the village of Gorbals was included in 
the parifh of Govan, the population of thd whole, ac- 
cording to Dr. Webfter, amounted to 43 89. That vil- 
lage, and the lands joined to it quoad facfa, appear now 
to contain 5800 fouls. From an enumeration made chief- 
ly in the courfe of laft year, there are in the parifh of

On an elevated fituation very near to Kelrin, and not 
raany hundred yards from the Clyde, fland the ruins of 
an edifice ereaed in 1611, and known by the name of 
the Bilhop's Cattle. It was the country refidence of the 
* Bifhop of Glafgow. In the bleachfield near to the vil- 
lage of Govan, which was already taken notice of, there 
Is an artificial mound of a conical fhape. Its perpendi- 
cular height is 17 feet. At the bafe, it is 150 feet in 
•diameter, and at the top 102. It is commonly called, 
The Hillock, and was probably one of the f law hills 
'upon which courts of juftice ufed to be held in ancient 
times, which are to be met with in fome other parts of 
Scotland. What chiefly favours this conjecture is, that 
the oldeft people in the neighbourhood remember its be- 
ing known by the name of Doomfterhill. It may be 
here mentioned, as a circumftance a little uncommon, 
that on the northern boundary of the parifh, the coun- 
ties of Dumbarton, Lanark, and Renfrew, the parifhes 
•of New Kilpatrick, Govan, and Renfrew, and the pro- 
perty of 3 heritors in thefe feveral parimes, all meet in 
one point.

*' there, in which he refided during fummer j and that about the time of the

* refidence of the bifhop and his court in this place, no doubt, gave rife to 
«' the adjoining village of Particle, as tradefmen would naturally fettle near 

the biihop's refidence, for the accommodation of his houfehold, and of thofe 
« who frequented that eftabli/hment." From the lands being called in the 
deed o'f conveyance, as the fame gentleman thinks, Mam particulum terra, it 
is eafy to account for the name Partick.

CharaBer and Difadv ant ages. —For indultry and ac- 
tivity, as was formerly remarked, the farmers here are 
eminently diftingullhed. The fuperior claries are focial, 
hofpitable, liberal to their poor, and generally regular in 
attending the ordinances of religion. From a great part 
of the operative people in the" villages, 279 of whom are 
weavers, temperance, it is much to be lamented, has not 
obtained a place among the cardinal virtues. There are 
no fewer than 22 ale, or rather whiiky houfes m the 
parifli ; and had it not been taken from the Excife offi- 
cers books, it might be thought incredible, that when 
the cotton manufacture was in a flouriming ftate, 1500 
gallons of whiiky were confumed in the village of Go- 
van, in a fingle quarter of a- year. To this quantity, 
any fuppofititious addition to the prejudice of the re- 
venue, need furely not be made, even by the moll uncha- 
ritable. 

In fuch a diftrift, and where there is no * civil magi- 
ftrate to enforce fubordination, and to punilh crimes, 
what can be eapedted, but that the children mould have 
been negle&amp;ed in their education ; that many of the 
youth Ihould be unacquainted with the principles of re* 
ligion, and diffolute in their morals ; and that licentious 
cabal mould too often ufurp the place of peaceable and 
fober deportment. 

Notice was formerly taken of the inconvenience to 
which the village of Govan is fubjected,. with regard to 
fuel ; and it ftill farther deferves attention, that there is 
no ftandard by which the weight and carriage of coals are 

regulated 

* If neighbouring juftices were, at ftated intervals, to hold regular courts 
in fo large villages, they might effentially promote the beft interefts of thei? 
country. They would be a terror to evil doers, and a protection t» all that;

regulated. The confequence of which is, a poor houfe-. 
holder pays the fame price for 9 or 10, as for 12 cwt. ; 
and from want of a civil magiftrate, has no mode of re- 
drefs, when he thinks himfelf wronged. There is no 
baker in the place, no butcher, and no publick market of 
any kind. All forts of provilions, therefore, excepting 
meal and potatoes, coft the inhabitants more than if they 
lived in Glafgow ; becaufe they mull go thither to pur- 
chafe them, and afterward bring them home. The vil- 
lagers, indeed, are chiefly fupplied with loaf bread, fent 
to them from Glafgow ; but the trouble of fending it 
muft be compenfated in fome way or other ; and no way 
is fo eafy for the baker, as a proportional diminution of 
the weight. </p></div>

ABOUT the origin of the name of the parifh, there 
does not exift even a probable conje&amp;ure. It 
ftretches in length from E. to W. about 4 miles, and its 
greateft breadth from S. to N. is about a mile. Its 
eaftern extremity is diftant about 4I miles from St. An- 
drew's, and its wellern approaches within half a mile 
of Cupar. It contains about 1850 acres, of which more 
than 1500 are arable. Of the remainder, fome part was 
planted feveral years ago ; and the plantations, confifting 
principally of Scotch fir, are in fo thriving a ftate, that 
they afford a ftrong inducement to the feveral proprie-

Of thefe, all, except the laft, are tolerably fertile, and 
produce, by proper management, good crops of all the 
plants commonly raifed by farmers in this country. 
The furface of the ground, on the W. fide of the parifli, 
is nearly level, floping gently from S. to N. ; but on the 
E. fide, Nature, in the formation of its furface, feems 
to have indulged herfelf in a fportive mood, by throw- 
ing it into a variety of the moll irregular and fantaftic 
fhapes : it rifes above the level of the W. fide about 70 
or 80 feet ; and the elevations in feveral places are fo 
fudden and abrupt, as to render the cultivation of the 
fields very expenfive, and even dangerous, and the roads, 
from one part of the parifli to the other, almoft inac- 
ceffible. The air and climate are favourable to health. 
Endemic difeafes are unknown. The people in general 
are healthy, and fometimes reach extreme old age. 
There are at prefent feveral perfons in the parifli be*

manners; attending to their own bufinefs, living in peace 
with one another, and giving regular attendance upon 
the public ordinances of religion. During the incum-

In this parifli, till very lately, the capital improve- 
ments which farming has received during the courfe of 
the prefent century, have not been generally adopted. 
Within the recent period of 12 years, neither turnips 
nor artificial graffes of any kind were fown in the largeft 
farm in the parifh. The fields, after being exhaufted 
by cropping, were refigned in fucceffion to pafture, and 
remained in that condition feveral years, producing fcan- 
ty crops of natural graffes, till it became neceffary to 
break them up again for corn ; and the inftruments of 
hulbandry correfponded in clumfinefs with the rudenefs of 
the mode of cultivation. Of late, however, things have 
affumed a very different appearance. Turnips are raif- 
ed in every farm. The rotation of crops is fometimes 
fuch as the belt writers on husbandry recommend ; the 
fields are laid down with a plentiful allowance of clover 
and rye grafs, and the ploughs, and harrows, and carts, 
£r_c. are generally of the belt conftruclion. Still, how- 
ever, to an accurate and judicious obferver, there may 
perhaps appear room for much future improvement, 
both in the formation and in the execution of the plans 
adopted by farmers here for the management of their 

grounds. 

improvement, before a perfon can be qualified for reading fuch books 
with advantage, it would be necelTary for him to go through a more 
complete courfe of education, than can be commonly obtained at a 
country parifli fchool. A confiderable acquaintance with the Englifli 
language, arithmetick, book-keeping, and menfuration, are qualifica- 
tions without which a farmer can neither make himfelf mailer of the 
improvements made in the art, nor profecute thefe improvements in a. 
manner either beneficial to himfelf or his country. This, by the way, 
(hows the neceffity of giving greater encouragement to public teachers, 
than is at prefent done ; as there is not, perhaps, any Cngle circumftance 
that would conduce fo much to the advancement of agriculture in Scot- 
land, as making provifion for the proper education of that clafs of meij 
by whom the art is to be carried on.

grounds. Of the improvements above mentioned, the 
caufes are no doubt various. One of the principal of 
them, however, certainly is, the attention which feveral 
of the gentlemen who refide on their eftates have them- 
felves paid to hufbandry. By introducing into the fmall 
farms in their own poffemon the moft approved fyftem 
of management for the different kinds of foil, they have 
exhibited an example to their tenants, which, confpiring 
with other caufes, has produced the change of culture 
mentioned above, a change no lefs beneficial to the pro- 
prietor and tenant, than delightful to the judicious 
fpectator. 

For 2 or 3 years paft, it has been the cuftom, in dif- 
ferent parts of the parifh, to raife potatoes from feed, 
in order to prevent degeneracy, to procure greater va- 
riety of kinds, and more abundant crops ; and there is 
little doubt, that in this way thefe defirable ends will 
be attained. There is another article of improvement, 
which has been lately introduced, which promifes to be 
a fubftantial and permanent benefit. I mean, the ufe of 
rutabaga, or Swedifh turnip. This plant is either fown 
in the field, like common turnip, and treated in the fame 
manner, or fown in a feed bed like cabbage, and tranf- 
planted at the diftance of 10 or 12 inches in the drill. 
In point of tafte and flavour, it is greatly fuperior even 
to yellow turnip ; and though in many refpe&amp;s fimilar 
to turnip, it potteries fome peculiar qualities which feem, 
to render it well calculated to ferve in fpring as a fuc«t 
cedaneum to turnip, and to afford green food for cattle 
till they can be put to grafs. It is confiderably more 
folid than common turnip. Its fpecific gravity to that 
of common turnip being nearly as 1013 to 878 ; (it may 
te proper to mention, however, that the accuracy of 

thia

this proportion refts on a fingle experiment). It refiftg 
froft better than turnip ; after mooting in the fpring, 
the root Hill remains juicy and fucculent, and even after 
the feed is ripened upon the ftalk, a considerable part of 
the root remains fit for the ufe of cattle. 

Threihing machines have been lately introduced here, 
and though there has not been time for them to receive 
the fanaion of experience in their favour, yet as they 
perform a great quantity pf work in a very fnort time, 
and cut off almoft every opportunity of embezzlement, 
they promife to conftitute a valuable improvement upon 
an extenfive farm. 

There are no fewer than 3 corn mills in the parifh j 
but, from this circumftance, little or no benefit aecrues 
to the inhabitants in the way of competition, as almofi: 
all the lands are bound thirle to one or other of them. 
The multure exacted by thefe mills, is, I believe, almoft. 
precifely the fame. It cannot be expreffed in general 
terms, becaufe it is drawn in grain, and partly in meal. 
By a calculation upon oats, I found, that when the boll 
6f oats produces aboil of meal, the multure is i-^th, 
and when the boll produces only 3 firlots of meal, the 
multure is i-i2th of the quantity fent to the mill. This 
fuggefts an inducement, which, along with many others, 
mould difpofe farmers to pay attention to raife grain of 
the belt quality, as the multure is always lefs in propor-. 
tion as the quality is finer. 

The rents of farms are various. Of late, there has ap- 
peared in this neighbourhood a tendency to offer higher 
rents for farms, than the average prices of corn and 
cattle, and the improvements of the art feemed to juftify. 
The fame fpirit of unfounded fpeculation, which had per- 
vaded feveral other orders of fociety, feized upon farm- 
ers.

ers. This fpirit in farming, however, as well as in 
trade and manufactures, has received a check from the 
ftate or the times : Had it proceeded much farther, it 
would have produced the moft fatal confequences. It 
would have proved an effedual bar to every fpecies of 
agricultural improvement, becaufe the farmers bound to 
pay more than the land could produce, would foon have 
found themfelves in a ftate of bankruptcy and ruin ; and 
it would have neceflarily foftered in the country that 
fpirit of diffatisfaftion, which almoft invariably accom- 
panies the feeling of diftrefs. 

In this parifli, the rent of land ftill continues mode- 
rate ; there is only i or 2 fmall farms which let fo high 
as 20s. the acre, and the beft land in the parifli is, at pre- 
fent, let confiderably under that rate. The largeft farm 
in the parifli confifts of about 270 acres. There are in, 
the parifli about 122 horfes, 457 cattle, and from 80 to 
100 fwine. Every cottager almoft feeds a pig for the 
ufe of his family. 

Rivers, — The river Eden is the northern boundary 
of the parifli. Of this ftream the courfe is not ftraight, 
but forms many beautiful.ferpentine windings, the banks 
fometimes almoft level with the furface of the water., 
and fometimes riling above it to the height of 40 or 50 
feet ; and at the eaftern extremity of the parifli, the 
river forms a curve of fo curious a kind, that it fliapes 
about an acre of land, which it nearly furrounds, into' 
the -figure of a guitar, with the broad end oppofed to the 
water on the E. fide. 

The portion of the Eden belonging to this parifli, 
abounds both with river and fea trout. The river trout 
are of two kinds, red and white. They begin to be in 

feafon' 



Of Kemhach 



fezton in March, but are in higheft perfeftion in April 
and May. The largeft will weigh about 2 lbs. Eng- 
lifh weight ; the middle fize from 4 lb. to a lb. The 
fea trout are alfo of 2 kinds, red and white. They begin 
to come up from the fea in May. The largeft are about 

3 lbs., and the common fize about 1 lb. 

There is a fmall falmon-fiihing too upon the Eden in 
this parifli. The falmon begin to appear in the river in 
May, but are generally more frequent in June and Ju- 
ly. They are commonly fold at 4d. the lb, Englifti. 
About 30 years ago, the average number of falmon 
caught, was 3 fcore ; and the average number caught in 
the part of the river belonging to Nyddie, which borders 
with this parifh, was 12 fcore. For feveral years paft, 
both fifliings have been occupied by the fame perfons ; 
and though no exertion of induftry and fkill has been ne- 
gle&amp;ed, the average number of both hath not exceeded 

4 fcore. The caufe of this deficiency, however, it does 
not feem eafy to afcertain with any degree of probabi- 
lity. . 

Mines and Minerals. — Of free ftone, there are vaft 
quantities in the parifli. Veins, both of coal and lime, 
have been alfo found in it ; but of thefe laft, the expenfe 
of working has been hitherto fo great, that though feve- 
ral attempts have been made at different times, they 
have always proved unprofitable fpeculations. In the 
year 1722, a difcovery was made at the foot of a pretty 
high hill at Myretown of Blebo of a quantity of metal 
in large pieces, which, upon trial, proved to be rich lead 
ore. This circumftance induced the proprietor, Mr. 
John Bethune of Blebo, with fome of his friends, to 
form themfelves into a company, to work, dig, and fearch 

Vol. XIV. ftr

for the whole metals and minerals upon the lands p? 
Blebo. 

In the courfe of their trials, they found at Myretown, 
a little below the place where the ore was difcovered, 
a vein in the folid rock, about % feet wide, containing 
fpar, and other vein ftuffj mired with large fpots or 
flowers of fine ore; and in another place, about half a 
mile W. from the former, they difcovered a neft of the 
pureft lead ore, containing large lumps, one of 24 ftoues, 
and fereral of 10 or 12 Hones, and the reft fmaller ; and 
a little bslow the neft, a vein of about a foot wide, in 
working of which, in a fmall level, they came to a rib 
of pure metal of about 3 inches, which increafed to 6 
inches. But as the levels to both lay through rocks fa 
exceflively hard, as could only be wrought with gun- 
powder, the expenfe of the work became io gi v eat, that 
it was thought proper to diflblve the company. About 
a tons of lead were manufactured, and exported to Hol- 
land *.

• Afterward, In the year 1748, a gentleman, from the county of 
Jvlid-Lothian, Captain William Thynne, took a leafe of the mines and 
minerals in the lands of Blebo, and came with a few workmen, and 
made a trial at Myretown, where the vein appears in the folid rock. 
Both he and his workmen thought the appearance promifing ; but, in a 
few weeks after the commencement of the work, Captain Thynne re- 
ceived an offer of going to the Weft Indies, to fuperintend fome works 
there, which he accepted ; and fincc that time, no new trials have been 
made. A few years ago, however, all the difcoveries above ftated, were 
communicated to a gentleman of great profeffional knowledge and ex- 
perience in thefe matters; and he gave it as his opinion, that, very pro- 
bably, fomething of importance may be (tumbled upon in the neigh- 
bourhood ; and that, therefore, it would be proper to open up and exa- 
mine the old works, efpecially as the expenfe of fuch an cxaniinatica 
would not exceed the furn of 200 i. Sterling.

I  fmal i Hvulet called Ceres burn, which falls into the 
Eden a "little below Kemback mill. The banks of this 
ftream on both fides rife to a great height, in a great va- 
riety of inclinations, forming a den, called the Den of 
Dura, which prefents an affemblage of wild grandeur 
and natural beauty, fuch as is very rarely to be met. 
with Of this den, the windings are about a mile in 
length-, and, on both fides, the eye is delighted with * 
rich variety of pidurefque and romantic fcenery. The 
banks in fome parts flope gently towards the water, and 
3 re covered with a beautiful verdure of grafs, affording 
pafture for fheep j in other parts, they are perpendicu- 
jar or overhang the ftream at an elevation of 50 or 60 
feet; and in one place, the bank on the W. fide, forms it- 
felf into the figure of a very extenfive amphitheatre. Here 
and there we meet with fmall plantations of afh and oak, 
and fir, and gean; and where the banks are fteepeft, they 
prefent a-furface of broken faced rocks towards the bot- 
tom, and higher up, are covered with large thickets of 
wild hazles, which produce great quantities of nuts. It 
is not eafy to conceive a feene more beautiful, or more'

different {hades of verdure of the oak, the aih and the 
fir, joined to the wild variety of views, which every ftep 
almoft prefents, confpire to render it one of the moft de- 
licious fpots, which nature^ without the amftance of art, 
can form.

habitants have fuffered a great hardfhip from the want of 
a proper public teacher for their children *. The falary is 
only ioo merks Scots. And here I cannot help remarking 
again, that a proper provifion for the education of youth 
in the country pariflies of Scotland, fo as to give them 
an opportunity of acquiring at home the principles of 
grammar and a considerable knowledge of arithmetick, 
book-keeping, and menfuration, is a national objed of 
much greater magnitude than is generally fuppofed : It is 
certainly effentially neceffary to general improvement in 
the art of agriculture, an art upon the advancement of 
which the happinefs of individuals, and the profperity of 
the nation, in a great meafure, depend. At prefent, the 
falarics and perquifites of eftabliihed fchoolmafters in 
the country, are, in general, fo exceedingly fmall, that 
they do not exceed, and often hardly equal, the wages 
of an ordinary mechanick ; and it can fcarcely be expect- 
ed, that a perfon, properly qualified for communicating 
the neceffary branches of education, will devote himfelf 
for fuch an income to the molt laborious of all profef- 
iions.

in vain the few years that fhould have been devoted to the acquirement 
of ufeful knowledge, may eafily be conceived, and will be felt for many 
years to come. About a twelvemonth ago, the heritors generoufly a- 
greed to give the old fchoolmaffer an annuity of III. ios. Sterling, du- 
ring life, and his wife an annuity of 4I. Sterling during her life, after 
her hufband's death; upon condition of his refigning his office, which 
thefc annuities enabled him to do, without lofs either to himfelf cr fa-

of divinity, a very deferving young man, and an excellent teacher.

5 heritors, 4 of whom refide. The valued rent of the 
parifh is 231 2*. 13s. 4*. Scotch money. The flipend is- 
about 90I. a year, including communion elements. The 
church and manfe are both old buildings. The fchool 
and fchool-houfe is a new building, The glebe confifts 
©f about 5 acres of good df y flat land, upon a fandy bot- 
tom, and is enclofed. The principal and profeffors of 
the united college of St. Andrew's, are patronsof the pa- 
rifh, and titulars of the teinds. The fund for the main- 
tenance of the poor arifes from the intereft of 220L, 
Sterling, at 5 per cent. ; the rent of i|th acres of land, 
and of feveral feats in the church, mortcloth-money, 
fees of proclamation, and collections at the church door 
on Sunday, and may amount to about 20I. or 25I. a 
year. The money at intereft, and that with which the 
i^th acres of land was purchafed, feems to have arifen 
from the gradual accumulation of a long courfe of care- 
ful management. The only donation that appears to 
have been made to the feffien, is a legacy left about 2 
years ago by Mrs. Margaret Bethune of Blebo, a lady 
whofe beneficence to the poor during her lifetime, was 
moll extenlive and exemplary, and who, at her death, 
bequeathed to them the fum of 50L Sterling. Of this 
legacy, however, only 30I. were added to the feffion 
funds ; the other 20I. were immediately diflributed a- 
mong the poor, to alleviate, in fome meafure, their grief 
for the lofs of one of their greateft benefactors. With 
this fmall fund, the feflion is enabled to relieve the pref* 
fing neceflities of feveral families of well difpofed Chrif- 
tians, whom it hath pleafed Providence to reduce to cir-, 
cumftances of diftrefs, to foothe, in a fmall degree, the 
affliction of the widow and the fatherlefs, and to afford

a vutuous feeling of decent pride, prevent many from 
*Pplymg and receiving affiftance, who yet ftand much in 
need of a fmall addition to the income arifing from the 
fruits of their own induftry. 

Whether it be pr. cKcable in an advanced ftate of fo- 
ciety, to introduce fuch meliorations into the fituation of 
the labouring poor, as to enable them to rear a family 
of children, without fuffering the extremes' of hunger 
and nakednefs, and to lay up a fmall pittance for their 
fupport in ficknefs and old age,— whether this be a prac- 
ticable improvement, is a political queftion which it is 
not perhaps eafy to refolve ; but it is a certain fact,- 
which often affe&amp;s, with unavailing melancholy, the 
minds of thofe who are called by their profeffion to vifit 
the poor, that common labourers, in the time of their 
flrength, cannot afford to purchafe for a numerous fami- 
ly of children, the bare neceflaries of life ; and after 40, 
when the vigour of life is over, they generally languilli 
and decay for want of the more delicate nourifliment, 
which declining nature then feems to require. In the 
prefent ftate of things, it feems to be the intention of 
Providence, that even the induftrious poor fhould depend, 
for a confiderable fhare of their comfort in life, upon the 
generofity and beneficence of the rich among whom they 
live ; and the rich are, in this way, furnifhed with an 
opporturtity of gratifying the rnoft amiable feelings of 
the human heart, and of praftifing virtues from which 
the mind derives at once the higheft improvement and

Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

IT is impofilble for me to afcertain the ancient name 
of the parifli, except from the Icelandic hiftorians ; 
where we find, by Torfaeus's Hlftory of Orkney, that 
St. Magnus, Earl and Saint of Orkney, was killed at 
Eagleftiay, upon the fpot that we believe now the kirk 
is erected, which is a fteepled kirk. In Torfaeus's Hif- 
tory, the parifli is called In provincia de Byrgijherad. 
In lonai Orknyinga Jaga, the name is much the fame. 
After St. Magnus's death, he was brought from Eagle- 
fliay, and buried in the cathedral of Birfay *. Thefe 
Icelandic hiftorians fpeak much of the many miracles

which were performed at his tomb ; that I refer to them. 
Certain it is, that the firft feat of the bifhops of Orkney 
was in Birfay, as appears by the S. palace, a very fmall 
part of which is yet remaining ; and I do not wonder at 
it, becaufe Birfay is one of the moft beautiful fpots that 
could be chofen for the clergy ; and they had good fkill 
to choofe them, as is well feen through all Scotland; for 
they generally cultivated their fpots well. The modern 
name of the parifh is Birfay, which certainly is a cor- 
ruption of the ancient one. The form of the parifh I 
would take to be almoft a fquare, or an oblong fquare ; 
for confidering, from the fea fide to the uttermoft part 
of the parifh, it may be *jl Englifh miles; from the 
bridge perfectly acrofs, it, in my opinion, is 5 miles ; 
and, confidering the hills and dales, I mould compute 
the parifh at 37-i fquare miles, or thereabout. The 
parifh is bounded on the W. and N. fide by the fea. It 
is not mountainous, but is however hilly, containing 
much game, and pafture for cattle in the fummer time. 
The foil is very various in the barony of Birfay ; the 
N. fide in general is fhallow, it being a mixture of clay 
and thin fand, in fome places having a thin bottom of 
rock ; fome parts of the upper end of the N. fide hav- 
ing tolerable black ground, but rather wettifh ; S. fide, 
good fandy ground, but generally produces the fteadieft 
crops, except when the fea bleaches it. As to other 
parts of the parifh, I fhall give a defcription of them. 
When I fpeak of the vile weeds that torment their corn, 
I fhall add the quality of their ground, and why thefe 
weeds fhould be more prevalent there than in any other 
part of the parifh.

the barometer up at fet froft, and at the fame time the 
thermometer down- at 24 ; at which time, what we call 
ftrong beer, was frozen, while fmall beer broke the 
bottles by burfting.— As to the diftempers in our parilh, 
I do believe they proceed from cold and wetnefs, occa- 
lioned by wet clothes and inattention. Sometimes they 
produce nervous fevers, which affe£t women particular- 
ly ; fometimes in the fpring, fometimes in the harveft. 
In the inner part of the pariih, I have often feen ftrong

ing grafly. There are 2 or 3 fine burns, one of whick 
Waflies the middle of the barony, all full of fine trout ; 
and fometimes, through the barony burn, a falmon, by 
chance, may run up, but always at an unfeafonable time 
of the year. The extent of the fea coaft is about 10 miles; 
the more all rocky, except two little fpots, which are 
ftony, where our fifliing boats come in. The fifh catch- 
ed in our parifli, are a few poor cod, a few thin ling, a 
few haddocks now and then, a hallibut now and then ; 
and, in general, we have plenty of dog filh, caught up- 
on hand lines, which all our fifli are caught upon, being 
the cuftom of the parifh. Thefe dog fifli are fold to the 
neighbouring pariflies at about an average price of 6d. 
the dozen : the oil fold, for thefe few years paft, at 
an average of iod. the pint, or thereabout. The dog 
fifli are beft in June, July, and Auguft, when they 
have their livers in prime ; when that time pafies, they 
go to the northward. There are numbers of fmall fifli, 
fuch as coal fifli, and all their fry, of different ages, 
down to a year old ; at which time, I have feen them 
fold at the rate of 6d. the thoufand, at the fame time 
that worfe fifli of the fame kind was fold in Edinburgh 
market at 6d. the dozen, or thereabout, under the name 
of podlies ; ours are called fillicks *. Many other fifli 
are caught about this coaft, but in general in inconfi- 
derable quantities, called in this country milds, bergills, 
Ikate, fifli and frog, and many other fpecies that feldom 
are caught upon lines. Two of the beft kinds of fifli we 
have are the tulk and the llein-biter, but thefe are fel- 
dom caught. Numbers of whales of different kinds 
hover about the coaft, but none are caught. A few of

the fun filh appear upon our coaft, but none of them 
ftricken. Sometimes, indeed, a fmall whale will come 
in, or a fmall mark ; but in general they are of no con- 
ference. Few or no filh are fent out of this parifh to 
any proper market, except dog fifti as above. Many 
other fea animals, plants, fpunges, corals, ftiells, &amp;c. 
are found upon this coaft, which, to defcribe properly, 
would require a feparate Latin treatife of itfelf. There 
is plenty of fea weed, of the larger and finer kinds, 
drove afliore by ftormy weather ; and all made ufe of

efpecially on the fea coaft, where we are far from fuel ; 
and by eonfequence, what houfe dung can be made, can 
go but a ftiort way. 

Kelp. — Our ihores are not very large ; they may pro-

or thereabout, of kelp a-year. As to t.he price of mak- 
ing, it cannot be fo well afcertained, the fuperior, till

tenants. The price greatly varies* fince I came to this 
country, I have feen it as low as 2I, 10s. the ton, and 
fometimes at 9I. 

Tides, &amp;c — As to the courfes of our tides, the flood 
tide fets right in from the N. W. upon the point of 
the burgh of Birfay, from whence it fplits, one part to- 
wards Evie Sound, where it goes away with a rapid 
ftream towards Kirkwall • and the other part flips down 
by Sandwick fliore, till it get in to the indraught of 
Hoy Sound, where it becomes very ftrong. As to rocks, 
we have three of what we call rims, which are generally 
tccupied by ©u/ fiftiermen as their bell fiftiing grounds :

and, by the bed accounts we have had from them, the 
flioals of Marwick are 16 fathom ; the S. head 14 fa- 
thom ; and the rim ihoals deepens from 20 to 40 fa- 
thom, or upwards, until they come to the N. head, 
which is only about 10 feet, all at low water. I have 
been upon thefe Ihoals feveral times ; and I have good 
reafon to believe, that what the fiflxermen fay is true. 
No light-houfe is erefted, and we think one could be of 
no fervice, becaufe it might lead the flapping out of the 
W. Sea, where they could have no fbelter. The only 
head lands we have are called Marwick Head, the Bragh 
Head, and the North Craig. The only harbours for boats 
are, Skibbaygoe ; Caftragoe for a fummer place ; as al- 
fo one in the S. fide of the barony, which contains 4 
boats ; one in Marwick, which contains 3, but it is on- 
ly a fummer habitation ; for except they had Caftragoe 
under lee, they could not keep a boat in Marwick or 
the S. fide. 

Mountains, &amp;c. — There are no remarkable mountains 
in this parifli ; and as to hills, I never took the height 
of them by any proper menfuration, nor do I think 
them worth pains, becaufe I really believe the barome- 
ter and thermometer would make them of but little 
height ; they are nothing like Hoy : They are covered 
with heath, and what we call lubba, a fort of grafs 
which feeds our cattle in the fummer time ; it generally 
confifts of different fpecies of carices, plain bent, and 
other moor grafies. No volcanic appearances, nor any fi- 
gured flones, are to be feen in this parifli ; nor any have 
foffil, marine bodies, or any petrified parts of animals, 
yet been obferved. There are indeed fome fprings, 
which throw up a fpecies of lime, of no determined

marble, little is to be got in this parifh, if any. What 
we call flag, which is a thick kind of flate, as alfo a 
thinner kind of coarfe grey flate, both of which are u- 
fed in covering farm, cottager, and other houfes, are 
found in this parifh, but not of a very good quality, nor 
in large quantities. We have plenty of other kinds of 
building flones, except free ftone, of which I think we 
have none. All our flones are applied to the building- 
of mere country houfes. Sometimes the N. W. part of 
our parifh is very fubjea to fea gufting, but no inun- 
dations. 

In the mifly year which all Europe felt, I obferved a 
phenomenon at the manfe of Birfay : The fun at mid 
day appeared very dufky, and furrounded with circles, 
curioufly interfering one another ; of which I took a 
drawing, which is hereunto annexed. 

Beqfts, Birds, &amp;c. — The wild quadrupeds of this pa- 
rifh are, rabbits, the brown or Norwegian rat, the fhort 
tailed field moufe, common mice, and a fmall fpecies of 
mice, commonly called here wights, which I have ne- 
-ver obferved in Scotland. Amphibious animals are, 
the common feal and common otter ; the fkin of the lat- 
ter fells at a high price, fometimes at a guinea, more of 
lefs, according to the feafon they are caught. The 
market for them is Hamburgh, and other places through 
the E. Sea. — We have plenty of the common rock birds, 
but none peculiar to this parifh, all being found in the 
bold fhores round Scotland. — The parifh of Birfay is 
not more famous for a breed of black cattle than any of 
the neighbouring parifhes 5 they are fmall, and gene-

but we fuppofe, the hooks have been ill kept, becaufe we fee the differ, 
enei- of marriages and baptifms in fome year.- is very great, which 
we fhall account for. Abouc 110 years ngo, namely, in the eighties, 
commonly called Brand's years, an univerfal fterility prevailed in Ork- 
ney, when the people died in hundreds ; the lands were laid wafte for 
want of ftrength both of man and beaft, and no feed ; many of the beft 
places were totally relinquifhed ; and the miferable Ikeletons of thefe 
ridges may be feen to this day. Even when they began to recover them~ 
i'elves, they were not able to manage their ufual poffeffions, but juft 
cut away the fward of the one part to put upon the top of the other, 
for want of manure ; and thus the cafe appears till this very day. 

Marriages in 1680 none. 

In 1681 only 4. Baptifrns, 11. 

In 1693 •— IX. Baptifms, 14, 

As to the population of the parilh, it will be feen by the foregoing 
lift, and thofc that will follow. It has been fluctuating, for rcafons that 
will be fhown hereafter. The people at that time were perfectly fta- 
tionary, and even laws were made for reftridting them from leaving their 
*wn country, or even going aboard of fljips ; which had a very good 
effect in keeping people at home for recovering their ftate of defolatioc.

* It fhould be adverted to, that the years 1739, 1740, and 1741. 
were bad years, in which many died for want ; however, the ftate of 
thefe years cannot be well known at this time of day. The parifh may 
not much differ from what it has been 5, 10, or 25 years ago, with re- 
gard to the annual births, and the whole population ; but it muft be 
attentively noticed, that there are great emigrations from our parifh ; 
numbers of our young people go to fea, to Hudfon's Bay, and to trades 
oat of the parifh. Our young female people run off to Newcastle, Leith, 
and other places, and never take certificates, which is now out of fafliion, 
and may be very difcouraging to the more honeft fet ; becaufe every one 
now, it feemp, takes fervants juft as they get them — There are 3 or 
4 old men about 80, but none above at prefent. I have known fome 
arrive at 90 or 95 years. We have a number between 60 and 70 ; and, 
in general, our people arrive to a good oli .age; owing, I fuppofe, to 
temperance^ drinking beer, and eating fome animal food, working hard, 
and fleeping cheerfully, and following their employments with alacrity.

ProduBions, &amp;c— The productions of the parifli are 
oats and bear, or big, as it is generally called, and in 
the gardens cabbage. The gardens will produce early 
cabbage and colliflower • as alfo onions, leeks, garlick; 
parfnips, carrots, turnips, and fmall fallad herbs : very 
fine flowers wiU in fome years likewife blow, which I 
liave tried. There are no trees — We have taken notice 
of the number of flieep already ; and the w6ol, in fome 
fmall diftrifts, is good ; that about the mores is much 
hurt with the fand, which deftroys its fabrick, and like- 
wife fpoils the mutton, by the flieep feeding upon fea 
ware. The parifli fupplies itfelf with provifions, and 
fells a little : in good years, it generally exports to the 
neighbouring towns. They fow their oats in March, 
and their bear about the latter end of April or begin- 
ning of May, old ftyle ; and begin to reap about the 
middle of Auguft, and fometimes later, according to the 
feafon. A fmall quantity of marl is found, but of other 
curious earths we have none. Some bitumen, which is 
the fubftance of peats, is to be met with, and in fome 

places 

At an average, a marriage may produce five children ; I have baptized 
three at one birth, and often twins. In my opinion, the average may 
be admitted. 

Some, in the bad ycar.% as mentioned before, died ; but in the year 1782, 
&amp;c. one died, and many were like to die. However, government gave' 
them meal in thefe bad years, once for nothing, and once for payment. 
As to fuicides, there are two that have happened in late remembrance : 
A man that drowned himfelf 4 for what reafon is not known ; another 
poor girl, in my time, had baken her own wedding bannocks, and, as may 
be fuppofed, out of fome averfion to her fweetheart, threw herfelf a- 
way. Many are loft by accident, by boats, &amp;c. None have been ba- 
mmed from this parifli in our memory. None leave the parilh for want 
©f employment ; indeed, we want hands, becaufe our young fellows go 
off in hopes of greater wages, as the farmers well feel ; the N. W., &amp;c. 
being their bait.

laces it will fpring out of the rocks remarkably thin ; 
pother places of the country, it is found of the con- 
fiftence of pitch. The parifh has this advantage, that 
part of it lies near the fea, and for that reafon can .have 
fifli and oil enough to ferve this parifh and other parifli- 
es beyond it : At the fame time, it is far from large bo- 
roughs, and mull labour under a great difadvantage, 
by carrying its commodities to the towns of Kirkwall 
and Stromnefs, which are the greateft markets in this 
country. 

Language.— As to the language, it is Englifh, mix- 
ed with a Norwegian accent, owing to the ancient 
connexion between the two countries, but is now much 
bettered by our connexion with ft rangers, and by that 
of fuch of our own young men as have been abroad *► 

Rent, Stipend, Poor, Sec— The valued rent of the pa- 
rifh is 3144I. us- Scots ; the real rent depends upon the 
fiars, which are always at the will of the heritors. The 
value of the living, including the glebe, is 60I. The 
patron is Sir Thomas Dundas of Kerfe, Baronet.— The 
church was repaired in 1760, and the manfe was built 
in 1. 761 ; but both have been kept in bad repair ever

* All our names are derived from the Norwegian language. Every 
hill and every dale are of Norwegian derivation in this parifli; as 
Reveybill, Gartbnia, Smeurquoy, that is to fay, butter land ; Smerrabjets, as 
is pronounced here, that is, where good grafs grows, which makes but- 
ter. Of other hills, are Eringlefiold, BaU'uJiddy and other fuch names. 
As to our meadows, they are always called Sealers. Though I am little 
acquainted with the Norwegian language, I underfland a Seater to be a. 
place for maintaining milch cows ; and thefe Seater: are to this moment 
properly adapted for it : we have many in this parifh, namely, Kirk- ftata; 
■ JJbi-fealcr, Stater, Fol-featcr, Overty-fcatcr, Eaflbyfeater, &amp;c.

Sir Thomas Dundas, the greateft heritor non-refiding ; 
fmall heritors refiding 11 ; non-refiding 8.— The poor 
of this pariih have been, at an average, about 14 or 15 
thefe number of years, and the alms are collected bj 
the hands of the elders in their boards, and given out, 
at the difcretion of the feffion, to poof perfons, accord- 
ing to their need. The parifli really cannot clothe their 
poor, becaufe their funds are too fmall. Legacies we 
have none. The annual produce of the alms of the pa- 
rilh is below 20s. Sterling a-year; to which may be add- 
ed, the mortcloth money, as alfo the marriage money, 
which, by the cuftom of this country, is il. Scots each, 
wrfich is really the property of the minifter, as our 
public records can atteft ; but it is thrown into the pub- 
lic fund by the prefent minifter, and he believes by

* As to the prices of provifions in this parifli, we feldom buy or fell 
between one another ; fo that the prices cannot be well ascertained. But 
when a cow is difpofed of, it may, at an average price, be fold at 16 1. 
Scots ; a flieep at 3 s. Sterling ; a fwine at 5 s. Sterling ; butter at j d. 
the mark of t\ lb. avoirdupois ; corn, counted by the fuperiors fiars op 
and down, and always paid by the name of malt, at 11^ ftones each meil, 
the county fiar price at 61. Scots each meil malt; and the oat meal 
fometimes 8 1. } fometimes 9 1. Scots each meil, of the fame weight. — 
We have no day-labourers in hufbandry. As to boat carpenters, they 
are generally hired from Stfomnefs, and work by the piece, at zs.the foot 
of keel. Bricklayers of mafons r we employ none; becaufe Ourmafons are 
felf-taught. Tailors are generally paid in days victuals and corn by the 
inhabitants for their work ; and other workmen much in the fame 
manner. Weavers in general work by the hundred, and take the fame 
prices as others of the fame trade in Scotland. — The fuel here is peat al- 
together, brought from the diftance of 6 miles ; and erery man procures 
his own, except the minifter and the fchoolmaftcr ; as alfo cottagers and 
tjandicraftfmen, to whom the tenants lead moft cheerfully. At an ave-

Antiquities.— There are feveral {landing {tones orobe- 
lifcs in this parilh ; one of which {lands by itfelf, and 
gives name to a very good piece of land, which is now 
called Stanefgarth, which is certainly of Norwegian ex- 
traction, being the gkth or garth which was firft ereft- 
ed round the {tone, now in good arable land. Next is 
Stanerandy, without the walls of the barony, which is 
two {tones upon a tumulus, that has been dug into, by 
whom I know not : it feems to be the only name-ftone 
that ever I heard of, and perhaps may be called Ran- 
dolph's Stone, after the warrior that might have been 
buried there. There are three others, but very fmall, 
among a parcel of very large tumuli, none of which 
have been touched ; which, however, marks the fcenes 
of other years, of which we have no tradition. Re- 
mains of Popifli chapels are many, becaufe every Eryf- 
land of 18 penny land had one for matins and vefpers, 

but now all are in ruins f.

rage, the expcnfe of a common cottager may be computed, when he earns 
his own bread, with a family of 4 children, at 81. Sterling a-year. 
With regard to hufbandry fervants, it juft depends upon the high or 
low farms; fome giving 3I. to their men fervants, and about a guinea 
to their women fervants ; which is not paid them all in money, but in 
commodities. As to domeftic fervants, there are none, except my own, 
in the parifh.— From the number of horfes above mentioned, it will be 
be eafy to judge what is the number of ploughs, becaufe the greateft 
farmers have only three, drawn by three horfes each. The ploughs of 
Orkney are peculiar to the county, like nothing except themfelves ; 
however, they fomething referable the Egyptian plough, but the Egyp- 
tian plough is more fimple. There are 6 carts in the parifh. 

I There are feveral names of Pi&amp;ifh caftles, which even now give 
names to places, fuch as Cajlragoe, &amp;c. As to camps, roads, and forts, 
there are none, unlefs we can call the borough of Birfay a camp of de- 
fence in times of diftrefs. Towards the land fide, where it is only ac- 
ceffible, we can to this moment mark the traces of the ancient wall that

Chara&amp;cr, Occupation, &amp;c. of the People The peo- 
ple in this parifli are good, honeft, manly, decent men. 
The general fizes of the people are thus : My clerk, tho 
writer of this paper, is 6 feet i inch high ; we have ma- 
ny 6 feet high ; and, in general, they are very flrong 
men, being hard wrought. We can hear of no parti- 
cular tall men ; in general, the people of this pariiri 
are above the middle lize : they are, in general, very 
induftrious, and even laborious ; but at prefent we have 
no Handing manufacture of any kind. The women fpin 
a great deal of lint for fo much a hank, or buy bags of 
lint, at about a guinea, which they work up into linen, 
by an 800 reed, which is fold at Newcaftle, Edinburgh, 
and Shetland, at about nd. the yard, befides many 
pieces of finer and coarfer grifts for themfelves. The 
woollen manufacture is not much employed, except for 
mere convenience : there may be about 40 or 50 wea- 
vers, moftly employed in the linen branch, and a few 
are employed in the woollen for family ufe, and thefe

defended it, together with a great number of foundations of fmall huti 
within the fortification ; which furely may be attributed to the inhabi- 
tants, to fecure their beft effects againft invaders, but could not fecure 
their cattle, horfes, &amp;c, becaufe there is no grafs. The a:ra of this for- 
tification, and others of the fame kind, I leave it to be judged upon, as 
fuch places are quite frequent, both in Shetland, fuch as the Mule of 
Unft, and in the other end of the mainland of Orkney, called the Mule- 
head of Deernefs, the Burgh of Murray, and, indeed, in all other places 
denominated Burghs, that is to fay, infolatcd headlands projecting to the 
fea ; which, in thefe rude times, before the invention of gunpowder, 
might be deemed very fufficient for the fafety of the inhabitants 3gainft 
incurfive enemies. We may mention, by the by, that in the Burgh of 
Birfay there is a little chapel of modern workmanfhip, of which only 
one window, and part of the wall, remains, faid to be dedicated to St. 
Peter, to which the fuperftitious reforted; but St. Peter and his chape J 
are now much neglected.

^Moft of the people of the barony and Marwick are 
bred fifhermen ; and multitudes of our young men go to 
fea, both in merchant and in his Majefty's fervice ; few 
in proportion of whom ever return to fettle here In 
this parifh, 1 8 fifhing boats run from 4 different fum- 
mer ftations, befides 2 fmall ones ufed occafionally, 
Thefe boats are from 16 to i 7 i feet of keel ; and, with 
their whole tackle, may coft 10I. at an average. We 
have no large veffels, nor any proper harbours. It is 
very difficult to afcertain what number have entered in- 
to any of his Majefty's mips during any preceding war ; 
the parifh generally give a bounty of 2 guineas each to 
3 men, when required ; but doubtlefs many entered or 
have been impreffed, that have not come to our know- 
ledge. ,No perfon has inlifted as a foldier from this 
parifh during this century. 

As to their economy, they cannot fpend much ; but 
there is a great odds within thefe 20 years, both in ap- 
parel and living. When I came firft to the parifh, there 
was not a piece of Englifh cloth to be feen on a man's 
back ; no figured waiflcoats or velvet breeches ; their 
ftockings made of their own wool, their fhoes of their 
own leather, tied with good ftrong fufficient points 1 
Now the cafe differs ; the young fellows, inftead of bon- 
nets, almoft all wear hats ; upon Sunday, a fuit of de- 
cent S. country clothes, with cotton waiflcoats, and cordu- 
roy breeches ; fome few wear cotton or thread ftockings ; 
fhoes much the fame as formerly ; buckles univerfal. The 
living, in general, among the lower people and fervants, is 
much better, owing to the rife of prices of what they can 
£ifpofe of, and perhaps by making a more liberal ufe of

what the pari* produces. There is not much tea no* 
fugar expended here. The xvomen, on Sundays or holi. 
«ays, come out neatly drclTed in calicoes, calirnancoes, 
or neat fluffs, with grey or brown cloaks, fcarlet cloaks, 
ana a great number of beautiful fcarlet plaids ; their li- 
nen fine, clean, and neat. The reafon of the fuperior 
finery Q £ late among the young people, may be attri- 
buted to the following particulars : ift, They have a 
good part of their own earning to themfelves ; 2dly, 
New methods of earning are daily occurring, and the 
price of their annual labour produces much more than 
it did jo years ago. The old men and women are juft 
in the ftyle of their forefathers. As they are fprung 
from the Norwegians, they flill continue to wear good 
ftrong black clothes without dying, called by the ancient 
Norfe, Vadmcll, and by them wrought in a loom called 
Upftagang ; but now wrought in the common manner. 

Property in this parifli is juft as in other pariflies, 
now and then fhifting from hand to hand; and when land 
is fold, efpecially in fmall parcels, it fetches very high 
prices ; in general, at 40 or 50 years purchafe, fome- 
tunes a great deal more, and feldom lefs *„ 

The 

* The people in this parlfh are very humane, generally, by helping their 
poorer neighbours, both at the mills eye, and at their own houfes ; fo that 
our poor, whether old or paft work, or young orphans, not come to it, are 
not a very great burthen upon us. Very few fliips are wrecked upon this 
coaft, becaufe it is dangerous ; but one inftance we may mention, of real hu- 
man' ity, was in the cafe of a floop belonging to Leith, which had one man im- 
yrefTed, the mafter knocked overboard, and none but two apprentice boys left 
to govern it, who wtre far from being able to hoift the mainfail. The flcop, 
thus left in diftrefs, was noticed by our Birfay boats, who immediately went 
aboard of her, and part of the crew of one of them carried her into Strom- 
nefs, where they anchored her fafely ; and the veflel being claimed, our Jads 
had but a moft trifling reward for their trouble, only about a guinea, though 
the Stipmnefs pilots would have t*ken much more for taking her in through 
Hoy Sound, and perhaps claimed falvage alfo. 



OfBirfay and Han-ay. 



The people are facial among themfelves, and fee,;, 
contented ; and their circumftances may be guefTed from 
tke pun&amp;uality of paying their rents, which, except 
in a very few inftances, they do as exactly, or perhaps 
more fo, than any pariih in the mainland. 

Hints for Improvement, and Mifcellaneous Ohferva- 
tions. The only method I can fee how their circum- 
ftances can be meliorated is, by a change of climate, in- 
troducing a new method of agriculture, granting leafes 
for a reafonable time, fo that a man could have fome 
hopes of enjoying the fruit of his own labours. But 
thefe, and many other improvements that may be fug- 
gefted, will, I dare fay, never be obtained while this ge- 
neration endures on the face of the earth. There is only 
one bridge worth notice, conhfting of 2 fmall arches, 
and is in great difrepair ; we have no made roads, nor 
any turnpikes. There is fuch a payment as road and 
rogue money ; but how taken up, or how applied, I am 
not well informed. As the pariih was never properly 
meafured, they value their land in planks of 40 fathom 
fquare ; fo that the rent cannot be well afcertained, but 
it is in general very low. Little pafhire ground is let out 
here for hire, but every man has a fmall proportion 
according as he labours : all hill pafture is in common. 
We have one farm, which, together with the mill and 
the links, pays to Sir Thomas Dundas a rent of 30I. 
Sterling yearly ; another pays 30 meils malt ; and fome 
others pay a great deal lefs. The number of farms is 
rather diminifliing, but this only in a few inftances, and 
by flow degrees. Several people, and their predeceffors, 
have lived upon the fame fpot for upwards of this cen- 
tury. Every farm-Head in the parifli is enclofed with art

out fence of earth, but not divided. The people have it not 
in their power to judge whether it would be of any ad- 
vantage to them or not ; though doubtlefs it might, as 
may be feen by fome fmall trials that have been made *. 

PARISH 



* There is little alteration in this parifli fince 1782 or 1783, except the 
difference of crop*, which, for fome years, have been very bad, particularly 
from 1782 to 1788, others middling till 1792, which was moft excellent, and al- 
io 1793, which is a good faving crop, only fufFered a little by the rains in har- 
▼eft, which rendered it late in ingathering. In 1783, we received meal from go- 
vernment gratis, whi«h was diftributed without diftinftion to thofe who really 
had neceffity for it, whether farmers or artizans, or others. In 1784, they re- 
ceived a new fupply, but that was paid for at a moderate price. The other 
bad years above mentioned, could not fupply themfelves ; but a great deal of . 
meal and potatoes was imported by merchants, who made the beft profits they 
could, no doubt. There are neither cities nor villages in this pari/h, and only 
one ancient ruinous building, which was the palace of the Earls of Orkney, 
though built at different times, and by different men, namely, the Sinclairs, com- 
monly ftyled princes and counts of Orkney. Robert Stuart, natural brother to 
Queen Mary, as alfo his fon Patrick, made great additions ; it is now much in 
ruins, but has been built upon the model of Holyroodhoufe, being a fquare 
area built upon the four fides, with a well in the middle ; but for the largenefs of 
the building, it has had little conveniency according to the tafte of the times. 
Above the gate was the famous infeription, which, among other points of ditty, 
coft Earl Patrick his head. It runs as follows : Dominui Rtbirtus Stuartns Jiliut 
Jace&amp;i quinti Rex Scotorumboc opus injlruxit ; and above his coat of arms was the 
following motto : Sicfuit, eft, et erit. The ftone, as far as I know, is now in the 
pcfieffion of the Earl of Morton, to whom the lands were fold, and by him fold 
to Sir Lawrence Dundas, in whofe fon's poffeffion the greateft eftate of the pa- 
rifli does ftill continue. As to the fchools in this parifli, we have a legal paro- 
chial fchool paid by the heritors at 900 merks Scotch, befides fome perquifitej, 
which are generally paid in kind. The fchoolmafter has likewife the feffion 
clerkihip, which yields ao 1. Scotch. 

Two charity fchools have been eftablifhed in this parifli, by a mortification 
left by Nkol Spence, late church agent, which is the rent of his houfes in 
Edinburgh, lying in Warrifton's clofe ; as likewife one in Harray, which flwll be 
mentioned in its proper place. 

There are no fettled inns in this parifli, but plenty of ale hoofes, as there are 
no gaugcrs. As to the morality of the people, it may be juft as well hurt by 
Orkney ale as burning whi/ky,

PARISH OF HARRAY. 

Name, Soil, Air, &amp;c.-The pariih of Harray is un- 
der the fame miniftry as Birfay, and is joined with 
Birfay at N. W. ; towards the V/. it touches Sandwick; 
W., S. W., and S. it is bounded by a large brackifh 
loch, commonly called the Loch of Harray ; and on the 
other quarters, by Stennefs, a fmall part of Firth, and 
the hills that part it from Randale. What the origin 
of the name is, I know not, nor ever read of it in an- 
cient hiftory. It is a very irregular parifh ; and, be- ( 
tween arable and uncultivated ground, may contain 21 
fquare miles, being about 6 miles long, and 3^ miles 
broad. In general, Harray is flat and rather fwampy, 
interfeaed by a great number of very dangerous burns, 
which, at moft feafons, ruih down in perfed torrents 
from the adjacent hills, and often occafion danger and 
even death to unwary travellers. The foil varies very 
much ; in fome places tolerably fertile, and in others 
very barren ; the nature of it is generally very fpongy, 
or elfe very hard and channelly, with but a very fmall 
flratum of earth. By the nature of the earth, the air 
muft be moift, and often produces moft fevere colds, 
dropfies, fcrofulas, and other cutaneous diftempers, 
which may be owing to a watery diet, fuch as cabbage, 
gtc. There is one large loch, which produces a great 
quantity of moft excellent fifli of the trout kind, and a 
letter one, which fupplies their mill. The filh in this 
pariih are never fent to market, and are in beft perfec- 
tion in the fummer time, efpecially from May till Sep- 
tember. — The hills are about the fame height as thofe 
in Birfay. The meadows are often fubjed to inunda-

tions about Lammas, which fweep away the hay, or 
otherwife deftroy it, by rendering the meadows a per- 
feft gutter, fo that they cannot be cut ; and this is often 
the cafe, as it will happen in a night's time, owing to 
the hill fpeats. There are feveral inftances of thunder 
having done mifchief in Harray , one in particular with- 
in the memory of man, which caufed a water fpout, 
that, by removing the earth, left a great gulph many 
yards broad, down to the rock, and near a quarter of a 
mile long. The parifli breeds a number of fmall cattle, 
but none of any peculiar fize ; even what they have are 
very ill kept, being fed through the whole fummer up- 
on hill pafture, and that of the very worft kind, except 
in two or three inftances. 

Population. — The population of the parifli of Harray 
is much nearer upon a par, for this dozen of years back, 
than the parifli of Birfay, owing to the people of Harray 
not having the fame fpirit of enterprife j they are en- 
tirely unacquainted with the fea, and though a few of 
them may have learnt to build boats, or go to Hudfon's 
Bay, or perhaps work as mafons in the neighbourhood, 
yet few of thefe are loft to the parifli, they being gene- 
rally employed near at hand, and pafling their fpare time 
with their friends. Few or none go to fea from Harray; 
and only two have gone for foldiers that I know of in 
my time, both of whom have fince returned. Fe- 
vers are fometimes very deftruftive, and the fmall pox 
often fatal. The young men of Harray are pretty 
fond of quarrelling over their ale ; but I have never 
heard of any murders. Many accidents happen upon 
the lochs, by people falling through the ice, and dying 
by cold. None have been baniflied ; one fellow fled for 

inceft, 



Of Birfay and Harray. 331 



i nc ert, and has not appeared again ; and another fled for 
petty thefts. 

Produ&amp;ions The productions of the parifli are com- 
mon bear and fmall oats, which, in fome years, do not 
fupply themfelves ; but in very good years they may 
fpare a fmall quantity. The neareft average that can 
be made, without an exad lift, may be, of horfes 172, 
or rather more ; cattle 258, or rather more : they have 
a few ftieep in Harray, but not fo many as their bounds 
might contain ; fome of thefe are very fine woolled, but 
that has been of late years very much hurt, by intro- 
ducing a mongrel breed of Englifli rams, which not on- 
ly render their wool rough and hairy, but brought the 
fcab among them, which killed them by fcores ; many 
likewife perifh in the mow. They fow and reap their 
crops nearly as in Birfay. There is marl in plenty, of 
a very good .quality, and much ufed. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations All the advantage the 

parifti has, is being pretty near to the fuel, which is 
very good of its kind, and neareft to coal of any peats 
that ever I faw ; burns with a clear Heady flame, and 
when charred, will work iron very well. Its disad- 
vantages are, a want of fea fiih, of which they can 
procure but few. The ancient Norfe language long 
prevailed in Harray, more fo than in any part of the 
country, but is now worn out : the names of places are 
all undoubtedly Norwegian, Heuon a Zidna, a knoll to 
lie upon ; Rufland-Burghs, compounded words which end 
in burghs or garths, which fignify an enclofure of 
greater or leffer extent j with many others limilar to 
thofe mentioned in Birfay parilh. The land rent of this

parifli cannot be well afcertained, as it is parted among 
near an hundred fmall heritors, many of whom kbour 
their own fmall portions ; but the valued rent is 1696I. 
3s. 1 id. Scots. The glebe in Harray may be worth about 
45I. Scots. The church of Harray got a thorough repair 
in the year 1778, but has never been touched fince ; fo 
that if not attended to, I fuppofe, it will foon be where 
it was. We have a number of poor, but no funds ; 
fcarce being able tq pay our clerk and officers. 

The number of ploughs in the parifli is about 57, 
together with 30 carts, drawn by one ox each : One 
Handing ftone, without any tradition concerning it : 
Many Pi&amp;ifli caftles, all in ruins ; they feem to have 
ferved for watch towers and fortalices in ancient times, 
but they could have faved nothing but lives and houfe- 
hold goods ; they could not have preferved cattle, as 
their dimenfions were too fmall. The people in general 
jn this parifli are about the middle fiz.e, few above it. 
Property is ihifting fometimes from hand to hand, but 
moflly in trifling bits. 

The people are as well contented as poor people can 
be expected ; can put a new fuit pf clothes upon their 
backs now and then, partly of their own making, and 
partly bought ; and can make a feaft, at a wedding or a 
chriftening, on their own provifions, with a drink of 
their own ale. — The enclofures are much the fame as in 
Birfay. — The poverty of Harray was very great in fome 
late bad years ; infomuch that I divided 8 bolls of 
meal into 96 parts, and every perfon that applied got 
according to their need \ they, in thefe years, certainly 
lived very miferably, moflly upon milk and cabbage, 
but none died. — In this parifli, there is 1 fchool, at pre- 
fent vacant, partly maintained by a mortification given

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1139052">CRATHY</name> 
        and <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q897175">BRAE MAR</name>. 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery of 
Kincardine O'Neil.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Charles M 'Hardy.</head> 


<p>
Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

CRATHY is of Gaelic derivation, probably from 
Cruaidh-achadh, " hard or ftony fields," as the 
parilh, in general, is rocky, and full of ftones ; or from 
Craoibh-achadh, " fields or ridges, interfered with wood." 
The ancient name of Braemar was Ceann-atidrochait, 
which, in Gaelic, fignifies " bridgend." There is no 
certainty at what period they were united. They are 
fituated in that diflri&amp; of the connty called Marr, in the 
yery middle of the Grampian hills. They are diftant 
from Aberdeen about 50 Englifli miles. The length of 
both parifb.es from E. to W. is about 40 miles, and a- 
bout 20 in breadth ; the inhabited part of which is 
about 30 miles long, and from 6 to 10 in breadth. The 

parifli 



Of Crathy and Braemar. 335 



parifli of Braemar is fuppofed to be more elevated above 
the level of the fea, and farther removed in every direc- 
tion from the coaft, than any other parifh in Scotland. 

Climate, Soil, Produce, &amp;c.—The climate is healthy, 
and many of the inhabitants live to a good old age. The 
principal diflempers are fevers, gravel, rheumatifm, and 
cholic. When a malignant kind of the fmall pox prevails, 
it carries away a number of children ; yet the body of 
the people are not reconciled to inoculation. The foil is 
various ; in fome parts a light loam, in others a thin 
clay ; but, in general, mallow and fandy ; yet, when 
properly cultivated, produces, in a favourable feafon, 
good crops. The ordinary crops raifed by the country 
people, are, oats, bear and potatoes. Turnips and clover, 
with rye grafs, are cultivated by a few gentlemen. 
There was very little lintfeed, till of late, fown in thefe 
parifhes, although it was found to anfwer exceedingly 
well, for this reafon, that there was no lint-mill in the 
county ; but that grievance is now, in a great meafure, 
removed, as Mr. Farquharfon of Invercauld has built a 
lint-mill at Caftletown of Braemar. The confequence 
is, that the people, in general, fow more lintfeed ; and 
from the advantages they derive from this branch of 
farming, it is probable that, in a few years hence, ano- 
ther lint-mill, at leaft, will be neceflary in this part of 
the country *. 

Mountains 



* As there is no map of the pari flies, it is impofllble to fay what number of 
acres are in tillage. Oats are fown in April, or fooner, if the feafon permits, 
then lintfeed, and potatoes, and bear from the beginning to the middle of May. 
The time of harveft is extremely variable ; beginning fometimes abeut the 15th 
qf Auguft, and fometimes not till the ift or 5th of September.

Mountains and Minerals — The greater part of the 
two parifhes is mountainous. Some of the mountains 
are probably the higheft in Scotland : Of this defcription 
are the mountains of Loch-na-garaidh, on the S. fide of 
the parifli ; Binn-na-baird on the N. ; and Binn-na- 
muick-duidh on the W., &amp;c. Upon thefe mountains, 
and others connected with them, there is fnow to be 
found all the year round ; and their appearance is ex- 
tremely romantic, and truly alpine. On them are found 
pellucid ftones, of the nature of precious Hones, e- 
qually tranfparent, beautiful in their colour ; and fome 
of them, particularly the emerald, as hard as any orien- 
tal gem of the fame kind. The moft common are, the 
brown, of different fhades, and next the topaz. There 
are alfo beautiful amethyfts and emeralds, though thefe 
are rare to be met with, particularly the latter ; and 
what is remarkable, amethyfts only arc to be found on 
Loch-na-garaidh ; emeralds, topazes, and the brown on 
Binn-na-baird j topazes and the brown kinds only on 
Binn-na-muick-duidt, and the other mountains in thefe 
parifhes. The firft of thefe ftones that attracted notice, 
and were cut by a lapidary, were found on Cairn-gorm, 
in Strathfpey, but conneacd with the above ridge of 
mountains, which gave rife, though very improperly, to 
the general name of Cairn-gorm ftones. Both the pa- 
rifhes abound with granite of different kinds, and vari- 
ous fhades, which is ufed for building. It is very hard 
in its nature, and when polifhed, looks as well as marble. 
There is limeftone in great profufion. On Mr. Far- 
quharfon of Invcrcauld's property, in the parifk of Brae- 
mar, is a little quarry, from which are brought almolt 
all the Hates made ufe of in this country. 

Forcjls, 



Of Crathy and Braemar. 337 

Forefts, Woods, &amp;c— The greater part of the united 
crimes of Crathy and Braemar, have been originally 
King's foreft, and known by the name of the Foreft of 
Marr This foreft, with thofe of the Duke of Atholi, 
and Mr. Farquharfon of Invercauld in Perthftnre, and 
the Duke of Gordon in Badenoch and Glenaven, confti- 
tuted the principal part of the great northern Caledo- 
nian foreft. In the deepeft moffes or morafles, within 
the immenfe range of extenfive forefts above mentioned, 
there are to be found large logs, or roots of wood (even 
where there is not a tree now to be feen ftanding), which 
affords the moft incontrovertible evidence, that they have 
formerly been over-run with timber. 

The only part of the foreft of Marr, which is now 
ufed as kept foreft, is in Braemar. The Earl of Fife 
and Mr. Farquharfon of Inyercauld, have, each of them, 
extenfive forefts, which are well flocked with red and 
roe deer. From the great care and attention which has 
been paid to thefe animals for fome years paft, they are 
now fo numerous and domefticated, that they are to be 
feen in numbers from the windows of the houfes of In- 
vercauld and Marr-Lodge. At the latter place, about the 
beginning of May, 100 flags have been feen at once 
feeding on the lawn. The foil of this country, in gene- 
ral, is favourable to the growth of foreft trees. Be- 
fides birch, a kind of poplar, known by the name of 
quaking afli, the alder, the roan tree, or mountain aft), a 
fpecies of the willow, &amp;c. &amp;c. There are, in thefe pa- 
rifhes, extenfive natural fir woods, belonging to the Earl 
of Fife, Mr. Farquharfon of Invercauld, Mr. Gordon of 
Abergeldie, and Mr. Farquharfon of Inverey ; as alfo, 
large plantations of Scotch firs, and other trees. Mr. 
Farquharfon of Inyercauld alone has planted above 14 
Vol. XIV, U u millions

nulhons qf the former, and upwards of a million of 
larch, with a great variety of others. Mr. Gordon of 
Abergeldie has planted Scotch firs to a very confiderable 
extent, befides other trees ; and the Earl of Fife has, 
alfo made plantations of Scotch firs, and other kinds.. 

Rivers, Lakes, gic — The Dee is the principal river. 
Jt has its fource on a hill called Gaibh-chor-Bhe, iq 
Lord fife's foreft ; and running through the united pa- 
rities of ^raemar and Crathy, and a great many other, 
parities, with yaft rapidity, empties itfelf into the; 
German ocean at Aberdeen, at the distance of about 90 
miles, in a flrajght line from its fource. If the wind- 
ings qf the river were meafured, it would be little fliort 
of 50 more. It produces falmon and trout in great plen- 
ty, with fome pike and eel. Several fmall rivers an4 
rivulets fall into the Dee before it reaches Crathy, par- 
ticularly the Geallaidh, the Luidh, the Eidh, the Coich, 
the Cluanaidh, Sec., which are all well ftored with ex- 
cellent trout : the Cluanaidh produces falmon. In the 
partih of Braemar, there are many lins or cafcades, 
particularly thofe of Coich, the Mulzie, the Garrabh- 
alt, &amp;c. ; but the Jin that deferves mqfl notice, is that of 
the Dee, not fo much on account of the height of the 
fall, as the Angularity of tlie rivers being confined for 
upwards of 60 yards between two rocks, within fo nar- 
row a fpace, that fome perfons have been fool hardy 
enough to Hep from the one rock to the other. Thq 
principal Jakes in the parilhes, are Loch Callader and 
Loch Bb.rotacb.an, both on Mr. Farquharfon's property, 
and well ftored with excellent trout. Loch Callader pro- 
duces fine little falmon, of about 7 or 8 lbs. weight, and 
3 fo^S

fomc cel. It will be above 2 miles in circumference. 
Loch Bhrotachun is fmaller, but produces large delicate 
i'ed trout; 

Animals the quadrupeds' are horfes, cows, flieep, 

fwine, red and roe deer in abundance, foxes, martins, 
pole cats, wild cats, White and brown hares, badgers, ot- 
ters, &amp;c. The fowls are, eagles, hawks of different 
kinds, kites, black cock, growfe, or moorfowl, and tar- 
magan ; befides every other fpecies common in the High- 
lands of Scotland. There are in the parifli of Crathy, 
529 horfes, 919 black cattle, 5591 fheepi In the parifli 
of Braemar, 466 horfes, 930 black cattle, and 9000 
fheep. In both pariftles, 995 horfes, 1846 black cattle, 
and 14,591 flieep *. Befides the above, there are about 
800 or 900 black cattle grazed in the fummer feafonj and 
- about 2000 of the above number of flieep fent to other 
places to be paftured through the winter: 

Population. — The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755^ was 
3671 fouls. In the parifli of Crathy, there are 700 
Proteftants, 150 Papifts, and 164 children under 7 years 
of age. Total 1024 fouls. In the parifli of Braemar, 
there are 455 Proteftants, 580 Papifts, and 192 children. 
Total 1227. In both pariflies, 2251 fouls. The annual 
number of births, marriages, and burials, as taken from

State of Property. — The proprietors of thefe 2 parifh- 
es, of whom Mr. Farquharfon of Invercauld is the prin- 
cipal, are 8, viz.. The Earl of Fife, James Farquharfon, 
Efq. of Invercauld, William Farquharfon, Efq. of Mo-

Gordon, Efq. of Abergeldie, "William M'Donald, Efq. 
of Rincaton, the Reverend Thomas Gordon of Crathy- 
naird, and John Erlkine por doner of Achallader. One 
heritor refides conftantly, 3 occafionally ; and there are 
4 who do not refide at all. The valued rent of both 
pariflies, is 3347I. 16s. 8d. Scotch. The real rent 1826L 
Sterling. 

Price of Labour and Provijions. — The general wages of 
day labourers of every defcription, are double what they 
were 20 or 30 years ago. The wages of male fervants, a- 
bout 30 years ago, were from il. 15s. to 2I. a-year ; at pre- 
fent they are from 4I. to 61. a-year ; maid fervants, at 
the above period, had from il. to il. 10s. a-year. Now 
they get from 2I. to 3I. About 30 years ago, a fat cow, 
which at prefent cofts from 5I. to 61., could have been 
purchafed at 2I. 2s., or 2I. 10s. ; a fat wedder that fells

That amiable woman, who never loft fight of what tended to P r6mot e thr 
.ntereft of the poor, finding that the women of the two paries were ente H 
gers to the art of f pinn i„g on the little wheel, applied to the Board of Truf"

fp.nn.ng m.ftrefs, and erected a fpinning fchool at the caftlctown of Bracmar 
After the fchool wa S opened, it was found fo difficult to get fcholars to attend 
it, that Mr. Farquharfon himfelf W a S obliged to fpeak to his tenants, and i 
a manner, compel thofe who Ind z or 3 daughters, to fend 1 of them to the 
fchool: having, however, fdrmounred every difficulty, tRe fchool was fairly 
rtgoing ; and from the attention Lady Sinclair paid to it, going in perfon to vifit 
it, and giving premiums to thofe who excelled, (he raifed fuch a fpirit of emu- 
lation, that in about 7 years time, the progrefs was aftonilhing. From printed 
advcrtifements circulated through the parimes, in the month of Auguft l;6~2, 
coring certain premiums to thofe who produced the greateft and beft quantities 
of linen yarn, of their own fpinning, againft the 31ft of December following *, 
there were no fewer than 129 unmarried women, and little girls, who received' 
premiums on the ill of January 1763. The quantity of linen yarn brought at 
this time to Invercauld for infpeclion, and which was examined by Lady Sin- 
clair, and fo'me other ladies who attended to affift her, was fuppofed to be worth 
at leaft 300I. Sterling. Previous to this inflation, lint was f pun on the rock 
or diftaffonly, and wool on the big wheel.

Exports and Imports. — The exports are wopd, black 
cattle, flieep, butter, cheefe, wool, woollen cloth, &amp;c v 
The imports are oatmeal ? fait, iron, linen, flax, leather, 
lawns, muflins, &amp;c. 

Language The language generally fpoken is the 

^Gaelic. Moll of the people, however, underftand fo 
much of the EnglUh, as tp be able to tranfadi ordinary 
bufinefs with their neighbours of the Low Country. If 
was once thought an objeft of political attention to ufe 
means for eradicating this ancient language from the 
Highlands of Scotland. Jt is to be prefumed, that the 
Legiflature now entertains very different views. For 
experience has fujly evinced, that there are no better 
foldiers in the day of battle than the Highlanders, and 
that honour, humanity, decency, and good order are not 
incompatible with the ufe of the Gaelic, and. of tartan 
plaids and philabegs. AH names pf places in the coun- 
try, whofe etymology can be traced with certainty, are. 
Gaelic. 

JLccIefiaJicql Stat? — The prefent ftipend is 800 merits, 
with 20I. Scots for furnifljing communion elements. 
The prefent incumbent, who was fettled in June 1789, 
has raifed a procefs of augmentation againrt the heri- 
tors : What the iflue may be, is as yet uncertain. The 
£lebe meafures nearly 7 acres, but the greater!: part of 
it, till laft year, w as uncultivated. The prefent incum- 
bent, with his own fervants and cattle,, has brought fame 
acres to tillage, and has contracted with an undertaker 
to have the remaining acres trenched before the end of 
April next. The expenfe will be upwards of 61. Ste-

ground when brought into culture. The manfe, which 
was built in the years 1790 and 1791, at above 400I. 
Sterling of expenfe to the heritors, is an exceeding good 
houfe, with all the accommodation neceffary for a cler- 
gyman, and executed in a neat and fubftantial manner. 
The King is patron. 

There are 2 churches, one in Braemar, and one at 
Crathy. The church of Braemar is a very neat, decent 
church, with a moll excellent church-yard wall round 
it, built with ftone and lime. It is fupported almoit at 
the fole expenfe of the Earl of Fife and Mr. Farquhar- 
fon of Invercauld. The church of Crathy, though kept 
in repair at the joint expenfe of all the heritors of the 
a parilhes, the Earl of Fife excepted, is in very bad 
order, and too fmall. The church-yard wall is in the 
fame fituation *. 

There are l Roman Catholick priefts who refide con- 
ftantly in Braemar, befides 1 who comes occafionally to 
the parifli of Crathy. 

Schools, Poor, &amp;c— There are 2 fchools, viz. the pa^ 
rochial fchool, fituated near the church of Crathy, with 
a falary of 100 merks, befides feffion-clerk fees, and 
other quarterly payments ; and one of the Society's

•her perquifites.-The number of poor who receive 
fupply is upwards of 70. The funds for their fupport 
are the weekly coitions, the intereft of lad. at 5 per 
cent , and the rent of a gallery in the church of Crathy, 
amounting in whole to about 26I. Sterling. The late 
John Farquharfon of Invercauld, and father of the pre- 
fart proprietor, mortified 5000 merks for the purpoft. 
of maintaining and educating fome poor boys of the name 
of Farquharfon at the charity fchools. 

Roads arJ Bridges.- The military road from Blair- 
gowrie to Fort George goes through the parilhes of 
Braemar and Grathy, which Was completed in the year 
1749, at the expenfe of government. Bridges were 
likewife built over all the rivers and rivulets upon this 
line of road; at the fame expenfe. The county roads 
are made and kept in repair by the ftatute-labour. The 
fervice is indeed, for the moft part, commuted, and eve- 
ry man, between 16 arid 60 years of age is obliged to 
pay at the rate of is. 6d. yearly, the proprietors em- 
ploy a proper road grieve, with a party, to work on 
days-wages, till the fum arifing annually by this com- 
mutation is expended ; and it is found, from experience* 
that there is more road made by this mode, and to much 
better purpofe, than when the people performed their 
ftatute-labour, I cannot pafs over this article of im- 
provement, in juftice to the memory of the late Mr; 
Farquharfon of Monally* without mentioning how much 
the public in generalj and this county in particular, are 
indebted to his difinterefted and public fpirited exertions. 
That gentleman, with a laudable fpirit of patriotifm,

at a great expenfe, to a confiderable extent, for feveral 
years before the 1745. Having., however, unfortunate- 
ly engaged in the Rebellion, and being kept a prifoner 
for 18 years in England, the country was, during that 
period, deprived of his fervices. On obtaining his li- 
berty, he immediately renewed his public fpirited im- 
provements, wherever he had any influence, but chiefly 
in the 5 parifhes of Braemar, Crathy, Glenmuick, Tul- 
lich, and Glengarden (which,, indeed^ form a feparate 
and diftindt diftricl: of this county) ; and from that time 
till his death, which happened in the year 1790, he con- 
tinued, with unremitting attention, and at a great ex- 
penfe, to forward the building of new, and the repair- 
ing of old bridges ; the making of new, and repairing 
former roads ; in which he was ably fupported by Mr. 
Farquharfon of Invercauld (whofe abilities in directing 
and executing roads are very uncommon), and, in fome 
degree, by all the gentlemen in the county : fo that, 
upon the whole, it may with great propriety be aflert- 
ed, that during the lafl 25 years,- no part of the High- 
lands of Scotland, of the fame extent, has gained more 
in roads and bridges by private fubfcription, than the 5 
parifhes above defcribed. 

Advantages and Disadvantages.— .The 2 parifhes of 

Crathy and Braemar, in general, have many, perhaps 

more, advantages within themfelves, than fome of the 

neighbouring parifhes ; and the people, though not very 

induftrious, are yet intelligent, humane, obliging, and 

much given to hofpitality. But ftill much might be 

done to better their cireumftances, were fuch branches 

of manufacture as the country is calculated for, eftablifhed 

and carried on by perfons of experience, ability, and 

fpirit.

fpirit. As the foil is very favourable to the growth of 
flax, and as there is a great deal of wool annually ex- 
ported, it is to be prefumed, that the manufacture of 
woollen and linen cloth would be attended with the 
greateft fuccefs. There are likewife fome good fitua- 
tions for bleachfields. 

There is one difadvantage which this county in gene- 
ral labours under, and that is, the want of mofs roads. 
The moffes, for the moft part, lie -at the diftance of i or 
3 miles from the tenants, and over aimoft inacceflible 
hills ; by which means they ure obliged to carry home 
their fuel on horfeback. This makes them keep a 
greater number of horfes than their farms can well 
bear ; confequently the horfes are of a fmall fize : but 
were proper roads to be made, the tenants in general 
would keep larger horfes and fewer of them, and would 
provide wheel carriages. This is clearly evinced upon 
the eftate of Monaltry. The prefent proprietor, mere- 
ly to accommodate his tenants, in the years 1790 and 
1 791, carried on and finiflied a very complete road to 
an inexhauftible mofs. It is carried over the fummit 
of a high hill, yet fo well dire&amp;ed, that the acclivity 
is fcarcely felt : the expenfe, no doubt, was confiderable^ 
but the confequence is, that lince that period moft of 
the tenants have provided themfelves with carts, and, 
in a few years hence, it is very probable, the whole 
tenants on the eftate will do the fame. 

Another difadvantage, which prevails in fome places 
of the country, is the perfonal fervices of the tenants. 
Wherever the tenants are expected to thrive, perfonal 
fervices mould be difpenfed with and commuted. That 
which has longeft kept up, is the providing a certain 
quantity of fuel for the mafter, yearly, with fome long 

X x 2 ajnd

and fliort carriages. This interferes fhuch with the la- 
bours of the hufbandman, as his whole time is employed 
in providing his own and his matter's fuel, from the 
time the feed is fqwn till the beginning of harveft. 
Thus he lofes all that time in which he ought to pro- 
vide manure for his land ; and though there is lime- 
ilone in great profufion near, or perhaps upon, his farm, 
yet he can derive no benefit from it. Several of the 
proprietors, however, have commuted their feryices. 
Were this mode generally adopted, and the tenants 
encouraged to build decent houfes, it would conduce 
much to the comfort of the farmer, and the intereft of 
the landlord. 

There is a third difadvantage, and which is exceed- 
ingly pernicious, not only to this county, but almolt to 
the whole North of Scotland ; and that is, the depreda- 
tion made on the flieep, game, and poultry by foxes and 
other vermin. There was a fcheme planned feme years 
ago by Mr. Farquharfon of lnvercauld, and carried into 
execution by him and the other heritors, for the pre- 
ferration of flieep, game, and poultry, and for the de- 
ftru&amp;ion of foxes, wild-cats, pole-cats, eagles, hawks, 
&amp;c, from which the parimes of Braemar, Crathy, Glen, 
muick, Tullich, and Glengarder, derived more real be- 
nefits, than perhaps from any other improvements that 
could be introduced into this county. It commenced 
the 15th of January 1776; and before that period, the 
definition of Ibeep was fo great, that it is thought the 
value of the flieep annually killed by vermin, in the a- 
bove pariflies, was nearly equal to half the rent paid to 
the proprietors. The fcheme was this : The heritors 
entered into a private fubfeription among themfelves, 
out of which a premium was paid for every animal or 
6 ' kin*

bird that was brought in to the cafliiers, by fuch perfom? 
as were authorifcd by the " affiliation to carry arms for 
the deftrudion of foxes, Sec. ; and who had been pre- 
vioufly fworn not to kill game : and, it is believed, that 
out of more than 100 perfons, who had warrants for 
this purpofe, not one of them ever trefpaffed in that 
refpeft'. The whole fubferiptions in the 5 parifhes a- 
mounted to about 40 guineas a-year j and the fcheme 
continued for 10 years, with fq great fuccefs, that da- 
ring that period there were Idjled 634 foxes, 44 wild- 
cats, 57 pole-cats j 70 eagles, 2520 hawks and kites; 
1347 ravens and hooded crows * 5 befides all thofe 
which were deftroyed by poifon, or died of their 
wounds : and fheep were then in perfect fafety to paf- 
fure at all times and feafons to the very boundary of 
where the fcheme extended. Unfortunately, however,, 
for this county, fotne of the heritors (for reafons bed 
known to themfelves) withdrew their fubferiptions . 
The other fubferibers were obliged, 8 years ago, to give 
up the fcheme -, the confequence of which is, that the, 
deftrudion of flieep has gradually gained ground, and 
game of all kinds decreafed in the fame proportion. It 
is much to be regretted that the fcheme was dropped; but 
the experiment has fufficiently evinced the following; 
fact, viz. that if fuch an exteimve track of mountainous 
country as the 5 parifhes 4 above defcribed, where there is 
a great deal of wood, and where foxes and other ver- 
min poured in from neighbouring countries as moun- 
tainous as this, derived fuch real advantages from 



a 



* For the firft year, the premiums extended only to foxes, eagles, gofacks, 
and falcons ; the fecond year, wild-cats, pole-cats, fmall hawks, and kites, 
were added j and the third year, ravens and hooded crows were aifo included. 



Stati/lical Account 



a fcheme carried into execution on fuch a contract 
feale as 40 guineas a-year ; ftill greater advantages muft 
be derived from a fcheme of this kind, if it was extend- 
ed over the whole Highlands of Scotland. 

A fourth difadvantage is, the diftance from a port 
town, which is 50 miles in any dire&amp;ion *. 

Antiquities — There is, upon the eftate of Caftletown of 
Braemar, the ruins of an ancient caftle, built, as tradition 
reports, by King Malcolm Kenmore for a hunting feat. 
By the veftiges which ftill remain, it is obvious, that 
there was a very confiderable building. The houfe 
Hood on the top of a rock on the E. fide of the water 
of Cluanadh j and the King having thrown a drawbridge 
acrofs the river, to the rock on the oppofite fide, the 
parifli of Braemar derived its original name of Ceann-an 
drochart from that circumstance. On a little mount om 
the Haugh of Caftletown ftands the caftle of Braemar. 
It was originally the property of Farquharfon of In- 
vercauld, and given to a fecond fon of that family as 
his patrimony. About the end of Queen Mary's reign, 
thefe lands were excambed with the Earl of Marr for 
the lands of Monaltry, and, foon after his acceffion to 
the eftate, he built the prefent houfe King William, 
after the Revolution, took poffeffion of it for a garrifon, 

and 

* I fee with pleifure a branch of the poll office extended lately from Aber- 
deen to Kincardine O'Neil j but this country can derive little or no benefit 
from it, being ftill 33 miles diftant from the Caftletown of Biaemar. Was the 
jsxtenfion of this branch to be carried to that pl?.ce, this whole country, inftead 
of fending a man weekly to Cupar Angus for letters and newfpapers, would 
put all their letters into this office to go round by Aberdeen, which would bring 
an additional revenue of 3d. at leaft, for every fingle letter, and would, it is 
prefumed, more than indemnify government for the expenfis incurred in th« 
cftibliflunent of it.

and put fome troops into it to keep the country in awe ; 
but this had not the defired effed, for the country be- 
ing of oppofite fentiments at the time, befieged the gar. 
rifon, and obliged the troops to retire, under filence of 
night, in order to fave their lives ; and to fave them- 
felves from fuch troublefome neighbours for the future, 
they burnt the caftle. In this flate, it continued till 
the year 17 15, when the whole Marr eftates were for- 
feited. About the 172c, Lords Dun and Grange pur- 
chafed from goverment all the lands belonging to the 
Erikine family .; and about the 1730, John Farquharfon 
of Invercauld, bought the lands of Caftletown from Lords 
Dun and Grange. About the 1748, Mr. Farquharfon 
.gave a leafe to government of the caftle, and an enclo- 
fure of 1 4 acres of ground, for the fpace of 99 years, 
at 14k Sterling of yearly rent; upon which the houfe 
was repaired (the walls being then fufficient), and a 
rampart built round it, and it has, fince that period, 
been occupied by a party of foldiers. At the expira- 
tion of the leafe, or the evacuation of the troops, the 
houfe, with the enclofure, returns to Invercauld's fa- 
mily, without any melioration whatever. 

On the lands of Monaltry, and on the N. bank of the 
river Dee, in a narrow pafs, where there is not above 
60 yards from the river to the foot of a high, fteep, 
rocky hill, Hands a cairn, known by the name of Carn- 
na-cuimhne, or Cairn of remembrance. The military 
road is carried along the foot of this hill, and through 
this pafs. The tradition of the country is, that, at fome 
period, the country being in danger, the Highland chief- 
tains raifed their men, and marching through this pafs, 
caufed each man lay down a ftone in this place. When 
they returned, the ftones were numbered; by which means

it was known how many men were brought into the field, 
and what number was loft in a&amp;ion. Since that period, 
Carn-na-cuimhne has been the watch- word of the coun- 
try. At that period, every perfon capable of bearing 
arms, was obliged to have his arms, a bag, with fome 
bannocks in it, and a pair of new mended fhoes al- 
ways in readinefs ; and the moment the alarm was given 
that danger Was apprehended, a flake of wood, the one 
end. dipped in blood (the blood of any animal), and the 
tother burnt, as an emblem of fire and fword, was put 
into the hands of the perfon neareft to where the alarm 
was girert, who immediately ran with all fpeed, and gave 
it to his neareft neighbour, whether man or woman j 
that perfon ran to the next village or cottage (for mea- 
sures had been previoufly fo concerted, that every one 
knew his route), and fo on, till they went through the 
whole country 5 upon which every man inftantly laid 
hold of his arms, &amp;c, and repaired to Carn-na-cuimhne, 
where they met their leaders alfo in arms, and ready 
to give the neceffary orders : The ftake of Wood was 
named Croifhtarich. At this day, was a fray or fquabble 
to happen at a market, or any public meeting, fuch in-

Name and General Defcription, 

IN various part3 of Scotland, we meet with places 
which are named Galder. The word is probably of 
Gaelic derivation, and the meaning of it is faid to be 
" wood and water." Confidering the word in this fenfe, the? 
town, from which this parim derives its name, may, 
with great propriety, be denominated Calder. The Al- 
mond, a river of confiderable fize, flows a little to the Nj 
of it ; and 2 fmall rivers to the E. unite their ftreams a 
few hundred yards before they are mingled with that of 
the Almond. Calder wood, which has one of the above 
mentioned fmall rivers on each fide of it, is ftill of con- 
fiderable extent j but from the following verfes, which 
Vol. XIV. Y y ?

Siatifiical Account 



I have heard repeated, it fecms to have been formerly 6 
or 7 miles in length. 

Calder wood was fair to fee, 
When it went to Cameltree ; 
Calder wood was fairer ftill, 
When it went to Crofswood hill. 

The town of Mid-Calder is pleafantly fituated, and 
many of the fcenes and profpe&amp;s, which the wood pre- 
fents, are romantick, grand, and delightful. The wood 
confifts chiefly of oaks, birches, Scotch firs, and larches: 
The parrfli is upon the whole, much adorned with 
ftripes of plantation ; and it receives no fmall advantage 
from the fhelter, which the trees afford. The greater 
part of the parifh is enclofed, and divided into fields of a 
jnoderate extent, by ftone walls, or by hedge and ditch. 

Agriculture — The old Scotch plough, which is very- 
heavy, and drawn by 4 horfes, and often by 4 horfes 
and 2 oxen, is now, in general, l^id afide, and a light one 
made ufe of, which is drawn by 2 horfes only, and, in 
fome inftances, by 2 oxen, without any horfe whatso- 
ever. 

The Scotch plough requires 2 perfons to attend it, 
but 1 is deemed fufficient for that which is drawn by 2 
horfes. Thus there is a faving to the farmer of labour- 
ers, horfes, and food. The 2 horfe plough is not fit for 
heavy foil ; but in that which is of a light quality, it is 
not reckoned to do a great deal lefs work, than that in 
which 4 horfes are employed. 

For improving the lands, fummer fallowing is be- 
come a Yery common practice, together with fowing

fields with the feeds of turnip, and other fucculent 
plants. Our foil is generally light, and not confidered as 
the moft proper for peafe, or wheat, though both of 
them, in fome parts of the parifti, thrive very well. 
Oats, barley, turnips, and potatoes, make, in general, 
good returns. The curling of potatoes, fo much and 
juftly complained of in England, is not prevalent in this 
country. Making allowance for the difference of foil, 
feafons, cultivation, and other circumftances, the feve- 
ral kinds of grain, which are fown in this parifli, may 
be ftated, upon the whole, as yielding the following in- 
creafe : Wheat from 6 to 10, and fometimes 12 fold; 
peafe from 4 to 8 ; barley from 5 to 7 ; and oats, 4, 7, 
or 8 fold : Potatoes, at an average, may be reckoned at 
30 fold, though, in many places, the increafe is much 
lefs. An acre of turnips is worth 5I. or 61. and will fat- 
ten 2 fmall oxen, which, when full fed, will weigh each 
of them', about 25 ftone Englifh weight. I am informed, 
that the butchers in Edinburgh give to the farmers in 
that neighbourhood nearly double the value, which I 
have fet upon a turnip crop ; but it ought alfo to be ob- 
ferved, that this is of much more value to the butchers 
than to, the farmers, as the latter muft fell their fed 
cattle, fo that the purchafer may have a profit, whereas 
the former kill them ; and felling the meat, Ikin, and 
tallow, to their refpe&amp;ive buyers, get for all thefe arti- 
cles, the current price of the different markets. Be- 
lides, for the fake of convenience, the butchers may fome- 
times be induced to give more than the intrkfic worth 
of the crop. 

The greater part of the hay in this part of the coun- 
try is made of rye-grafs and red clover, the feeds of 
which are fpwn with barley, and fometimes with oats or 

Yy 2 wheat, 



'356 Statiftical Account 

wheat. If the barley or oats be not too ftrong, fo as to 
prevent the rye-grafs and clover from getting the necef- 
fary nutriment, which the light and air afford ; and if 
the foil be good, and properly managed, a luxuriant crop 
Of hay may be expeded, for at leaft two feafons there- 
after; and it is generally fit for mowing 3 years. An an- 
nual kind of rye-grafs has lately been introduced into 
this neighbourhood, which produces one fine crop •, but 
being fo tranfient, the farmers are getting quit of it as 
fail as they can. The pradice which prevails in England, 
of laying dung occafionally on the furface of land, which 
is laid down in grafs, might be introduced with advan- 
tage into this country. When a grafs field, through a. 
feries of years, has acquired a clofe fward, it is of im- 
portance to preferve it as long as the weeds can be kept 
down ; and while the foil is enriched by dung, it may be 
kept a long time clean, by the application of lime. Few 
fields of cabbages or carrots are cultivated here, though 
the former are reckoned to be good feeding for black 
cattle ; and the latter, in fome parts of England, are 
efteemed excellent food for horfes. The root of fcarcity, 
which is now afcertained to be only a fpecies of the beet, 
has, fo far as I know, never been reared in this parifh. 

The rolling ftone is pretty common here. The ma- 
chine called Fanners, for cleaning the grain after it has 
been thralhed, is much in ufe among the farmers ; but 
the thrafliing machine, which was invented in Scotland a 
few years ago, has not found its way yet into this pa-

Extent and Population.— The parifh, winch is now 
called Weft Calder, conflicted formerly a part of this 
one and the whole was then known by the name of Cal- 
der Comitis. From the time of this divifion, the parifh 
which I am defcribing, has been denominated Mid-Cal- 
der. It is about 7 miles in length from N. to S. ; and 
no part of it is much above 3 miles in breadth. The 
population, according to Dr. Webfter's report in 1755, 
was 760 fouls. It contains, at prefent, 1251 inhabi- 
tants ; 689 of whom are in the country part of the pa- 
rifh, 

mon price, for many years paft, has been is. The peck contains 8 lbs, of 
Scotch Troy, or Dutch weight, the lb. of which is to the Avoirdupoifc, 
or Englifli lb., as 7600 grains is to 7000. Potatoes have been fold here 
this autumn, when difpofed of in quantities, at 4 s. 8d. the boll, which 
contains 16 pecks; and % of the pecks, by which potatoes are fold in this 
place, exceed a Wincheftcr bufhel, by parts. There is not much 
filh brought to this market ; but there is plenty of it to be had in Edin- 
burgh; and we have two carriers in this town who go thither twiae a 
week, bcfides feveral from different parts of the parifh, who go on ftated 
occafions. Our butcher meat is charged 3d., and fometimes 4d., or up- 
wards, a lb. Dstch weight. Poultry is dearer in proportion, and eggs are 
fold at 4d., 5d., or 6d. the dozen, according to the feafon of the year, 
and as circumftances require. New milk coils §d. the mutchkin, which is 
one-tenth lefs than the Englifh wine pint ; and butter milk is fold at £d. 
a Scotch pint, which is one-tenth lefs than an Englifli wine gallon. 

A good ploughman will not engage himfelf for lefs than 81. a year, and, 
Jn general, he expects more. Along with thefe wages, he has bed and 
board in his matter's houfe ; but when he is married, and has a cottage of 
his own, he has allowances of different kinds, which, on the whole, may 
amount to 15I. or 1 61. a year. Footmen, gardeners, &amp;c„ have wages in 
proportion to the circumftances in which they are placed. A female fer- 
vant, fit for common houfehold work, demands, independent of bed and 
board, from 3I. 10s. to 4I. a year. Thofe in a fuperior line have more, 
according to their fituation. A common labourer, if he find himfelf 
with food, gets, at an average, 18. ad. a day during that feafon of the 
year, when he can work from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in 
the evening. A few years ago, a labourer of this kind had no more than 
lod. or Is. The wages of mechanicks have been advanced in proportion,

xifh, and the remaining 562 are in the town. The 
males amount to 588 5 the females to 663 : Thus it ap- 
pears, that the females exceed the males by 75 in num- 
ber. Nature, upon the whole, feems to have made the 
number of males and females nearly equal ; and the dis- 
proportion, in the prefent iriftance, probably arifes from 
this fact, that many of our youths go abroad into other 
parts of the country to find employment, where trade and 
manufactures prevail. 

By comparing my enumeration of the people in this 
town, with that which was made by an ingenious me- 
chanick* about 25 years ago, it appears, that the popu- 
lation thereof has been upon the decline. Several new 
houfes have of late been built, indeed, but many old ones 
have alfo fallen into decay : However, the chief caufe of 
the diminution feems to be the influence which trade and 
commerce have in carrying off our young men to other 
parts of the country, where engaging profpecls of 
wealth are held out to them f. 

This difhicl: of the country mull be confidered as very 
favourable to health. There is no difeafe which is pecu- 
liarly incident to the people ; and there are feveral per-

■f During the laft 3 years, there have been 23 marriages, and 97 bap- 
tifms, as appears by the regifter books belonging to this church. The 
number of births has, without doubt, exceeded that which I have men- 
tioned, as feveral children did not live long enough to be baptif^d ; and 
as thofe of diffenters are not included, excepting fuch as chofe to have 
them entered in the parifh records, with a view to preferve more per- 
manently the mean of afcertaining, at any future period, the time of 
their birth, and the family from which they fprung. The number of 
deaths cannot be condefcended on, for many who breathe their laft 
in this parifh, are carried out of the bounds of it, and buried where 
their anceftors, or ftmie of their kindred have been laid before them; and 
not a few are brought from other parifb.es to this churchyard, that they 
may reft with their fathers.

tons in the pariih near 80 years of age, and fome confi- 
derably above it. Though a fmall part in the foutberm 
part of it be open, fwampy, and moorifli, yet it is fo far 
from being pernicious to the health of the inhabitants, that 
it feems to have an oppofite elFect. I know a perfon who, 
when he lived in a dry country, and on the fea coaft, had 
frequent and fevere fits of the ague ; but, upon coming 
into the neighbourhood of the marflry part of this parifli, „ 
which I have been taking notice of, and into a moorifli 
iituation, he was foon relieved ; and for a confiderable 
time paft, he has had no returns of his difeafe. In damp 
countries, and particularly among the fens of Lincoln- 
{hire, the ague is a prevailing malady. Query. Is 
there any antifeptic quality in the water and exhalations 
of moffy * ground which has a tendency to prevent this, 
and other epidemic difeafes ? It is to be remarked, that 
the ague is not a very common malady in Scotland. 

Advantages and D if advantages. —It is much to be la* 
mented, that, excepting a fmall paper mill, nothing 
which can be called a manufacture, is eftabliflied in this 
town or neighbourhood. A few women and girls get 
employment by fewing or tambouring muflin j but the 
young men, who remain here, have no other engage- 
ments of profit, but common labour, and the mechanical 
purfuits which arc neceifary for the demands of the 
town and parts adjacent. As there is little in which 
childern can be employed, they remain for a long time 
a burden on the induftry of their parents. Mid-Calder 
is well fituated for trade ; the markets fupply plenty of 

provifions,

provifions, the roads are good, and the communication 
is eafy with places of confequence, both at home and 
abroad. There are feveral water falls in the neighbour- 
hood ; and the value of thefe would be the more confi- 
derable to a manufacturer, as they are near the town, 
where a great number of hands could be conveniently 
procured. 

The principal difadvantage attending this part of the 
country, for fuch ellablifliments as would require much 
fuel, is the dearnefs of that article. A few people in 
the fouthern diftrid of the parifli burn chiefly peats ; 
but coals are moll commonly made ufe of in the other 
divifions of it ; and as they are brought from a diftance, 
the price of them is high. But when I come to treat 
of minerals, it will appear, that we have good reafon to- 
hope for a removal of this difadvantage; 

Seels and Parties.— There is an Antiburgher meet- 
ing-houfe in this parifli, and one belonging to the 
Burghers in the parifli of Eaft Calder, and at no great 
diftance from this town. There are a few perfons in 
this parifli who are of the Church of England } but as 
there is no minifter of that clafs of Chriftians nearer 
than Edinburgh, they attend the church of Mid-Calder. 
It is pleafing to obferve, that of late the violence of par- 
ty rage, in matters of religion, has much fubfided I ; but 
charity and brotherly love will not have their defired 
confummation, till we fet lefs value upon fpeculative 
opinions, and judge of men folely by true worth of 
character.

a good houfe and fchool-room, his legal falary from the

was funk upon an eftate in the neighbourhood for the 
benefit of the fehooimafter* together with the perquifites 
of being clerk to the church feffion, independent of 
fchool wages, may, upon the whole, be reckoned equal 
to 30 guineas a-year. There are other 3 fchools in the 
pariih ; but they have no falary to fupport them. I 
know nobody in the pariih, above 8 or 10 years of age, 
who cannot read, and not a few can write and do a lit- 
tle in accounts. Thefe acquirements which are fo com- 
mon among the people in Scotland^ are eafily feen to 
proceed from the important regulation of having a 
fchool with a fixed falary annexed to it, in every pa~ 
rifli *. If the mailer fliould not be popular, or if, ow- 
ing to diftance or any other circumflance, the eftabliiii-* 
ed fchool does not accommodate the whole children in 
the parifli, yet it keeps alive a fenfe of education in the 
country, and induces thofe who Hand in need, to provide 
fchoolmafters for the inftruction of their own families 
and friends. — There are at prefent in this pariih only

ceive occafional donations. This fupport is afforded 
them by voluntary offerings, which are made by people 
at church, and by levies, which the landholders raifc 
upon themfelves *. 

Valuation of the lands, &amp;x. — The ancient value fet 
upon the lands of this parifli, by which the taxes af- 
fecting the property in land are paid, amounts to 51 5.7L 
I os. Scotch money ; the prefent rental of the whole pa- 
rifli is about 2519I. Sterling. The produce of the dif- 
ferent farms, befides a confiderable quantity of hay, 
which is fold at Edinburgh and other places, feeds 480 
black cattle, 200 horfes, and 2300 fheep. Horfes are 
more numerous here than in fome other parts, as the 
farmers rear feveral for the market. Comparatively 
fpeaking, there are few fwine or pigs in the parifh. 

Hunting, Fijhing, Fowling, Sec — Foxes are not fcarcc 
in the parifli, and hares are very numerous. There are 
plenty of trouts in the rivers near this town, and a few 
eels j but no falmon come fo far up the Almond as Mid- 
Calder. In favourable feafons, the fportfman may find 
no inconfiderable number of groufe, partridges, wood- 
cocks, and fnipes in the parifli. We have here the 
blackbird and thrufti, the lark, linnet, and goldfinch., 
as well as the other fowls and birds which are common 
in general to Scotland. In Calder wood the bullfinches

,8re pretty numerous ; and this is the more remarkable, 
as they are not common in the neighbourhood. 

Manners, mode of Living, Drefs and Cujloms — The 
manners of the prefent generation are more Ample than 
thofe of the preceding ; and though we have reafon to 
mourn over preyailing vices, yet fome of the more flag- 
rant breaches of decency and virtue, fuch as profane 
fwearing and drunkennefs, are not fo common in the 
more improved circles as they were formerly. The 
people here are, upon the whole, fober and virtuous ; 
though we muft expect, to find among them fome of the 
vices which prevail in limilar fituations. 

The old farm houfes and cottages in the parim are., 
moftly built of flone and lime, but all thatched, have 
fmall windows, and few accommodations. Several of 
thofe which have been more recently reared are covered 
with Hates or tiles, have fafli windows, and are more 
commodious ; but, except in upper ftories, we generally 
find them with earthen floors, which are often damp, and 
neither cleanly nor healthful. Gentlemens houfes are, 
many of them, built with elegance and tafte in various 
parts of this country. There are no old cafUes in the 
neighbourhood which are capable of being inhabited. 

Oat meal made into porridge, and a thin, hard kind 
of bread, made alfo of oat meal, together with milk, 
butter and cheefe, oonflitute a conliderable part of the 
food, which is common to the inferior, as well as the 
middle clafles of the people. Butcher meat is more in 
ufe among them of late, and the practice of drinking tea 
is every day becoming more common. Not many years 
ago, loaves made of flour were rarely to be found in 
the country, unlefs in gentlemens families j but now

they are more frequently made ufe of by all ranks of 
the people. 

The tartan * or red plaids, clofe caps, with or with- 
out ribbons, gowns, petticoats,, and ftockings of home 
manufacture, which, 30 or 40 years ago, conftituted the 
drefs of women in the inferior conditions of life, gra- 
dually gave way to clothes made of red or blue Englifij 
cloth, and other approaches to an improved drefs-, and 
thefe in their turn are now yielding to the drefs cap, 
the filk bonnet, or beavei' hat, printed or other cotton 
gowns, white petticoats, white thread or cotton ftock- 
ings, and fine lhoes or flippers. Formerly the beft hand- 
kerchiefs for the neck were ftrong cambrick, but now 
they are of fine muflin, and fometimes there is an addi- 
tion of a ftiawl, of 5s. or 7s. value. 

With refpeft to the men, labourers and mechanicks, 
20 years ago, wore a woollen bonnet on their head, they 
) had coat, waiftcoat, and breeches of cloth, which was, 
manufactured in private families ; their ftockings were 
fpun and knit at home, or by feme neighbours ; and, 
their ftioes were rather ftrong than neat. Now they 
•wear hats of different qualities, coats of Englilh made 
cloth, ftriped or white waiftcoats, corduroy or fuftaia 
breeches, fine cotton or thread ftockings, and flight neat 
ftioes. Thus they are equipped when they are in drefc ; 
but in days of labour, they are clothed in a way more 
fuitable to" their various engagements. As to the higher 
ranks of both fexes, their drefs is much the fame as it 
is in the fouthern parts of the ifland, and the fafliions of 
London foon find their way hither.

the practice of their forefathers ; though the changes 
attending times and circumllances be gradually produ- 
cing their efFe&amp;s. In what relates to agriculture, food, 
and clothing, they have departed fartheft from the ha- 
bits of their anceftors. 

Though the Scotch be the prevailing language of the 
country, yet, by the influence of thofe who have a more 
extended intercourfe with the world, the people here are 
making evident approaches toward a more intimate ac- 
quaintance with the Englifli tongue, which is the more 
deferable, as, fince the union of England and Scotland, 
the language of the court of London has been received 
as the ftandard language of the united kingdoms. 

Feudal Cujloms. — All the eftates in Scotland hold of 
the Crown or Prince of Wales, by a nominal or trifling 
quit rent ; and the original proprietors, when difpofing 
of their lands, frequently fold them under the conditio* 
of receiving a fmall annual feu-duty, or chief rent. The 
fame practice is continued till this day ; confequently a 
perfon may enjoy a large eftate, which is all fubjedt to 
a feu-duty, payable to him who holds immediately of 
the Crown or the Prince — Many farmers in this pa- 
rim, as well as in other parts of Scotland, are bound to 
have their grain ground at certain mills, which belong 
to the proprietors of the eftates on which they live. 
This is called thirlage, and is confidered as a grievance, 
as they not only pay more than when they are left at 
liberty, but as they are thus prevented from going where 
their convenience or intereft leads them. 



Mines, Minerals, &amp;c — There are every where many 
indications of coal in this neighbourhood, fuch as in-

durated clay, and a petriolic fchiftus, which burns with 
a bright flame, but leaves a large refidue of afhes. 
Schiftus of this kind feems to differ very little from 
coal, but by having combined with it a fmaller quantity 
of. the bituminous principle. Moreover, coal has been 
got in different parts of the country not far from this ; 
and it is to be hoped, that circumftances will occur, 
which will give fufficieut encouragement to have it 
wrought for the benefit of people in the neighbourhood. 
There is good free ftone in the parifh ; not much gra- 
nite, and many of the rocks are a fpecies of indurated 
clay. There is plenty of iron ftone, and fome of it 
effervefces confiderably with an acid. There is alfo 
lime ftone ; and in the parilh of Eaft Calder, about I 
mile from this town, Lord Morton has a quarry, where 
the ftratum is 60 feet in thicknefs. — Upon the whole, 
let me quote a paffage from a furvey, which Mr. Wil- 
liams has lately made of the eftates belonging to Sir 
William Auguftus Cunyngham of Livingfton, Baronet, 
which are in this neighbourhood, contiguous to the ri- 
vers Briech and Almond. *? Befide the coal and lime, 
the quantity of good iron ftone which croffes thefe ri- 
vers is fo very great, that if a canal come this way," 
which has lately been in contemplation, " the vicinity 
of thefe rivers will foon become an important fcene of 
manufactures and very ufeful improvements." 

On the eftate of Letham, belonging to Sir W. A. 
Cunyngham there is a fpring of fulphureou,s water. It 
does not appear to be different from other fountains of 
that kind. Like the waters of Harrowgate, and other 
fulphureous fprings, it has been found to be beneficial 
in various difeafes ; but more efpecially in cafes of fcro- 
fula and gravel. The influence which has been afcribed 

to 



Of Mid-Calder; 36/ 

to the carbonic acid in calculous affections, might lead a 
perfon to fuppofe, that it contains a portion of that acid j 
but it was evident to me, on examination, that it did 
not. Dr. Beddoes, in his Obfervations on the Nature' 
and Cure of Calculus, &amp;c afferts, that it is not the 
carbonic acid, but the alkali ; which is generally admi- 
niftered along with this acid, which has the medicinal 
effect. Perhaps it may be allowed, that they both have 
a tendency to remove this difeafe. The alkali then, 
which, in conjunction with the fulphur, forms the he- 
patic fmell of thefe waters, may be the principal agent 
which yields relief to patients in cafes of gravel ; and 
the attenuated fulphur, which conftitutes a part of the 
hepatic vapour, may be the mean of promoting a cure 
in fcrofulous dilbrders. But the truth is, that in mi- 
neral and calcareous waters there are many combina- 
tions, and volatile fubftances, whofe nature and effects 
are hitherto unknown. 

Eminent and Remarkalle CharaBers. — Among the few 
perfons of note in this parifb, whofe names have been 
handed down to us, I mall begin with Sir James Sandi- 
lands of Calder. He was a man of ability and eminence, 
and being a knight of the order of Malta, he was, by 
his worth and influence, raifed to the preceptory of 
Torphichen, in the county of Linlithgow, where the 
order to which he belonged had their principal rendence 
in Scotland, and where the ruins of their houfe and 
chapel are ftill to be feen. He was engaged in feveral 
important negotiations during the Reformation of reli- 
gion in Scotland ; and when Popery was overturned, the 
preceptory of Torphichen was converted into a tempo- 
ral barony, and it, together, with the title and dignity 

of 



3 68 



Stati/lical Accotmt 



of a Lord of Parliament, was conferred on Sir James 
for which he immediately paid 10,000 crowns, and be- 
came bound that 500 merks mould be paid annually to 
the fovereign, by him and thofe who mould fucceed him; 
The title has remained in the family ever fince ; and 
the prefent reprefentative is the Right Honourable James 
Sandilands Lord Torphichen. This family have long 
been refpe£table, not only for the rank in which they 
are placed, but alfo for their decency of conduct, and 
their attention to the duties of religion. 

Mr, John Spottifwood, of the family of that name in 
Merfe, was parfon of Galder Comitis. He refided here 
chiefly, during the perilous times of the Reformation .* 
When the ferment fubfided, he was chofen fuperintend- 
ant of the churches in Lothian, Merfe, and Teviotdaley 
as the bifhops had loft their power, and the Prefbyte- 
xian form of government, in its prefent ftate, was not 
then eftabliflied. He difcharged the duties connected 
with his ftation, fo as to merit refpecl and approbation*. 
When he became old and infirm, his fon John, at the 
age of 18, fucceeded him, as parfon of Calder Comitis. 
But he did not long continue in this fituation : he was 
made Archbimop of Glafgow, after the hierarchy of the 
Church of England prevailed in Scotland, as it did for 
a time ; he was one of King James I. of England's Privy 
Counfellors ; crowned Charles the Firft in the chapel of 
Holyroodhoufe ; and died Archbimop of St. Andrew's. 
He was the fame Spottifwood who wrote a Hiftory of 

the Church of Scotland f. . .

manfe, ftands the houfe of Greenbank, which has a gar- 
den and a few acres of land belonging to it. It was 
formerly in the pofleffion of the fuperintendant Spottif- 
wood and his fon, as it appears both from tradition, and 
the following quotation from an old deed of conveyance : 
" All and whole that manfion houfe, built by the de- 
ceafed Mr. John Spottifwood, grandfather of umquhill, 
that is, deccafed, Sir John Spottifwood of Dairfie, 
Knight, and by the deceafed John Archbimop of St. 
Andrew's." The property was lately purchafed by 
Lord Torphichen. In the houfe, there is a portrait of 
the fuperintendant ; and till lately, there was a bed in 
it, which had probably belonged to the family of the 
archbifhop. The polls of it were many, and had vari- 
ous figures carved upon it. It ftood in a clofet, which 
is lined with tapeftry, in excellent prefervation. *

The church of Mid- Colder is built in the Gothic 
manner. There is no date nor record, by which the 
time of its ereftion can be afcertained. There is only 
that part of the edifice, which was intended for the chan- 
cel. The building mufl either have been Hopped by the 
want of money, or by the agitations which took 
place during the time of the Reformation. The old 
building being too fmall for the accommodation of the 
people, it was deemed neceftary to enlarge it. The new 
ereftion is at the W. end ; and not being built in the 
fame ftyle, rather hurts the appearance without ; but the 
additional part is not much feen from the flreet. The 
church within is both neat and commodious. 

On both fides of the river Almond, but efpecially 
on the fouthcrn banks, from Livingfton, to its conflu- 
ence with the fea below Kirkiiflon, which is a fpace 
of, at leaft, 14 or 15 miles, there have been found 
many Ikeletons of the human body remaining in ftone

fallen in this battle, we might have found afhes and urns; but neither

that burning the dead was not general among the Romans, till toward 
the end of the Republic; aH d that it gradually fell into difufe, and was 
altogether laid afide about the end of the 4th century.

It has the refemblance of a fpear, or crofs, elevated on g[ 
pole cut upon the top of it. The warriors name is faid 
to have been Clair ; and hence we may fuppofe the pa- 
rifh of Eaft Calder was anciently called Calder Cleri- 
cus : And hence too, perhaps, if he were a Chriftian, may 
have been derived the furname, St. Clair, or Sinclair. 

Witchcraft. — There is a well known report, that, in 
days of old, witches were burnt at Calder. A mound 
between the northern part of this town, and the banks 
of the river Almond, is pointed out as the fcene of their 
fufferings. But, if ever thefe acts of cruelty were 
realized in this place, they muft have been done at fo 
remote a period, that nothing but a vague tradition now 
remains. It is an undoubted fa£l, however, that about 
the end of the lafl century, perfons accufed of witch- 
craft were examined and watched in the town of Mid- 
Calder ; but it does not appear, that any were doomed 
to the flames. The intention of keeping them in con- 
finement, was to bring them to a confeffion of their guilt. 
They were extremely careful to keep them awake ; for 
an idea was . entertained, that if they were permitted to 
fleep, their fpirits left them, and went abroad to do mif- 
chief *.

* There are people living at this day, -who have in their youth converfed 
, with Tome of thole who were employed to guard perfons fufpe&amp;ed of 
witchcraft. The method which they took to keep them awake, was to 
pierce their flefh with pins, needles, awls, or other fharp pointed mftru- 
ments. To refcue them from that oppreffion, which fleep impofed upon 
their almoit czhaufted nature, they fometiroes made ufe of irons, heated 
to a ftate of rednefs. Arnbt, in his Criminal Trials, mentions devices ef 
cruelty more inhuman ftill, which, in fome places, had been cxercifed on 
perfons who were accufed of a fpirit of witchcraft. When thofe of in- ;

It behoves us to rejoice, that we lire in happier times, 
when the darknefs of error is faft giving way to the 
light of reafon, truth, and fcience. As this darknefs is 
removed, fo will thofe opinions, prejudices, and fpeftres 
die, to which ignorance and credulity gave birth. I 
cannot fay, that the belief in witchcraft has entirely left 
the people in this parifh ; but it appears to have little 
influence either on their lives or their conduct. While 
fome give no credit to it at all, but impute the whole 
of it to delufion, the moil general opinion among the 
common people, is, that it did formerly prevail ; but 
they are convinced, that the power of the gofpel has now 
put it to flight. May the human mind daily increafe in 
wifdom, and afTert more and more it* native dignity, till

knowledge themfelves guilty, they inflicted torments upon a friend, a huf- 
bind, or even a darling infant ; adding the moft exquifite fenfibility of 
mind to the acutefl pain6 of the body, and thus compelling them to fay 
a'ny thing which their enemies defired ; as in that fituation they muffc 
have preferred death, however dreadful, to a life of mifery and defpair. 
But among thofe who were tried for witchcraft, we may believe, that 
many fuppofed, and were convinced, that they were in poffeffion of its 
power. The fame fpirit of credulity, which led people, in general, at 
that time, to believe in witchcraft, would induce fome of the weaker 
fort to imagine, that they were endued with the art. Thofe who dealed 
in witchcraft ufed enchantments ; and among the variety which they em- 
ployed, it is more than probable, that fome of thofe things which they 
had a wifli to accompiifh, really took place in the common courfe of 
events. When an inftance or two of this kind happened, they were as 
firmly of opinion, that it was done by their power, as the few who, in 
diftant places, even yet pretend to charms, arc fully pcrfuaded, that, by 
thefe means, they can prevent difafters, or cure difeafes. </p></div>

Elgin.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Gillan,</head> 


<p>
Situation, Extent, 

^ I 'HE parifh of Speymouth is bounded by the Murray 
Frith on the N., and by the river Spey, which 
feparates it from the county of Banff, on the E. It 
extends about 6i miles in length from N. to S., and 
about if, at an average, in breadth from E. to W. It 
is compofed of the 2 old pariflies of Effil and Dipple, 
which were united in the 1731, when the prefent name 
Was given to the united parifti, from its fituation at the 
mouth of Spey. The harbour, or mouth of Spey, is, 
according to obfervation on the fpot, W. longitude 3 
deg. 6 min., latitude 37 deg. 41 min. *

Face of the Country, Soil and Climate — At the dis- 
tance of about half a mile from the fea, the ground rifes 
• fuddenly to a fmall hill. Beyond this, there is almoft 
cne continued plain for 3^ miles in length, and about 
1^ in breadth, bounded on the fide towards the river by 
a fteep bank from 40 to 50 feet in height. At the end 
of this plain, the ground again rifes and terminates in a 
high hill to the S. The foil is for the molt part light. 
About one half of the arable ground is good fertile foil, 
being a light loam, of fufficient depth, on a bottom of 
black earth or clay ; the other half is a thin, gravelly, 
fharp foil, on a hard gravelly bottom ; in fome parts it 
is fandy. The grounds below the bank above mention^ 
ed; and between it and the river, are almoft all very 
good foil, efpecially that part towards the S., called the 
Haugh of Dipple, extending about a mile in length, and 
3-4ths of a mile in breadth. ( The cultivated ground lies, 
for the moft part, on the fide towards the fiver ; but 
towards the two extremities, it falls back nearly the 
whole breadth of the parifh. About the middle alfo, 
there are 2 pretty extenfive farms near the boundary to 
the W. The cultivated ground is equal to about one 
third part of the whole extent of the parilh : the pafture 
ground will be about 530 acres : there are about 30® 
acres in plantations of wood : about 50 acres of mofs 
ground : no acres of pebbles, or bare beach, along the

river and fea fide : ail the reft, equal to about the half 
of the whole extent of the'pari/h, is moor. 

The air is pure, the climate comparatively temperate 
and mild, and the fituation confequently healthy. The 
moll prevalent complaint feems to be rheumatifm, 
which may proceed chiefly from an inattention to wet 
clothes, and from the cold N. E. winds in fpring. It has 
bjeen long faid, that the low part of Murray has 4c days 
more of fair weather in the year than any other coun- 
try in the N. of Scotland ; and this part of it towards 
Spey is reckoned the drieft part of the country. And 
there is no doubt, that from April to October, we have 
generally much more dry weather than the countries 
in the neighbourhood. Indeed, what the farmer fears 
inoft, in the low part of Murray, is the "droughts that 
often take place here in the month of July. But it may 
be obferved, that the lightnefs and thinnefs of our foil 
in general renders it particularly liable to injury from 
drought. For the fame rcafon, a fticwery fummer is 
very favourable to it, and even that quantity of rain, 
which is very hurtful in raoft parts of Scotland through 
the fummer, and efpecially in the higher parts of the 
country in this neighbourhood, is beneficial through the 
greatelt part of the low country of Murray, and efpe- 
cially in this parim. Accordingly, in the year 1782, 
when there was fuch a failure in the crop through the 
greateft part of Scotland, from the exceffive rains, it is 
believed, there was a fufriciency here for the confump- 
tion of the country ; and that many of our farmers made 
more profit than ufual by that crop, from the high 
prices. It has been obferved by many, that the fum- 
mers have been more rainy fince the year 1782, than 
for a confiderable time before, and that the crops in our 

dry

«lrj light grounds have confequently been better. The 
medium depth of rain water fallen in a year, will be 
about 24 inches. 

The moft prevalent winds all along the coaft of Mur- 
ia . are from the S. W. They may be faid to prevail 
for two-thirds of the year. Perhaps the greateft defeft 
in the temperature of our climate is the cud N. E. 
winds, that commonly prevail in the months of April 
and May, which often retard the growth of the corns, 
and efpecially of the grafs, and are very fevere on deli- 
cate conftitutions. This is an inconvenience that is felt 
over almoft all the E. coaft of Britain ; but is particu- 
larly fo in fituations like this, which are open, and ex- 
pofed to the N. and E. Perhaps it might tend to leueri 
this inconvenience, if ftrips of wood were planted at cer- 
tain diftances where the country is level. 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, 
the population in 1755 was 994. The number of fouls 
in this parifh, according to an accurate lift taken ixx 
1792, is 1347. 

Males, - 655 From 20 to 50, - 51 % 

Females, - 692 From 50 to 70, - 216 

Under 10 years of age, 304 From 70 to 80, - 86 
From 10 to 20, - 210 From 80 to 90,. - 19 

Two or three of which laft are 90, or on the verge of it. 
The number of houfes inhabited is 310. The number 
of perfons to a family is 4f, at an average. — The re- 
gifter of baptifms deaths, and marriages is not com- 
plete for many years paft, as the people will not always 
be at the trouble and expenfe to have them recorded. 
This has been the cafe, efpecially lince the duty was im- 
^ofed. But, from notes taken by the minifter for fomc

time pail, the average number of marriages for a year 
appears to be 10 ; of deaths, 28 ; of baptifms, 43. The 
number of the males baptifed is to that of the females 
as 17 to 16 *. 

There are in this parifh at prefent 12 Englifh and 2 
Irifhmen. There are 5 of the Epifcopal perfuafion ; 40 
Roman Catholicks ; all the reft are of the Eftablifhed 
Church. — There are 71 farmers, 8 weavers, 7 tailors, 
5 blackfmiths, 3 coopers, 10 joiners, 32 fhip carpenters 
and blockmakers, 20 fawers, 8 faw millers, 3 corn mil- 
lers, 30 feamen, 6 fhopkeepers, 45 falmon fifhers, 8

* The parifli regifter was kept by a former minifter, from the 1 731 to 
the 1750; and as it has every appearance of uncommon accuracy, it may 
be proper to infert fome notes from it here. 

The number of fouls in the parifh in the year 1736, isftated to be 994, 
pf which the examinable perfons are 844 ; the children not examinable 
35©, The average of baptifms for a year, of 9 years, of which the above 
year (1736) is the middle, that is, from 1732 to 1740, inclufive, is 35 
7-9ths. The number of males baptifed during all thefe years is 162 ; of 
female?, is 160. The average of marriages for the fame time is 8. The 
average of burials is 24 i-9th; of which there is about 1 -5th more of fe- 
males than males; viz. males 10 8-9ths, females 13 *-9ths. A greater 
number of years is not taken, becaufe the regifter is not complete before 
the year I732, and becaufe, in the 1741 and 1742, there is an extraordi- 
nary number of deaths, no lefs than 112 for thefe % years. This uncom- 
mon mortality is to be accounted for, partly from the fmall pox which 
raged at that time. But it may probably be alfo accounted for , in fome 
nieafure, from the great failure in crop 1740. It is faid in the pari/h re- 
cord, that a faft was appointed by the fynod in November I74°» 0D ac " 
count of the threatened famine. From the fame caufe, perhaps, the bap- 
tifms are fo few in 1742.

the better fort of the farmers raife turnips and arti- 
ficial graffes, but not to the extent that could be wiihed. 
Their general mode of cropping is, 2 crops of oats after 
grafs • then barley or bear (big) with dung ; or, inftead 
of this, turnips, potatoes, and peafe, and then bear ; 
next oats with grafs feeds, or peafe and rye after the 
bear ; and then oats with grafs feeds. The grafs is' cut 
for hay the firft 2 years ; is paftured on for a year or 
2 more, and then broken up for oats as before. The 
proportions for grafs feeds generally ufed are, iz lb. red 
clover, and 5 lb. of white, with 2 bufhels rye grafs- 
They generally find profit in adding 2 lb. more of red 
clover, and half a bumel, or even a bumel of rye grafs, 
They have begun to add 2 or 3 lb. of rib grafs, for the" 
fake of the pafture. In the low grounds, near the river, 
they raife fome wheat, and this generally after turnips 
or potatoes. The proportion of ground under grafs in 
fuch farms, will not generally be above 1 -fourth of the 
whole. 

This mode of farming will appear faulty from the 
great proportion that is under crop. But the pra&amp;ice 
of the leffer farmers, who are by far the greateft num- 
ber, is ftill more obje&amp;ionable. Their common method' 
is to take 2 or 3 crops of oats after ley j then bear with 
dung ; then a crop, partly oats, partly rye ; then 2 crops' 
more of oats ; and when the ground is now fufficiently 
exhaufted, to leave it out in ley or natural grafs. Some- 
times they fow a little peafe the fecond crop after the 
ground has been dunged for bear j and this gives them 
an additional crop of oats, which is their great objed. 
It is very common here to mix about a fourth or fifth} 
part of rye with the oats, the firft or fecond crop after 
tear j and this they account a very profitable method*,'

89 they fay they have the rye over and above what they 
Would otherwife have in oats. They allow the ground 
to reft in ley, fometimes 4 years, but generally no more 
than 3 : The proportion of fuch ley is not above a fifth, 
Or even a fixth of their farm. This frequency of crop- 
ping will no doubt appear ftrange ; yet it is not peculiar 
to this place. It was pretty much the univerfal prac- 
tice over the N. of Scotland, not very many years ago, 
and is ftill pretty general among the fmaller tenants : 
They feem to acknowledge the error of this practice 
here, but fay, they cannot do otherwife, as they muft 
raife fo much corn, for bread to their families, and fod- 
der to their cattle. Oats is the ftaple produce of the 
parifh, and feem to anfwer beft with the foil in general. 
The oats here generally ufed are of a kind peculiar to 
the place, called Haugh or Dipple oats ; and when fowa. 
in ground properly prepared, are of an excellent qua- 
lity. They are a middle kind, between the early and 
late oats ; and are beginning to be in requeft in the 
neighbourhood. Rye fucceeds very well in our light 
foil. In fome places, barley is ufed ; but in general 
Scots bear or big is preferred, as a richer crop. Neither 
the one or the other are found to fueceed very well in 
the upper parts of the parifh ; nor are peafe or red clo- 
ver found to anfwer well, except in the grounds below 
the bank or nigh the Spey. To produce grafs fit for 
making hay, or peafe, or even barley or bear, in any 
proportion, lime is found heceffary in moft parts of the 
ground above the bank. But with the affiftance of lime* 
all thee crops fueceed very well : and, from the expe- 
rience of the bell farmers in this neighbourhood, it 1* 
found, that lime is particularly adapted to light, thin,

el it of moor, and is confequently of a moorifh nature. 
On fuch a foil, it is found to have the molt powerful 
effeft and to make it produce the above mentioned 
crops', viz. grafs, peafe, and bear or barley, in abun- 
dance, which it would not do before, even with the beft 
dreffing and dunging. This effed it muft produce, not only 
from its ading as a ftimulus, but from its power alfo 
of deepening the foil, and efpecially of retaining the 
moiftuve ; a circumftance of the firft importance in thin, 
light, dry ground. Our farmers here are fenfible of the 
great benefit of lime to their grounds ; but fome cannot 
afford, and others grudge the expenfe ; and thus not a 
great deal is yet ufed. It is to be had from the diftance 
of about 6 or 7 miles, in the parimes of Boharm and 
Keith, in the county of Banff, of the beft quality ; and 
when carried by the owners, as it generally is, it cofts 
about 9d. the boll ; that is, 3 Winchester bulhels pretty 
nearly : when brought only to the other fide of the 
Spey, it cofts generally 7d. or 7^dl The trouble and 
expenfe of ferrying it over the Spey is a great and al- 
moft unfurmountable bar to the general ufe of it here. 
Among the many advantages that would refult from a 
bridge over Spey, the removing of this difficulty would 
be one of the molt important, not only to this parifli, 
but to all the eaftern part of Murray. 

Turnips and potatoes anfwer extremely well in our 
light foil, even without lime. But as our grounds are 
almoft all unenclcfed, and cattle and Iheep, for the moll 
part, go at large du ing the winter, there is a great dif- 
couragement in railing turnips, and little are therefore 
yet raifecl. There is nearly the fame inconvenience 
with refpecl to fown grafs ; the ftieep either pluck it 
lap by the root, or eat it fp bare, as to prevent its com- 
ing

ing to any perfeftion in the fummer. Even our lefler 
farmers are ferifible of the great advantage of turnips 
and fown grafs ; but as they have almo'ft all fome Iheep, 
and are unwilling to keep them during the winter, they 
choofe rather to forego this advantage. The better fort 
of farmers endeavour to enforce winter keeping ; but 
the attempt is generally very unpopular and trouble- 
fome, and oft-times ineffectual. It is to be hoped, that 
it will fucceed better by degrees — Every family raifes 
a certain quantity of potatoes. The farmers raife them 
often without dung, and even in the grounds that are 
moll exhaufted. They plough the ground 3 or 4 times, 
and plant them after the plough in the end of April or 
beginning of May. They harrow them at different 
times ; and fometimes give them a very fhallow plough- 
ing before they begin to fpring above ground. This 
they find leiTens the trouble of hoeing, but it renders 
them fomewhat later. Planting them without dung, has 
alfo this effe&amp; ; nor is the crop fo rich as it would be 
with dung ; but it is ftill tolerable, if the ground be kept 
clean, and the potatoe is thought better in quality. 

For barley or bear, it is the pradlice here, and through 
all Murray, to give 3 ploughings ; one after harveft, 
one in April, and the laft, with dung, from the middle 
of May to the 8th of June, which is thought the belt 
time for fowing this grain here. For oats after bear, 
they give one ploughing in fpring : for oats, after ley 
or grafs, they plough after harveft, or after the firft 
ftrong froft. Sometimes they give a rib furrow to the 
ley in harveft, or early in autumn, in order to rot the 
fward in due time. For a fecond or third fucceffiVe 
crop of oats, and for a crop of rye, they almoft alway* 
give a rib furrow after harveft ; and this is* found to 

aiifwer"

anfwer well. Oats are fpwn in the month of April ; 
peafe about the fame time ; rye after harveft, or in 
March. The produce, at an average, will not be above 
4 bolls the acre. The parilh will fupply itfelf for com- 
mon. The plough generally ufed is of the fmall kind, 
here called the Englim plough. In fome of the fironger 
grounds, they ufe the Scotch plough, fomewhat lefs and 
lighter than of old ; and this, when properly conftrucl- 
ed, is perhaps the beft form of any, in every kind of 

foil. " 

The number of horfes in the parim will be about 
194; of black cattle about 636; of meep about 2000$ 
of fwine or hogs about 40. The better fort of farmers 
keep horfes of a good fize, 2 of which are able to draw 
a plough ; but the generality of the horfes are of a 
fmaller fize, but ftrong and harcjy. The cattle are ge- 
nerally of a fmall fize ; fuch as when fed for the butcher, 
will weigh from 20 to 22 ftone. A mixture of the 
Highland breed is now generally preferred and adopted 
all over this country, as being the handfomeft and moft 
hardy. The fheep are generally of a very fmall kind. 
Some time ago, the Linton breed was fought after, as 
being of a larger fize. But their wool was found to be 
much coarfer, and they were not found to thrive fo well 
with our pafture, as the old native breed of the coun- 
try ; nor was their flelh thought fo delicate. The old 
native breed is therefore now preferred here, and almoft 
all over Murray. Their wool is of the fineft quality, 
approaching, it is faid, to the Cheviot and Shetland wool. 
They will generally weigh, when fe^ for the butcher, 
about 7 or 8 lb. the quarter. The better fort of farm- 
ers ufe ploughs drawn by 2 ftout horfes. Some few ufe 
$ or 8 oxen in the plough. But the moft common 

draught

draught for the plough in this parifh is 2 horfes of * 
moderate fize, with 4 oxen, or a mixture of oxen and 
cows behind them ; fometimes 2 horfes with 2 oxen j 
and fome are now beginning to plough with 2 oxen on- 
ly. There are about 14 carts in the parifh, almoft all 
of 1 horfe draught ; and this is found to be the moft: 
convenient mode. 

There are 3 corn mills within the pariih, to one or 
ether of which all the lands in the parifh axe aftri&amp;ed. 
The multure, or the proportion paid for grinding the 
"corns, will be about an eleventh part of the quantity- 
ground. The tenants are like wife bound to fupport the 
mill-houfe and dam, and to carry the mill-ftones. It 
were better that mills were generally laid open, and 
that, inftead of high multures and mill-fervices, a pro- 
portionable additional rent were paid by the tenant f 
the landlord direelly. 

Extent of Farms, Rent of lands, &amp;c— The farms in

* The above ac-connt of the fmall extent of our farms, will appear 
furprifing to mod people. But it is to be obferved, that the greater 
part of the North of Scotland, about 30 years ago, was let in fmall 
farms. And there can be little doubt, that farms, of a moderate 
extent, are the moft favourable to the population of a country. The 
farmers of this parifli, who only labour from 14 to ao acres, and pay 
only from 61. to 9I. of rent, fupport families of healthy children, have 
them taught to read, and generally to write a little, and train them 
to induftry and virtue. They will alfo perhaps accommodate a cot- 
tager with a houfe on their fmall farm, fome poor or infirm relation* 
or a tradefman, or day-labourer. Six fuch farms may fupport per- 
haps 40 perfons, young and old, befides accommodating cottagers and 
their families. But all thefe together, wauld be reckoned but a fmall 
or moderate farm in many places, and would not probably fupport 
above a dozen of perfons. If, then, the number of the people be the 
ftrength of a nation, there feems little room to doubt, in anfwering the 
queftion as to the propriety of large or fmall farms, that in a public or 
political view, as well as that of humanity, the latter are to be preferred 
to the former. The mode of cultivation, and of laying out the lands, will 
not probably be in fo improved a tafte in fmall as in large farms ; but the 
produce, on the whole, it is probable, will be equal, and even much great- 
er in the article of grain, which is the moft valuable. And even as to the 
cropping and laying out of the ground, the proprietor may take care 
that this be done in a proper manner, by a little attention in laying down 
regulations in the tenant's leafe, and feeing that thefe regulations be fol- 
lowed. And as to the improvement of new grounds, he may alfo fecure 
that point as effectually, by binding the tenant in the fame way. And 
even with refpedl to the proprietor's intereft, which mult always, be a 
leading confederation , it is prefumed, that fmall tenants can afford to pay 
as high a rent as greater ones, from their fuperier induftry and attention ; 
and if one mould now and then fall in arrears, the rifjc is not fo great as 
When the fame thing happens to a greater tenant ; or if the proprietor's 
intereft Ihould fuffer a little, for it cannot be a great deal, yet he has the

The real rent of the whole lands of the parifb cannot 
be exaftly afcertained, as one part (the lands of Gar- 
mouth) is feued out, and is moftly in the poffeffion of 
the feuars themfelves. Befides the lands, there is a very 
valuable falmon fifliing on Spey, belonging to this parifh, 
from the fea for 4-J miles up the river. The real rent of 
this fiihing is confiderably greater than that of the lands 
in the parifli. The valued rent of the lands is 2771I. 
17s. id. Scotch money. The valued rent of the fifhery 
is 2541I. 17s. 8d. Scotch. 

Heritors. — The Duke of Gordon is proprietor of the 
greater part of the lands of this parilh, and fuperior of 
the reft. Of the filhery on Spey in this parifli, he is pro- 
prietor of 7-9ths. The Earl of Murray is proprietor of 
the remaining a-o,ths. There is a conliderable number 
of fmaller heritors or feuars, who have feus of different 
extent of the lands of Garmouth, all holding of the Duke 
of Gordon as fuperior. The greater part of them refide 
in Garmouth, and poflefs their own feus. Several of

be, to allow as much ground to a farm as can be laboured with one 
plough ; much lefs than this, would be a lof» to the tenant. Here and 
there, however, there fhould be larger farms, and farmers of greater 
ability and flcill, to give examples of new and more improved modes 
of culture, and thereby introduce improvements into the country at large. 
The Duke of Gordon, agreeably to that humane fyftem which he follows 
on all hit eftates, on renewing, of late, the lcafes in this parilh, conti- 
nued almoft all the fmall tenants in their poffcflions; and fuch of the 
farmers as had fubtenants, he took bound to continue them alfo in the 
grounds they had before, or to allow them an equivalent in fome other ^ 
part of their farm, if that were more convenient, according to the judg- 
ment of men mutually chofen. This is an example that ought to be 
generally followed, as it tends to prevent fubordinate opprefllon, and to 
keep the people in the country.

Vhurch, Schools, Poor, &amp;c— The church was built in 
the year 1732, foon after the annexation of the parifhes, 
in a centrical fituation for the united pariih ; but though 
bf fo late a date, is in very bad condition. The manfe 
ivas built about the fame time, at a little diftance from 
the church, and lately underwent a thorough repair. 
The offices were rebuilt of late. The ftipend, by decreet 
of annexation 1731, is 77 bolls 1 firlot 2 pecks bear, 
32 bolls 1 4- peck oatmeal, at 84- ftone the boll, and 340I.

another mortification of ajmerks, for the fchoohnafter of the. other old 
parifh, left by the fame anceftor of the Earl of Fife, and now enjoyed 
by a fupperannuated teacher. Befides thefe, there are a or 3 poor wo-

Garmouth.— The only village that deferves notice is 
Garmouth, or, as it is commonly pronounced, Garmach, 
It is fituated at the mouth of Spey ; contains about 620 
inhabitants ; is a burgh of barony, and has an annual 
fair. The lands belonging to this place, extending to 
about 240 acres, with a right on an extenfive common, 
are held by a confiderable number of feuars of the Duke 
of Gordon. The feus are of different extent. Moft of 
the feuars refide in Garmouth ; poflefs their own feus,

* The wages of men fervants for the half year, have rifen above one 
third within thefc 7 years; and feem rather too high for this part oE 
the country. It is alfo a pretty general complaint, that they do lefs 
work than when they had much lefs wages. To remedy this inconve- 
nience, the heft method feems to be, to employ married fervants more 
than has been done in this part of the country for fome time paft, and 
to accommodate them, and day-labourers and tradefmen, with houfea 
and other conveniences on the farms. This will encourage them to fettla 
in the country. The greater farmers are beginning to fee the conve- 
nience of having fome married fervants. As they cannot fo eafily re- 
move their families, they are lefs given to change, and, by confluence, 
more ftudiousto pleafe. Their children, too, by encreafing the number, 
will kffcn the wages of fervants.

rious purfuits in life, are in opulent circumftances. ¥h$ 
greater part of the houfes in this place are of mud. The 
mud, when made into mortar, is well mixed with ftraw ; 
and the more ftraw, it is thought the better. For about 
a foot from the foundation, they think it better to 
fcuild Hones with the mud. After this, the only pre- 
caution that feems neceffary is to make a flop at every 
2 or 3 feet more height, that the wall may dry, and be- 
come firm before they proceed further. Thefe houfes 
if well thatched, are very dry, clofe, and comfortable' 
and laft a very long time. They are fometimes built 
the height of 2 floreys. It adds to the look and dura- 
bility, if the walls are harled with lime on the outfide. 

The river of Spey and Harbour — The river Spey rifes 
on the borders of Lochaber, and runs through Badenoch 
and Strathfpey, until it comes within about 8 miles of 
the fea, nearly in the direction of N. E. ; it then runs 
due N., and falls into the Murray Frith at Garmouth, 
after a courfe of about 85 miles. It is faid to derive its 
name from a Pi&amp;ifh word, fignifying froth, from the 
rapidity of its ftream. It is the moll rapid river in 
Scotland, and, except it be Tay, is the largeft ; and 
though it does not ordinarily appear fo large as Tay, it 
is thought by fome to run as much Water in the year: 
Its fall from the Boat of Bog, nigh Gordon Caftle, to 
the fea, the diftance only of 3 miles, is 60 feet. Below 
this, it runs in a flat of about a mile in breadth, between 
the Bank of Bellie on the one fide, and that of Spey- 
mouth on the other, which there is every appearance 
that it has formed *. From the great fall towards the 

fea,

fa, the tide does not flow above half a mile up the ri- 
ver. The ordinary depth of water on the bar at neap 
tides, is from 8 to 9$ feet. 

The greateit inconvenience of the harbour is, that the 
flream, by its ftrength and rapidity, fometimes brings 
down in a flood fuch quantities of gravel as fhift the 
channel a little, efpecially at the entrance of the har- 
bour. But there are always good pilots at the place ; 
and many veffels belonging to the Englilh Company at 
Garmouth. Some of them of 350 tons burden, have been 
going and coming for thefe 7 years, without any parti- 
cular detriment or inconvenience. There has never 
been any attempt to build a pier ; and, from the above 
caufe, it is to be feared that it would not fucceed, or 
that the expenfe would exceed the value of the trade. 
The more on both fides, all along the bay of Spey, is 
foft gravel, for 5 or 6 miles, excepting one rock, which 
runs out a little into the fea, about 3 miles W. from 
Spey, and is hidden at high water ; fo that a veiTel will 
be in no great danger, if there be a neceflity, in running 

aihore 

joined, and that the river once run 50 feet above its preftnt level, along the 
citenfive plain which begins at Orton, about 8 miles from the lea, and 
runs nearly the whole length of the parifh of Speymouth to the fea. The 
fmall ftones and pebbles in this plain, which have the appearance of being 
rounded and fmoothed by running water, and the bank behind which has 
the appearance of being formed by the fame, feem to itrer.gtb.en this con- 
jecture. But at this time, far beyond all the hiftorical records of the 
country, the appearance of the furface of the earth muft have been very 
different from the prefent. The river, at prefent, runs ftraight into the 
fea. But there is a tradition, and indeed a plain evidence, from the ap- 
pearance of the ground, that it has once taken afudden turn within a few- 
hundred yards of the fea, and run weftward in a narrow cut of hollow 
ground, parallel to the more, now called the Lin, and entered the fea 
about 3 miles to the W. of its prefent mouth, oppofite to a hill yet 
called Spey'i Law.

Salmon Fijlring on Spcy. — The fifli in Spey are, the 
fulmon ; a trout, called here the white trout, of about 
2 or 3 lb. weight, which comes in March, and continues 
for fome months, and is very delicate : the grilfe, which 
"begins about the middle of June, and continues until 
the end of Auguft ; this is here believed to be the young 
falmon : the finnic, which comes about the end of Au- 
mft, and continues to the end of O&amp;ober. There is alfo 
a fmall fpotted trout found near the mouth of the river. 
All thefe afford excellent diverfion to the angler. But 
the falmon is the chief obje£l ; and of this there is a 
very valuable fiming on the river, and along the more 
near it. This nihing, for the whole extent of this pa- 
rim, and fome diftance above it, belongs to the Duke 
of Gordon, excepting a-cjths of what is in this parifh, 
which belong to the Earl of Murray. The fiming be- 
longing to this parifti extends for about 4f miles up the 
river from the fea. Mr. Richardfon of Perth, and Mr. 
Gordon of Portfoy, have it in leafe. The liming here be- 
gins on St. Andrew's day, and ends the 26th of Auguft. 
There is feldom, however, any regular fiming until a- 
bout the beginning of February. Until about the be- 
ginning of May, the greatefl part of the fifh is fent frefti 
in ice to London. From that time, the greateft part is 
boiled, and fent to the fame market. Very little is 
now falted for exportation, as there is a fufficient de- 
mand at the London market ; and the countries to which 
the falted falmon was formerly fent, are now fupphed.

is but a late difcovery, and adds greatly to the value of 
our falmon fiftiings, as the fifli fetches a much higher 
price in this way than in any other. Mr. Richardfon 
of Perth is faid to have the merit of introducing this 
pradice. The fiftiing is carried on with fmall boats, 
called Cobles, with 8 men and an overfeer, here called 
a Kenner, to each. The crew is changed every 12 hours. 
Our filters are reckoned uncommonly Ikilful in this bu- 
finefs. This arifes from the difficulties attending the 
flming on Spey, from the rapidity of the river and o- 
ther cireumftances. The nfhers have about il. 15s. of 
fixed wages, each man, for the feafon. They have 6d. 
each, when they catch 6 fifti or more within the 12 
hours, and 3d. when they catch only 4. : when they 
catch beyond a certain number, they have a flill farther 
allowance. In this way, they will make from 4I. to 61. 
in a feafon. They have bread and beer, as much as is 
necefiary, while they are working, and a bottle of fpi- 
rits among the crew for the 12 hours they are em- 
ployed *.

trade at Garmouth ; but, for fome years paft, the greater 
part of it has been carried on by an Englilh Company. 
Two capital wood merchants, Mr. Dodfworth of Yerk, 
and Mr. Ofbourne of Hull, about 8 years ago, purchafed 
of the Duke of Gordon, the extenfive foreft of Glen-

fince that time, they have carried on the trade with 
great fpirit. They employ a great many hands, at the 
foreft of Glenmore, in felling the trees, and manufac- 
turing them into plank, deals, mails, Sec, and in pre- 
paring the floats. The plank, deals, and mails are fent 
down the Spey in rafts, conducted by 2 men, at the rate

equal, it is faid by competent judges, to any that is im- 
ported from the Baltic, and inferior to that only in point 
of fize. The largeft mails are 60 feet in length. This

the greater number about 200 tons, and amounting in 
all to about 4000 tons ; and all of their own fir wood of 
Glenmore, both the plank and timbers. Some of thefe 
veffels they have fold ; others they employ in their own 
trade from Spey, and in the Baltic trade, and one was 
bought for the trade to the Bay of Campeachy. Thefe 
veffels, though wholly of fir, are thought by good 
judges to be equal to thofe of New-England oak, from 
the excellent quality of the fir. There are generally 
about 28 fhip carpenters and blockmakera employed by

deen to 'the S. and'E. It is of importance in a publick 
view, as the judges mull pafs this way to and from the 
circuit at Invernefs, and the troops to and from Fort 
George, Fort Augufttis, and Fort William ; and it is 
an objed of importance to every traveller that vifits 
this country. The road that panes the river Spey at 
the Boat of Bog in this parifh, is, and from the iituation. 
of the country ever muft be, the only great poft road, 
and great line of communication from the S. to the 
counties of Elgin, Nairn, Invernefs, Rofs, Cromarty, 
Sutherland, Caithnefs, and Orkney. Spey can very 
feldom be forded with fafety. The boat here is in- 
deed good, and well ferved. But a palTage by boat is 
inconvenient at the beft ; and when a river, fo great and 
rapid as the Spey, is higher than ordinary, or, in a 
flood, as is oft-times the cafe, it muft be highly incon- 
venient, and fometimes dangerous. When the import- 
ance of a bridge at this place to fo confiderable a part 
of the kingdom is confidered, it muft naturally excite 
furprife, that it has not long ago attracted effectually 
the attention of the publick. The internal improve- 
ments of a country claim the firft care of the publick ; 
and of thefe, roads and bridges, for facilitating commu- 
nications, are held the moft effential. If fo, then, a 
bridge over the Spey, at the great poft road, which is 
fo important an object to the whole of the North or 
Scotland, has a high claim on the publick attention.

There 1S nothing impraaicable in the undertaking, if 
the publick will lend the fuitable aid. An experienced 
archited, Mr. Stevens, who built the bridge at Dublin, 
and is now building that at Montrofe, furveyed the ri- 
ver at that place 2 years ago, and found the work per- 
fe£Uy praaicable, and that the rock, at the \V. fide of 
the river, run acrofs the whole way, at a moderate 
depth below the bed of the river. The breadth of the 
river at that place is about 98 yards. This he propofed 
to cover with 3 arches. The expenfe he eftimated at 
i4,oocl. at the higheft. No fuch fum as this, even for 
an object, of the greater!: utility, can be expected to be 
raifed in the country, either by fubfcription, or by a 
toll, or by both. This could only be expected in the 
neighbourhood of a great town. It is only by the ef- 
fectual aid of government, that a work of fuch magni- 
tude can be undertaken in the country, and efpecially 
in fuch a diftant part of the country as this. And to 
that effectual fupport, this work appears to have the 
jufteft claim, not only from its great utility to fo confi- 
derable a part of the kingdom as above mentioned, but 
likewife for reafons in which government is more im-* 
mediately concerned. At prefent, a flood in Spey may 
very materially affect the adminiftration of juftice, by 
Hopping the judges in going on the circuit to Invernefs, 
or in returning from thence to Aberdeen : Or the troops 
may, by the fame caufe, be retarded in their march to 
or from Fort George, or the other forts in the North, 
or from the country on the one fide of the Spey to the 
other ; and cafes may occur, in which this may be of 
very bad confequence to the peace of the country, to 
the protection of the fubjects, and to other purpofes of

* Tf the fcnfe of the country on this fubjeft cm be of avail in draw.ng the 
attention of government, this any be gathered from the molt unequivocal ex- 
pr-ffi-m of it lately given, and affords the ttrongeft argument for the effcaual 
iaterpofition of government in this matter. ' La[l year a fubfcription was fet en 
foot by the Duke and Dutchefs of Gordon, for building a bridge on Spey at. 
the Boat of Bog, near Fochabers, and in a very fhort time upwards of 3000). 
wis fubferibed in this neighbourhood, or by pcgfoQS connefted with it. A 
good deal more would have been fubferibed 3 but as the fubferiptioa wa«. 
undertaken in the confidence that government would give an effectual aid, 
in feeing the fenfeof the country as to the utility of the work, fo fully ex- 
prcflod, and as it was foon after found, that this expectation could not be rt». 
ljfed at that time, from the breaking out of the war, as was faid, the fubforip- 
tion was given up for the time, becaufe of itfelf it would never be tfffaclual. 
It feems there was the like flattering profpeel of a bridge at this place before 
the American war ; but that war, in like manner, baniihed it. It is hard that 
war lhould fo materially affeft the internal and effential improvements of 2 
country. It is hoped, that fuch a fmall aid can ftill be fpared for fo ufeful and 
ueceffary a work. But if this cannot be otherwife granted, it might be done 
by means of a fmall temporary tax on the northern counties. It is prefumed, 
that they would readily fubmit to fome fmall additional burden for fuch a pur- 
pofe ; and it is fuppofed, that an additional duty on home fpirits in thefe coun- 
tries, would be the moft proper in itfelf, the leaft felt, and the moll reasiiiy 
agreed to. It has been propofed to build a bridge over Spey at the Boat of 
Brig, about 5 cr 6 miles above the Boat cf Bog. A bridge could be built there, 
it is faid, at a much left; expenfe, and would, no doubt, be very ufeful to that 
part of the country. But with regard to publick and general utility, it could ne- 
ver anfwer the purpofe of a bridje at the Boat of Bog, or fuperlede the necef- 
frty of another there. The road which leads to the Boat of Brig from the S. 
and E., is often impafiuble, and always inconvenient during the winter, fo that 
it is impoffible that it cari ever become the poft road, or the great line of com- 
munication between the S. and N. On the other hind, the road which pafles 
at the Boat of Bog, being the coaft road, is always paffable, and for this reafo'n 
is, and ever muft be the poft road, and the great line of communication from 
S. to N. Nor from the fituation of the ground does it appear pofiible to make 
a patent rord between the two places on the S. fide of Spey. However ufeful, 
then, a boat may be at Boat of Brig, it can never fupply the place or fuperfedc 
the neeeflity of one at the Boat of Bog. A, bridge over tb,e river Findhorn

CharaBer of the People, Mode of Living, Lrefs, &amp;c— 
The people of this parilh are, in general, honeft, peace- 
able, and induftrious ; very charitable to the poor, and, 
in cafes of diftrefs, very much difpofed to afts of hu- 
manity. ^ They are generally rather above the middle 
nze, aftive and hardy. Few go into the army. The 
greateft part apply" themfelves to hirfbandry, to the fal- 
mon fifhing, or a feafaring life. The young men of the 
part of the parilh next to the fea, and efpecially of the 
town of Garmouth, are much difpofed to this lall ; and 
many of them go to fea, and become excellent feamen. 
There are about a dozen natives of this place who are 
now matters of vefTels. The people feem to enjoy the 
comforts of fociety in the fame degree, as thofe of their 
{ration throughout the kingdom in general, and are con- 
tented with their fituation. The kindnefs and indul- 
gence of their landlord, the Duke of Gordon, contributes 
in no fmall degree to their contentment, as well as com- 
fort. The diet of the labouring people here, and in ge- 
neral, all through the Lowlands of the North of Scot- 
land, is porridge, made of oat meal, with milk or beer, 
to breakfaft ; fowens, (that is, a kind of flummery, made 
of oat meal, fomewhat foured), with milk or beer, to 
dinner ; and kail, that is, greens or cabbage, boiled with 
oatmeal, to fupper. With all thefe, they ufe bread of 
oat meal, or what is called houfehold meal, that is, fome

mixture of barley, rye, and peafe. On Sundays, they 
have generally barley broth, with fome meat in winter, 
and butter in fummer. In places near the fea-coaft, 
they have fometimes fifh. Turnips are fometimes ufed 
in place of cabbage or greens ; and potatoes drelTed m 
different ways, with butter, milk, onions, &amp;.C., is com- 
monly one-third part of their food from the beginning of 
September to the end of March. This is the general run 
of diet of the labouring people in this part of the coun- 
try, that is, of letter farmers, farmers fervants, and 
people of that clafs ; and all the above they have in fuf- 
ficient plenty. The oat meal, which forms fo confider- 
able an article in the above, is of the very beft quality 
throughout all Murray ; and, notwithstanding the ob- 
jections made againfl: the ufe of oat meal by fome, ir. 
is known to thofe who are beft qualified to judge, to be, 
when properly drefled, one of the moft wholefome and 
nouriming articles of food. The cottagers and poorer fort 
of the people have not alw T ays what is called kitchen, 
that is, milk or beer, to their meals. In the view of 
patriotifm and humanity, it is a pity that the article of 
beer cannot be rendered more attainable by the poorer' 
fort of people. This might be effected, at leaft in fome 
meafure, by lowering the duty on malt, and impofmg it 
on fpirits ; and this would have the double happj^ effect 
of affording to the poor a comfortable and ftrengthening 
beverage, and checking the ufe of that which is noxi- 
ous. Such a meafure deferves the attention of thofe 
who are able to carry it into effect.

nants have as many fheep as fupply wool for their own

milies, and manufaftured and dyed in their neighbour- 
hood. Almoft all raife as much flax likewife as fupplies 
their families with Hurts, &amp;c., which they fpin alfo in 
their houfes. The induftry of the women in fpinning 
is very commendable. In many families they make a 
little of woollen and linen cloth, efpecially the latter, for 
fale ; and the poorer women fpin a good deal of linen 
yarn for fale. The bonnet is ftill commonly ufed by 
the men. A watch is no uncommon thing among the 
fervants. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations, — It w6uld add greatly to 
the value, as well as to the appearance of the country, 
if part of the moor-grounds were brought into cultiva- 
tion, and part planted. Some parts of the moor in this 
parifh might be cultivated to advantage with the aid of 
lime. In other parts, clumps or pieces of plantation, pro- 
perly difpofed, would be a great improvement. Exten- 
five plantations have been made on the W. fide of this 
parifh, by the Duke of Gordon and the Earl of Fife, 
which are already a great ornament, and will foon be 
of great ufe to the country. There is no doubt that 
the plantations will foon be continued on each fide of 
the highway all along to Spey. As our mofles are near- 
ly exhai. (led, it is of great importance to extend plan- 
tations for a fupply of fuel. Firs, and fome other kinds 
of wood, grow on our hardeft foil to the fea fide — The 

pihdaricif or, pepper grafs, is the only uncommon bo-

tanical plant that has been obferved here. It is found 
in fome low damp places in the moor, that have been 
under water in the winter.— The common fuel through 
the greateft part of the parilh is moory turf. In Gar- 
mouth, and near the fea, they ufe coals, the greateft 
part from Sunderland. Since the duty has happily been 
taken off, they have fold at from 2 2d. to is. the barrel j 
which mould be equal to 3 Winchefter bufhels heaped. 
There is fome moor ftone in the upper part of the pa- 
rilh, which is ufed in building. The llone that is prin- 
cipally ufed, is taken out of a rock that runs along the 
Spey for about a mile, where the poft-road panes. It 
is of a red colour, and is altogether of the nature of 
lime-fione. It becomes harder according to its depth ; 
and it is only what is at fome depth, that is hard and 
durable enough to be fit for building. Towards the top, 
it is foft, and of a marly nature ; fome parts of it pretty 
rich, and when expofed to the air and weather, it dif- 
folves. The clay that is mixed with this rock, or be- 
tween the' different flrata of it, is alfo of a red colour ; 
and in many parts, of a marly nature, and of confkler- 
able ftrength. Both the foft flone and the clay are laid 
on the lands, by thofe in the immediate neighbourhood, 
to great advantage. But the quantity necefTary to pro- 
duce any conliderable effect, has hitherto prevented thofe 
who are at the diftance of a mile, from ufing it. It 
feems, however, to be worth the trouble ; and it is pro- 
bable, it will be more ufed as its value is known. The 
great poft road enters this parilh at the Boat of Boff 
and paffes through the middle of it to Elgin, The fare 
for the pafiage here over the Spey is for a fingle per- 
fon id. ; for a man and horfe ad. ; for a chaife and 
pair as. 6d. j for a horfe and cart 2d., &amp;c. When the

river is in a flood, the fare is raifed. . There is another 
ferry at the mouth of Spey. Another road leads from 
Garmouth, or the mouth of Spey, along or near the fide 
of the river to Rothes and the Highlands. A third road 
leads from the fame place to Elgin. All thefe roads are 
in pretty good condition. Like the other roads in Mur- 
ray, they are, from the lightnefs of the foil, and the 
drynefs of the climate, eafily kept in tolerable repair. 
Turnpikes would not fuit the ftate of this country, nor 
would they, it is believed, be at all relifhed. The ex- 
penfe would be too great for the general condition of 
the people. It would be better to convert the flatute- 
labour into money, at a low rate. There is reafon to 
think, that is. 6d. for every man for the year, would, 
if properly applied, go farther in keeping the roads in 
repair, than the ftatute-labour itfelf, as at prefent ex- 
acted. 

This parifli has the honour of a connexion with the 
celebrated family of Chatham, which, though fomewhat 
diftant, is not to be omitted *. Jane Innes, wife to 
Governor Pitt, and great - grandmother to the prefent 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, was daughter to. James 
Innes, Efcj. of Redhall, a place within a few hundred 
yards of the prefent church of ! peymouth, on the bank 
of Spey, immediately oppofite to Gordon Caftle. The 
family ol Redhall was a branch of the family of the 
Innefes, Baronets, of Goxtoun. — From the fituation of 
this parifh on the river Spey, it has been the fcene of

Another army of rebels, in the year 1 1 10, halted at the mouth of Spey, with 
a determination to difput: th; paffage of King Alexander I., who was parfuing 
them. The king forced the p^ffa-e, and ordered Alexander Scrimger to at- 
tack the enemy with a part of his army, who routed them, and put them to 
flight.— {Ibid.) 

In the year 1160, near the mouth of the fame river, and on the moor be- 
tween Speymouth and Urquhart, as is fuppofed, a rebellion of a ftill more feri- 
«us afpeft was quelled, by a viaory gained by Malcolm IV. over the people 
of Murray, when the vhole army of the rebels was cut to pieces, after 
which the chief families of the province, and all who were concerned in the 
rebellion, (as being, according to Buchanan, " a people of a turbulent dif- 
pofition,") were removed and difperfed through other parts of the king- 
dom j and others from different parts were trar.fplanted into Murray in 

their room. (Ibid.) King Charles II. landed at Speymouth from Holland 

in the year 265 0. Some fay, he arrived fir ft at Cromarty. It is certain, 
however, he came by fea to Spey, as the defcendents of a man of the 
name of Milne, who carried his Mcjefty on fhore, are ftill in Garmouth, 
and are diftinguilhed from others of that name, in the fame place, by the 
name of King Milnes, fiom that encumftance. He was here received by 
the Laird of Innes, and other gentlemen, and dined with the faftor of 
Lord Dumkimling, who lived in Garmouth, in a houfe which was only late- 
ly taken down ; and here it probably was, that lie was nr.ide to fign the cove- 
nant. In fpring 1746, the rebels, on their return from the S., colledhd in 
great numbers on the bank? of Spey, and the manfe of Speymouth b;c?.me, for 
fome time, according to an account left by the minifter of that period, their 
head quarters on Spey ; and fcveral of their principal officers, as Lord John 
Drummond, the Duke of Perth, Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerinoch, Secretary 
Murray, put up in it, and many others frequented it. This, the minifter ob- 
fcrves, was expenfive to him, but they ufed him very civilly, and gave him no 
difturbance in point of principle ; only there was no public worflnp during 
their ftay. It appears from this, as well as from what they th. ml'elves gave 
out at the time, that they meant to have made a ftand at Spey againft the 
King's army ; and this the Duke of Cumberland expected. And there is no

holm, &amp;c., in the immediate neighbourhood. And even 
the inhabitants, who refide in other parts of the parifh, 
continue to call the Situation in the vicinity of the church, 
more properly, Canoby. This parifh extends from E. 
to W. about 9 miles, and from N. to S. above 6 miles, 
Englifh meafure. 

Canoby may be confidered as the low-lands of Elk- 
dale ; for the higheft grounds, which rife gradually to- 
wards the E. and N. E., cannot be called mountains, 
when contracted with the general appearance of the 
conterminous parifhes of Langholm, Ewes, and Caftle- 
ton. and the country of Elkdale, at large. At the fame 
time, although there are no hills in Canoby, the fur- 
face is uneven, and diverfified by a variety of ridges 
and flats, excepting the land Situated on the banks of 
the river, which is generally level. The central part of 
the parifh is interfered by the river Elk ; and the poll 
road from Edinburgh to London, by Langholm and Car- 
lifle, palling in the fame direction, through a line of ve- 
nerable oaks, planted by the hand of Nature ; and other 
trees, of different descriptions, holds up in varied fuc- 
ceffion to the view of travellers, the moft beautiful and 
pi&amp;urefque rural fcenery, that is perhaps to be met 
with any where in Scotland. 

Soil. —The foil, in this tract, being ^hat is called 
Holm-land, is moftly light loam • and being fheltered to 
the E. and W. by a profufion of wood on the Hoping 
grounds on each fide of the river, the whole length of 
the parifh, from N. to S., affords productive and early 
crops, when under proper cultivation. On the banks 
of Liddel, which divides the parifh from England, for 
the Space of 4 miles to the S. E., the foil is much of the

fame quality with that on Efk. In other parts, where the 
ground is more elevated, it coniifts of a mixture of mofs 
and clay, which, when limed, yields abundant crops of 
oats in dry feafons, fuch as the laft j but on account of 
its wetnefs, which certainly admits of a remedy, is 
found unfit for the culture of barley arid potatoes j at 
leaft thefe crops are more precarious. 

Woods and Orchards. — This parifh abounds in woods. 
The number of acres thus occupied cannot be lefs than 
loeo. In the time of the minority of the prefent Duke 
of Buccleugh, who is fole proprietor of the parifli, the 
wood was all natural ; but having fuffered much by de- 
predation, as the writer is informed, that lofs has been 
fince fully repaired, by the numerous plantations made 
in different lituations, by his Grace's order. And the 
woods now placed, under the infpe&amp;ion of faithful and 
Ikilful overfeers, are in the beft ftate and prefervation. 
The oak reigns here over his fubje&amp;s of the wood, of 
all denominations, from the creeping ivy to the tallefl 
afti. In the new plantations, plains, beeches, elms, firs 
of every defcription, poplars, &amp;c. are making rapid P ro- 
grefs, being properly fenced, and feafonabiy pruned A. 
limited quantity of oak is cut down every year ; which 
furnifhes bark to the tanner, and timber to the tenant. 
A variety of orchards have been planted at his Grace's 
expenfej within thefe 7 or 8 years, upon fuch farms as 
were thought molt favourably fituated'for that purpofe \ 
and they promife well, for the time. But there are on- 
ly 4 of older ftanding, that are as yet produdive, viz" 
at Forge, Woouhoufelces, Rowanburn, and the miniC 
t,r's, which, in kindly feafons, yield a good deal of 
fruit, of the bell quality.

Rivers and Fi/b.—The rivers Efk and Liddel hold the 
firft rank ; the former rifing in the higheft part of the 
panfti of Efkdalemoor, and the latter in the upper ex- 
tremity of Liddefdale, or parifh of Caftleton. Both, 
after collecting in their different conrfes of nearly the 
fame extent of 23 or 24 miles, a great number of tri- 
butary ftreams, meet at the fouthmoft part of this pa- 
rim ; when the Liddel lofes at once its name and waters 
in the Efk ; which, after running from the point of con- 
fluence about 7 miles, in a S. W. direftion, difcharges 
its united ftreams into the Solway Frith. The fmaller 
river of Tarras, having its fource in the parifli of 
Ewes, and feparating, on the N E. quarter, this parifli 
from that of Langholm, is remarkable for its preempt 
channel, romantic fcenery, and giving title of Earl to 
Walter Scott of Highchefter, who married Lady Mary, 
eldeft daughter of Francis Earl of Buccleugh. The pa- 
tent bears date the 4th September 1660. There are be- 
fides, many burns or rivulets, which, in rainy feafons, 
fwell to a great fize, but which, otherwife, do not me-

river trouts are found in great plenty in all the rivers 
and rivulets in the parilh. They are all excellent in 
their kinds ; but the Elk trouts and whitens, in parti- 
cular, are, for their delicate flavour, highly prized.

His Grace has complimented certain of his tenants with 
fo much of the water as borders upon their farms ; the 
iifli therefore is feldom brought to market, being chiefly 
ufed in their families. They are catched by the long 
net, the rake net, the rod, and fometimes killed, or ra- 
ther murdered, by an inftrument called a Lifter *. 

Mineral Springs — There are the appearances of fever al 
chalybeate fprings fcattered throughout the parifti ; but 
the only mineral well in this neighbourhood, reforted 
to for medicinal purpofes, is that at Heather, which lies 
on the Englifli fide of Liddel. It is ufed chiefly in the 
cafe of fcorbutic diforders, and ftomachic complaints. 
There is a petrifying fpring near the river of Tarras in 
this pariih, the only one that is known in the whole 
country, Mr. Keir, of Langholm parifh, who will be 
more particularly mentioned afterwards, collected the 
petrifactions of fog, &amp;.c, formed along the courfe of 
the ftream, to the amount of feveral cart loads, which ' 
he burnt after the manner of lime ftone, and found it 
to be excellent manure. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The inhabitants of this parifh 
cannot boaft of a dry atmofphere ; but although there 
be a conliderable proportion of rain and moillure in this 
place throughout the year, the climate is by no means 
unfavourable for the purpofes either of health or vege- 
tation. Of the former, the number of long-lived per-

fons of both fexes, is a proof; and the latter is con- 
hrmed by the early progrefs, and fuperior quality of 
vegetable productions, beyond any other parifh in the 
d'ftnft. The climate, however, is very different, in 
different fituations. In the whole tract of the Efk 
which is filtered on all hands, the air is generally mild 
and temperate, even in cold feafons ; while it is fharp 
and piercing, within the diftance of a mile or two from 
that fituatiou. The difeafes incident to this parifli are, 
rheumat^m, and thofe of the nervous kind ; which may 
be induced by the humidity of the air, and coarfe man- 
ner of living ; as the poorer clafs of the inhabitants are 
moft commonly affefted with fuch diforders. I am forry 
that a regard to truth obliges me to mention another 
difeafe, namely, fcrofula. Whether this direful ma- 
lady be indigenous, or was at firft introduced by inter- 
marriages, is not for the writer to determine. But it 
falls under his obfervation, that numbers in this place 
are more or lefs infected with it. And as it is an efta- 
fcliflied fa£t, that it may be propagated through a feries 
of generations, much caution ought to be ufed in form- 
ing .matrimonial connexions, as the only effectual way 
of preventing the entail of this malignant diforder upon 
pofterity ; thus lightening fo far the load of human woe. 
— The prejudices of the people againft inoculation are not 
yet entirely removed, although many fatal inftances 
have occurred, and are, at this very feafon, daily pre- 
fented to. their view ; which, while they fpeak to their 
feelings, ought alfo to enlighten their underllandings. 
The natural fmall pox has raged here for fome time 
pall with deftruftive violence, and fwept off multitudes } 
While fcarcelv an individual has fuffered, that under- 
went the procefs of inoculation.

Moratory Birds.— The curlew appears in the higher 
fixations, bordering upon Caftleton and Ewes ; and al- 
io the plover, dotterel, and fieldfare. In the more in- 
land parts, the woodcock, bullfinch, fwallows of the 
different fpecies, and cuckoo, fix their temporary fet- 
tlements. 

Game.— The black cock haunts the woods upon Tar- 
ras : moorfowl are found in fome fituations upon thje 
fkirts of the parifh ; partridge, in many places ; and 
hares every where, in great abundance. The Duke 
of Buccleugh, fome years ago, fent out a breed of 
pheafants to flock his woods in Efkdale ; and they fre- 
quently make their appearance in Canoby. 

Roads and Bridges. - In no fituation, within the wri- 
ter's knowledge, have greater or more rapid improve- 
ments been made in thefe two articles, fo effential to civi- 
lization, and the exertion of induflry in every fphere, 
than in this parifn. About 20 years ago, every fitua- 
tion out of the line of the river Efk, excepting in a 
very dry fummer, was almoft inacceflible. Since that 
period, leading roads have been made on the E. and 
W. fide of the parifli, and branches carried from thefe 
to almoft every farm j and, in a little time, will be ex- 
tended to all without exception ; fo that the various pur- 
pofes of agriculture or commerce can now with eafe 
and comfort be fully ferved : The effect, which this hap- 
py change has produced on both, will be mentioned in the 
proper place. For making and keeping thefe roads in 
repair, his Grace has appropriated 5 per cent, out of 
the whole land-rent of the parifh, and has hitherto given 
jol. a-year, out of his own pocket, in addition. A

found altogether inade.uate to the p urpof e. The" 
Ws, m the aggregate, may amount from 3 ocl. to 
400I a. y ear. There is a toll-bar in the parilh placed 
esaclly upon the fide of Scotch dike, the ancient/ as ^ 
as prefent march between Scotland and England • the 
produce of which is applied entirely toward the repair 
of the poft road. There are about 10 bridges, with 1 
arch, over different rivulets, and numberlefs fmaUex 
ones, in the parilh; befides 2 over the Elk, the one hav- 
ing 3 arches, and the other 2. (he former, diftant 
It mile from the latter, was built about 50 years ago, 
at the expenfe of the county, from motives of huma- 
nity ; at leaft, it does not appear that there could, at 
that time, be any other objeft in view of general con- 
cern. The pariihioners, to the W. of the river, who 
are numerous, had no accefs to the church, or to the 
E. fide, before this bridge was built, but by wading or 
riding the river, or palling in a boat, when it ceafed, 
from flood, to be other wife fordable. And the boat 
having been overfet at one time, and many perfons 
drowned, in returning from church, and many indivi- 
duals having loft their lives, after this event, the idea 
of building a bridge, that had been long fuggefted, was 
at length happily realized. 

The other bridge was only finilhed laft fummer. It 
is built upon a large fcale, and has a ftriking appear- 
ance ; to which its romantic fituation very much con- 
tributes. The fpan of the large arch is 70 feet, that of 
the fmaller one 45 feet ; the height of the bridge to the 
pafs-way 46 feet, and its length 244 feet. By this

bridge, a communication is opened ujj of great utility 
to the country ; as, fhortening the road feveral miles in 
going and returning from his Grace's colliery at Byre- 
burnfoot ; a new direction is given to the port road for 
the fpace of if mile; by which means a long pull, from 
N. to S. on the old road, is fuperfeded ; the chilling 
blafts in winter on this part avoided, being the moft ex- 
pofed fituation on the road between Langholm and Long- 
town ; and new romantic fcenes difclofed to the view of 
the traveller, that mock all defcription. The road lead- 
ing from the E. end of the new, towards the old bridge, 
is cut along the fide of a fleep bank covered with wood, 
forming an amphitheatre 5 at the S. end of which an- 
other bridge, with 2 arches, is to be built the enfuing 
fummer. When the operations now carrying on in this 
quarter, and further intended, are completed, which it 
is expected will be the cafe before Martinmas next, , the 
new line of road, for boldnefs of defign, and difficulty 
of execution, muft aftonifii every paffenger. All thefe 
works are clone at the Duke's private expenfe, and muft 
coft feveral thoufand pounds. 

Mines — There are 2 collieries in Canoby ; one at 
Archerbeck, let to an Englim gentleman of the name of 
Lomax, wrought by an open level ; the other at Byre- 
burnfoot, in the pofTeffion of his Grace, to whofe public 
fpirit the country is much indebted upon that head *. 

The 

Ml) the year 1770 or 1771, the whole coal mines and lime flone quarries 
in this partfh, wen let to the fame perlbn, upon a very long leafe ; one of 
the conditions of which was, according to information, that a fupply of 
fcoal, equal to the demand of the country, mould be readily afforded at 
ail rimes. The tackfman, to avoid the great expenfe of an engine* con- 
1 his. operations to thofc places whrre coal could be wrought by 
means of an open level, Hence the quantity of coal got in tins" man- 
ner. 



4*6 Statiflical Account 

The coal here is wrought by a water engine upon a new 
conftruftion, the invention of Mr. Keir of Millholm. Jt 
is moved by means of a large bucket, of a fquare form, 
fufp-nded from the end of a lever, having a valve at bot- 
tom in the centre, which, by machinery, is made to fhut 
and open in the in ii ant of time the bucket mould fall 
and empty itfelf. The other end of the lever is fixed to 
the pump, fpear, or rod ; and by the continued aftion of 
the bucket defcending and afcending, filling and empty- 
ing the water it contains, which is of fuch weight as to 
make the beam preponderate, the pumping is carried on, 
and the coal pit cleared of the water collefted below. As 
the principle upon which the engine is conftrucled, is 
known only to the ingenious inventor, who, it is report- 
ed, means to take out a patent, a more particular def- 
cription ihall not be attempted. The annual produce of 
the coal mines cannot, at prefent, be afcertained ; but 
the writer is authorized to ft ate, that a fupply can be af- 
forded equal to any poffible demand. 

' Lime Stone and Free Stone.— -Lime ftone is found in- 
great abundance in many parts of the parim, particular- 
ly on the E. fide of Efk ; but that which is wrought at 
Harelawhill, is in greateft requeft, as yielding the pureft 
lime. It is alfo remarkable for its whitenefs, as well as 

the 

ner, was only partial; and many, in diftant parts of the country, who 
had no other rtfource, were often reduced to the greateft diftrefs. In 
thcfe circumftances, the Duke, although the tackfman might have been 
compelled to implement the terms of his leafe, was phafed to enter into 
an agreement wi;h him, by which his Grace was to be at liberty to fet 
up a colliery in any fituation that did riot diredtly interfere with Mr. 
JLomax's levels; and very confiderable fums of money have been expand- 
ed by his Grace, in bringing thofe works to bear, which at length afford 
to the public the happy prolpeJl of a prompt and ample fupply of ihrf 
DecefTary article of life.

the quantity of powder from the bufliel of (hells. And what 
is of great importance, the quarries in this quarter are 
eafily wrought, and feem inexhauftible. It has been men- 
tioned above, that the lime-ftone was let alongft with the 
coal : The tackfman is bound to furnilh lime in {hells at 
7 d. the buftiel 5 three of which commonly fill a fingle 
horfe cart. From the lime kilns at Holhoufe and Hare- 
lawhill, the whole country is fupplied, to the diftance of 
30 miles. The parifti every where abounds in free-ftone 
of various kinds, which is conftantly ufed in building. A 
circumftance of a Angular nature may be here noted ; that 
within the fpace of 200 yards, in one particular fpot, coal 
and peat, lime-ftone and free-ftone, may be digged. 

State of Agriculture. ^It does not appear that agri- 
culture had been profecuted on this part of the border 
either with (kill or iriduftry in former periods. The late 
Dr. Grahame of Netherby, a gentleman of extenfive views, 
and uncommon enterprife, had the merit of refcuing the 
Englim borderers, in this neighbourhood, from a ftate of 
idlenefs and dimpation, to which they had been habituat- 
ed, by pointing and enforcing their attention to purfuits 
of induftry. And he lived to fee his endeavours crowned 
With fignal fuccefs ; having improved his eftate from 
2500I. a-year, the rental when he came to the fucceffion in 
1753, which, at the fame time, was feldom paid up, to 
8000 1., the rental at his death in 1781, which was well 
paid ; while the tenants lived more comfortably and re- 
fpe£tably than formerly, when they paid little more than 
a quit-rent. 

The habits and circumftances of the people m this pa- 
vifh, were much a-kin to thofe on the Englilh fide of the 
border, when the prefent Duke of Buccleugh came of age* 

Vol. XIV. 3 G And 



4 1 S StaiiJHcdl Account 

And it did not efcape his Grace's obfervation, that this 
part of his eftate was alfo capable of great improvement , 
poffcffing the advantages of furface, and climate, and coal, 
and lime. A gentleman of diftinguiftied talents and adi- 
vity was at length found to direct and fuperintend im- 
provements upon the eftate in this country, Mr. Keir 
above mentioned 5 whofe chief attention came naturally 
to be turned to Canoby, as the pa*im in the diftrift moft 
capable of agricultural improvement, In purfuance of this 
view, roads were made j farms laid out where the plough 
had never before entered ; commodious houfes and of- 
fices built and flated at his Grace's expenfe, for the en- 
couragement of the tenants ; the ground divided into en. 
clofures with hedge and ditch ; and leafes given at a mo- 
derate rate. The confequence now is, that luxuriant crops 
of corn are reaped, where heath, and bent, and mofs, 
had predominated, perhaps, fince the deluge ; population 
increafed ; the fpirit of induftry roufed ; the face of the 
parim beautified ; and the inhabitants, in point of civiliza- 
on, proportionably improved* 

Wheat is cultivated with fuccefs, on the land fituated 
on the banks of the river, as well as every other fpecies of 
grain ; and the foil in this direction is well adapted for 
turnips and potatoes, both which are raifed in great per- 
fection ; although the turnip fyftem is not fo much fol- 
lowed here as in fome other places, lefs favourable, per- 
haps, for their production. In the larger farms, the ufual 
routine of cropping is obferved, viz. two crops of oats after 
grafs j then peafe or turnips ; then barley with clover and 
rye grafs. Wheat is generally fown after potatoes ; the 
increafe of which is feldom lefs than from 10 to 14 after 
one •, of oats, from 6 to 14 ; of barley, from 8 even to 
30 j of potatoes, from 14 to 40, and upwards.

Seed-Time and Harveft.— Whczt is fown from the end 
of October to the middle of November : oats, peafe, and 
beans (the two laft are not much cultivated), from the be- 
ginning to the end of April : barley, potatoes, and lint- 
feed in fmall quanties, for private ufe, from the end of 
April to the 25 th of May : turnip from the middle to the 
end of June. The beginning and end of harveft varies, 
according to the feafons and fituations within the parifh. 
Oats of the early kind fown here, on the 7th of April, 
have been cut down the firft week of Auguft. But, in 
general, the harveft does not commence before the end of 
Auguft, nor is concluded before the end of October. The 
Litenefs is owing to the wetnefs and coldnefs of the foil 
in the higher fituations, and perhaps alfo to the cuftom 
of fowing later than in other parts of the country. 

The crops are cut down with the common fickle, the 
farm of Woodhoufelees excepted. Mr. Bell, the tenant, 
has for many years paft ufed the fcythe, fitted up for the 
purpofe. By which mode, he has found from experience, 
that much grain and fodder are fayed. He affirms, that 
two mowers, and three attendants for collecting and fheavT 
ing the corn thus cut, will do more work, and to better 
purpofe, than double that number in the other way. This 
gentleman polTefTes one of the principal farms, in the pa-? 
rifli ; which, by his fuperior {kill and unremitting atten- 
tion to. all the operations of farming, he has brought from, 
the worft to the higheft (late of improvement. Mr. Bell 
has the merit of having firft introduced into this parifh 
the improvement of land by turnip and clover j of both 
which he raifes the belt crops in the country. 

Of late years, the tenants who pofTefs the beft lands ? 
have been laying down their fields into grafs, upon the

monly of the Cheviot breed, about the end of September 
or beginning of Oftober, with an adequate proportion of 
tups. The ewes of this defcription are bought, upon an 
average, at 8 s. 6d. each ; and the ewe and lamb are fold 
off the pafturage here, without the fleece, which may fetch 
from is. 6d. to 2s. 6d., from il. to il. 2s. 6d.. A cer- 
tain number of black cattle are fed upon the fame paftu- 
rage, and turn to good account. 

There are three or four fmall fheep farms, upon the. 
extremity of the parifh, in the N. W. and N. E. quarters j 
but after the details from the other parifhes of the diftri£t, 
which are almoft wholly in the pafloral line, it is only ne^ 
cefTary juft to mention them. 

'Antiquities. — The inhabitants of this parifh, being more 
immediately expofed to the marauding incurfions of the 
Englifh borderers in the days of yore ; which vifits, per- 
haps, they had reafon to expect, upon the principle of re- 
taliation, had not been inattentive to the means of defence. 
Many vefliges of ftrong holds can be traced within the 
parifh ; although there is only oire, near the new bridge, 
already defcribed, that makes an appearance at this period, 
its walls being yet entire. John Armftrong, a famous 
border chieftain in the reign of James V., ftyled John 
of Gill-knocky, mofl likely had his refidence here -f.

Moat, fituated on the S. fide of Liddel where it runs into

the {mailed veftigc of mafon work, and therefore could not have been 
the fite of that chieftain's caftle, which, from the name, has heen com- 
monly fuppofed. It has, however, the appearance of having heen a 
temporary ftation, to which the inhabitants might have fled with their 
moft valuable effects, when any invafion was apprehended, which other- 
wife they were unable to repel. It is in the form of a promontory, giv- 
ing a curve to the river Efk, which wafhes its three unequal fides ; and 
being fteep and rocky, is fcarcely acceflible but on the land fide, which 
has been fenced by a deep fofle ; over which, very probably, a draw 
bridge had been thrown. It may not be inconfiftent with this part of 
our investigation, to obferve, that John Armftrong is the only character 
of note, in later or more remote periods of antiquity, connected with 
this parilh, whofe memory has been preferved. He was the terror of 
the W. marches of England ; having forced the inhabitants of Cumber- 
land, Weftmoreland, and a great part of Northumberland, to become his 
tributaries, or to pay him blackmail-, that is, a fum of money annually, 
to be exempted from his depredations. At length, his power having 
grown too great for a fubject, he became an object of jealoufy to the 
king ; who levied an army for the avowed purpofe of punifliing Gill- 
knocky and his followers, and marched at their head to the parifh of 
Ewes. There, John was fummoned to attend the king, upon the pro- 
mife of his fecurity ; and having accordingly obeyed the fummons, in 
violation of the public faith, pledged for his perfonal fafety, as obferved 
by Buchanan, he and his attendants were hanged at Carlenrick-rigg, 
two miles to the N- of Moffpaul, on the road between Hawick and 
J-angholm. \

Scottifh borders, not long before that event, was a pre^

Population. — The account tranfmitted to Dr. Webfter in 
1755, fixed the population of this parifh to the number of 
1733 fouls. At prefent, in the beginning of 1794, it 
reaches to 2725 fouls. The following table will exhibit 
trie number of males and females, from the age of 40 to

at an average about 15I. a-year. The rent of fome is fo 
low as 2 1, or lefs ; and of others as high as 80I., 120I., 
and even near to 300I.

Inhabited Hoitfes, 'Number of Acres ^ Stocky &amp;c— *There are 
about 512 houfes inhabited, containing, at an average, 
fo me what more than 5 inhabitants each. None are unin- 
habited. Within thefe 20 years, 1 80 new dwelling houfes, 
at leaft, have been reared ; 53 of which are covered with 
blue flates 5 befides office houfes, which are alfo generally 
flated. 

The parifh has been meafured, and contains 22,500 
and odd acres; of this number, perhaps 15,000 or 16,000 
acres are arable, or may be made capable of tillage ; but 
as yet not mere than 9000 or 10,600 are in the way of 
being under the operation of the plough : although it is 
to be hoped, from the progreffing ftate of improvement 
in this parifh, that the whole of the improvable ground 
will, in due time, be made to change its natural ftate. 
All the land is occupied in crop, paflure, or wood j and 
the greater! part is enclofed and fenced by hedges, or ftone 
walls, the advantages of which are fully recognifed. As 
the whole farms in the parifh have been let upon a plan 
of improvement, and therefore upon very reafonable terms; 
the prefent land rent, as eftimated by the ratio of poor's 
rates, does not much exceed 3000I. What revenue may 
arife from the coal and lime work?, or the fale of oak 
bark and wood, cannot be accurately flated. 

The number of horfes in the parifh is about 407 j of 
black cattle 1516 ; of fheep, it is fuppofed, between 2600 
and 3000 ; and of fwine 259. The writer has been in- 
formed, that, about 60 years ago, there were only 2 carts 
in the parifh : at prefent, there are 217 ; 2 waggons, and

1 four-wheeled carriage. The ploughs in ufe here are of 
the Englifh conftruaion, and in number 208. 

The vidual produced in the parifh is not, at this time, 
equal to the confumption. The beft land, as was before ob- 
ferved, is laid down in grafs ; which circumftance, as well 
as the extent of population, number of horfes and fwine 
to be fed from the lefs productive ground, will account 
for this deficiency. 

Ecclefiajlical State of the Parijh. — There are between 30 
and 40 Seceders, chiefly of the feci: of Burghers ; the reft 
adhere to the Eftablifhed Church.— The living, as fettled 
by a decreet of modification obtained laft fummer, con- 
fifts of 96 bolls of vi&amp;ual, half meal, half barley, 61 1. 2 s. 
2d. in money, a manfe and glebe of about 20 acres Eng- 
lilh. The Duke of Buccleugh is patron, as well as fole 
heritor. From a date, cut in ftone, the manfe appears to 
have been built 62 years ago, and at that period muft have 
been one of the beft finifhed, perhaps, in Scotland. It 
has fmce been frequently repaired, but is very much out 
of order at the time, and will require a thorough repair 
to make it lodgeable. The church is in no better condition ; 
the walls being in decay, the roof and windows infuffi- 
cient, and two-thirds of the feats calling loudly for reno- 
vation. It is expected that the church, manfe, and of- 
fices will be completely repaired in the courfe of the en- 
fuing fummer. 

State of the Poor. — The poor are maintained by an af- 
feffment levied from his Grace, and the tenants, who pay 
in proportion to their rents. One half of the fum judged 
neceflary is paid by the Duke, and the other half by the 
tenants. The quantum allotted to individuals, is fixed by 

the 



Of Canoby. 427 



the Tdrk-fetiion and principal tenants, who meet For that 
purpofe at the commencement of every quarter, and is 
paid in advance. The fum varies according to the circum- 
ftancesof the poor. Penfions are given from 5 s. to 2I. 
5 s. a quarter. This mode of providing for the poor was 
adopted by this, and the other parifhes of the diftricl:, in 
1773, with the laudable defign of reftraining vagrant beg- 
gars, and confining them to their own parilhes, where 
their neceffities muft be beft known. By this fcheme, it 
was prefumed, that fuch as were rendered unable, by age 
or indifpofition, to exercife their wonted induftry, would 
be taken care of, when they could no longer labour for 
"bread ; while others, who had contracted habits of idle- 
nefs, would, be prevented from living upon the public 
flock, to which, by their induftry, they were unwilling 
to contribute ; and having no refource for idlenefs, be 
conftrained to exertions of induftry. And yet it is a 
queftion, whether thofe objects have been fully attained. 
In this parifh, where none that are able and willing to 
labour, can want employment •, where the price of provi- 
fions is reafonable, and fuel to be had at fo eafy a rate, 
and where houfe rents are extremely moderate, it is An- 
gular that the number of poor fhould have increafed in 
proportion as the means of induftry have been enlarged 
and diffufed. When the poor rates were eftablifhed in 
1773, tne era °f improvements in Canoby, the annual 
amount was only 54I. 2 s. •, which left a .furplus in the 
collector's hands, after affording the neceflary fupply to 
24 individuals, the whole poor then in the parifh. At 
Martinmas 1793, tne number of poor on the roll was 68, 
and the afleflment for their maintenance a quarter 44 1., 
or 176I. a year; while, at the fame time, there are two 
friendly focieties in the parifh, who have confiderable 

3 H 2 funds 



42? Statiftical Account 

funds for the relief of their members, amounting to fe- 
veral hundred individuals. The increafing number of 
poor may be accounted for, from various caufes ; the 
want of induftry or economy, and a culpable reliance, in 
the Wight of want, upon that fund, which is appro- 
priated to the aid only of the induftrious, although un- 
fortunate, members of the community ; the circumftance 
of young perfqns entering fo early into the married ftate, 
as is the cuftom here, without any rational profped of 
fubfiftence ; and then not exerting their induftry in pro- 
portion to their increafed expenfe. Perhaps the fmall 
fcale of fo many farms may tend to increafe the number 
of the lift ; as they cannet be fuppofed to afford, bread to 
the families that neftle upon them, did the pofleffors even 
hold the land in fee Ample *,

* Prkes, Wages, Fuel— Provifions, in fonie articles, vary in price with 
the feafons. At Martinmas, beef and mutton may be purchafed at 
and the beft at 3 d. the lb. In the fpring, or beginning of fummer, good 
beef or mutton is fold at 4 d. The price of lamb is from a£d. to 6d.

6d. ; ducks, 6d. and 76.; hens, yd. and 8d.; chickens, ad. i\d. and 
3d.; butter at 6d.; and beft cheefe, of cow or ewe milk, at 3d. and

lifle bufbcl, equal to 3 Winchefler; oats, from 5 s. to os., and barley 
from 8 s. to 14s. the Carlifle bufhel, fhe meafure ufrd in this parifh. 
Oat meal, according to the ftate of crops, is fold from is. 8d. to 2S. 8d. 
the flxne. Excepting victual, which of late years has been advancing 
in price, the oiher articles have flood much at the fame rate during the 
writer's incumbency. 

Labourers in hufbandry, and other work, receive 1 s. a day ; when 
employed in mowing, 1 s. 6d. Carpenters, bricklayers, and mafons, is. 
6d.; tailors, when victuals are afforded, iod. The wages of male 
fervants are from 6 1. to 10I. ; of female fervants, from 2 1. 10 s. to 4 1. 
10 . a year. A labourer's earnings through the year may amount to 
1 61. The coalliers, it is faid, may earn from 10 s. to aos, a week. 
Their expenfes muft depend upon their mode' of ' living, and turn for 

economy.

Schools. There is a parochial or public, and five private 

fchools in the parifh. The number of fcholars at prefent 
attending the whole, amounts at leaft to 300. The parifh 
fchoolmafter has a legal falary of 200 merks, a houfe and 
garden ; which, with the emoluments of his office of fef- 
fion-clerk, may be equal to 20 1., independent of fchool 
fees. About 70 of the above number of fcholars belong 
to the public fchool, and are taught Englifh, French, La- 
tin, and Greek •, writing, arithmetick, book-keeping, and 
mathematicks. In the private fchools are taught only 
reading, writing, and arithmetick. 

Language. — A mixture of the provincial dialects of 
Cumberland, Annandale, and Efkdale, feems to form the 
language commonly ufed here, which is very incorreel: in 
point of grammatical propriety •, and with refpecSr. to ac- 
cent, harfn and unpleafant. The plainer! rules of fyntax 
are much violated : For example ; I is, thou is ; Vfe gaan, 
for, I am going j tbou'fe get, thou malt get ; ho-xvje fou, 
how art thou. / nvite is% a common expreflion, mean- 
ing, I wot it is ; in plain Englifh, it is fo. The word 
fanny is much in ufe here, as well as on the other fide 
the border, and denotes praife. A canny per/on, or thing ; 
a good fort of perfon, &amp;c. In you, the diphthong is 
founded as in trout ; and the vowel in me, as the diph- 
thong in feign. 

The 

economy. Thofe who are fober and attentive, live comfortably, and 
bring up their families in a decent manner; and fome even fave a little 
money for future emergencies. 

Nature has been extremely bountiful to Canoby in fuel. Befides the 
coal mines already mentioned, there is abundance of mofs in different, 
fixations, open to the free ufe of all the inhabitants. Coals may be 
pnrchafed upon the bank, at the rate of S d. the horfc load; four of 
which, value' is. 8 d , being ai much as any fingle horfe can draw in a

j. Perfons of Eminence, Natives of the Parfi.-The fans of 
the Reverend Mr. Petrie, who died minifter of Canoby 
are entitled to notice under this head. Four are now 
alive, who, by their talents and induftry, have all acquired 
fplendid fortunes. The eldeft, Dr. Robert Petrie, while 
he continued in practice, was an eminent phyfician in 
Lincoln, and Fellow of the Royal College of Phyficians at 
Edinburgh ; and tire youngeft, William Petrie, Efq., is, 
at tins time, fecond in Council at Madras ; who is no lefs 
diftinguifhed or his benevolence and amiable manners in 
private life, than for his fuperior abilities in the public 
itation he now fills. 

CharaBer, Sec. — Many circumftances have occurred 
v.-ithin thefe 20 or 30 years, to introduce a change in the 
difpofitions and manners of the people. It is well known, 
that wherever idlenefs prevails, vices as naturally fpring 
up in the mind, as weeds in negleded fields. Induftry was 
not formerly the charafteriftic of this part of the border. 
Gambling was a favourite psftime with many ; with fome, 
an employment. I n particular, horfe-racing and cock- 
iighting were much in vogue ; and the irregularities con- 
3  fequent 



Of Canoby, 43 1 

fequent upon fuch meetings, among the lower claffes of 
the people, brought a ftain upon the general charafter. 
The new farms that were fet off, upon the wafte lands, 
gave an eftablifhment to many families ; and in thefe, not 
only their comfort, but civil exiftence, depended upon 
their induftry. The works carried on by his Grace in the 
parifh have afforded regular employment to mafons, 
wrights, and labourers ; while the manufaftures at Car- 
lifle have given occupation to the numerous clafs of wea- 
vers : hence the fpirit of induftry was infufed in a more * 
general manner than before. As a check upon the con- 
duel: of the lower individuals, his Grace has referved the 
cot-houfes upon the farms in his own power •, fo that, ar 
every term, any offender of this defcription, againft the 
laws of good order, can be turned out of the parifh. hi 
all the new leafes, a claufe of nullity is inferted, in cafe 
of moral delinquencies therein fpecified j and tenants, even 
of a fufpicious character, are in danger of lofing their 
farms at the expiry of the leafe. His Grace having fixed 
an occafional refidence at Langholm Lodge, has an op- 
portunity of being perfonaily acquainted with the parti- 
cular circumftances of the parilh, which is honoured with, 
his prefence almoft every day, while in the country ; and 
being thus under his review, not only the character of 
the inhabitants in general, but even that of individuals, 
comes to be known : This circumftance has, no doubt, 
confiderable weight in guarding the people againft irregu~ 
lar conduct, which, they are affured, muft preclude from 
all accefs to his Grace's favour. The happy effects of 
this plan of reform are confpicuous j and fuch reform is 
of far more importance to the comfort and happinefs of 
focicty, than either triennial or annual parliaments could 
poflibly be. The tenantry, fo far as is known to the 

writer,

W, are indubious, fober, and decent, in all rcV 

f , T fame may be faid of the generality of the 
other clafs of inhabitants; although, it muft be owned, 
there are exceptions, which, it is apprehended, would 
itill be fewer, if fpirituous liquors were more rare ; and 
perhaps alfo, if parents were more attentive in teaching 
their children the flrft lefioh of obedience to themfelves" 
for by prefervirig the curb of parental authority, the young 
would be in a great meafufe prevented from contracting 
habits of diflipation in the early part of life, which after- 
ward are not eafily eradicated; 

The people are of the middle fize, with a due propor- 
tion of bodily ftrength, capable of enduring hardfhips ; 
fagacious, humane, and benevolent. Many are ferioufly 
difpofed,. and all for the moft part regular in their attend- 
ance upon die public ordinances of religion. 

Advantages and Difadvantages.-mie advantages have' 
already been ftated in the courfe of this ino^iry. The 
only obvious difadvantage is the want of manufactures ; 
which, from the increafe of population, is already felt, 
and muft be ftrl'l more fenfibly felt, if the population holds 
on in a progfeflmg ftate.' In the event of manufaftures 
being eftablifhed, the riiany fmall farms would, from that 
circumftance, aca x uire additional value ; in which both 
landlord and tenant would have a joint intefeft. And it 
is humbly prefumed, Confidering the advantages of public 
roads in all directions ; of coal, lime, free-ftone, and tim- 
ber upon the fpot ; and every rcfource that rivers and ri- 
vulets may yield, that no place can be more favourably 
fituated for many branches of manufacture, to which thofe 
articles are efTential.' </p></div>

Situation, Extent , Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c. 

THIS pariih is fituated about 12 miles S. from Edin- 
burgh. The great road leading to Cornhill and 
Kelfo, runs through it. There are about 3900 acres im 
the parifli. Above 11 00 of thefe are outfield. This part 
of the pariih is little capable of improvement. The foil 
is a thin mofs on the furface, with either a wet foft fand, 
or clay bottom. The pafture it produces is fcanty and 
bad, with little fhelter for fheep. The proprietors have 
wifely turned their attention here to planting. The planta- 
tions feem to thrive well, and will beautify and flicker 
the country. Within thefe 5 years, about 50 acres have 
been planted, in ftripes and clumps, upon the eftate of 
Crichton. 

The other part of the pariih, towards the N., is well 
adapted to tillage. A great part of it is a deep rich foil,

Minerals. — There is a lime-ftone quaiTy wrought in this 
parilh to a confiderable extent. About 4000 bolls of lime 
are fold annually from this parilh. The lime is carried, 
upwards of 30 miles S., and raifes excellent crops. Coal 

3 I 2 has 



435 St atifl'ical Account 



has been difcovered in this parilh, but there is nonVr 
wrought at prefent. The lime work is fupplied with coal 
from the pariih of Cranftoun. 

Advantages.— The vicinity of Dalkeith market, the 
neighbourhood of coal and lime, and the great road lead- 
ing to Edinburgh and to the S., are great advantages to 
the farmers. This parifh has a peculiar advantage in be- 
ing altogether freed from thirlage. For many years paft, 
there has not been a corn mill in the parim. The lime 
work employs a confiderable number of hands. About 6 
years ago, a fociety was formed in Path-head, for the fup- 
port of diftrefled labourers. The number at prefent is 
upwards of 140 : The ftock amounts to 160I. Sterling. 

Antiquities. — There are the remains of a camp or en- 
trenchment at Longfaugh, in this parifh. It ftands upon 
a rifmg ground, is of a circular form, and the entrench- 
ments may, in many parts, be eafily traced. It is pro- 
bable that fome confiderable battle had been fought in 
this parifh, from the great number of bones dug. up when 
Path-head was building. In the lower ground, feveral 
thevaux de frife have been found, which were ufed for 
wounding horfes feet. They are in the form of rings, 6 
inches in diameter, and armed all round with fliarp pikes, 
turned up in a circular manner. — The caftle of Crichton is 
a very ancient and magnificent building* " This caftle," 
fays Pennant, " was once the habitation of the Chancellor 
" Crichton, joint guardian with the Earl of Callander of 
" James II., a powerful and fpirited ftatefman in that 
" turbulent age ; and the advifer of the bold, but bloody 
" deeds againft the too potent Douglas. During the Hfe 
" ©f Crichton, it was befieged, taken, and levelled with

f groun d by William Earl of Douglas. It was afterwards 
t , e built, and part of this new work is uncommonly ete- 



gant.' 



Ecclefiaftical State.— The church was founded, 26th De- 
cember 1449, ^ Sir William Crichton, Chancellor of 
Scotland, with confent of James Crichton, Knight, his 
fon and heir, for a provoft, 9 prebendaries and 2 finging 
boys, out of the rents of Crichton and Locherwart i a 
menfal church, belonging to the archbifliop of St. An- 
drew's, referving to the bifhop the patronage of the prebends 
of Vogrie, Arniftori, Middleton, and Locherwart. It is a 
venerable building in the form of a crofs, the W. end left 
unfimimed. It is fituated at the weftern extremity of the 
parilh.— Colonel Callander of Crichton' is patron.— The 
living is 3 chalders 12 bolls of barley, 3 chalders 4 bolls 
of meal, and 45 1. Sterling in money. The glebe is be- 
tween 6 and 7 acres of good land. The manfe was built 
in' 1758, and, with a fmall repair, might be made an ex- 
cellent houfe. 

School and Poor.— The fchool has been, for fome years 
pad, removed to Path-head, the molt populous part of 
the parilh. The fchoolmafter's falary is about 100 merks : 
the fees, is. 6d. for Englifh 5 2 s. for writing; and 2 s. 
6d. for writing and arithmetick. He has between 70 and 
80 fcholars ; and his income may amount to 30 1. — The 
poor are fupported by the collections at the church door, 
the dues on marriages and funerals, and the remainder 01

<p>
Name, Situation, and Extent. 



HP HE original name of this parifh feems to hare been 
Carnngton, which is always pronounced, and very 
often fpelled Cairnto.n. Of the origin of this name, no fa- 
tisfaftory account occurs. As far back as the year 171 r, 
it feems to have received the name of Prim^ moft pro- 
bably from the family of that name having acquired a 
very large proportion of the landed property which it con- 
tains. But although, fince the period above mentioned, 
which is the earlieft at which any parifh records appear, 
it has always pafTed under the name of Primrofe in writ- 
ing, fuch is the attachment of mankind to whatever is 
ancient, that, in the oral communications of the neigh- 
bourhood, it Mill, f or the moft part retains the name of 

Cairnton. At the extreme points, its length, from E. to- 
W., is about 3 i, an d its breadth, from S. to N., 2 miles. 



Climate, 



Of Primrofe. 439 



Climate, Soil, Cultivation, and Produce.— The lulls call- 
ed the Moorfoots on the S., and the Pentlands on the N., 
by attrading the clouds in their progrefs from the W., 
render the climate of this parifti rather drier than that of. 
the country on both fides of it, in their more immediate 
neighbourhood, In the eaftern part of the parifh, the 
fituation of which is low, the air is temperate ; to the 
weftward, it becomes colder than, from the fhortnefs of the 
diftance, and the inccnfiderable elevation of the ground, 
antecedent to experience, we lliould have naturally fup- 
pofed. The longevity of feveral of the inhabitants, and 
their freedom, in general, from epidemical difeafes, feem 
to be proofs o'f its. faiubrity. About the village of Prim- 
rofe, the foil is good and dry. But towards the extremi- 
ties of the parilh, it is cold, wet, and moortfh, particu- 
larly to the N. and W. Villages feem generally to be fet 
down upon the moft eligible fpots, both as to climate 
and foil, of the feveral diflricts in which they are fi- 
tuated. Even in thofe rude ages, in which fettlements 
are formed, men have difcernment to felecl: thofe fitua- 
tions in which the air is leaft inclement, and the herb- 
age mod frefh and abundant. The cultivation and ma- 
nure of a long feries of years, which, in the infancy 
of agriculture, men always apply to the fields immediate- 
ly adjacent to the villages they inhabit, increafe the natu- 
ral fuperiority of the circumjacent lands to thofe that are 
remote. The produce of the parilh confifts of wheat, 
barley, oats, peafe, potatoes, turnips, and clover. On the 
light and dry lands, the moil approved rotation of crops 
feems to be turnips or potatoes, oats, clover, turnips, 
&amp;c. On thofe that are more inclined to wet and clay, 
wheat after fallow is more frequent. The plough, which 
is by far the molt in general ufe, is that conftruclred by 
§mall, and drawn by 2 horfes. But a fenfe of the obvi- 
ous

ous advantages to be derived from the ufe of fingle carts, 
has not been able to vanquifh the inveterate prejudice 
agamft them, and in favour of double carts. On a very 
large proportion of the parifli, very inconfiderable progrefs 
has been made in the improvements, of which it is fuf- 
ceptible. Not a fmall part of it is ftill unenclofed, and its 
general appearance is rather bleak and unfheltered. 

Number, and Employment of the Inhabitants.— -The ave-, 
rage of births recorded from 1752 to 1762, was 16,5; 
from 1762 to 1772, 12,5 ; from 1772 to 1782, 11,5 ; from 
1782 to 1792, 9,6 : From which it appears, that as there 
are no manufactories in the parifh, to encourage the influx 
of inhabitants from other quarters, the population muft be 
in a {late of gradual decreafe. Hence, the number re- 
turned to Dr. Webfter in 1755, w hich amounted to 55^, 
was, in July 1793, reduced to 329 fouls of both fexes, 
and of all ages and defcriptions. The chief caufe of this 
diminution has been the laying down to grafs a confider- 
able part of the lands, in confequence of which many 
of the farm houfes and cottages have fallen into decay. 
If it were duly confidered, that the foil derives its value en- 
tirely from the number of inhabitants, and the confequent 
demand for its produce, this mode of management would 
jprobably be adopted with more caution, even by thofe to 
whom profit is the ultimate object. The number of fa- 
milies in the parilh is 85 : of females, 171; of males, 
1585 and of children below 1 o years of age, 66. There 
are 42 Seceders in the jjarilh, including the children of 
thofe who are of that perfuafion. All the reft of the in- 
habitants attend the Eftablifhed Church. There are irt 
the parilh 9 farmers, 1 fmith, 1 wright, 2 weavers, 3 tai- 
lors, 1 flioemaker, 1 gardener, and 1 fmall innkeeper.

in the natural poffeffion of the proprietors, the real rent 
cannot be afcertained with precifiom For the fame rea- 
fon, the number of black cattle, horfes, and {heep main- 
tained in it cannot be eflimated with any degree of accu- 
racy ; becaufe they are always confiderably more numer- 
ous in fummer than in winter. The rent of the largeft 
farm is 2351., and of the fmalleft 50I. Sterling 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c— The church was 
built in 1 71 1. Its form is regular and convenient, and 
its walls well built and fubftantial. But as the roof is 
much decayed, as the windows are mattered, the walls 
rough from the hand of the mafon, the feats crazy and 
irregular, its internal appearance is the very reverfe of that 
fimple elegance which befits a place of public worihip.

of a maid fervant, from %\. io s. to 3I. ies. a year, befides victuals: of a 
labourer, from IO d. to 14 d. ; and of a woman for hoeing turnips or potatoes, 
or for hay -making, from 6d. to 7 d. a day, without victuals : of a mafon or 
wright, from 10 d. to tzi. a day. without victuals : The wages for cutting 
hay, but efpecially corn, in harveft, vary according to circumftances. For 
feme time psft, work people of all kinds have been more eafily procured than 
formerly, and their wages begin rather to fall. The price of every article is 
nearly the fame here, as in the Edinburgh market, by which it is regulated j 
with this difedvantage, however, that the inhabitants of this parifh muft pay 
the carriage of every thing they fell to Edinburgh, and of every thing they 
huy, from that city, which is at the diftaace of about 9 miles.

itfecms undeniable, that they poiTefs this advantage, that 
they proportion diftribution to opulence, and force the

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—Tht only regular fund for 
repairing the roads and bridges in the parifh, is the ftatute 
labour, which is converted at i8d. for every ploughgate, 
and which amounts to about 18I. a year. The length of 

the

the whole roads in the parilh may be about 10 miles. The 
whole of thefe roads were, till very lately, in a miferable 
ftate of difrepair, and a great part of them has never been 
yet formed. In thefe circumftances, it is not to be ex- 
pefted that the application of fo fmall a fum can be pro- 
dudive of any confider-ble improvement. Senfible, how- 
ever, of the advantages of good roads, which furnilh one 
of the moft defirable accommodations in every country, 
the farmers and inhabitants have of late years managed 
this bufinefs in a manner very creditable to themfelves, 
and beneficial to the publick. Befides making good fome 
of the roads, which were formerly impaffable, they have 
built 2 fmall bridges, and levelled 2 very heavy pulls ; and 
if the road leading from Peebles through the villages of 
Primrofe and Dalhoufie to Dalkeith, which has hitherto 
abforbed a great part of the parilh funds, and on which 
there was erected, feveral years ago, a turnpike near the 
place laft mentioned, was to be repaired from the proceeds 
of that turnpike, which thofe who ufe the road, and pay 
the toll duties, are certainly entitled to expect, there is 
reafon to believe, that the repairs of the other roads 
would advance fo rapidly, that the whole would foon be 
in good condition. 

There is only 1 threfhing machine in the parifh. It is 
of fuch a conftruction, that one fimilar to it may be 
erected for about 30 1. It is wrought by 2 horfes, and is 
equal to the work of any farm. The publick attention, 
with regard to thofe ufeful machines, feems to have been 
fixed upon a wrong point. The teft of faperior excellence 
appears to have been hitherto chiefly the production of the 
greateft quantity of work in a given time. Hence, ma, 
chines have been conftructed, which, efpecially when 
wrought by water, are fufficient to threm the produce,

not of one farm only, but of a whole parim. But cer, 
tainly it would be more ufeful to endeavour to reduce 
them to fuch fimplicity of form, and lownefs of price, as 
would bring them within the reach of thofe farmers of 
moderate capital, who compofe the great body of that 
profeffion. Hence, every model of thofe machines, which 
can be conftrufted at a fmall expenfe, merits the publick 
attention ; fo that by comparing the different forms, ex- 
perience may be able to afcertain, which is, upon the 
whole, the moft eligible. 

On the river South Efk, which bounds the parifh on 
the S. and S. E., there are fome good ftations for erect- 
ing machinery, and particularly one thought to be ex- 
tremely commodious for a paper mill. In fome future 
period of more advanced induftry, thofe ftations may 
prove the more valuable, that the whole parim is faid to 
be a field of coal of different flrata, one of which is of 
very fuperior quality, and another of the thicknefs of 1 1 
feet. It has alfo been thought by fome, that the adja- 
cent grounds exhibit {hong appearances of iron ftone. 
Upon the banks of this river alfo, which are now over- 
run and deformed with furze and broom, trees would 
flioot with luxuriance, {hade and beautify the country, 
and amply reward the planter's toil. But all thofe natu- 
ral advantages remain neglected. To whatever quarter 
of the globe we turn our thoughts, fimilar, but more 
flriking, objects of regret meet our obfervation. The 
earth, which induftry might have turned into a fruitful 
gardfen, remains, for the moft part, a wafte and barren 
vyildernefs. How numerous and extenfive are the Sa- 
vannahs, on which the ploughftiare and the fickle never

Name, Extent, Surface, and Soil. 

HH HIS parilh is faid to have obtained its name from 
^ "rcumftance of a golden crofs being prefrmed 
to the church by fome French nobleman, « Croix, d'or 
finer and hence Corflorphine. But as there is no rem- 
nant of tradition, which relates to any change of name 
having taken place, and which this vulgar opinion doth 
imply, we are rather to look for the origin of the name 
from fome of thofe local circumftances which determined 
the firft fettlers to give to places thofe appellations which 
they yet bear. According to fome fkilled in the Gaelic 
tongue, the name fignifies the milk-houfe under the hill. 
Others derive it from Coire, a large hollow, or round 
glen ; Stoir, fteps through a wet place ; and Phin, either 
from Fionn, white, or from Fein the Fingobans, i. e the 
hollow or glen with the white fteps, or the glen of the

FIngoban fteps. The termination Fin^ may have come 
from Ftonfi) wells or fountains. — Its greateft length is 4 
Englifli miles, and its greateft breadth i\ miles ; its form 
is regular. — The furface is in general level, rifmg to few 
eminences, and thefe inconfiderable ; over a great part of 
its extent, it fpreads into a fmooth plain. The grounds 
of greateft elevation, are thofe which go by the name of 
Corftorphine-hills, an appellation they hardly could have 
gained, unlefs from being in a manner infulated in the 
midft of rich vallies, where they form a diverfity highly- 
conducive to the beauty of the country : on the S. and 
W. fides, they rife from the plain by an eafy gradual af- 
fent ; on the E. fide, they are more precipitate, and run 
N. in an indented criftated form, into the boundaries of 
the parifh of Cramond. Their appearance on the S. fide 
is remarkable for its beauty. They are decorated with, 
the beautiful feats of Belmont * and Beechwood j the lat- 
ter of which is remarkable for that pleafing and elegant 
neatnefs with which it hath been embellimed by its pre- 
fent pofTefTbr. Almoft the whole of the grounds being 
arable, and of the greateft value when converted to this 
ufe, there is lefs occupied with plantations than is ne- 
ceffary for the embelliihment of the country, and even, 
perhaps, than what might actually be conducive t'o its 
interefts, from affording that fhelter which is fo friendly 
to vegetation f. Every diverfity of foil, in its feveral mo- 
difications,

difications, is to be found in this parifh. In fome places, 
there is found the rich black loam : this, diverfified with 
clay and fand, forms that which prevails moft, and produces 
very plentiful crops. In a great part of the meadow 
ground, it is mofly, or compofed of decayed vegetables. 

Metals and Minerals.— There are no metals or miner- 
als at prefent dug in this parifh, nor any account of their 
ever having been found. Search at prefent is making for 
coal in the grounds of Mr. Keith of Ravelfton, where 
there are very fine quarries of free or fand-ftone, much 
in requeft for the buildings carrying on at Edinburgh, on 
the fide of Corftorphine-hill, oppofite to Mr. Keith's quar- 
ries, which are compofed of the fand-ftone. There are 
in the lands of Clermifton inexhauftible quarries of the 
blue whin-ftone, or toad-ftone* 

Churchy Manfe, atld School.~T\\e church is an ancient 
and refpe&amp;able building: It is of Gothick archite&amp;ure, 
and built in the form of the Jerufalem crofs. The prefent 
church was founded near the parifh church of this place, 
by Sir John Forefter of Corftorphine, Lord High Cham- 
berlain of Scotland, and anceftor to the Lord Forefter, in 
the year 1429^ and dedicated to St. John the Baptift, for 
a provoft, 5 prebendaries, and 2 firiging boys* It was a 
collegiate church, to which belonged thofe of Corftor- 
phine, Dalmahoy, Hatton, Cramond, Collington, &amp;c. The 
teinds of Ratho, half of the teinds of Adderton, and of 
Upper Gogar, were appropriated among the revenues of 
this college. The firfl provoft was Nicholas Bannatyne, 

who 

lour of the leaves, is of the richcft vivid yellow hue j from whence this tree 
is eafily diftinguifhed at a diftance almoft incredible. A few flips have been 
taken from it, and which arc thriving very well in other parts of the country.

who died in 1470, and was buried m the church, where 
his epitaph m remains. The coat of arms of the family 
of Forefter is every where difperfed over tne buddmg 
Within the church in niches, are feveral monumental 
remains of this family. The figures, cut out in {tone, are 
as large as life : Amidft that decay, which they appear to 
have fuffered from time and violence, they exhibit proofs 
of having been executed with dexterity and. fkill. The 
male figures are covered with complete armour, and the 
female appear richly ornamented, according to the fafluon 
and drefs of the times. The roof is fupported by ftrong 
arches, and is formed by large ftone flags : The whole 
building feems to have fuffered little by the wafte of time. 
The infide, a few years ago, was fitted up in a modern 
and commodious manner, at a confiderable expenfe, by 
the heritors. Sir William Dick of Preftonfield, Baronet, 
is -patron. — The manfe and . offices ■ have been repaired 
by the heritors this laft year, for^ the convenience of the 
incumbent.— -The fchoolmafter hath no houfe, but is al- 
lowed a fum of money in lieu thereof. What is perhaps 
lingular, he hath a fmall piece of ground or glebe, near 
the extent of an acre, amongft the emoluments of his office,

for fupporting it was taken down. There are various con-

feems not to have been praftifed in a degree any way 
prejudicial in this parifh. The greateft part of it is di- 
vided, between 3 heritors: Befides thefe, there are about 
14 fmaller heritors and feuars. There are no manufac-

forthefaleof produce, the real rent' of the land- in this 
parifli amounts nearly to 5000 1. Sterling. The average 
rent the acre (Scots meafure) may be computed from 36 s. 
to 2I. Sterling. 

Agriculture. — Agriculture, in its different departments, 
is conduced in this parifh according to the mod improv- 
ed modes adopted in Scotland, or the bordering counties 
of England. Summer fallow, and a due proportion of 
green or meliorating crops, are obferved in the rotations. 
But the mode of conducting thefe is often varied by the 
moft judicious farmers, and which arifes from a circum- 
ftance. of local advantage, their accefs to procure dung 
from Edinburgh ; by this means, they are enabled to raife 
crops from their lands in a fucceffion, which thofe who 
have not this advantage do not venture to try. It will, 
therefore, in general, be found, that in places more re- 
mote from the capital, a greater uniformity prevails in 
their fyftems of management than is obferved here. Par- 
ticular attention is paid to raifing of potatoes, which is 
here conduced with great fuccefs, and for which Edin- 
burgh affords a ready market. They reckon their land 
after this crop to be very favourable for raifing wheat ; 
and which being a profitable crop on high rated land, is 
neceffary for defraying the expenfe laid out in preparing 
the ground for the potatoe crop. To bring an acre of a

the common one ; although it certainly may be fubfervient

fupply of any other fucculent or green forjd, the cattle 
muft either be fupported with hay and corn, at an enor-

turnip, as it Hands againft the froft, and is not apt to

relief againft this inconvenience. This feafon, it hath 
been cultivated to a confiderable extent at Gogar, and 
with great fuccefs, notwithftanding the drynefs of the fea- 
fon of planting. It will alfo ferve moft advantageoufly to

Manure.— -That alone which is here ufed, is dung ei- 
ther made upon the farm, or brought from Edinburgh. 
There can be no difpute concerning the fuperiority of this 
manure over all others •, but it hath been a matter of con- 
fiderable furprife to farmers in other counties, why lime 
is rejected as a manure in the neighbourhood of Edin- 
burgh, where, though dung may be procured, it is often 
at an exorbitant rate. It is anfwered to this, that the 
lands here, which have received dung mixed with fo much, 
afties, would be injured by liming ; the afhes having per- 
formed that which the lime is intended to produce, viz. 
to loofen the foil, and aft as a ftimulus-. Notwithftand- 
ing of this opinion, which is believed to be well founded, 
perhaps lime, in certain cafes, might be applied with ad- 
vantage ; not to ground which is impoverifhed and exhauft- 
ed of vegetable aliment, but in the rankeft foil, and where 
even the greateft quantity of dung hath been laid down : 
as it is well known, that calcareous bodies have a ftrong 
affinity to oils, the lime applied to ground abounding with 
thefe, will aflift infringing forward that procefs which 
is favourable to vegetation ; and if it abounds with the 
uncorrupted roots of weeds and noxious plants, it will 
haflen their deftru&amp;ion, and thus produce a double bene- 
fit. I may perhaps here, with propriety, remark, that I

have heard it often taken notice of, as an error in the 
farmers of this neighbourhood, that they were not fuffi- 
ciently careful to have their grounds cleaned by fummer 
fallow, before they manured them with Edinburgh dung *. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The advantages are de- 
rived almoft entirely, perhaps, from the vicinity to the 
capital, where the demand for whatever the ground can 
produce is conftant and great. The farmer feels thefe 
advantages in every branch of his tranfa&amp;ions. The ftraw 
of his corns, and even his chaff, become objects of con- 
siderable value from this circumftance. The landlord is 
fenfibly benefited, from the great increafe of rent which 
thefe circumftances produce. Another advantage this pa- 
rifli poffefles is, from being very conveniently interfered 
by the two great roads which lead to Glafgow ; by which 
means, the communication with the Edinburgh market 
for carriages is convenient and eafy. 

One of the difadvantages is, the diftance from coal, 
Corftorphine being almoft equally removed from the coal 
mines in the E. or the W. parts of the Lothians. The 
lower grounds of this parim fuffer much inconvenience 

from 

* Price cf Labour.— The wages of ploughmen, and other labourers em- 
ployed in hulbandry, and who are hired yearly, or at the end of every half 
year, are not extravagantly high in this parifti, and are lower than in many 
o'.her places of Scotlmd, particularly in the counties of Roxburgh and Ber- 
wklclhirc. Servants who are married, and have familks, b{ fides pecuniaiy 
emolument, have fuch a recompenfe, in carriage of fuel, in meal, and other 
necefiarks cf. life, as renders their fitualion comfortable. The average increafe 
of the wages of men and women fervants, within thefe loft fevcn ysars, may 
be reckoned about one-third. The wages of mafons and carpenters are in a 
higher proportion than thofe of fervants employed in hulbandry ; perhaps, this 
is owing to the vicinity to the capital, where their labour, Sot many years, has 
been fo much demanded. 9

frdm being readily flooded by water after heavy and in- 
ceflant rains. From their level fituation, the water is not 
eifily removed, the ground thereby injured, and the hopes 
of the hufbandman often fruftrated. There is a vaft track 
of meadow ground, which is fubjeded to this inconve- 
nience. If there are great falls of rain early in harveft, 
the whole crop is in danger of being loft ; which hath not 
unfrequently happened. To drain thefe grounds, and to 
fubjeft them to the culture of the plough, hath been of 
late a confiderable objeft of attention to the proprietors, 
and fums of money expended. And fo great and incon- 
venient was the accumulation of waters on thefe grounds 
in former times, that in the laft century, it was made an 
object of parliamentary attention: and, in 1661, an act 
of parliament was pafled, enjoining a drift attention to 
the clearing, every two years, what is called the great 
drain, and empowering every one interefted in it to com- 
pel the others through whofe lands it panes to do their 
part. The inconvenience, from the fuperabundance of 
ftagnated waters, hath in part been removed } for fo con- 
fiderable was it, that the Lords Forefter of Corftorphine 
were accuftomed to bring their provifions from Edinburgh, 
by water carriage, in a boat, from Coltbridge to their 
houfe at Corftorphine ; where there are the remains of a 
very confiderable moat or ditch for holding water. But 
while this evil hath been removed, the chief object, viz. 
to bring the lands into a ftate of culture, hath not been 
procured ; and, between the two, a material lofs hath been 
fuftained. Thefe grounds formerly produced very heavy 
crops of grafs and aquatic plants ; and, before the intro- 
duction of broad clover, were the chief fupply of the 
Edinburgh market, for green food for cattle ; by the par* 
tial draining they have received, they are rendered too dry

enough for the purpofe of tillage. A plan hath been pro- 
ofed, andwhxch the fixation of the ground renders per- 
tly praa 1C able, for conning canals through the 
ground, as is done i„ f evcr al places of E ,J ^ 
thereby w;th the ^ of ^ ^ ' 

fad for limited penods, the grounds under water, fo as to 
raife that abundant herbage formerly produced, and, at 
the fame time, delivering the country from the evil and the 
inconvenience of ftagnating waters—It will, perhaps, be 
thought ftrange, that I mould clafs among the difadvan- 
tagesof thisparifh, the execution of the intended canal. 
The farming intereft are of opinion, they would be ma- 
terially mjured by it. It is evident, that, as a mode of 
conveyance to them fo near Edinburgh, it is no obiea i 
but it would deprive them of the privilege they, with 
others m the vicinity, exclufively poffefs, of purchafinfc 
flie ftreet and other dung about Edinburgh : For by the 
canal, it would find its way to places even very remote 
■Several articles, too, as potatoes, &amp;c. would be reduced 
m the prices they now bear, -by being brought from lands 
much lower rented. Befides this, the number of horfes, 
employed in carrying goods from the weft couutry, would 
thereby be diminifhed ; which at prefent furnifh a lucra- 
tive market for fome of their crops; as, hay, oats, and 
efpecially peafe and beans. 

There is a great want of running water in this parifh, 
excerSt in one corner, where it is flightly vifited by the 
Water of Leith ; and in a fmall part of its weftern divi- 
fion, by the little rivulet called Gogar Burn. There is no 
appearance of any ftream to animate the fcene, or to be 
made fubfervient to the purpofes of manufactures and of 
improvements.-

Among the prefent difadvantages of this parilh, is reck- 
oned the want of manufaaures. It is evident, from its 
being not fupplied with water, fo neceiTary in the requi* 
fite machinery, that only certain fpecies of manufaaures 
are admiffible. And the extent to which thefe ought here 
to be introduced, appears to me to be a fubjea of the 
laft importance, but of nice and difficult difcuffion. I am 
not much eonyerfant in fubjeas of political economy, and 
it is with extreme diffidence I venture to advance any thing 
on this fubjea, but feeling its importance, as intimately 
conneaed with the public profperity, and beft interefts of 
the people, I fuggeft what follows : 

In this parilh, agriculture is to be confidered as the prir 
mary profeffion, and all others mould be conduaed with 
the view of promoting its fuccefs \ for it is the foundation 
which fupports manufaaures. That it hath not yet been 
carried to the utmoft point of perfeaion it will admit, is 
not only true of this neighbourhood, but of the molt cul- 
tivated diftrias in England : a ftill larger capital, a ftill 
greater number of hands may be employed. The improve- 
ments carrying on in the fields \ the change in the mode 
of hufbandry, by the introduaion of new machinery ; of 
new fpecies of grain or of feeds, and to which no limits 
can be affigned, demand the employment of a number Of 
people of every fex and age, in the fervice of the huf- 
bandmen for carrying on his plans. Formerly, hay time 
and harveft were the only feafons which called forth wo- 
men, and people of fedentary profeftions *, but now, in the 
improving fyftem, the whole fummer requires their lar 
bours. Children too, who"formerly had no mare in the 
talk, may now, at an age not very advanced, , be mader 
ufeful, and contribute affiffcauce to their parents for fup- 
porting them, without impairing their vigour, or Hinting 

3 M 2 • their

their growth. While agriculture thus offers not only a 
refource againft want, but the means of comfortable fub- 
hitence to fuch as are able and willing to work, in parifhes 
fituated hke this, in a political view, I mould confider it 
as unwife to attempt the introdudion of manufadures 
to any confiderable extent : In a moral view, I mould 
confider it with regret and with dread. On this fubjed, 
under all the exifling circumftances, the balance is not to 
be {truck between the gains on the one fide and on the 
other, that of manufactures and that of agriculture, but 
between the fum of actual enjoyment and profperity to 
be produced on each fide. I hefitate not one moment to 
decide, that it is in favour of agriculture, in a proportion al- 
moft too great for calculation. By the.purfuit of agriculture, 
is every perfon employed who is willing to work ? Doth 
induftry reap a reward, by which not only the neceffaries, 
but comforts of life are procured ? In a place fo fituated, 
what more is wanted? Are manufadures introduced, 
workmen employed there will get higher wages ; but with 
thefe too, the defire to fpend them in idle diflipation. 
Ufeful hands would be tempted to forfake the peaceful 
labours of agriculture, where a rife of wages would, by 
the farmer, be feverely felt. The employments in agri- 
culture greatly conduce, not only to promote- the health 
of the lower clafies, but to preferve their morals from that 
degradation and corruption which is lamented in manufac- 
turing towns. The grafping hand of avarice, never fatis- 
fied, exacts from children employed in manufactures, talks 
unfuited to their years ; fickly and debilitated, their grow th 
is never or feldom that of full manhood. Since the ma- 
nufacturing rage hath commenced, the wafte of the hu- 
man fpecies would not be eafy to compute. Children bear 
the confinement with impatience, unjuftly deprived of the 

hours

hours which, in the feafon of youth, mould be devoted to 
play, they often are tempted to embrace the opportunity 
of making their efcape. In the works of agriculture in 
which they are employed, they often alfo difcover that 
they are amufed. In manufaauring places, where num- 
bers are necefiarily affembled, the poifon of vice fpreads 
wide, and enters deep ; in thofe of advanced years, the 
degradation and corruption which the human mind fuffers, 
is painful to confider 5 their politics too often degenerate 
into tumult and rebellion •, their religion, if they even 
profefs any, into idle difputation, difcord, and fchifm. 
The manners of the people employed in hufbandry are 
generally marked by contentment, refpea for religion, and 
every peaceable difpofition. Their health feldom needs 
to be repaired by the aid of the phyfician and aflbcia- 
tions, for relief in diftrefs of this nature, are hardly to be 
found amongft this clafs of men, as is ftated by Mr. Ro- 
bertfon in his Agricultural Survey ; but amongft manufac- 
turers, where it is impaired by the unwholfomenefs of 
their profeflion, or the cpnfequences of debauchery *. 

Mifcellaneous 
t- 

* Thefc obfervations I have not made from theoretical principles, but from 
aSual obfervation ; which was confirmed to me by a neighbouring clergyman, 
into whofe parifh manufactures, to a confiderable extent, have been introduced. 
The perfons there employed are collected from all the manufacturing towns in 
England, Ireland, and Scotland. They are continually fluctuating ; feel no 
degree of intereft in the profperity of the place \ and act as if rteliv red from 
all the reftraints of decency and decorum. In general, they mar/ifeft a total 
difregard to character, and indulge in every vice which opportunity enables them 
to perform. 

The influence of their contagious example mud fprtad, and familiarize to 
crimes perfons who formerly confidered them with abhorrence. While I enter- 
tain no doubts refpecting thefe obfervations, on the fubject of manufactures in 
general, I am alfo of opinion, that, under a certain modification, they mav be 
introduced into a country parifli, where agriculture ought to be the principal

bitanls : rheumatifm is not more general here than in 
Edinburgh, or other places. I have never feen the inter- 
mittent fever in any form. In the village and parifli, there 
are a great many old perfons, but none at an age which 
merits particular notice. 

The people of this parifli, in refpett of their general 
character, are entitled to praife* They are induftrious in 
their occupations : and, though in the neighbourhood of 
the capital, they difcover no foolifh and vain defire to copy 
after its fafhions; neither have they adopted its vices. Their 
conduct is never marked by any indecent outrage againft 
the laws, by which fociety is maintained, and publick hap- 
pinefs promoted, or againft the rules of decency and de- 
corum. It is not intended to fay, that from vice or ble- 
mifti they are free but thefe are of that clafs which be- 
long more to the individual, than to the publick character. 
They are ftained by none which fometimes characterize 
whole claffes of people, pointing them to their neighbours 
as the objects of fcorn and of abhorrence. Their religi- 
ous fentiments are not difgraced by rancour or animofity : 
they regard the Sabbath. In their attendance on publick 
worfhip, they are regular and exemplary ; during divine 
fervice, they are attentive and devout. 

It would be improper, were I not here to take notice of 
that liberality of fentiment which DiiTenters alfo difcover 
in matters regarding religion. Difference, in religious opi- 
nion, excites no difcord or ftrife between them and their 
brethren of the Eftablifhment : They exercife acts of mu- 
tual kindnefs, and live in the bonds of charity and frater- 
nal love. They who belong to the inferior clafs in fo- 
ciety, have an appearance in their perfons, houfes, and 
families, which is both decent and refpedable, and not 
exceeded by any ©n the fame level in any part of the

country : They are perfeftly inftruaed and expert in the 
exercife of their profeffions ; and this they difcover not by 
the affixation of a knowledge that puffeth up, but by 
fomething in their manner, which the eye will underftand 
bell, which it is not eafy to exprefs : It feldom gives ok 
fence j it intimates a manly confeioufnefs of their abilities, 
and of deferving the juft reward of exercifing them. 

It was with infinite pleafure I obferved an attention paid 
to cleanlinefs, neatnefs, and propriety in their houfes, 
which, in the lower ranks in fociety, is an unequivocal 
proof of a regard to fentiment and to charaaer. They 
were generally well furnifhed, and accommodated with 
thofe conveniencies which, in former ages, would have 
been deemed luxury. An air of fatisfaaion and of con- 
tentment was in general diffufed over all \ and the heart 
of every philanthropist and good man, mull have rejoiced in 
beholding a mare of the increafing profperity and wealth 
of the country falling to the lot of a numerous and de- 
ferving clafs of men. And this refleaion inevitably ftrikes 
the mind, that no change or revolution in the fyftems of 
government, could ever render the fituation of the labour* 
ing clafs of foeiety (and which in every change muft exift) 
more comfortable or more happy. </p></div>

Situation, Extent, and Name. 

TH E parifli of Ewes is fituated in the eaftern extre- 
mity of the county of Dumfries. Its length from 
N. to S. is 8 miles ; and its medium breadth about 5^. 
The water of Ewes runs through the parifh, taking its rife 
in the height of the country, at the northern extremity, 
and lofing itfelf in the Efk at Langholm, 2 miles below its 
fouthern boundary, dividing it almoft into two equal parts. 
In the E. part of the parilh, the water of Tarras takes its 
rife, and, running nearly S. W., difcharges itfelf likewife 
into the Elk, nearly 3 miles below the town of Langholm. 
— I have no guefs of the etymology of the name of the 
parifh, unlefs it be taken from its being a paflure country, 
and fed moftly by fheep of that defcription.

are 2 other publick roads, the one leading to the E., and 
opening a communication into that divifion of the county

were made by aft of parliament, laying on fo much year-

their valued rent, and which the tenants are obliged to 
pay in hen of the ordinary ftatute-labour. The country 
is very agreeable j the hills, on both fides of the water 
being entirely green, except fome fmall fpots of heath,'

quantity of wool produced yearly is between 170 and 180 
, containing 1 2 Scotch {tone each j which fold lait 
year at the medium price of 16 s. 6d. the ftone ; but, by 
the change of markets, has this year fold at 12 s. 

Soily Agriculture, &amp;c. — In the lower parts of the parifli, 
the land upon the banks of the water is generally dry, 
and inclined to gravel ; but towards the head, to a firong 
deep clay. Very little corn is fown ; not more than 80 
bolls, Roxburgh meafure, one year with another : The 
produce, from the dampnefs of the climate, in moft years, 
is fmall, and in none, fcarcely equal to the expenfe incur- 
red by the purchafe of the feed, and of the fervants and 
horfes neceffary for carrying on the labour. Potatoes are 
alfo cultivated with fuccefs. Within thefe few years, the 
tenants have fown turnips, which are generally good, and 
moflly given to the cows and young cattle. — The rents of 
the farms rife in progreflion, from 30 to 200 guineas, but 
are moflly above 100 guineas. — The improvements in 
building have, for fome time paft, been confiderable ; fe-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1017196">WIGTON</name>. 

(County and Presbytery of Wigton, Synod o £ 

Galloway.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Andrew Duncan.</head> 

<p>

Name. 



HP HE panfh of Wigton, by a natural and obvious idea, 
is denominated from the town, the place where the 
church was originally ereded, and which contains the moft 
of the parifhioners. The name of the town itfelf is ap- 
parently Saxon, and feems to have arifen among that peo- 
ple, by whom Wigton was probably founded, in the 7 th 
or 8th century, when they were mafters of this part of 
the country. The name feems to have been taken from 
the local fituation ; though the precife fignification and 
etymology of the word is rather uncertain. It is probably 
compounded of the two Saxon words, mic % a village, and 
tun, a hill ; thus fignifying, a town feated on an eminence, 
as Wigton ftrikingly is. Or, perhaps, it may be derived 
from vik, a corner, and ton, a hill, in the fame language ; 

alluding 



Of Wigton, 



alluding to the particular fituation of the hill of Wigton, 
which lies in a corner between the river of Bladenoch and 
frith of Cree 

Situation, and Extent. — This parifh is bounded by the 
river Bladenoch, which feparates it from the parifli of 
Kirkinner, on the S. ; by a fmall rivulet and a morafs, 
dividing it from the parifli of Penningham, on the W. ; 
by the burn of the Caufeway-end, otherwife called the 
Bimop-burn, which runs between it and the laft men- 
tioned parifh, on the N. ; and by the bay of Wigton and 
frith of Cree, on the E. The figure is rather irregular, 
as in fome places it indents, and in other places is indent- 
ed by the furrounding parifhes ; but, upon the whole, ap- 
proaches mod nearly to that of a long fquare. The great- 
eft length, from E. to W., is between 5 and 6 Englifli 
miles *, and the greateft breadth, from S. to N., almoft 4 
miles. The contents, according to the molt accurate con- 
jecture, may amount to about 5500 acres *.

* Climate and Seafotts.—The climate of this place, which is fituated be- 
tween the 34th and 55th degree of N. latitude, though certainly rather 
cold, is not intemperate. The gentle breezes which arife from the fea, 
help to preferve the temperature of the air, and render the weather more 
moderate than could otherwife be expected in fo northern a fituation, 
Perhaps, the greateft defect of this climate, arifing, no doubt, from the 
proximity of the fta, is an inconftancy of weather, to which this place 
is remarkably fubjeft. The purity of the air, as well as the ftate of the 
weather, is affected by our infular fitualion. B.ing frequently loaded 
with vapours from the fea, it is at times damp and unwholefome ; but as 
it is often ventilated, and kept in motion by the wind, it is in general 
pretty pure and healthful. Befides thefe more general caufes, there are 
two or three local circumftances, by which the climate is here more par- 
ticularly affeited. The ftewartry hill?, from their fuperior height, help 
to cover this place from the N. and E. wind ; the lefkr hills, with which 
the parifh itfclf abounds, afford a fkeltcr to the plains below them ;

Soil and Surface.-r-ln the parifli of Wigton, though of 
fo fmall extent, there is a confiderable diverfity of foil and 
furface. The fouthern fide, which runs along the river 
Bladenoch, is interfperfed with hills ; which, though more 
inconvenient for agriculture, are all of them arable, and 
bear the fame kinds of crop as the plains below them. 
The land on the tops, as well as that around the bottoms, 
is equal in fertility to the plains ; but the fides, from which 
the earth is warned down by the rains, are lefs fertile ; and 
the northern fides, from being more expofed to the cold, 
are found to be worfe than the fouthern. The foil is here, 
both on the hills and plains, a dry, light, hazle mould, ly- 
ing in fome places on a bed of till, and in other places on 
a bed of gravel. As it is in general thin, it is foon affect- 
ed by drought, and agrees beft with a ihowery feafon, e- 
fpecially till about mid-fummer ; after which time, the 

ground 



■while the running ftreams, which almoft furrdund it, carry off the fu- 
perfiuous water from the land, and the moifture from the air. 

We have here all the four feafons in viciflitudc, though they are ra- 
ther irregular in their courfe. The fpring feafon almoft never begins till 
after the vernal equinox, fometimes not till towards the middle of April ; 
and foon after it is fet in, it is almoft always checked by an eafterly wind, 
which rifes about the end of April, and, continuing for 10 or 12 days, 
fcorehes the fields. Not only during the time of this wind, but after- 
wards in the month of May, and even in the beginning of June, there 
are frequently frofts by night, which check vegetation. The fummer 
feafon generally commences about the time of the folftice, and our warm- 
eft weather is in the months oi July and Auguft. The heat afterwards 
fubfidyjg, during the whole of September, and the firft half of O&amp;ober, 
■Which loims the time of harveft here, we have the moft agreeable wea- 
ther in the courfe of the year. Froft and fnow almoft never fet in till 
towards Chi iflmas, or even new-year's day. The fnow, except when it 
hnppens to be frozen, never lies Jong, fddom above two or three days, 
frequently not longer than as many hours. Neither does froft generally 
continue long ; though, in fome years,- for a confiderable time, even for 
the 1'pace of fome weeks.

ground being completely covered with the crop, it is riot fo 
foon affected; 

In the N. W. end of the parifh, the face of the ground 
is ftill more diverfified. A confiderable part of this tract, 
upwards of iooo acres, confiding of moor and mofs, is 
incapable of tillage^ In the arable ground, which confifts 
chiefly of hills fcattered amidft the moor and mofs, the 
foil is coarfer, and lefs productive. But this arifes, not 
fo much from an original difference in the nature of the 
land, as from the want of improvement. For the foil is 
here much of the fame quality, agrees with the fame kind 
of feafon, and when well improved, produces the fame 
kinds of grain, as that formerly defcribed. 

The N. E. part of the. parifh, lying along the Bifhop- 
burnj is of a foil and furface different from both the form- 
er. This tract, of about 2 miles in length, and if in 
breadth, bears all the marks of having been once covered 
by the fea. It is almoft one continued level, and lies far 
lower than the reft of the parifh, perhaps 200 feet below 
the tops of the adjacent hills. The foil, as well as the 
bed on which it refts, confifts of a kind of fea fleech, con- 
denfed into a hard fubftance, intermixed with fhells, form- 
ed in ftrata, and of great depth. In a fubfequent period, 
and long after the fea had receded, this tract muft have 
been covered with trees 3 the trunks df which are ftill 
found, in great numbers, interfperfed over the whole of 
it. They confift of various kinds, but fnoftly of oak, many 
of them between 30 and 40 feet long, and lying generally in 
the fame direction, as having been felled by the weft wind, 
which is the moll violent in this place. A great part of 
this tract, perhaps the half of it, is ftill covered with mofs ; 
which feems to have been formerly much more extenfive] 
a confiderable deal of it having been cleared away within

the memory of man. The mofs, from which the town 
and neighbourhood of Wigton have been long fupplied 
with fuel, is from 5 to 10 feet deep; under which, and 
lying on the clay furface, the trees are moftly now found. 
The parts which are not covered with mofs, are all of 
them arable, and laboured as well as- the reft of the pa- 
*ifh. The crops, however, are not equal to thofe on the 
high land;, and either in a very wet, or in a very dry fea- 
fon, they are exceedingly bad. 

Property.-— Property is better divided in this parifh than 
In moll others around. The town of Wigton, which once 
held extenfive pofTeffions y has ftill the property of a little 
land, and the fuperiority of feveral farms. Exclufive of 
the town, there are 6 principal heritors, none of whom 
refide within the parilh. Befides thefe, there are about 
a©* fmall proprietors, who poflefs pieces of land on the 
hill of Wigton, called Borough-acres, in different propor- 
tions, from 20 down- to 2 or 3 acres ; moft of whom re- 
fide within the town. 

Extent of Farms. — All the land in the parifh, except 
the generality of the borough-acres, is let to tenants, who 
are a fubftantial fet of men. An increafe of farms natu- 
rally arofe with the fpirit of improvement, and they are 
now become much larger, than when the tenants were in 
a condition of abjecl: poverty, and the lands in an uncul- 
tivated ftate. The fame extent which was farmed by 2, 
or even by 4 tenantsyais now generally held by 1. And 
there is a particular farm in the parifh, now occupied by 
2 men, which formerly contained 12 tenants. There are 
2 men here, who pay upwards of 200 1. Sterling of yearly 
rent;. 1 who pays about 150I. ; 3 who pay more than 

100I;.

nants, who fubfift not entirely by farming. 

Enclofing.—T\\\ of late, this parifli, as indeed all the reft- 
of the country, formed one continued open. A few farms, 
which were then in the hands of the proprietors, were 
enclofed about 50 years ago, But it is not much above 
20 years fmce enclofing became general, during which 
time it has been carried on with fpirit. Every farm in 
the parifh is now enclofedj and moft of them divided; 
thofe on dry land with flone walls, and tfiofe on the wet 
land with ditches. Even the borough-acres, which, till 
of late, were all of them open, and during the winter half 
of the year formed an abfolute common, are now almoft 
wholly enclofed ; and the hill of Wigton, which contains 
about 200 Scotch acres, exhibits between 60 and 7©_ en- 
closures. 

Manure.--\t is but between 20 and 30 years ago, tlrat 
the fpirit of agriculture arofe in this parifh. The improve- 
ment of land began in the eaftern end, which lies nearer! 
to the fhore ; and being carried gradually forward, has 
now reached the moft weftern extremity. A few farms, 
however, in the weftern end, are ftill partly in their natu- 
ral ftate j but as the tenants are now employed in improv- 
ing them, they will foon be in the fame condition with the 
reft, and all the arable land in the parifli in a ftate of 
improvement. In the eaftern end, where the carriage 
.would admit of it, the manure chiefly ufed was that of 
{hells, the effects of which are found to be the moft la fl- 
ing ; but in the weftern end, on account of the diftance 
from the fliore, lime has been moftly ufed. The {hells 
are brought from the neighbourhood of Creclon, on the

oppofite fide of this bay. At the port of Wigton, they 
cod, according to their different qualities, from i s. 41. 
to is. 6di the ton, which confifts of 21 bufhels ; and 
from 20 to 25 tons are laid on an acre. The lime comes 
from England: the Carlifle bufhel, which is equal to 3 
Y^incnefters, cofts is. 2d. at the port; and from 40 to 50 
of thefe are allowed to an acre. 

Utenfds. — Thirty-four ploughs, 60 pair of harrows, and 
66 carts, are at prefent employed within this parifh, for 
the purpofes of agriculture. Several improvements have 
been introduced into the ufe of thefe inftruments. The 
plough, which formerly employed 2 men and 4 horfes, 
is now managed by 1 man, and drawn by 2 horfes ; 
though, in breaking up {tiff ground, 3 horfes, and even 
fometimes 4, together with a driver, are ftill employed, 
Over all the hard land in the parifh, the common Scotch 
plough is ufed, which agrees beft with the nature of the 
foil, it being in general very {tony ; but the Englifh plough 
is ufed in the foft land. A pair of harrows are drawn by 
1 horfes, or, when made lighter on purpofe, fometimes 
by 1 ; the old timber tines, by which the ground was 
exceedingly ill harrowed, are exchanged for thofe of iron ; 
and the harrows themfelves, which were formerly loofe, 
and conftantly interfering, are now coupled together. It 
is not above 40 years fmce carts were introduced into this 
parifh. The double horfe carts, wluch prevailed for fome 
time, are now generally laid afide ; and fingle horfe carts, 
the preference of which is univerfally feen, are fubftituteU 
in their place. 

Crops. — While the land was in its natural ffate, oats 
were almoft the only, as they ftill are the principal crop., 



Of Wigton. 



All 



in the parifh of Wigton. The grain produced then, was 
pf an inferior kind, called grey oats ; the ordinary produce 
was from 2* to 3 feeds j and the boll (which confifts of 
12 bufhels) produced generally no more than 8 {tone of 
meal. Since the application of manure, the oats have 
been improved into the belt kind $ the produce is from 
4^ to 5 feeds, fometimes to 6 •, and the boll, when made 
into meal, rifes generally to 12, fometimes to 13, or even 
14 (tone. Oats are fown from the 10th of March. to the 
middle of April, and reaped from the ift of September 
to the middle of O&amp;ober. No bear was formerly raifed 
in this parifh, except in the borough-acres. A confider* 
able quantity is now fown, efpecially in the eaftern end, 
an$l the produce is from 8 to 10 feeds. It is fown to- 
wards the end of April, and reaped towards the end of 
Auguft. Within thefe few years, a little wheat has been 
raifed in the neighbourhood of the town of Wigton. It 
is fown after a green crop, and has been found to anfwer 
well. The average fowing of the parifh, as nearly as can 
be afcertained, is that of 500 bolls of oats, and 50 bolls 
of bear ; and allowing almoft the half of the produce of 
oats, and about an eighth of the produce of bear, for 
feed, and confumption in the farmers families, the reft of 
the crop remains to be fold. A part of that for fale, 
efpecially of the oats, is made into meal, and fold in the 
market of Wigton; but the bulk of it is exported to 
Wbitehaven or Liverpool, to Ayr, Irvine, or Greenock. 

Green Crops. — The method of improvement by green 
crops, has as yet made little progrefs here. In a few 
farms around the town of Wigton, crops of potatoes have, 
for fome time paft, been raifed ; but the farmers over the 
left of the parifh, ra-ife. no more than are fuflicient for the 

confumption 



47» 



Statiflical Account 



Confumption of their own families. The produce of ptao- 
toes is various, according to the difference of foil and fcafon, 
from 12 to 20 feeds j and a crop of them, when they turn 
out well, far exceeds in value Q ne of oats. They are plant- 
ed m drills, laid down in the end of April or beginning 
of May, and taken up in the end of O&amp;ober. Turnips 
are cultivated only by one farmer in the parifh ; who intro- 
duced them a few years ago. They are fown in drills with 
•i drill farrow, in the end of June and beginning of July ; 
and the light dry foil being well adapted for turnips, the 
crops have proved remarkably good. Milch-cows are part- 
ly, but young cattle ?re chiefly, fed with them in winter. 

Grafs Safcfr.— With refpe£t to the quantity of tillage, 
the tenants are univerfally reftritted to the third of the ara- 
ble land ; and the ordinary courfe is that of 3 years in crop, 
and 6 in grafs ; or when a green crop intervenes, 2 crops 
of oats before it, 1 of barley after it, and 6 years in grafs. 
Over all the improved land in the parifh, the fields are fown 
out with clover and rye grafs ; though in the low foft 
ground, where natural clover grows in profufion, rye grafs 
only is generally fown. The quantity allowed by the befk 
farmers to the acre, is about a bufhel of Englifh rye grafs, 
or a bufhel and a half of Scotch, and 12 pound of clover, 
generally two-thirds of it red, and one-third of it white ; 
lefs of the white being fown, becaufe the ground of itfelf 
foon produces a good deal of it. But the generality of 
the tenants, from a fooHfh economy, give much lefs to the 
acre, efpecially of the clover. 

Stock. — In this parifh, as over all the reft of the coun- 
try, the breed of horfes has been greatly improved. The 
little galloways, the native produce of this place, are to- 
tally 



Of Wtgton. 



479 



tally worn out ; and a breed much larger, and abler for 
the purpofes of agriculture, brought originally from the. 
W. of Scotland, has been introduced. A few young 
horfes are annually reared in this parifh, partly for fale, 
and partly for private ufe. The breed pf black cattle lias 
alfo been much enlarged, the fize having been improved 
by the keeping. Confiderably more are at prefent reared, 
than fed within this parifh, efpecially as 2 or 3 farms in 
it have been of late thrown almoft wholly into grafs. 
Both they which are bred, and they which are bought in, 
are kept till they are 2 years old, and, in a few farms, till 
they be 3 ; when they are fold out into grazing parks, to 
be fattened for llaughter. The produce of a milch cow, 
in the neighbourhood of the town of Wigton, is worth 
4I. a year -, but over the reft of the parifh, fcarcely worth 
more than 3I., allowing 40 s. for the calf, and 20 s. for 
the milk. Almoft no fheep are kept in the parifh, except 
in a few moory farms in the N. W. end of it. Thefe 
are the common Scotch fheep, white on the body, and ge- 
nerally black on the face and legs. The very few in the 
reft of the pariih, arc either of the mug kind, or of a crofs 
breed between the mug and the common kind, which an- 
fwers exceedingly well. Almoft every farmer in the pa- 
rifh keeps a fwine or two for the ufe of his own family. 

Rent, — Arable land is let at various rat.es according to 
its quality and ftate of improvement, from 10 s. to 20 s., 
the acre fome of it, in the neighbourhood of the town, 
at almoft 30s. ; and fuch of the borough-acres as are let, 
from 50s. even to 3J. tht acre. Upon the whole, from 
the fucceflive rife of markets/and trie improvement of land, 
the rent of this parifh, within thefe laft 60 years, has 
prodigiouily increased. In the year 1733, appears from 

authentic^ 



4So Statiftical Account 

authentick documents, it was not much above 400I. Stea- 
ling ; whereas, in the year 1793, from an account pretty 
accurately taken, it is found to be almoft as much above 
2000I. The valuation of the parifh is no more than 
1602I. 14s. Scots. The valued bears the lefs proportion 
to the real rent, as 4 or 5 of the beft farms, which hold 
burgage of the town of Wigton, are not included in the 
valuation. 



Population — The population of this panfh, within thefe 
laft 40 years, has greatly increafed. In the year 1755, 
the number of inhabitants, according to Dr. Webfter's 
account, was no more than 1032. In 1793, f rom an e- 
humeration taken by the prefent incumbent, they were 
found to amount to 1350. None of this increafe belongs 
to the country part of the parifh, the population of which, 
far from being increafed, is diminifhed. It belongs wholly 
to the town ; and though, perhaps, owing partly to the 
growth of opulence, has arifen chiefly from two other 
caufes ; from the enlargement of farms, which has led many 
families which refided in the country, to fettle in the town; 
and from the influx of people from Ireland, who are fcat- 
tered over the whole of this county, and of whom above 
100 at prefent reftde within the town of Wigton. As a 
regifter of marriages, of births, and burials, has not been 
kept, for, a confiderable time paft, the annual number of 
thefe cannot be precifely afcertained. The marriages, how- 
ever, are generally prolific, and the number of births to 
each of them, may, on an average, be rated at 6. 

Health. — The falubrity of this place appears from the 
health of its inhabitants. The town ]of Wigton, from its 
jiigh, open, and marine fituation, is naturally healthful ;

^ is the complaint moft incident to this place, especially

epidemical dillempers are experienced here , and .has been 
remarked, that fevers are much lefs frequent m this, than 
in fome of the neighbouring parifhes. They who efcape 
the dangers of infancy and childhood, except fuch as are 
afterwards carried off by accidents, generally live to the or- 
dinary period of human life. Nor are inftances of longe- 
vity unfrequent. Three perfons died here lately, 2 of

Condition.— The condition of the people, especially fince 
ahout the middle of this century, has been greatly improv- 
ed. In point of lodging, of drefs, and diet, a material al- 
teration has taken place # .

* The miferable huts, in which the common people were formerly 
lodged, have now generally difappeared 5 and in their place more com- 
fortable houfes, and much better furniture, are now to be feen. The 
aid drefs of the country men, even of the moft refpe&amp;able farmers, a 
kik coat, a blue bonnet, and plaiding hofe, have been totally laid afide ; 
and the 1 nveft of the people, even the men fervants themfelves, on pub- 
lick occafions, appear now in hats, in coats of broad cloth s in cotton 
vifts and breeches, and generally with watches in their pockets. The 
old dr fs, too, of the country women, even of the farmers wives and 
daughters, the b'ue cloth cloaks and hoods, the tartan or red plaids, and 
the worfted gowns and aprons of their own Ipinning, are alfo gone al-

Charaaer.—ln the charafter, as well as the condition of 
the people, the progrefs of fociety is very obfervable. By 
a much better education, and a more enlarged intercourfe, 
than our anceftors enjoyed, the human mind has been con- 
fiderably opened } and they of this generation, in a variety 
of refpeds, excel thofe of the kft. The fpirit of creduli- 
ty, which arifes out of ignorance, and which over-ran, the 
country, is now greatly worn away; and the belief in 
witches,- in fairies, and other ideal beings, though not en- 
tirely difcarded, is gradually dying out. Much of the old 
rufticity has been rubbed off ; more tafte, and abetter' 
manner and addrefs prevail, except perhaps»among the very 

meaneft 

moft wholly into difufe ; and the very fervent maids, when they appear 
abroad, are dreffed now in filk cloaks and bonnets, in dreffed caps, in 
printed cotton gowns, muflin aprons, thread (lockings, and cloth fhoes. 
Almoft no beef, and very little mutton, was formerly ufed by the com- 
mon people ; generally no more than a fheep or two, which was kill- 
ed about Martinmas, and falted up for the provifion of the family 
during the year. Though the practice of fairing up meat is ftill con, 
tinned, both in the town and country, yet beef and mutton are now 
almoft conft3ntly fold in the market, and all who can afford it, eat frefli 
meat through the whole courfe of the year. So litle wheat bread was 
ufed in the town of Wigton, about 40 years ago, that one baker could 
not find fufneient employment ; whereas the ufe of it is now become fo 
general, that there are four or five bakers in town, by each of whom a 
confiderable quantity is fold. Neither tea nor fugar were ufed in this 
place, except in a very few families in town, and very little of them, 
even there : thefe articles are now conftantly ufed by all who can afford 
them, both in town and country, and occafionally by the meaneft of the 
people. Upon the whole, the better fort of the inhabitants in the town, 
now generally occupy pretty good houfes, and live rather in a genteel 
ftyle ; the tenants, in the country part of the parilh, though few of them 
rich, arc generally fubftantial, and in eafy cirenmftances ; and among 
the tradefmen and day-labourers, they who are induftrioui, earn the 
neceffaries of life. It muft, however, be confeffed, that many of them 
are ftill in an indigent ftate ; as almoft all the Irifh families which hava 
fettled here, arc in a condition of abject poverty.

-ncaneft of the people. The ancient fpirit of mirth, which 
arofe out of the idle ftate of fociety, is almoft entirely 
cxtinguiftied •, and in the aftive purfuits of life, men have 
acquired more gravity of mind, and more folidity of con- 
dud. Servility of mind, the natural confequence of po- 
verty and oppreflion, has loft much of its hold here •, and 
a fpirit of independence, in the progrefs of opulence, has 
arifen, efpecially among the more fubftantial part of the 
people. An attention to publick affairs, a thing formerly 
unknown among the lower ranks, pretty generally prevails 
now. Not only the farmer?, but many of the tradefmen, 
read the newfpapers, arid take an intereft in the meafures 
of government. 

Morals. — However fome may declaim againft the vices 
of the age, it is pretty certain, that good morals have, in 
feveral refpetls, rather gained than loft ground here. The 
violence of our anceftors, which frequently broke out into 
acts of outrage, has exceedingly fubfided ; and, under the 
influence of a regular government, gentler pa (lions, and 
more peaceable manners, have been gradually infufed into 
the people. The inhabitants of this parifh, with the ex- 
ception of a very few individuals, are diftinguiihed for 
temperance j and it is a well known fa£t, that there is 
much lefs drunkennefs and diflipation in the town of Wig- 
ton, than there was 40 or 50 years ago. An attendance 
on the public inftitutions of religion, though it cannot be 
called exemplary, is however pretty decent, efpecially a* 
mong the better fort of the people ; the old foolifh tafte 
for long fervices, is almoft quite worn away ; and the vile 
fpirit of acrimony, arifing from difference in religious opi- 
nions, feems to be totally gone. The people in general, 
when called to exercife it, difcover a due fenfe of bene-

Volence ; and the liberality of individuals, on variotfc' Q'cv 
cafions, is a fact which confifts with the knowledge of the 
writer of this account. 

Church. — The parifh church, which (lands at the N. E. 
end of the town, was moftly rebuilt in 1730 ; and, about 
24 years ago, was completely repaired within. The pa- 
tronage and teinds, fome time after the Reformation, were 
given away by the Crown to the family of Vans of Barn- 
barroch ; and transferred by them, towards the middle o€ 
the lafl century, into the family of the Earl of Galloway, 
who is {till both patron and titular. The ftipend confifts 
of 72I. in money, and 4 chalders of victual, 2 of them in* 
barley, and 2 in meal. The glebe confifts of about 7 
acres, and, from its vicinity to the town, is worth 14I. 
yearly. There is neither a manfe nor office-houfes here,- 
but an allowance of 12I. a year for manfe rent. The* 
total amount of the living, made up of thefe feveral par=« 
t-iculars, is about 1401. Sterling, 

Poor. — The number of poor on the parifh roll, is al- 
ways upwards of 40. The funds for their maintenance 
arife partly from the intereft of money appropriated to that 
purpofe, and partly from the weekly collections at the 
door of the church. The total amount, of about 40 1. a 
year, is divided quarterly by the kirk-feffion, among the 
poor, according to their feveral' neceffities. They all re- 
fide within their own houfes, and earn a part of their own 
fubfiftence. But the maintenance of their own poor, is 
not the only burden of this kind on the parifh. The place 
is infefted by fwarms of {trolling beggars ; the law for re- 
ftraining them never being put in execution either in tne 
town or country.

jFW—Thc principal difadvantage under which this part 
of the country labours, and the great bar to the introduce 
tion of manufaaures, is the want of coal. The common 
people, both in the town and country, burn peat, of which 
indeed there is abundance within this parifli. The better 
fort of inhabitants in the town, though they alfo ufe peat 
in their kitchens, burn coal in their rooms. It is brought 
from the oppofite coaft of England, efpecially from White- 
haven and Liverpool-, the ton, which contains 32 Win- 
chefter bumels, coft lately a guinea at the port of Wig. 
ton •, but, by the late aft of parliament, which took off 
the duty, the price of the ton has been reduced to 15 s. 
or 1 6s. 

Manufaaures.— In the town of Wigton, as in almoft all 
the other towns of Galloway, there has long been a want 
of induftry. Something of a manufafturing fpirit, how- 
ever, having lately arifen in this part of the country, two 
fmall manufaaures, the one of wool and the other of cot- 
ton, were introduced into this town, about a year and a 
half ago. In the former of thefe, which employs between 
30 and 40 perfons, the wool is manufactured into plaid mg

^V^There is a fmall f a l mon fifhing in the river of 
Bladenoch, the rent of which has fucceffively rifen from 
pi. to 16L, from 16I to 24I., and from 24I. to 33I. Ster- 
ling. The falmon are not large ; they are taken from the 
beginning of March to that of October, and are in greateft 
perfedion in June and July. They are generally fold, 
when they begin to be taken, at 4 d., and afterwards at 
3d. the lb. The inhabitants of Wigton have the privi- 
lege of nfliing falmon in a particular part of the water of 
Cree, oppofite to the town itfelf ; and the fifh taken there, 
which are not very many, are much of the fame fize, 
caught at the fame time, and fold at the fame price, as 
thofe already mentioned. Various kinds of white fifh, 
efpecially flounders, are taken in the bay of Wigton. The 
fifliing, it is thought, might be turned to confiderable ac- 
count, but is very little attended to. 

Reads and Bridges. — The ftatute-labour, by which the 
roads were formerly made, was lately, by aa of parlia- 
ment, converted into money. The maximum, which has 
hitherto been colleaed, is that of 15 s. for each iooh 
Scotch of valuation, and half a crown for each labourer 
and tradefman in the year. With this fund, the roads are 
getting faft into a ftate of repair, and are let to be kept 
fo for 10 years. The bridges in the parifh are upheld 
from the county funds, and are in excellent order. 

Antiquities; 



OfWigton. 487 

Antiquities.—^ moft remarkable monument of anti- 
quity in the parifh, is that in the weftern end oT it, called 
the Standing Stones of Torhoufe. It is one of thofe circles 
pf large ftones, by fome thought Druidic temples, by 
others°reckoned courts of juftice. The ftones which form 
the circle, are 19 in number, all of unpolifhed granite ; 
and all of them {till ftanding ereft, as they have been 
originally placed, except one, which is fallen down. They 
are of various fizes, as they have been formed by the 
hand of Nature ; from 2 to 5 feet in length, and from 4 
to 9 feet in girth. The diftances of the ftones are alfo 
very different, from 5 to almoft 12 feet ; and the circum- 
ference of the circle, on the outward fide of the ftones, 
is 218 feet. Within the circle, though not quite in the 
centre, but toward the S. fide, ftand 3 large ftones, erect- 
ed in a ftraight line from E. to W., of which the 2 out- 
ward are about 5, and the middle one about 3 feet high ; 
the altar, in all probability, on which facrifice was offered, 
before the difpenfation of juftice, as in Pagan times the 
judge was always a prieft. Southward from the circle, 
at the diftance of 43 yards, ftands a large fingle ftone ; 
and eaftward from the circle, at the diftance of about 1 60 
yards, ftand 3 ftones, erected in a line from E. to W. ; 
both of which probably bore fome relation to the temple 
or court of juftice. Directly to the N., are 2 cairns or 
barrows of ftones, the neareft at the diftance of about 140 
yards, the fartheft at about 166. The circumference of 
the former is about 240 feet •, but the moft part of it has 
' been carried away to build the fences of the adjacent 
grounds. The latter is entire, the figure quite conic ; 
the circumference at the bafe about 256 feet, and the 
height about 1 2 feet.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7084395">OLD LUCE</name>. 

(County of Wigton, Synod of Galloway, Presby- 
tery of Stranraer.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Learmont</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent^ &amp;c. 

T E O P L E, who underfland the Gaelic language, fay, 
that the name Glenluce is Erfe, and fignifies Valley 
of Herbs ; and that almoft all the names of the farms are 
likewife Erfe, as Auchenmalg Craignargit, jBa/kail, Dun- 
ragget, &amp;c. ; which is a proof, that the Gaelic has form- 
erly been the language of the country, though not a word 
of it is now underftood by the inhabitants. Glenluce was 
divided into Old and New Luce in 1646. — Old Luce 19 
fituated in the centre of the county ; the promontories of 
the Mull of Galloway and Burrow-head of Whithorn, 
within which the bay of Luce lies, being nearly equi- 
diftant from it. It is 10 miles long, and varies in breadth, 
from 2 to .7, being deeply interfered by the bay of Luce on 
the one fide, and the parifti of New Luce upon the other. 
It is bounded by the fea upon the S. The bay of Auch- 

enmalg, 



Of Old Luce. 



49 1 



enmalg, the bay of Kirk-Chrift, and the fmall river of 
Pooltanton, which unites with the river of Luce within 
high-water mark, are the landing ports. The bay of 
Auchenmalg might, at no great expenfe, be made a very 
fafe harbour for veffels of confiderable burden ; but there 
is not fufficient depth of water in Pooltanton for veffels 
above 60 or 70 tons to get into a place of fafety, even at 
the higheft fpring tides, and perhaps it would not be prac- 
ticable to make it better ; but it is the beft of the three 
at prefent, for the other two afford no protection in a 
ftrong gale of wind from the S. 

Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c— About one half of the parifli 
is not arable, but it produces pafture for fheep and cattle. 
The arable part of the foil is dry, light, and grateful, 
when properly managed ; but the fpirit of improvement 
was very late in making its appearance in this parifli ; for 
within thefe 20 years, only 1 farmer or 2 had a cart : at 
prefent, every man has a cart or carts, in proportion to 
the extent of his farm. — A common round of labour 
which had taken place, was till lately invariably purfued, 
viz. there was a bear fey, or piece of fand allotted for 
bear, upon which the dung collected in the farm was an- 
nually laid, and laboured from time immemorial. The 
crop was a mixture of weak bear and gray oats. The oat- 
lands received no manure (the partial fpots excepted, on 
which the cattle and fheep were folded through the night 
in fummer), were laboured 3 years, and refted 6 : the pro- 
duce was grey oats, of which a Winchefter bufhel would 
only have yielded 6 lb. of meal ; or if it gave a pound or 
two more, it was thought remarkably good grain *. A

different method of management is beginning to give a 
very different appearance to the arable part of the parifli. 
Poor pafture is annually giving place to fields covered 
with clover and rye-grafs ; and gray oats are fucceeded by 
white, which return double the quantity of meal. There 
is, however, fomething in the nature of the foil which 
tends to degenerate oats ; for white oats will, in the courfe 
of 5 years, have a mixture of gray, even when kept up- 
on the beft improven land. An annual change of feed, 
from wet to dry land, and vice verfa, was tried, but did 
not fucceed above 7 years : the 8th year, there was a 
fmall quantity of gray ; and the oth, there was at leaft 
one-third gray oats, though the land on which the expe- 
riment was made in the 8th and 9th years was in as good 
heart as any of it had been in the preceding years. The 
frequent change of feed from a deeper foil, is, perhaps, 
the only certain method by which the lofs arifing from 
gray oats can be avoided. The means of improvement is 
lime imported from England, and fea-fhells from the bay 
of Wigton. The Ihells fucceed well ; but, from the ex- 
penfe of labour, 20 tons at lead being required to an acre, 
it is only thofe who are near the landing ports who have 
tried them. In 1790, about 16,000 Carlifle bufliels of 
lime were landed in the different ports. A Carlifle bufliel 
is equal to 3 Wmchefter's ; and 50 Carlifle bufliels of un- 
flacked lime has hitherto been confidered as a proper quan- 
tity for 1 acre •, but from 40 to 45 bufliels, according to 
the nature of the foil, with a proportional dreffmg upon a 
fecond going round, would, in all probability, anfwer the 
purpofe better ; for upon this coalt, fo fubjecT: to wet fea- 
fons, the almofl invariable confequence, from the 50 

bufliels

was thought high-rented at ill. a-year, then paid 12 bolls of each. 



Of Old Luce. 493 

fedhels has been a great quantity of lodged oats, impro- 
Der l Y filled, and the ltraw, fo neceflary in a cattle coun- 
try fit only for the dunghill. The lime is i s. 2d. the 
clrlillebuiheU and, for fome years paft, the import has 
been nearly the fame as in ,790; and only about 1000 
bufliels of it might annually go to the adjacent parimes. 
-Thq arable farms are all enclofed, and the improvement 
of farm houfes is going hand in hand with the improve- 
ment of land. So late as 1780, they were, almoft with- 
out exception, miferable hovels. Since that time, above 
20 have been built, all of them good, and many of them 
very good ; having not only the farm houfe, but the of- 
fices, with flated roofs, and many have been enlarged, re- 
paired, and rendered more comfortable habitations for 
men. 

Before improvement began, the grain raifed in the pa- 
rim ferved the inhabitants. The elfeas of the fcafcc 
years, 1782 and 1783, though improvement had then 
made fmall progrefs, were little felt : The meal did not 
rife above as. the ftone. At that time, the parim could 
do little more than fupply itfelf ; but in 1790, it export- 
ed 400 bolls of oats, 12 Winchefter bufhels to the boll 
and 400 bolls of meal, 16 ftone of 17HD. making the 
boll. Wheat and bear cannot be ranked amon£ft the pre- 
fent exports of the parim, but traces of them are under 
cultivation, by different farmers, this feafon. 

Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c. — The farmers great dependence be- 
ing placed upon black cattle, one great object of improve- 
ment is, to produce good pafture. Grain is cheaper here 
than in a manufacturing country : the Galloway boll of 
oats giving, in this parim, communibus anms, il. is.; 
meal, is. 8d. the ftone j and potatoes, 8d. the bufheL

makmg the ftone. The fheep go all to the butcher, and 
the black cattle to England, or other parts of Scotland to 
be prepared for them ; for very few are fattened in the 
panfh, except for private ufe. The average value of the 
black cattle fold is about 4 1. Sterling each , fteep, 9 1. the 
icore; and wool, 12 s. the ftone.— There may be about 
400 horfe in the parifth. A few of the farmers have a- 
dopted lately the wife plan of breeding horfe ; and it is to 
be hoped, that the prattice will foon become general, as 
they are fupplied at prefer* from Ireland at a great ex- 
penfe. 

A rabbit warren deferves to be mentioned amongft the 
animal produdions : it is rented at iool. a year. The 
flans go to the Englifli market, and the carcafes are fold 
in the country at 4d. the pair. 

ftp &amp;C.—A confiderable falmon fifhery is carried on 
in the rivers of Luce and Pooltanton. Both rivers are 
late ; clean fifth feldom appearing in either of them before 
the end of May, and never, in any great quantity, before 
the end of June or middle of July 5 but the fifhing con- 
tinues to the 27th of September. Though the rivers u- 
nite at their entrance into the bay, and have a common 
channel to low-water mark, yet the fifth of the one river 
are eafily diftinguifhed by their colour from thofe of the 

otlier ;

other j and the river in which they were bred is the one 
they return to ; a fifh originally belonging to the one, be- 
ing very feldom met with in the other. They are fold at 
2d. the lb., if above 10 lb. weight ; if io lb. or below it, 
at i d. the lb.—- Great plenty of fea trout, of different 
kinds, weighing from I lb. to 5 lb. or 6 lb., are met with 
in both rivers, from the beginning to the end of the fal- 
mon liming feafon ; and the bay of Luce, along the 
whole coaft of the parifh, abounds with fifh : but no at- 
tempt hath hitherto been made to turn them to any ac- 
count. The inhabitants having no abfolute demand for 
them as a neceflary of x'fe, and no market near them, for 
no manufactures are eftablifhed in the parifli, they never 
think of profiting by the blemngs which Providence has 
put in their power. 

Population. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls in 1755 was 1509. Old Luce, on the 
1 ft of January 1 791, contained 1200 inhabitants, old and 
young. An accurate enumeration was likewife made in 
1778, which amounted to 1275. 

From the baptifms entered in the parifh regifter, which 
hegins in 1732, it appears, that the population has been 
decreafing fince the year 1 75 5s and perhaps before that 
period ; but as there is no rule by which it can be traced, 
this cannot be certainly known.

* From the preceding ftate, and the return made to Dr. Wcbfter of 
the population of Old Luce in I75J. being IJ09 fouls, it is evident, that 
there has been fome continued caufe of depopulation. Indeed, two caufes 
may be afligned, and the firft is; that, previous to 1755, the arable part 
of the parifh wa 6 parcelled out into fmall farms ; and fince that period,

Rent, Heritors, Stipend, &amp;c— The valued rent of the. 
parifh is 5991 1. 15s. Scots, and the real rent about 3500I. 
Strling. There are 9 heritors, 5 of whom have houfes, 
in which fome of them refide conftantly, and others occa- 
fionally. 

The church is too fmall for the inhabitants, but toler- 
ably well nmmed, and in good repair. The King is pa- 
tron. The flipend, by an augmentation lately obtained, 
is about iool. The manfe was built about 50 years ago, 
and is a large and good houfe. The glebe has evidently 
been the garden of the abbey, and contains exaclly 12 
acres, including the ruins, manfe, and prefent garden. 
The ruins, notwithstanding the immenfe quantities carried 
away, (till cover, or render of no value, about 1^ acre of 
the glebe. 

The abbey was founded in the year 1 1 90 * ; and it ap- 
pears from die ruins, to have been a very extenfive build- 
Vol. XIV. 3 R ing ; 

there has been a progreflive union of two or more of thefe. This has 
kffened confiderably the number of farmers. But, befides the divifion 
of land into fmall farms, there was, in general, a farm fervant upon 
each of them, called a cottar or worker, who had a houfe, with a wife 
and family. The number of thefe diminifhed, of courfe, with the en- 
largement of farms ; and their number has again decreafed in confequence 
of the farmers preferring unmarried fervants, in their families, to the 
cottar in his own houfe. The enclofing of land has likewife contributed, 
in part, to the depopulation, by rendering herds, who generally had 
wives and families, altogether unneceffary. Thefe caufes have occafion- 
ed the depopulation; and unlefs manufactures be introduced, there is no 
probability that the population will increafe, while the mode of large 
farms continues. 

* The monks were of the Ciftertian order; and a Thomas Hay was 
appointed commendator fo late as 1560. The Pope's bull, dated at 
Rome, ad May 1560, appointing him, Commendator Vallis Lucis atque 
de Glenluce, is ftill in the poficflion of the commendator 's family, in this 
parifh, Sir Thomas Hay of Park, Baronet.

ing } but all that now remains entire is a fmall apartment 
upon the E. fide of the fquare, within which the cloifters 
have flood. In the middle of the apartment is a pillar, 
about 14 feet high, from which 8 arches fpring, and have 
their terminations in the fur rounding walls : The centre 
of every arch is ornamented with foliage and different 
figures, remarkably well cut in coarfe free ftone. From 
the folidity of the workmanfhip which remains, a probable 
conclufion may be drawn, that the hand of time would 
never have overturned it ; neither had the zeal of the 
good people in Galloway for Reformation extended to ftone 
walls, even though they had contained Roman Catholicks j 
for it had remained for near 100 years after the Refor- 
mation, without fuffering any material injury *. But li- 
berty had, after that time, been given by the incumbents 
to the people to pick out the free ftone, which brought 
it to ruins. The pillar, which is much admired for its 
juft proportions, has efcaped the general deft.ruc~r.ion, ei- 
ther from the difficulty of removing the rubbifh which had 
fallen upon the arches, or the danger of its burying the 
depredators in its ruins, had any attempt been made be- 
low the arches to pull it down. 

School and Poor. — The fchoolmafter's falary is 8L 6s.

II or il years before, abbeys, cathedrals, and churches, in other parts 
of Scotland, had perifhed. It appears, from the records of the prefby-

education of 4 poor children, may amount to 25 1. Ster- 
ling a-year. The number of fcholars, at an average, will 
be about 50. Two private fchools are likewife generally 
kept, for the winter months, in different parts of the pa- 
rim, and the number of fcholars at each about 30. — The 
poor are not numerous, and feldom beg. The funds 
for their maintenance are the weekly collections at church, 
which fome years fall under, but feldom exceed, 15I. 
Sterling. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is little flat or low 
lying land ; but none of the hills rife to any confiderable 
height, except 3, and the higheft of thefe does not exceed 
200 feet above the level of the fea. The Knock, the 
fmalleft in circumference, is of a {harp conical figure, and 
a fmall fpace at the top has been furrounded with a ftone 
wall, the veftiges of which are ftill vifible. It probably 
has been a place of refuge, in the turbulent days of our 
predeceflbrs, where a handful of determined men, pre- 
vious to the ufe of fire arms, might have bid defiance for 
a long time to thoufands. 

Many tumuli, or cairns of ftones, are ftill remaining, 
though the building of fences and clearing of fields, has 
reduced their number confiderably. There cannot be a 
doubt of their being monuments erected over the afhes of 
the dead j for in all of them that have been opened, there 
has been found, it is faid, an urn, enclofed in ftones, in 
the form of an oblong fquare, about the middle of the 
cairn : but there was lately found, near the outfide of one 
which had been carried away almoft level with the fur- 
face of the field, 6 earthen pots, refembling urns, alter- 
nately ranged in the earth, with the mouth of one and 
bottom of another up. In each, there was a fmall quan-

tity of human bones, which evidently have been burnt : 
Parts of the fkulls, and other human bones, are very dif- 
tinft. They were carelefsly left by the workmen who 
found them upon the publick road, where fome idle boys 
broke them in pieces ; but, from the information that 
could be got, and fragments that were picked up, no in* 
fcription had been upon them. It is remarkable, that 
wherever one of thefe cairns is met with, another will 
invariably be found within view of it. A line of them, 
in this parifh, can, in this way, be traced for 2 miles. 
There may be two, and not a third one in view of either ; 
but there is never one without another, unlefs it has been 
carried away, within view of its fellow. 

There is, in this parifh, a fpring of the chalybeate kind., 
which has been ufed with fuccefs in fcorbutic diforders. </p></div>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011691">GREENLAW</name>. 

(County of Berwick, Synod of Merse and Tiviot-

By the Rev. Mr. William Simson.</head> 


<p>
Extent, Name, Soil, Surface, &amp;c. 

TH E parilh of Greenlaw is between 7 and 8 miles in 
length, from N. to S. ; and, on an average, about 
2 miles in breadth. In this parifh, there are feveral of 
thofe round hills, or detached eminences, which, from 
their conical figure, are well known in Scotland by the 
name of Laws. It is from one of thefe, which, in the 
original uncultivated ftate of the country, being greener 
than the reft, that the parifh evidently derives its name.— 
The foil is extremely various. In the S. part of the pa- 
rim, it confifts of a deep, ftrong clay, and produces ex- 
cellent wheat, barley, oats, hay, and line pafture. In pro- 
ceeding northward, it becomes worfe. In many places, 
it is wet and fpongy ; and both the grain and grafs are of 
an inferior quality j but fuch parts as are dry, bear good 
oats, excellent turnips, and heavy crops of clover and rye 

grafs. 



5 0 2 Statiflical Account 

graft. The N. part of the parifh is moftly a mountainous 
traa. Some of the hills are dry and improved towards 
the bottom 5 others are wet, and covered with fhort heath, 
and fit only for fheep-walks, and die raifing of young cat- 
tle. On the W. fide of this trad, there is a mo fs of con- 
futable extent, from which -the inhabitants of the town 
of Greenlaw, and all who live in the N. part of the pa- 
rifh, are fupplicd with peats of a tolerably good quality. 
There is no map of the parilh. About one half of it is 
enclofed, and two thirds of it arable. 

Climate, Difeafes, &amp;c— The climate is as various as the 
foil. At Greenlaw, which is well fheltered by hills, the 
air is rather mild ; in the S. of the parifh, it is more fo ; 
but on the high grounds, and efpecially towards the N., 
it is keen and penetrating. It . may be faid to be a healthy 
diflria, few or no epidemical difeafes being peculiar to 
it. In the fpring, however, agues, rheumatifms, and in- 
termittent fevers, are frequent : but it is remarked, that 
thefe difeafes are neither fo violent, nor of fuch duration 
in this parifh, as in thofe to the S. ; which is owing, per- 
haps, to this part of the country being more hilly ; the 
waters, confequently, being lefs apt to run into a putrid 
flate. Formerly, the fmall pox carried off great num- 
bers ; but the prejudices againft inoculation are faft wear- 
ing out. The people, in general, are become reconciled 
to this practice, by feeing the remarkable fuccefs with 
which it is attended. Mr. Alexander, furgeon in this 
place, has, in the courfe of the laft io years, inoculated 
upwards of 500, of which number only 1 died. 

Rivers. — Blackater, or Blackwater, is the only river 
which runs through this parifh. Its waters are of a dark 

blackifh

blackifh colour ; and it is from this circumftance it de- 
rives its name. It abounds in excellent trout. In fum- 
mer, and even in winter, it is commonly but a fmall 
ftream ; but being fed by a number of rills and fmall tor- 
rents, which iflue from the neighbouring hills, it fwells 
fometimes unexpectedly to a great fize, and overflows, to 
a confiderable extent, the valley grounds through which 
it panes. 

Refit, &amp;c— The valued rent of the parifh is 6836L 
3s. 1 1 A d. Scots. The real rent about 3550I. Sterling. 
The rent of land varies according to its quality and fitu- 
ation. Near the town of Greenlaw, where it is let in 
fmall portions, the rent is from 1 1. to I L 1 o s. an acre * ; 
enclofed arable farms from 10s. to 20s. 6d. an acre : un- 
enclofed farms, which are partly in tillage, and partly 
flocked with fheep, are not let by the acre, but in the 
lump. The farms are, in general, from 70 1. to 350I. a- 
year ; but there are fome from 70 1. down to 50I. ; and a 
few fmall pofTeffions below 20 1. It ought to be obferved 
alfo, that feveral farmers, fome of whom refide in the 
parilh, and fome out of it, but all having farms in it, pof- 
fefs lands to the value of 500L, and even 700 1. a-year. 
About 50 years ago, the real rent of the parim did not 
much exceed the third part of what it is at prefent. Some 
of the belt lands were, about that time, let at 5 s. the 
acre. 

This great rife of rent is not owing to any confiderable 
rife in the price of grain : For even fo far back as to- 
wards the end of the laft century, grain fold, commumbus 
tmnts f, nearly as high as it is now. But the caufes, 

which

is always meant.

which have chiefly contributed to raife the rent fo greatly, 
are the great rife in the price of fheep and cattle, and 
the vaft improvements which have been made in agricul- 
ture, by which more grain is raifed than formerly ; and 
much artificial food, fuch as turnips, clover, and rye grafs, 
&amp;c, has been introduced, which has contributed, in no 
fmall degree, both to improve the cattle, and to augment 
their numbers. 

Formerly, the parifh was almoft totally unenclofed, and 
let out in fmall farms. From fcarcity of manure, an in- 
confiderable portion only of thefe farms could be kept in 
good condition for tillage. This, which was called croft 
land, lay in the immediate neighbourhood of the farm- 
Head ; and all the manure, which was made upon the 
farm, was laid upon it. The reft, v/hich was termed 
outfield, was partly cropped with oats, without any kind 
of manure whatever, except what was fometimes folded, 
which was generally but a few acres and partly allowed 
to lie wafte, paftured by fome ftunted half-ftarved (beep 
or cattle. When that which was cropped was quite ex- 
haufted, it was allowed to reft, and a portion of the other 
wafte ground taken up in its place. A few crops of oats 
exhaufted it alfo ; it was then allowed again to lie wafte, 
and another portion was ploughed and cropped with oats ; 
and fo with the reft. The tenants then were very differ- 
ent from what they now are : They wrought as hard, and 
fared as meanly as their fervants : their houfes were fmall 
and inconvenient ; and the whole face of the country ex- 
hibited nothing but marks of extreme indigence. This 
wretched fyftem of hufbandry, and the poverty which was 
the confequence of it, were riot peculiar to this parifh, 
nor even to this corner of the kingdom, but prevailed al- 
moft all over Scotland •, and arofc no lefs from the ftate

m which commerce then was, than from ignorance in 
agriculture. Before the Union, Scotland had no foreign 
market for her fheep and black cattle ; and, confequently, 
had no motive to raife more of thefe than her own do- 
meftick confumption demanded ; which, at that time, was 
extremely fmall, as little butcher meat was then ufed. 
But no fooner had the Union opened a market for thefe 
valuable articles of commerce, than an influx of wealth, 
unknown in former times, began to pour into the north- 
ern part of the ifland. This influx of wealth increafmg, 
as the price of cattle rofe, gradually produced a happy 
change in the fyftem of agriculture ; and was, doubtlefs, 
one of the principal caufes of the improvement of the 
country : For landlords of difcernment foon perceived, 
that it would be as profitable to cultivate land for rearing 
and feeding cattle, as for raifing grain. They, therefore, 
enclofed their grounds, and united feveral of their fmall 
farms. Thefe, they either improved themfelves, or let to 
opulent and enterprifing farmers, who had money fulh- 
cient, not only to flock their farms, but alfo to improve 
them ; and who had the good fenfe to perceive the ab- 
furdity of the manner in which agriculture had been car- 
ried on, and the fagacity to forefee the advantages which 
would refult from introducing a more improved fyftem. 
In this parilh, thefe farmers laboured under many local 
difadvantages : They were at a great diftance from lime, 
which was the only fpecies of manure they could com- 
mand : They were ftill farther from markets, -where they 
could difpofe of their grain : The roads to both, when 
they began their improvements, were bad ; but, by their 
perfeverance and fpirited exertions, they furmounted eve- 
ry obftacle ; and (which is much to their honour), have 
converted a great part of the parifh from a bleak and ne-

Statifticat Account 



gleaed, into a beautiful and well cultivated diftricl:. They 
now reap the fruits of their induftry : Moft of them are 
in eafy circumftances, and live in a comfortable manner. 

Roads. — When a fpirit for improvement in agriculture 
firft appeared in this part of the country, the roads were 
in bad repair. The only way of tranfporting grain or 
meal to the Lothian markets, was on horfes backs. It is 
obvious how expenfive this mode of carriage muft have 
been. But befides being expenfive, it was attended with 
another, and even greater inconvenience : In winter, when 
there was moft grain to difpofe of, and the farmers flood 
moft in need of money for paying their rents, the roads, 
or rather tra£ls, were often impaflable. But fince that 
branch of the great road from London to Edinburgh, 
which runs through this parifh, was made (which is near- 
ly 30 years ago), there has been conftant accefs with carts 
to the Dalkeith market. A cart with 2 horfes, carrying 
5 load of meal, can perform 2 journeys in the week, and 
returns home laden with coal or lime. The roads to Ber- 
wick and Eyemouth were, till lately, in a bad ftate ; but now 
they are in good repair. The principal crofs roads in the 
parifh are alfo much improved. All thefe roads do great 
honour to the publick fpirit of the gentlemen who planned 
and promoted them ; for they have put, as far as human 
art can, this diftant inland tra£t of the country on a level 
with thofe places that are more favourably fituated with 
refpedr. to markets. 

Mode of Cultivation and Price of Labour. — The ploughs 
generally ufed, arc the Englifh kind, drawn by 2 horfes ; 
but when ftrong ftiff land is broken up, the Scotch plough 
xs ufed, which is drawn by 4 horfes, or 2 horfes and 2 

oxen. 



Of Greenlaw* 507 



oxen. Since the late improvements were introduced into 
agriculture, the price of labour has greatly encreafed. A- 
bout 40 years ago, farmers men fervants, who had their 
vitals in their mailers houfes, received from 3I. to 4I. 
a-year; the women from 2I. to 2l. 10 s. : At prefent, the 
men receive from 7I. to 9I. a-year; the women from 3I. 
to 4I. But moft of the men fervants, employed in hui- 
bandry, are married, and eat in their own houfes : They 
receive, for meat and wages, a certain quantity of grain, 
fome money, and food for a cow for the whole year ; a- 
mounting in all to between 15I. and 16I *. 

Crops. — The principal crops in this parilh are, wheat, 
barley, and oats. Some peafe alfo are fown, but in fmall 
quantities, as the foil is found not to be very fuitable for 
the growth of that kind of grain. Heavy crops of clover 
and rye-grafs are raifed on almoft all the improved lands. 
Turnips have been much cultivated of late, and are found 
to fucceed well in the dry grounds. The farmers either 
feed cattle with them in the houfe, or fell them to dealers 
in fheep, to be eaten on the ground. When eaten in the 
fields, they generally fell at about 3 1. an acre ; but fome 
years, they are much higher: This year (1793) fome

* Formerly, men day-labourers, when they furnifhed their own vic- 
tual?, had enly 6d. a day ; now they have from is. to is. ad., except in 
the time of mowing, when the wages are Is. 6d. : in harveft, the men 
get is. ad. a-day, with their meat ; women, 8 d. or 9 d. : but reapers 
are generally hired for the harveft. The wages of the men are about 
il. 6s.; thofe of the women about il. is. Women receive for work- 
ing at hay, and weeding turnips, 8d. a-day, without meat : the day- 
wages of a mafon are from is. 8 d. to is.; of a carpenter, from 1 s. 
6d. to is. 8d. ; of a cabinetmaker the fame. Work, however, of all 
thofe kinds, is generally done by the piece. A tailor receives 8d. a-day, 
with his meat.

fields fold fo high as 61. ios. the acre. Potatoes are a 
general crop, and are of vaft fervice to the poor people. 
About Martinmas, the price of them is feldom above iod. 
or i s. the firlot. 

Mode of Cropping. — The fame mode of cropping does not 
prevail through the whole parifh, but is varied according to 
the foil and climate. On lands fit for bearing wheat, the 
mode of cropping followed by the principal farmers is 
this : When a field is taken up that has been paftured for 
fome years, they take 2 crops of oats fucceflively ; but if 
it has not been paftured, and been only 1 year in hay, 
they take only 1 crop of oats ; then fallow it, and after 
the fallow, fow wheat in the autumn, with grafs feeds in 
the fpring : If they do not fow grafs feeds, which is forne- 
times the cafe, with the wheat crop, they then take a crop 
of peafe after the wheat ; and after the peafe a crop of 
barley, along with which they fow the grafs feeds. On 
light dry land, fit for turnips, when taken up after it has 
been paftured, they take 2 crops of oats fucceflively ; but 
if it has been only 1 year in hay, only 1 crop of oats, 
then turnips, and after the turnips, barley with gTafs feeds. 
Till of late, it was the general practice .to take 2 crops of 
hay before they laid their fields in pafture j but feveral 
farmers have found, by repeated trials which they have 
made, that it is more profitable not to cut their fields, 
which they intend for pafture, but to put their fheep or 
cattle upon them the year immediately after they are 
fown. And they are of opinion, that the firft 2 years 
thus paftured, are fully as valuable as the 3 next following. 

Number of Horfes, &amp;c— There are about 280 horfes, of 
all ages, in the parifti, and 850 black cattle : the number 

of 



Of Greenlaw, 



e f fheep amounts to about 2500. The attention which 
has been paid, for fome years paft, to the improvement 
of the breed of fheep, has greatly increafed the value of 
the wool. In 1 791 and 1792, laid wool fold from 14s. 
to 1 8 s. 6 d. a-ftone-, and white wool con fiderably higher. 
This year it has fallen about 2 s. the ftone. 

Populations According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls in 1755 was 895. An accurate enume- 
ration of the inhabitants of the parifh was made in fum- 
mer 1785. They amounted then to 12 10, of whom 223 
were below 8 years of age. Of the 987 who were above 
8 years, 832 were of the Eftablifhed Church; 62 were 
Burghers 82 Antiburghers ; 7 Cameronians •, and 4 of 
the Relief perfuafion. There are 7 heritors, 3 of whom 
refide in the parifh. About one half of the inhabitants 
live in the town of Greenlaw the reft live in farmfteads 
and detached houfes, and in a fmall village, in the N. part 
of the parifh, which contains about 60 people. Almoft 
the whole of the town of Greenlaw is feued *. The 
feuars are about 80 in number. There are feveral in- 
ftances of longevity in the parifh. Some years ago, 2 
perfons died upwards of 90. There is 1 alive at prefent 
aged 93, another 87, and feveral fomewhat above 80. 

Abstract 



* Feuing Is a mode of holding landed property very common in Scot- 
land. The puichafer holds of a fuhjecft fuperior, to whom, befides the 
money given when the lands are bought, he pays a perpetual yearly ac- 
knowledgment, which is termed feu-duty. The purchafe money paid 
for the grounds feued In Greenlaw is Sol. the Englifh acre, and the feu- 
duty j 6 s. 10 d. The Earl of Marchmont is fuperior,

Stipend. — The flipend is iool., with a manfe, and a 
glebe of about 10 acres. The church was lately repaired 
and new feated ; and although it is tbo narrow, confider- 
ing the length of it (which is the cafe with almoft all old 
churches), and rather too fmall for the congregation ; yet 
it is, upon the whole, a comfortable place of publick wor- 
ship. The manfe (lands in need of being repaired. The 
Earl of Marchmont is patron. 

State of the Poor. — The heritors and kirk-feffion meet 
twice a-year, about the terms of Whitfunday and Mar- 
tinmas, for the purpofe of making provifion for the poor. 
At each of thefe meetings, an afleflment is made, fuffi- 
cient for maintaining thofe that are admitted upon the 
roll for the enfuing half year. The one half of the af- 
feflment is paid by the heritors, and the other by the te- 
nants. There are 41 perfons at prefent upon the roll ; and 
the fum aflefied to maintain them, for the current half year, 
is 62 1. us. 6 d. • About 5 years ago, the fums levied for 



Of Greenlaw* 



the fupport of the poor, were not much above one-third 
of what they now are. 

Manufaaures.— Manufactures have not yet been intro- 
duced into this parifh. The only branch that has been 
attempted, is one of woollen cloth but how it will fuc- 
ceed, it is impoffible to fay, as it is yet in its infancy. 
Cabinetmakers work is extremely well executed here : 8 
or 10 tradefmen are conftantly employed in making houfe- 
hold furniture for gentlemen in the neighbourhood ; but 
none is made but what is commiffioned. 

CharaBer. — The inhabitants of this parifli are, in ge- 
neral, a fober and induftrious people. There are fome, 
indeed, of a different cliai-after : Thefe, however, are but 
few. No inhabitant of the parifh has either fuffered ca- 
pital punifhment, or been banifhed for many years paft ; 
and only one inftance of fuicide has occurred in the me- 
mory of the oldeft pcrfon living. 

Dif advantages. — Perhaps few parts of the country, la- 
bouring under, equal difadvantages, have made as great 
progrefs in improvement as this parifh has done. Its dis- 
tance from markets neceflarily diminifhes the price of 
grain ; and its diflance from coal and lime as neceflarily 
increafes the price of fuel and manure. The town of 
Greenlaw, which is nearly tbe centre of the parifh, is 30 
miles from Dalkeith, 20 from Berwick, and about the 
fame diftance from Eyemouth ; and almoft all the meal, 
and even part of the grain, that is carried to thefe differ- 
ent markets, is bought up to be tranfportcd to more dif- 
tant parts of the country : What is carried to Dalkeith, is 
thence conveyed by land carriage to Glafgow, which is 

near 



5 1 2 Statiftical Account 



near 8o miles from Greenlaw. The neareft coal and 
lime are in Northumberland, about 20 miles diftant. Yet, 
notwithstanding all thefe difadvantages, not only the S. 
part of the parifli, where the foil is good, but alfo many 
other parts, where it is of inferior quality, are, by being 
well enclofed and well limed, made as fertile as it is pof- 
fible to render places fo unfavourably fituated for im- 
provement. 

Antiquities. — The ruins of two ancient religious houfes 
are ftill to be feen in this parifli. They belonged to the 
priory of Kelfo, when popery was eftabliflied in this 
country *. 

Hints for Improvements. — 1. It has been already obferv- 
ed, that feveral of the hills, in the N. part of the parifh, 
are improved towards the bottom. No part of them, how- 
ever, is enclofed. This is a great lofs to the farmers, as 
they cannot, with all their care and attention, keep their 
fheep from the turnips in winter, nor fown grafs in the 
fpring. A few enclofures, therefore, would be of great 
benefit 5 and would amply compenfate for fuch fums of 
money as would be neceflary for making them. 

2. Several 

* About a mile N. from the town of Greenlaw, an old wall, or earthen 
mound, with a ditch on one fide, known by the name of Harrit's, or 
Herrit's Dike, runs acrofs the parifh. It cannot now be afcertained, 
cither what the height of the wall, or depth of the ditch originally was ; 
but neither of them feems to have been confiderable. By the enclofure?, 
which have been lately made in the country, the greateft part of this wall 
has been deftroyed. About 60 years ago, it could have been traced 14 
miles eaftward ; and tradition fays, it proceeded, in the fame direction, 
as far as Berwick. It is fuppofed to have extended wefhvard to a place 
in the parifli of Legerwood, called Boon ; a word, in the Celtic language, 
iignifying boundary or termination. It is not known by whom, or an 
what time this wall was built, nor for what purpofe it was intended. 



Of Greenlaw. 5*3 

- Several parts of the fame farms are dry and arable, 
W have not been in tillage for at leaft 100 years paft, 
in their prefent ftate, are worth very httle : Were 
ley taken up and well limed, and, after a crop or two of 
oJ, fown with white clover feed, then value would be 
confiderably increafed. They would become rnoft excel, 
lent pafture grounds either for fheep or cattle 

, The greateft improvement that could be made in 
this parim, would be to plant fome of the high grounds 
with fuch trees as beft fuited the foil, Plantations, when 
judicioufly made, are ornaments to the richeft and beft 
cultivated diftrias : but on high and expofed places, they 
are not only ornamental, but greatly beneficial. They 
break the violence of the winds, and render the air more 
mild and temperate. In few parts of the country do the 
winds rage with greater fury than on fome of the high 
grounds in this parim : yet thefe are almoft all quite bare, 
and deftitute of trees. It is unneceflary to point out all 
the various places where plantations might be made to 
advantage ; it may be proper, however, to- mention the 
following : Were a ftripe of plantation drawn acrofs the 
parim, about half a mile to the S. of the town of Green- 
law, it would be both a great ornament to the country 
in general, and a vaft benefit to the lands through which, 
it paffed. Another ftripe, about the fame diftance N. 
from the town, drawn likewife acrofs the parim, would 
be no lefs ornamental and advantageous. Befides thefe, 
fevcral clumps of trees ought to be raifed in places far- 
ther N. In fevere winters, when the frofts art intenfe 
and of long continuance, and the ground covered with 
fnow, all thefe various plantations would be of angular 
benefit. They would afford a conftant Ihelter to the 
Vol. XIV. 3 T

flieep y and thereby prove the means of improving and 
preferving thofe valuable creatures, on which the wealth 
?nd profperity of the country fo much depend.

that fignifies high. Auchterhoufe is 7 miles N. W. of 
Dundee. It lies in a gentle declivity to the S. of that 
range of hills called Sidlaw, which feparates Strathmore 
from the Carfe of Gowrie and the low part of Angus. It 
is of a triangular form, and contains (according to the 
beft information I had a'ccefs to), about 4 1 60 acres ; of 
which there are 3160 arable.

"movements in agriculture have been made m tlus pa- 
ri* fmce the year 1776, which took then- rife from the 
difcovery and application of marl, of which there are^ 3 
We fields and a fmall one. The feft mentioned, with 
a of the former, belong to the Earl of Airly , the other 
to Captain Laird of Strathmartine and Mr. Yeoman o. 
Ballbeuchly. The furface of thefe fields confifts of 2 feet 
rich earth; below which are 6 feet of mofs under the 
mofs, 4 or 5 feet of clay and fand : then, the firft bed ot 
marl j in fome places, 7 feet deep •, in others, not above

feet j and next, the fecond bed of 'marl, generally of the

wrought, becaufe of the Water which abounds, and which 
it would be extremely difficult and expenfive to draw off. 
In one of Lord Airly's moffes, there is a rock of a pecu- 
liar fpecies •, hard as flint, and black as coal. Where it 
is neceflary to open drains through it, it has always been 
found impraaicable, without the aid of gunpowder, as no 
tool can make any impreffion upon it. Yet, obdurate as 
it is found in its natural fituation, when expofed to the 
winter froft and rain, it crumbles into pieces, and is good 
for no purpofe.-— Deers horns, of a great fize, have often 
been found, at a considerable depth in the moffes •, as alfo

or the moft fubftantial kind : The walls are brought to a 
level at the height of 4 feet ; then covered with large flag 
ftones, projeaing ^ or 3 inches on each fide ; and to bind 
and keep all faft, there is fet above thefe a capping of 
ftone, placed on edge, which ftands ftrong like an arch. 
The enclofures of Ballbeuchly are done after the fame 
manner : Thofe of Dronlaw and Scotfton are carrying on 
in a fimilar ftyle : The 2 Adamftons were enclofed many 
years ago; but, from the want of good materials, the 
fences are not fo complete as thofe upon the other eftates 
m the parifh. Proprietors and tenants are now fo well 
convinced of the fuperior advantage of enclofed ground to 
open fields, and fuch is the prefent prevailing fpirit of im- 
provement in all the branches of agriculture, that it is 
thought, within a few years hence, the whole arable land 
of the parifh will be enclofed. Thefe walls are built at 
24 s. the rood : 8 s. for quarrying, 8 s. for driving, and 8 s. 
for building. 

As to cropping, the farmers differ fomewhat in opinion, 
and vary in practice. Yet all are agreed, that their inte- 
reft lies in fowing out annually a large portion of their 
farm with grafs feeds, chiefly red and white clover, and 
rye-grafs ; and alfo in having a good deal of peafe, tur- 
nips, potatoes, and yarns. Oats and barley are our prin- 
cipal crops. Some wheat is fown, but it does not often 
prove beneficial. Peafe meliorate the ground, and yield, 
excellent fodder. It is for thefe reafons they are fown, 
and not for any other return they make ; the encreafe, in 
moft feafons, being rather fcanty. Turnips, potatoes, and 
yams, fucceed remarkably well. With the former, a great 
number of cattle are fed every winter for the butcher.

*They are alfo given with great advantage to milch-cows 
and young cattle. Upon Lord Airly's farm, oxen have 
been reared and fattened to the weight of 80 ftone. — Flax- 
feed is fown too, which generally yields from 3 to 4 or 
5 ftone the peck; the ftone worth us. or 12s.— 250 
ftone of hay an acre-, 11 or 12 bolls of oats; 10 bolls 
of barley; 9 or 10 bolls of wheat; and 10 bolls of 
peafe, are confidered abundant crops ; and not to be ex- 
pefted, if the fields are not in high cultivation, and the 
feafon favourable. In general, little more than the half 
of the above quantities are reaped ; yet the produce is al- 
ways more than what is necefTary for the confumption of 
the inhabitants. The furplus is carried to the Dundee 
market, which 13 faid to be about 2000 bolls of meal and 
barley. 

The rent of farms is from 20 1. to 200 1. and upwards ; 
their extent is from 50 to 500 acres. There are about 
200 acres planted, including belts and clumps. 

There are 40 ploughs in the parifli ; generally formed 
after Small's model, and drawn, fome by 2, others by 4 
horfes, according as the foil is tender or rugged, and the 
fields level or fteep. The number of horfes may amount 
to 200 ; and milch-cows to 150. 

The moft deficient crop known in this country thefe 50 
years part, was in the year 1792. Compared with it, crop 
1782 was a great one. Still, no perfon fuffered through 
fcarcity, either in the one or other. In 1782, as meal 
was very dear (20s. the boll), and the price of labour not 
fo high as now, the kirk-feffion purchafed a quantity of 
meal, and fold it at a reduced price, according to the cir- 
cumftances of the buyer *.

There are here 1 2 farmers by profeflion ; 40 weavers ;

We have neither lawyer, writer, doctor, furgeon, nor

Character of the People, &amp;c— The people are all of the 
Eftabliflied Church ; regular in their attendance upon pub- 
lick worfhip ; not mere formalifts in religion, and yet free 
from enthufiafm ; fober and diligent in their refpedive 
profemons, contented with their fituation, and well affect- 
ed both to the civil and religious eftablifhments of the 
country. In fpite of the various wicked arts employed 
by die feditious in a neighbouring town to difleminate 
French doctrines, and to poifon their honeft minds, they 
remain unfhaken in their loyalty, and think not they de- 
grade themfelves by paying honour to whom honour is

thers, they learned thefe principles, and their children arc 
imWted in the fame— If the price of many of the ne- 
ceflaries of life is greatly encreafed, the price of labour is 
more than doubled fmce the year 1774. Then, the wages 
of a man fervant were about 4I. Sterling; now they are 
9I. or 1 61., with viauals and lodging. The wages of fe- 
male fervants and day-labourers have rifen in the fame 
proportion. The people of this country, in general, are 
happy, and will remain fo, if they fuffer not themfelve* 
to fall under the influence of ambitious, difappointed, tur- 
bulent, and ill-defigning demagogues. The induftriout 
have ample encouragement, plenty of work, good pay- 
ment, and full fecurity for their perfons, character, and 
property. Very few young men go from this parifh either 
to the army or navy : a fure proof of their not being ad- 
dicted to idlenefs or vice. As to great crimes, they are 
not known here. No perfon recollects an inftance of fui- 
cide or murder nor of any one who had been tried ca-* 
pitally. And fuch is their peaceable difpofition and in* 
iegrity, that not many have been involved in law-fuits. 

Climate. — The air of the parifh is keen, but not un* 
healthy. There are 2 men now alive between 80 and 90 
years of age, and (till ftrong and active ; and 16 perfon» 
between 70 and 80. — The difeafes prevalent here are fuch 
as are common in the country. Not a few fuffer from 
rheumatifms and fcrofulous diforders : agues are fcarccly 
known : the fmall pox have frequently made fevere ra- 
vages among the children. By that fatal diforder, in 1775, 
no fewer than 20 were carried off in the fpace of 6 weeks. 
At that time, the prejudice of the people againft inocula-

writer of this account exerted all his influence to infpire the people with 
more juft and rational feirtiments upon fo very interefting a fubject. 
He argued with them in private, and recommended inoculation from the 
pulpit. He told them, that many of the moft pious and popular clergy- 
men had adopted the fcherne in their own families ; and that, from the 
great fuccefs that attended it in every quarter of the globe, there was 
good reafon to conclude, that it was a febeme highly favoured by Pro- 
vidence. But all in vain. Their prejudices remained, and their children 
continued to die. In 1782, he had a child of his own inoculated; and 
in the following year, by the advice of an eminent furgeon in Dundee, 
he performed the operation himfelf upon his fecond child ; and, at the 
fame time, upon fome other children in the village. They all did well. 
He continues the practice in his family ; and has prevailed with fome to 
follow his example ; that is, to inoculate their children without calling 
in either phyfician or furgeon. In fhort, it is believed, that by and bye 
the fcheme will be generally adopted, and, in confequence thereof, raanf 
ufeful lives fayed to the publick.

* All the parochial fchools, within the bounds of the prefbytery, are 
vifked and ftrictly examined annually by the prefbytery, and a report of 
the ftate of each fchool entered upon the record. The prefbytery is 
formed into three committees ; the firft meeting of each committee fix- 
ed, who have power to fettle the fubfequent meetings. The examina- 
tion of the feveral fchools is accomplifhed within three or four weeks. 
This plan, purfued for thefe fix years paft, has been productive of the

And there is one gentleman (Mr. Paterfon of Cafile Huntly), who not

The Earl of Airly is patron. The church was rebuilt in

with a fteeple of cut ftone on the W. end. Connected 
with it, on the eaftward, there is an aile, containing a 
large vault, formerly a burying-place of the Buchan fa, 
mily, now belonging to the family of Airly. The old 
church was an extenfive grand Gothick ftructure, dedi- 
cated to the Virgin Mary. It bore no date. There is a 
large fount ftone remaining, with fome images of angels, 
or faints, in rude fculpture, and but ill-fuited to the ele* 
gance of the general building. The manfe was built in 
1789, at the expenfe of 322I. 10 s. Sterling, befides the 
materials of the old manfe and carriages. It is an excel-. 
lent houfe, 39 feet by 25 within the walls ; well finifhed, 
and covered with the belt Efdale flate. The offices were 
built in 1784. A very handfome fchool-houfe was alfo 
fouilt in 1 7 89. And, to the honour of the gentlemen con-

and afternoon worfliip, a few of the fcholars are employed every Sunday 
in the church, for half an hour at leaft, in reading publickly a portioa 
of the Old and the New Teftament ; after which a catechetical exercife 
follows. Thefe leflbns are duly prepared the preceding day in fchool. 
This practice infpires a degree of emulation among the fcholars, and af-

another ftream, aflumes the name of Dighty Water •, and 
this it bears, till it empties itfelf into the frith of Tay, 4

Roads and Bridges.— The turnpike road from Dundee to 
Meigle runs through the parifh. Such as live near the 
turnpike, and have eafy accefs to it, feel its great advan- 
tage, and readily acknowledge it •, while thofe who live at 
a diftance, derive but little benefit from it, owing to the 
wretched ftate of the bye-roads, which the commuted fta- 
tute-labour will never render tolerable. There are in the 
parifli 5 bridges, 2 corn mills, 1 lint mill, and 1 fulling- 
mill. 

Antiquities. — Upon the fummit of one of the Sidlaw 
hills, called the Whitefheets, about a mile N. of the 
church, there are evident traces of an ancient fortification. 
About 2 acres have been enclofed with deep ditches and 
ftone walls. This fortification Hands 1400 feet above the

which diftinguifhed that gentleman in the whole of his 
naval purfuits, but efpecially where dangers and difficul- 
ties occurred, has been confpicuous in his land opera-'-

eftate, which, not many years ago, was purchafed at 
lOjOOol., has been raifed to the value of between 30,000!. 
and 40,0001. Sterling. Such an example as this, cannot 
be without its due effect in the country. And it is here 
mentioned, not only becaufe thefe improvements beauti- 
fy the profpecl:, and tend to the general good, but becaufe 
Captain Laird pofleffes one part of this parifh by an ex-

refolve to build, at their own expenfe, all the houfes ne- 
ceflary for the good accommodation of the people upon 
their eftates. And confidering that, by doing fo, they 
gain 2i per cent., they beautify the country, and augment 
the happinefs of thofe perfons by whofe indufcry and la- 
bour they enjoy eafe, affluence, and fplendour, it is not a 
little furprifmg, that the gentlemen have been fo long in- 
attentive to their own intereft, and the comfort of their 
fellow creatures. 

From the tenants of one eftate in this parifh, no incon- 
fiderable number of fervices and carriages are exacted ; 
which, while they profit not the landlord, bear hard upon 
the tenant, and are hoftile to all improvement in agricul- 
ture. There is, however, reafon to believe, that a tot;il 
abolition of this fpecies of flavery (the only thing meriting 
that odious name remaining in the country), will foon be 
accomplished : Already, much of it has been done away 
within thefe few years palt. It is true, thofe lands fub- 
jected to the greateft weight of fervices, are comparative- 
ly low rented. The condition of cottagers is not the 
moft comfortable. Happy would it be for this order of 
men, were they to hold of the landlord, and not of the 
tenant. Few tenants prove gentle mailers; </p></div>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17780269">FORGLEN</name>. 

(County of Banff, Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery 

of Turriff.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Robert Ballingall.</head>

Name. 

T HE name of the parim was formerly 'T Eutian, or 
St. Eunan, after the titular faint of that name, to 
whom the church or chapel had been dedicated. The 
common name now is Forglen, or Forcglen, to diftinguifh it 
from the neighbouring parim of Alvah, or Back Glen. For 
fome time, the two parifhes were joined, and fupplied by 
one paftor ; but, before the middle of laft century, Forglen 
became a feparate erection, and an annexation was made to 
it from the parim of Mamoch, comprehending the greater 
part of the eft-ate of Carnoufie. The annexation of both 
quoad facra ct civilia. At Burn-end, about half a mile to 
the W. of the prefent church, is to be feen the remains of 
a fmall chapel, probably the place of worfhip in Popifli 
times. For more conveniency, the church had afterwards 
been transferred to its prefent fituation. On a ftone budt

Of Forglen. 531 

Into the S. wall of it, is an infcription, in thefe terms : 
This church was re-edified by George Ogilvie, Mafifr of 
Banff, 1692. 

Situation and Extent.— Forglen lies on the N. fide of 
the river Diveron : it is bounded on the W. by the partfh 
of Marnoch, on the S. by Turriff, on the E. by Turriff 
and Alvah, and on the N. by Alvah. On the Sr. and E. 
fide the river is the boundary. Lord Banff's lands, how- 
ever, crofs it in two or three different places. He has a 
large alley oppofite his own houfe, on the Turriff fide ; 
another below the church, by the houfe of Muiriih, and 
a fmall part oppofite Boat of Muirifh. On the N. boun- 
dary, the part of the farm of Brownfide, Captain Hay's, 
called the Broadmyre, is in Forglen parifh, and the reft 
in Alvah. — The figure of the pariflr is an oblong, not 
far from regular \ only the N. E. angle is cut off by Al- 
vah. The length, from the church to the river fide, to- 
wards the S., is 3^ Englifh miles, and the breadth 2 I miles. 
It has a S. expofure, one of the bed in the country. The 
lands have a gradual flope, from the back parts of the pa- 
rim, to the river on the S. ; and there are no high hills to 
occafion any inconvenience of {hade, being gentle rifing 
grounds, affording a beautiful variety. 

Soil. — The foil, on haugh grounds, is fandy, but pro- 
duces very fine crops of grain, and very rich palture. The 
foil on braes and flats above them is richer, and yields the 
fineft crops of barley and oats. Having the river on two 
fides, which a&amp;s as a drain, and there being little mofs 
or marfhy ground in this parifh, the harveft is early, and 
the grain, in ordinary feafons, well filled and ripened. l£ 
is now cuftomary with merchants to buy oats and barley

by weight. The Banffshire firlot is 32 Scotch ftandard 
pints, and the medium of a boll of oats of faid meafure 
is 14 ftone Amfterdam weight ; of barley 18 ftone : bar- 
ley, however, is often much above that ; 19^ and even 20 
ftone : and oats often yield 8 ftone of meal, befides paying 
mill dues. 

Gultzvation. — The moft part of this parifh is arable, and 
has been, at one time or other, under the plough. The 
lands on the river fide have been, for fome time paft, in 
a ftate of improvement. The tenants, ftimulated by the 
example fet before them by the heritors, the late and pre- 
fent Lord Banff, and Captain Hay, when he refided at 
Carnoufie, in improving their mains, had made rapid pro- 
grefs in cultivation. And now the fame fpirit has caught 
fome young farmers, and even the old are ftirring, and 
extending the like improvements over the reft of the pa- 
rifh. In the remoteft parts of the parifh, we have now 
as good hufbandry, fields as well drefled, and as good 
grain, grafs, and turnip raifed, as on the river fide. The 
principal tenants have been in the practice of fowing tur- 
nip in broad-caft chiefly, for the fpace of 1 8 or 20 years ; 
and now the fmaller ones have each their proportion of 
them, and of fown grafs, which they find much for their 
profit, and is much in favour of the brute creation. — The 
mains, in the hands of the heritors, are of confiderable 
extent, and well improved. There are only two large 
farms in the parifh ; the farm of Old-Town of Carnoufie, 
of about iool. Sterling rent, and the farms of Kirktown 
and Eaftfide, prefently conjoined, of about 60I. : the reft, 
at a medium, rent from 20I. to 30I. There are a good 
many crofts for the accommodation of the fervants and 
labourers employed by the heritors.

In ploughing, the farmers foretimes life horfe ploughs, 
and fometimes oxen, according to the nature of the 
ground j and the cattle are now yoked with collars and 
traces, and trained to carts and wains. The breed of cattle 
and horfes is much improved of late; and alfo the fheep, 
of which there are feveral flocks of a larger fize, with finer 
wool, and giving double or triple price of the ordinary 
country breed. Wool is fold from feveral farms at 20 s. 
and 2 is. 4d. the (tone. 

The farmers now raife flax for their own ufe *. — Peafe, 
oats, and barley, are fown from the beginning of March 
to the end of May ; and harveft begins in Auguft, and 
terminates, in ordinary years, in September or beginning 
of Oftober. Harveft 1732, and feveral fince, have been 
much out of courfe •, and the laft (1793) as had as any f. 

Heritors. — The heritors of the parifh are, the Right 
Honourable William Lord Banff, Colonel Duff of Car- 

noufie, 

* They are but learners, however: they have not yet acquired the 
neceflary fkill, and not reckoning the crop eflential, they often lofe it, 
for want of a little attention to weeding and watering ; and to come to 
be difcouraged by their own neglect. A nrht or two extraordinary, in 
hot weather, will rot. it in the fteep. Care then fliould be taken of this, 
if it fliould lie a little longer on grifs. 

I The feed was late laid down, owing to a cold fpring. Rains in 
fummer kept it in the growing ftate, and extended it to an extraordinary 
length ; fo that it was, perhaps, the fulleft in appearance we ever faw ; 
but the rain continuing after the ordinary feafpn of harveft was come, pre- 
vented its ripening, and alfo lodged it. In the beginning of harveft this 
year, about the end of September and beginning of October, a confiderable 
part was got in in fafety, but rendered very light by lodging. The weather 
was good till the middle of October, but then the rains came back again, 
and fpoiled a great part of what remained in the field. Though ordi- 
narily earlier than our neighbours, the victual was not fully fecured in 
this parifh when D;cember was come. The fame was the cafe over all 
this quarter of the country.

Banff, who is patron, and Colonel Duff, refute in it. Co- 
lonel Duff's eftate of Carnoufie is a late purchafe from 
Captain Hay. 

Lord Banff's houfe is called Forglen, and ftands on the 
banks of the river Diveron, on the E. fide of the parifh •, 
a moft beautiful fituation. Here the river takes a fine 
circular fweep inwards, clofe upon the houfe ; fo as, (land- 
ing within, and looking out at the windows, to feem to 
run under it. The banks of the river, above and below, 
are covered with a variety of fine old wood, of a large 
fize ; confining of afhes, elms, planes, limes, larixes, and 
beeches. The ground rifes gradually from the river fide, 
and forms a concentric circular hill in the front of the 
houfe. The top of the hill is planted, which Ihuts the fields 
and houfes below finely in, and fcreens them from the 
winds and dorms. In the centre, on the fide of the hill, 
lies the mains of Forglen. The fields are divided with 
ditches and hedges, and furrounded with belts of plantation 
in a thriving ftate. Without thefe fields, on the N. and 
S., are accommodated, with neat houfes and convenient 
crofts, all his Lordlhip's people ; grieve, gardener, and 
farm fervants, wright and fmith, and labourers, with their 
families. Thefe perform his Lordfhip's work, and have 
their reward, without burdening the tenants at all. — There 
are 500 or 600 acres, or upwards, of plantation upon the 
eftate, moftly executed by the late Lord Banff, to which 
confiderabie additions have been made by the prefent 
Lord ; all in a thriving condition. His Lordfliip has done 
much of late to beautify his feat. The workmen were 
forry to put the firfb hand to change fome of the improve- 
ments of his father, which they thought well enough, and 
to undo their own workmanfhip ; but the execution pleat-

They found this was the order of Providence.— While 
they were executing thefe improvements, they were earn- 
ing their own and their families bread by them. Sorry, 
forry were their hearts when his Lordfhip was called a- 
way to the wars. Earneft is their prayer for peace, that 
he may return to them again. 

On the front of the houfe, over the entry, is a coat of 
arms, and above it this fentence : Houp of reward caufts 
guld fervice. Underneath, there is this infcription : " Do 
« veil, And doubt nocht, althoch Thou be fpyit. He is 
" lytil guid vorth that is nocht invyit. Tak thou no Tent 
" qvhat everi man tellis. Gyve you wald leive on demit, 
« Gang qvhair na man dwellis." The date below, or age 
of the houfe, or year of building, is 1578. 

Colonel Duff's houfe, Carnoufie, Hands upon a rifing 
ground, about an Englifh mile and a half W. from the 
church, not very diftant from the river, but not in fight 
of it. There are feveral confiderable plantations upon this 
eft ate, and a good deal of natural wood by the river fide. 
The Colonel is prefently enclofing his mains. There are 
no good quarries in the parilh ; they are obliged then to 
ufe fuch furface ftones as they can find ; and yet with 
thefe, they make the molt beautiful work of dry ftone 
fence I ever faw. The ftones are all courfed ; and the 
mafons fay, they make as much work that way as the 
other, when their hand is in ufe ; but it requires to be 
bred to it, as ordinary workmen cannot do it.

falmon ; and both heritors have nlhings on it. Lord

Banff has about 3 T Englifh miles of the river, and Colonel 
Duff only one. The fift, .however, are fmall, and the fifh- 
ings inconfiderable. It is only when there happens a 
high water on Sunday, when the cruives are open, that 
there is a chance of a run. At other times, the fifliings 
below are plied fo clofe, that few can efcape. 

There are three mills in the parifh : Mill of Pvibra, 
Lord Banff's ; and Mill of Bum-end and Mill of Car- 
noufie, Colonel Duff's. 

Rent, Stipend, and Accommodations. — The valued rent of 
the parifh is about 1700I. Scotch.— The ftipend is 42 
bolls of meal and 6 bolls of bear, and 45 1. Sterling in 

money, befides 2I. ros. for communion elements. The 

manfe was built in 1683. Tn e prefent. incumbent has 
had his barn, kiln, liable, and byre renewed ; and is 
getting the wings of the manfe repaired, with the addi- 
tion of a kitchen and childrens room in one of them, die 
houfe being fmall.— The glebe is good land, but is only a 
few falls more than legal meafure. For pafture, the mi- 
nifter has a den adjoining to the glebe, and a fmall field 
on the banks of Diveron, annexed in 1 75 1, by decreet of 
the prefbytery, to make the pafture fufficient. He has 
prefently no accommodation of mofs ; the mofs on which 
he had a locality being exhauflxd, and no new one yet 
fettled for him. There is indeed but little mofs in die 
parifh. 

Population. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the' 
population in 1755 was 607. The lift of parifhioners 
varies from accidental caufcs, by the refidence or non*- 
refidence of the heritors and their families. The popula- 
tion has increafed of late, by the divifion of fome tacks 
and fubfets on a large farm* In 1782, die number of

fouls was 577. The lift at this time was exaftly taken. 
Whether the following year's lift was equally exaft, I 
know not, but find it fet down at 544. This being a 
year of particular fcarcity of meal, perhaps the difference 
of 33 is to be accounted for by fewer fervants being en- 
gaged by the fmaller tenants and tradefmen, and by al- 
lowing their own children to go forth to fervice. The 
year following it is up again at 573, and continues abouft 
that till 1788, when I find 613 ; and fince that time, it 
has been about 600. The medium of fouls then of thefe-

Funds of the Poor.— Though the funded money doe* 
not amount to a large fum, only 65 1. Sterling, yet the 
poor in this parifh are as well fupplied as in molt other 
parifhes, owing to the liberality of the people them felves, 
and the diftinguilhed charity of the heritors. The For- 
glcn family being refident, and giving regular attendance 
upon the ordinances, have afforded a continual fupply to 
the poor and the fick. And Colonel Duff, when abroad 
in India, appointed a very handfome fum, in place of Sun- 
day collection. The intereft of 65 1., then in Lord Banff's 
and Captain Hay's hands, at 5 per cent., with the ordi- 
nary and facramental collections, and produce of mort- 
cloth, goes to the fupply of the poor. A meeting is held 
at the manfe annually, of the heritors, minifter, and el- 
ders, in the end of the year, to confider the ftate of the 
poor, and appoint fupplies for them. Blankets, clothes, 
Ihoes, and other neceffaries, are purchafed for them, a* 
they need. A fupply of Tneal is appointed for the year, 
and diftributed in equal proportions of their quantity 
monthly. One of the elders, in the centre of the parifh, 
takes charge of the diftribution. By this means, the poor 
are kept from wandering, there not being one belonging 
to the parifh that goes out of it. In times of fcarcity, up- 
on application of the feffion, the heritors genereufly af- 
forded the meal at the eafy rate of 10 s. fhe boll, over 
and above their other charities. At other times, 2 mem- 
bers of the feffion, Peter Mearfon in Eaftfide, and Wil- 
liam Robertfon in Mill of Ribra, refpe£lable men, and 
men of fubftance, furnifhed it, and afforded it alfo at 
eafy rates. This was a great faving to the fund. Keep- 
ing the poor thus comfortable within their own houfes, 
would be one happy mean to leffen iniquity, by prevent- 
ing vagrants, thieves, and pickpockets, from going about

fcncJer pretence of begging, and fave many from an un- 
timely end. No one would grudge the real indigent their 
fupply; but fo many impofitions and thefts are intole- 
rable in a land that has any regulation. In 1783, this 
parifh received 13* bolls of the government meal. 

Mortification in favour of the Mhiifter. — There is a mor- 
tification in behalf of the minifter, of 10I. Sterling, which 
Jies in his hands, free of intereft, and is transferred to the 
fucceflbr at entry. This is faid to be made by one of the 
Earls of Buchan, who had property in this parifh, in tef- 
timony of the minifter's hofpitality, which had much, 
pleafed him, upon honouring him with a vifit. 

Mortification in favour of the Schoolmafier. — The Reve- 
rend Mr. George Bruce, minifter of Dunbar, has, within 
thefe two years, mortified iool. Sterling in behalf of the 
fchoolmafter, through an attachment to the parifh, he 
himfelf having taught the fchool here in his younger days. 
He has required the fchoolmafter to be eftablifhed, and to 
be put in pofieffion of at leaft 100 merks of falary ; and 
the heritors, to concur with him, have made it 200 merks. 
He requires, as a condition of tenure, that the fchoolmaf- 
ter mall read portions of fcripture to the congregation, 
betwixt the fecond and third bells. In cafe of neglect, 
the mortification to be transferred to Rothiemay, Mr. 
Bruce's native parifh. Lord Banff, as patron, and Colonel 
Duff, as next greateft heritor, and the minifter, and their 
fucceflors, are appointed truftees for the management. 
And the reverend prefbytery of Turriff are requefted by 
the donor to infpecl: the application, with power to quef- 
tion any abufe ; and a copy of the deed of mortification i* 
mferted in their records. 



Statijlical Account 



Lord Banff and Colonel Duff have taken the iool. Ster- 
ling betwixt them, 50I. each, and bound themfelves to 
pay the interefl annually to the fchoolm after, Mr. Mori- 
fon, and his fucceflbrs in office, at the rate of 5 per cent. 

Mr. Bruce has become a rich man. How honourable 
to himfelf is fuch teftimony of his gratitude to God, who 
hath bleffed him with profperity ! How beneficial to fo- 
ciety is fuch benevolence ! There is no clafs of men more 
ufeful than fchoolmafters, when attentive to their dutv. 
and few worfe provided. Their falaries are fmall, their 
perquifites in fmall parifhes, inconfiderable, and their pay- 
ments, by the poor, not very punctual. The fchoolmafter 
here, however, from having one of the fmalleft, will now 
have as good a fixed income as raoft of his neighbours ia 
the country fchools. 

Mortification in behalf of the Poor.— George Gerard, Efq t 
of Midftrath, late factor to Lord Banff, through attach- 
ment to the parifh, in which he has long refided, and 
from pious motives, prefently pays the fchool fees through- 
out the year of four of the prefent fcholars, to enable 
them to read the Bible, and to write their name ; and in- 
tends mortifying a fum fufficient to make the payment 
perpetual. 

Character and Manners of the People.— -The people, ex- 
cepting two or three of the Scottifh Epifcopal congrega- 
tion at Turriff, are all of the Eftablifhed Church. There 
is no Catholick nor Seceder in the parifh. They are fo- 
ber and induftrious, and difcreet in their behaviour ; re- 
fpeftful to their matters and fuperiors, and kind to their 
Biinifter \ and give regular attendance to the ordinances^

now fee by experience the advantage of medical (kill, and 
more readily apply to the doaor than formerly in time of

There are happy and unhappy days for beginning any undertaking.. 
Thus, few would choofe to be married here on Friday, though it is the

of labour, and tradefmen's rates, are rather' too much raif- 
ed againft the country man, and moil of all among the 
farm fervants. 



Price of Labour. —The price of labour is much aug- 
mented of late. A farmer's fervant, though but an ordi- 
nary one, draws 7I., and fome 81., inflead of 5 1., a fevr 
years back. Womens wages were long ftationary at 2 1., 
but are now up to 2I. 10 s. f Day-labourers receive from* 
5d. to 8d. a-day, and victuals. Harveft wages are very 
high : women rl. Sterling, and men il. 10 s., and above. 
In hurried times, fome have had the confeience to alls 
2l. $. 

Rates of Prov'fims. — Butcher meat is raifed, in the 
Jpace of a few years, from 2*d. to 3 id. and 4d. the lb. j 
butter from 6d. to 8d. the lb. j cheefe from 3 s. 4d. to

* The farmer is defigncd by the name of his farm, as the matter is. 
by his eftate. The goodwife is rciftrefs; and yet the hufband modeftiy 
declines the compliment. When you a Ik for the goodwife, by the nam* 
of miftrefs, his return is, I thank you, my wife is well. 

f Not, however, in proportion to the men. The men can more eafily 
a-emove to a diftance : and with them indeed now, all is a mercantile or 
Touping fpirit ; the higheft bidder, though a ftranger, is preferred to a 
good old mafter, who would willingly retain his fervant. But there is 
now little gratitude, or attachment with thefe perfons, and no room left 
for their matter's generality and companion, in cafe of ficknei's or fettle- 
ment.

fities. Two fmall wells, one in the wood of Carnoufie, 
and another on the N. fide of the mofs of Whitefield, call- 
ed the Red-gill Well, are medicinal, and ufed by the 
•neighbours. The one by the mofs is a pretty ftrong 
chalybeate, iron mineral •, if a little attention was paid to 
it, it might be of ufe to the neighbourhood : the water is 
faid to be as ftrong as fome of thofe reforted to. There 
is a Druidical temple in the heart of the woods of For- 
glen, but {hut up thereby from view, till the wood grows 
up, and becomes penetrable. The tenants are in danger 
of lofmg their beafts in them fometimes. And the deer, 
either chafed from the herd in the Highland forefts, or 
pinched with hunger in fevere winters, come fome of* 
them down as far as this, and are feen to pafture with 
the cattle on the fide of the woods. Thefe woods abound 
with foxes for fport, for the fupply of the Turriff hunts ; 
but they frequently make fad depredations among the 
poultry around.

chan, who were proprietors here : it is now moftly 'drain- 
ed up. There is a know, called the Rmtnie Law, where 
formerly markets were held, on the fide of the wood of 
Forglen, a little N. of the church ; but none are held now. 
The privilege was probably transferred to Turriff, where 
are now the beft cattle markets in the country. 

The cattle on the water fide, by richnefs of the pafture, 
are of a large fize •, one tenant in Eaftfide, had a plough 
of 8 oxen, which would, in moft feafons, have been good 
beef from the yoke, and would have weighed from 50 to 
.70 (tone, at an average ; and if full fed, from 70 to 90 ; 
and fome feemed fize enough to carry 100. Now how- 
ever, as more profitable, farmers change oftener, and dif- 
pofe of them when young. The fleeces of {heep, I am 
informed, extend to 5 lb. Engiifh weight. They {hear 
.the lambs, weighing 42 ounces. 

We have marked weights for oats, at the medium of 14 
ftone j barley 1 8 ; but thefe are the loweft mediums. I 
am informed, there have been oats as high as 16, and 
have had from 19 to 20 ftone of barley, at the end of the 
feed time, when the victual was clean and dry. This 
parifli ufed formerly to be fupplied with lime, manufac- 
tured at Banff, at 9 d. the boll, of 2 firlots flacked. They 
are now fupplied with fhells from Sunderland, at 3 s. the 
boll, of 4 firlots ; both from Banffshire, diftant 10 Engiifh 
miles. This, when ufed as a manure, is laid on at the 
quantity of from 80 to 160 firlots the acre. Some part 
of it is brought from Streifa, Edingight's land, in the pa- 
rifh of Grange ; and a fmall quantity is burnt in the parifli, 
with peats. The Hones are brought from Whitehills quarry, 
on Lord Findlater's eftate, in the parifh of Boyndic. But 
this is very expenfive now, and little ufed, by reafofl of 
the fcarcity of peats. What is burnt with peats, muft be

Peat fuel is very expenfive, by reafon of the wafte of

well how to make ufe of Mr. Dundas's bleffing, as they 
find the coal does not anfwer fo well on the hearth. They 
are at length beginning to get fmall grates for their cham- 
ber fires; and they will next fee it convenient to have 
grates for their kitchen fires alfo. The relieving of this 
quarter of "the kingdom from the tax upon coals, is cer- 
tainly a great benefit to the country at large, and a fpe- 
cial bleffing to the poor, of which the clergy know their 
people to be very fenfible : they feel the obligation •, they 
received the news with joy : and, if collected in a body, 
they would have been as forward to. have borne publick 
teftimony to the efFec~tual endeavours of the Honourable 
Secretary, Mr. Dundas, as any fociety. They, indeed, 
deferve of their governors whatever can be done for them ; 
for they are fteady friends of Government. It does one's 
heart good to fee their loyalty ; while the clergy, in every 
corner of the church, have manifefled their fentiments in 
favour of Government. The people here, of every de- 
fcription, are in unifon with their teachers. There are 
no murmurers here : No evil men feeking only rebellion. 
" The King and the Conftitution," or, " The King, his 
Family, and Friends," are the toafhs in the lefler, as well 
as in the greater circles. They pay the taxes without 
murmuring and when a juft and neceflary war impofes 
an addition, they do not grudge it. They bear the taxes, 
and they alfo go out readily, and in numbers, to fupply 
the fleets and armies, and fight the battles of their coun-

Situation, Origin of the Name, &amp;C 

J INLITHGOW lies 16 miles from Edinburgh, and 
gives its name to the weftern divifion of Lothian, 
of which it is the chief town. It ranks the fixth among 
the Scotch boroughs, and belongs to the diftrict in which 
Lanark, Selkirk, and Peebles, are included : it is alfo the

* Few parifhes in Scotland would afford more ample and interefting 
materials for a ftatiftical report, than that of Linlithgow. '' The author 
of this, from recent admiflion to his charge, and other circumftances, 
has not been able to attain that degree of information which would 
qualify one to do juflicc to a fubjedt fo complicated and extenfive. As, 
however, the work, which has occupied many of his brethren, honour- 
ably for themfelves and ufcfully to the publick, now draws to a dole, 
he thinks himfelf bound, even under that difadvantage, to flate fome 
particulars, which may lead afterwards to a more full and accurate in- 
vestigation.

to be the fame with the Lindum mentioned by Ptolemy ; 
and the Romans are fuppofed to have had a military fla- 
tion on the fpot, where the palace was afterwards e- 
refted *. 

Defcription of the town, Sec—The town confifts of one 
ftreet, about three quarters of a mile in length, with fe- 
veral lanes, and a range of gardens on the N. and S. 
Oppofite to the town-h'oufe is a vacant fpace, where 
the crofs formerly ftood, and the principal well {till 
is. The ftreet, towards the E., is broad and airy; a- 
bout the middle, contracted and gloomy : as one goes 
weftward, it again enlarges itfelf. Many of the houfes 
have, it muft be owned, a mean afpeft, and exhibit ftrik- 
ing fymptoms of decay. Several, however, have lately 
, been rebuilt, and other operations of a fimilar kind are 
now going forward ; fo that, in procefs of time, the whole 
may be expected to afTume a modern and more elegant 
appearance. Linlithgow abounds with excellent fprings : 

To 

* This opinion is favoured by the natural advantages of the place, 
efpecially its plentiful fupplies of water, and its vicinity to the frith of 
Forth, from which ftores of every kind could eafily be conveyed. As lin 
fignifies a loch, and that, on the fide of which the town ftands, forms a 
fbiking object, the reference of the firft part of the name may be eafily 
difcerned. The etymology of the latter is doubtful. It has been chiefly 
traced to the Erfe language, in which gow expreffes a dog, and litb a 
tivig ; and fuppofed to allude to a black bitch, which, according to tra- 
dition, was found fattened to a tree in the fmall ifland on the E. fide of 
the loch. This conjecture derives plaufibility from the well known fi- 
gure on the town's feal, though no fatisfaflory account can be given 
how that animal came there, or fliould be fo far dignified as to form a 
part of its armorial bearing. A gentleman of ingenuity and refearch, 
has lately deduced the name of Linlithgow from the Saxon, in whicli 
litb fignifies fnug, clofe, and gow, a vale or bolloii: According to this 
interpretation, the name precifely marks the place as fituated on the fid* 
of a loch, 'in a well ficltercd vale.

STo that circumftance, concurring with the elevated fixa- 
tion of the grounds, which form two ridges on the N. and 
S., thus producing a current of frefh air in the direction 
of E. and W., may probably be aicribed the good health 
which the inhabitants in general enjoy, and the longevity 
many of them are found to attain. This place is diftin- 
guifhed by a variety of objcas, which cannot fail to im- 
prefs an attentive obferver, and give him a {hiking idea 
of its ancient grandeur. Among thefe, are chiefly to be 
remarked, the magnificent ruins of its palace •, the vener- 
able fabrick deftined for religious worlhip, and fituated 
fo near the other, as to form almoft a part of it ; the 
grand terrace on which both are erected ; the beautiful 
lake on the N., which covers an extent of 80 acres •, the 
lofty trees, which feem coeval with the facred and royal 
piles they adorn on the E. ; and the beautiful plantations 
interfperfed with pafture ground. Few places, indeed, 
would afford a finer fubjecl for the pencil. Even the old 
houfes have their effect on a contemplative mind. As 
many of thefe, during the Royal refidence at Linlithgow, 
belonged to perfons of the firft rank, they mark the fim- 
plicity of former times^ contracted with the luxury of the 
prefent ; and by their decayed condition, mow the natural 
tendency of all human things. 

The river Avon bounds the parifh on the W., and di- 
vides this county from that of Stirling. Its courfe mud 
have altered near the bridge, as a houfe and field, now on 
the oppofite fide, belong to the parifh and (hire 'of Lin- 
lithgow. The mean extent of the parifh, from E. to W., 
is 5 miles; from N. to S. 3. It is fuppofed to contain 
7600 Scotch acres. The average rent of the whole parifh 
may be estimated at 18 s. 4d. the acre.

*Hfa is hilly, and more fit for grazing than tillage. The 
foil there is generally wet-bottomed and ftiff, and the har- 
veft later. The N. W. and E. parts are moftly arable : 
the greateft proportion of thefe have a light free foil ■ but 
towards the S. and E., a pretty ftrong clay. The parilh 
m general is well cultivated, and almoft the whole of it 
enclofed and divided with ftrfpes of plantation. Thefe 
improvements have been chiefly made within the lafl 30 
years. Several gentlemen in the parifh have diftinguiflied 
themfeives in the agricultural line. None laboured in this 
more affiduoufly, or with greater fuccefs, than the late 
Mr. Johnfton of Straiton. The effeds of his attention 
are vifible, not only on his own cftate, which now a- 
mounts in value to about a feventh of the parifh, but the 
property of another gentleman rented by him, and capable 
of being let again to great advantage. The roads through 
the parifh, in all diredions, are good ; thus opening an 
extenfive communication, and conducing effeaually to the 
publick benefit. The ground on the S. rifes gradually to 
a confiderable height, and is diftinguiflied by three emi- 
nences. That on the W. is the higheft, and bears the 
name of Cockier ue. It rifes 500 feet above the level of 
the fea. The eminence on the E. is well known by the 
appellation of Binriy-craig, and was, in times of ignorance, 
confidered as a favourite haunt of Fairies. The high 
grounds, in the middle, take their name from the fmall 
village of Riccarton, which lies at the foot of them. 

The rotation of crops varies according to the foil. On 
breaking up the lands, they generally take firft oats, then 
a green crop, afterwards barley, and grafs fucceeds. In 
the fouthern parts of the parifh, oats, peafe, barley, and 
hay, are chiefly the crops in fucceffion ; though in fome 
places they fummer fallow for wheat. The lands there 



arc

are, often allowed to run into natural grafs. The lower 
part of the parifh is found to produce good crops of hay, 
and early and rich pafture, which are chiefly applied to 
fattening cattle for the Edinburgh and Glafgow markets •, 
that being found more profitable than rearing young ones. 
As moft of the farmers keep only a few cows, the dairy 
cannot be reckoned a principal objea. Of late, turnips 
and cabbage have been introduced into the rotation of 
crops with fuccefs. They are generally employed in fat- 
tening bullocks for the markets above mentioned : fome- 
times ufed alfo for feeding fheep, and carried with that 
view into an adjacent field. Several acres, on the N. of 
the town, are let for this purpofe, at 5I. each. One 
farmer, in the eaftern extremity of the parifh, fattens an- 
nually about 50 black cattle, and generally difpofes of 
them early in the fpring. Another, near the town, has 
at prefent 40 in the ftall ; and a third, 30. There are 
feveral pretty large farms in the parifh. One grazier rents 
ground to the extent of 700I. a-year in this parifh, and 
400I. more in two of the adjoining. — Potatoes are much 
cultivated, efpecially in the neighbourhood of the town. 
Though there be a lint-mill in the parifh, very little flax 
is raifed. 

Lime is often applied to fummer fallow for wheat and 
barley. There is an excellent feam of lime-flone in the 
parifh, which is fold at is. 6d. the boll of Linlithgow 
barley meafure, or 3 d. the Winchefter bufhel. There is 
good fhell marl in the loch ; and r fome years ago, confi- 
derable quantities were dragged from it ; but this is now 
given up, as marl is thought to have little efFecl: on 
grounds that have been previoufly limed ; which is general- 
ly the cafe in this parifh. — The inhabitants are chiefly fup-

Many of thefe have little pafture, and are fed with grain, 
or boded meat-Stable dung is fold at 2S . the double 
horfe cart ; cow dung at is. 6d. ; and ames at is. 

From the number of breweries and diftilleries, the con- 
fumption of barley is very confiderable ; far exceeding the 
quantity raifed in the parifli. 

Trade and Manufactures. —Though Linlithgow has not 
that appearance, a good deal of bufinefs is tranfafted in 
it.— .The people in general are fober and induftrious, ply- 
ing their occupations chiefly within doors, or on the fide 
of the loch. The manufadure of leather is the mod 
extenfive and advantageous carried on here. There are 
employed in it 17 tanners, 18 curriers, and 13 tawers -, 
amounting in all to 48. The annexed table, which is 
warranted as genuine, will give a jufter idea of this branch 
than any other defcription.

The art of tanning is faid to have been imperfectly 
known here till fome of Cromwell's foldiers both inffcru&amp;s» 
ed others, and plied it themfelves. 

Shoemaking forms a chief branch of the trade here. It 
employs about 100 perfons j and the number of pairs made 
annually is computed at 24,000. Confiderable quantities 
were formerly exported to America. Though the demand 
has now failed, the fhoemakers have, in general, a ready 
fale, and at times, pretty large commiffions. Some of the 
charitable foundations in Edinburgh are fupplied from this 
place with (hoes. They are now (December 1793) mak- 
ing 700 pairs, intended by the Earl of Hopetoun as a gift 
to the foldiers of his regiment. This benefaction is truly 
noble and judicious, ferving to encourage trade, when 
lefs brilk, and affording a frefh difplay of amiable atten- 
tion to the inferior part of the community. Similar ex* 
ertions, by men of rank and opulence,' would make the 
benefits of that inequality, without which fociety cannot 
fubfift, {till more fenfibly felt, and tend more effectually 
than any other arguments, to explode the rcafoning, and 
counteract the efforts of defigning men. 

Wool is another ftaple commodity here. Three perfons 
from this town go annually into Northumberland, and 
purchafe a confiderable quantity. Part of this is fhort, 
and grows upon the Cheviot hills. This is either fold in 
fmall quantities to fiich as make cloth of it chiefly for 
their own ufe, or in packs to thofe, who retail it. But the 
greateft part of the wool brought here is long, and fit for 
combing. This part of the procefs was introduced by 
workmen from England ; but all the people now employ- 
ed in it, amounting to 24, are fixed inhabitants of the 
town. The quantity of wool brought to Linlithgow is 
much the fame as for many years paft •, for though the

fale of the Ihort be diminifhed, from the country people 
having got more into the cuftom of buying cloth, that 
deficiency is fupplied by an increafed demand for the 
combed ; as manufacturers find it more for their interefl 
to purchafe this article, than order it as formerly from 
Darlington and other towns in England. The manufac- 
ture of wool can hardly be faid to be carried further in 
this place, though the water of the loch, from its peculiar 
foftnefs, is well fitted for that, or any other in which foap 
is ufed. There is, however, i carpet-weaver, and 23 
flocking frames. Of thefe, 10 are employed by a com- 
pany at Glafgow. One (locking-weaver has 6 frames con- 
ftantly at work, and produced laft year 2220 pairs *. 

Two tambour factories were lately erected here. The 
one employs 36 girls, who are bound for three years, and 
have is. 6d. a-week the firft year, 2s. the fecond, and 
2S. 64. the third. At the other, 50 are engaged for the 
fame time, who receive each 2d. more a-week. The

ticles from .'broad at zo oool. a-year. There was at that time, alfo a great 
linen market here. The decline of this trade has been occafioned chiefly 
by the introdudHon of cotton. The manufacTurers alfo of London and 
Manchefh r, who were often fupplied from this place, now import thefe 
articles dir illy from the continent. The manufacture of thread was 
early introduced to thii place, ard enrried on with fuccefs.; but th- de- 
r.i. nd is now trifling, and the number of mills reduced to four. Beau-

are now applied to diaper. Six looms are eniploj td~in the niullin branch- ;

this kind is the more laudable and requifite, as the educa- 
tion of the lower clafles is unhappily neglected ; and 
though other circumftances may concur to increafe the 
depravity of the times, it certainly originates in the want 
of thefe early impreffions of God and a future Hate, which 
only can effectually bind the confcience, and regulate the 
life # . 

Prhitfield. — In 1786, the calico-printing bufincfs was 
begun upon the river Avon, about a mile W. from the 
town, and carried on to a confiderable extent, till towards 
the clofe of the year 1792. The number of perfons then 
employed in it was 200 ; but they are now reduced one 
half. The prefent director was formerly engaged in fome 
of the extenfive operations on the banks of the Leven, 
and pleafes himfelf with the idea of the fpeedy revival of 
this and other branches of trade. 

The bleachfield, which bears the name of the town, 
though -now removed at a confiderable diftance from it, 
lies alfo on the fide of the Avon. Part of the machinery, 
which is faid to be of a new and improved conftru&amp;ion, 
is in the county of Stirling, feparated from the field only 
by the river. Mr. Reed, the conduftor of this work, in- 
vented the watering machine, which is found fo ufeful in 
the weft country ; and aifo contrived a new fpecies of 
pump, lefs fubjed to friccion than the common one. He

Near the machinery employed for the bleaching, is a 
flint mill, under the diredion of the fame perfon. The 
rough materials are brought chiefly from Gravefend, and 
when ground fent partly to Glafgow. Some of them are 
exported to Ireland, and the reft ufed as a fupply for his 
own pottery at Weftpans in Eaft Lothian. 

Among the articles of trade here, fnufF muft not be 
omitted, as the perfons who manufacture it refide in the 
town, though the mill ttoey ufe be in the parifh of Muir- 
avonfide. They flill carry on the bufmefs to a considerable 
extent, though the demand is not fo great as formerly. 

Breweries and Dijlilkries. — There are three breweries in 
town, for porter, ale, and fmall beer. The malt liquor 
produced here may vie with any in Scotland, and has a 
very extenfive circulation. The brewers are all reftrifted, 
to the borough mill, and complain of the heavy multures, 
which is a fixteenth part. — There were lately four distil- 
leries in the pariih. One very confiderable, is removed 
to the next parifh, on the E. ; but fome of the previous 
operations are {till carried on at Broad-law, in the S. of 
this pariih. Another, near the town, has been disconti- 
nued tliis year, but will foon be refumed. The quantity 
diftilled here is very great. The manufacture at Bonny- 
ton employs 24 men all the year, 3 female labourers, and 
3 female houfe fervants. From 150 to 1 80 black cattle 
are fed there annually : Of thefe, generally 100 are at the 
flail at one time. 

Bakers. — There are feveral in Linlithgow, who not on-» 
ly fupply the inhabitants of k' but the country around. 
The bread is remarkable both for its' fine colour and del^

jlfi/Zj.— There are four corn mills in the parrfh, befides 
thofe belonging to the burgh, which were lately built on 
the belt conitruftion for manufafturing all forts of grain. 
Alexander II. had bellowed the mills of Linlithgow, with 
all their pertinents, on the priory of Manuel, of which the 
remains are {till to be feen on the oppofite fide of the 
liver. Thefe, in 1586, were granted to the town by 
Lady Jane Livihgfton, priorefs of that convent, on con- 
dition of their paying annually 20 merks Scotch. That 
grant was renewed after the reformation by James VI., 
and other privileges conferred, by a charter of novoda- 
mus in 1592. 

Particulars as to the Borough. — Though the time when 
Linlithgow became a royal borough cannot be ascertained, 
it certainly exifted in that capacity as early as David I. ; 
for during his reign, it was, by r,£t of parliament, consti- 
tuted one of the principal burghs of the kingdom # . 

Linlithgow was formerly a place of confiderable trade, 
opulence, and fplendour ; but, from the union of the 
crowns, efpecially after the junction of the kingdoms, it 
declined in all thefe refpeds. It once had an exclufive

deed of fubmiffion to Edward I., in 129a; which contains the names of 
John Rabuck and John de Mar, who are exprefsly defigned, Baillivi 
burgi de Linlytgiiv. The number of bailies was afterwards increafed ; 
but there was no provoft till 1540, when James V. empowered them, by 
a charter under the great feal, to elecT: Frepof t tum Burgi. Befides the 
rrovoft and four bailies, the council is now compofed of a dean of guild,

the _Avon ; and Blacknefs was fpecially affigned as its port. 
Veflels with foreign commodities frequently arrived there j 
and thefe again exported the productions of the town and 
country around. Warehoufes were erected at Blacknefs 
fome of which ftill remain ; and the officers of the re- 
venue had a ftation there. Through the influence of the 
fannly of Hamilton, the cuftomhoufe was, about the end 
of laft century, transferred to Borrowftounnefs. 
_ The town of Linlithgow ftrenuoufly oppofed the erec- 
tion of Queensferry into a burgh ; but the matter was at 
laft compromifed on the following terms : That the latter 
ftould pay the former the annual fum of i 0 merks Scotch; 
That the freemen of this borough mould enjoy all the im- 
munities of Queensferry without reciprocation : That on 
the arrival of any foreign fhip, before it was unloaded, the 
magiftrates there mould inform the dean of guild here ; 
fo that within 24 hours, the burgeffcs might, if they pleaf- 
ed, purchafe half the cargo, timber only excepted. The

there are repeated inftances in the council books of inti- 
mation made, according to the original contract. 

By a£t, of parliament, the Linlithgow firlot is the Hand- 
ard for dry meafure, as the Stirling jug is for liquid. The 
firlot, by which oats and barley are meafured, contains 3 1 
Scotch pints : That ufed with regard to wheat and peafe, 
is limited to 21. After the Union, by order of Queen 
Anne, feveral Winchefter bufhels of brafs were fent to 
Linlithgow to be diftributed among the other boroughs. 
As, however, they did not all apply, fome of them {till 
remain in the town-houfe. That attempt failed, like o- 
thers fince made to introduce an equality of weights and 
meafures. — The town, by repeated grants, have a right of 
levying cuftom for all cattle that pafs the bridge, or any 
part of the Avon. The eftabliflied rate for a fcore of 
nolt is about 13d. ; for a fcore of fwine not lefs than 4s, 
5d. The revenue of the town, which arifes chiefly from 
the mills and cuftoms, amounts to about 400 1. a-year *.

* The maturates and other members of the town 'council, with the 
corporations and fraternities, make an annual proctfiion on horfeback, 
in the month of June. This is termed, Riding thtir marches. Two fland- 
ard?, with the town arms painted on. white 01k, are born on that occa- 
fion, by the treafurcr and deacon convener of the trades. They go firft 
to Linlithgow bridge, and afterwards to Blackncfs, where a cold collation 
is provided. They return in the fame form ; and, dividing themfelves

F/efj-Marfot.—Thk is well fupplied with the various 
articles in that line. The meat was formerly ranged on 
moveable flails, at the crofs •, but is now more convenient- 
ly difpofed, in a place furrounded with high walls, and 
defended from the injuries of the weather. 

The weekly market was anciently held on Saturday, but 
is now transferred to Friday. There are 6 fairs in the 
year. The chief of thefe is St. Magdalene's, on the 2d 
of Auguft. The fairs here are not fo much frequented 
as formerly. They were indeed once reforted to from 
all parts of Scotland, and continued for feveral days. 

The rate of living is as high here as in the capital. 
The price of beef and mutton often rifes beyond it. Veal 
and pork may fomctimes be had cheaper than in that 
market. Poultry of all kinds are not only dear, but 
fcarce. This arifes in part from the increafed demand of 
the neighbouring city ; and ftill more from the diminu- 
tion of cottagers, who furnifhed plentiful fupplies of that 
and many other articles connected with houfe-keeping. 

JFi/b. — The loch produces eels, pike, and perch, in their 
refpe&amp;ive feafons, though thefe are now faid to have de- 
creafed. Confiderable quantities of eels are collared here, 
and fent in that ftate not only to different parts of this 
kingdom, but as far as London. Trouts are alfo to be 
had in the river Avon. 

Minerals. — Coals are the only fuel ufed either in the 
town or country parifh. They are chiefly brought from 
Borrowftounnefs and Grange collieries, and the E. part of 

Stirlingfhire.

Stlrlingfhire. Several of the inhabitants of the town are 
conftantly employed in driving coals. The carts they ufe 
are of the fingle kind chiefly. The price of this article 
has rifen confiderably of late. This arifes partly from an 
increafe of the original charge, and partly from an addi- 
tional demand for driving. The firft has been raifed 2d, 
the load, the other from 2 s. 8d. to 3 s. 5d. the fingle cart. 
That there are mines of coal in the parifh, cannot be 
doubted. Some recollect thefe brought' both from Bon- 
fide and Bonnyton, on the N. E. of the town. The bo- 
rough muir, the lands belonging to the kirk-fefTion and 
guildry, are believed to contain coal ; and as thefe places 
lie near the town, a fupply from them would be of fignal 
advantage. Early in this century, one Peck took a leafe 
of the burrowmuir, engaging, in the event of fuccefs, to 
pay iool. annually, and furnifh the inhabitants of the 
town with coal at 3 d. the. load. Though he failed in the 
attempt, either from want of Ikill or perfeverance, abili- 
ties and exertion employed there, or upon the feflion and 
guildry grounds would, in all probability, conduce both to 
the benefit of the adventurer and the good of the publick. 
There is alfo coal on Mr. Stewart of Binny's eftate, which, 
with a mixture of the large kind, produced excellent fires, 
though it has not been wrought for feveral years. The 
lime-ftone, in the S. of the parifh, is well known, and 
univerfally allowed to be good. Free-ftone is fcarce. The 
quarries lie at a diftance from the town, and are little ufed 
at prefent. 

In the fouthern extremity of the parifh is a filver mine, 
faid, in former times, to have been a confiderable fource 
of wealth to the Haddington family, who were once pro- 
prietors of it. Silver taken from it was alfo coined here 
during the refidence of the royal family, and fome of the

The place ufed for fmelting the metal lies to the weftward 
of the town j and, from the ufe to which it was applied, 
flail bears the name of Silver- Mill. That mine, with the 
track adjoining it, belongs now to the Earl of Hopetoun. 
Search has been repeatedly made, but the contents muft 
either be exhaufted, or the right vein not {truck. 

Heritors and Rent of Barijh — The number of heritors is 
58. There are 16 more who hold by burgage-tenure, 
paying ftipend, but having no valuation. The valued rent 
of the parifh is 12,503!. 14s. id. Scotch. The real rent 
is about 7Q00I. Sterling. One half of the parifh,. in point 
of value, is pofTefled by the following heritors : Mr. John- 
fton of Straiton, Earl of Rofebery, Countefs of Dalhoufie, 
Earl of Hopetoun, Honourable and Reverend Mr. Hamil- 
ton of Riccarton. Few' of the chief proprietors refide in 
the parifh. Of thofe who do, Hamilton of Weflport is 
the moft ancient. Johnfton of Straiton is the firft both in 
valuation and reaj. property.

Benefice. — This confifts of meal and barley, with a fmall 
proportion of oats, and 34I. 9s. in money. The incum- 
bent cannot yet ascertain its value ; but his predeceflor, 
on an average of 13 years, in which the 1782 was in- 
cluded, rated it at 120I. There is at prefent no manfe, but 
in lieu of one, the town allow annually 100 merks Scotch. 
That might once be adequate, but the minifter cannot 
now be accommodated for double the fum. As there is 
no allowance for communion elements, that expenfe is 
defrayed by a collection. The glebe lies about half a mile

into a fingle farm large tracks formerly occupied by feveral tenants, with 
numerous families depending on them. Nor does this only affect, parti- 
cular fpots, but it muft be hurtful in general, both to population and 
morals, as the tedentary employments and artificial intercourse of a town 
are certainly lefs favourable to health and virtue, than the invigorating 
exercifes and natural recreations of a country life. 

The number of inhabitants in the town has increafed, though not in 
proportion to the diminution of the country parifli. 

The average of births, marriages, and burials, for 10 years preceding, 
is as follows : 

Of marriages, 20. 

Of births, 04. 

Of burials, 6i. 
The number of marriages and births may be exactly afcertained, but 
deaths are not fo regularly inferted ; nor will even the account of mort- 
cluths fix this, as i'ome who die here are buried in other parifhes, and 
''vice vcrfa. 

* Though there is only a provifion eftablifhecl by law for one clergy- 
man, the cure was ferved by two, froifa the 1700 till the tranflation of 
Mr. Speirs to Burntifland in 1743. For fupporting a colleague, the ori- 
ginal incumbent agreed to advance annually 350 merks. The town 
bound themfelves at firft to pay 550 merks, with 40 1. Scotch for houfe- 
mail, and raifed that fum afterwards to So© merks. The truftees for 
the Widows Fund oppofed the abolition of the fecond charge ; but the 
town was afloilzied by the Court of Selfion, in an aclion brought at their 
inftance.

School, &amp;c— From its natural healthinefs, as well as 
the eafy accefs in all direftions, Linlithgow is peculiarly 
fitted for a place of education. Many of both fexes have 
been trained here. That fewer now refort to it, may be 
accounted for from the variety of new erections in that 
line, and the ever-changing humour of the publick, with- 
out affe&amp;ing in any degree the abilities and attention of 
the teachers. The rector has a falary of 400 mcrks, al- 
fo a houfe and garden. The perfon who teaches Englifh, 
writing, &amp;c.' has about 14I. yearly. That, as well as the 
other falary, is entirely paid by the town. The lower 
part of the fchoolmafter's houfe is employed for teaching 
in. The houfe was lately repaired at a confiderable ex- 
penfe. Several boarders might be accommodated there, 
and in other houfes of the town. 



Poor, and Funds for their Relief. — The number of poor 
in this parifli, efpecially the town, is very great. The 
penfion lift contains at prefent between 80 and 90. Not 
above a third are natives, or even long rcfident. Several 
from the Highlands have eftablifhed themfelves here, and 
many from other parifnes imperceptibly crept in, induced 
partly by the low rents, and partly by the profpedt of 
fharing the charity funds, which are pretty confiderable. 
The magiflrates and town council, fom'e years ago, en r 
joined the proprietors of houfes not to admit any from 
other parifhes, but fuch as had a vifible mode of fubfift- 
ence, and little profpe£t of becoming burdenfome. This 
circumftance ought certainly to be attended to, as it is 
improper to alienate to ftrangers funds deftined for the 
necemtous, who have a natural intereft in the parifli. Nor 
are the proper objects of charity thofe who often ftroll about 
from idlenefs, and wafte what is given them ; but the

Publick Buildings in the Town, and Antiquities. — Thefe 
articles may juftly be connefted, hecaufe of thefe build- 
ings, the oldeft are the molt ftriking. The palace is 
well known to all who have vifited Linlithgow, and ap- 
pears majeftic even in ruins. As the eminence on which 
it ftands advances almoft into the middle of the loch, it 
has, when viewed from the N., the appearance of an am- 
phitheatre, with a defcent on the three fides, and terrace 
walks on the W. This was formerly mentioned as a Ro- 
man ftation. It is probable, that, as foon as the kings of 
Scotland fixed in the Low Country, they had a place here 
for reforting to occafionally. Its natural advantages could 
not fail to attract them, and the fituation, at an equal dis- 
tance, almoft from Edinburgh and Stirling, rendered it 
peculiarly convenient. David L granted the abbot and 
canons of Holyroodhoufe, omnes pelles arietinas ovinas it

their decayed members, and diftribute annually about 40 1. The feveral 
corporations and fraternities have a provifion for the old and indigent, 
with whom they are refpetftively connected. There are alfo feven fo- 
cieties, on a more enlarged plan, which have the defignation of Friendly, 
and allow a fum weekly to the contributions, when reduced either by

peculiarly magnificent, was built by him. The remains 
of the grand gate are ftill to be feen, though the entrance 
is filled up, and many of the furrounding ornaments de- 
faced. On the infidc of this gate was the famous ftatue 
of Pope Julius IL, with the triple crown ; which, after it 
had long efcaped, was, in the courfe of this century, de- 
mohfhed by a fmith of the town, in the ardour of his zeal 
The palace is all of polimed ftone, and covers about an 
acre of ground. James V. added the chapel and parlia- 
ment, hall. James VI. completed the grand fquare, by 
erefting the magnificent apartments on ±he N. Many of 
the windows, and fome of the doors, have the initials of 
his name, with correfponding ornaments. In the centre 
of the area, was a fine well, adorned with feveral ftatues, 
and fo conftru£ted as to raife the water occafionally to a 
great height. This is now in the fame ruinous flate with 
the buildings which furround it. The chief entry to the 
palace was from the E. The gardens lay on the fame 
fide. It had alfo a grand porch on the S., built by James 
V. This ftill remains, and on it may be traced, though 
now indiftinft, the royal arms, with the collars of the or- 
ders of St. Andrew, the garter, and St Michael. Though 
this building fuffered from defertion, it continued habit- 
able till 1745, w hen it was reduced to the condition in 
which it now appears. Part of the royal army had been 

accommodated

accommodated there. Some of the fires being neglected, 
had, before the difcovery was made, communicated with 
the roof. This being of lead, poured itfelf down in all 
directions, fo as to preclude any attempts to fave it. The 
burning of the palace happened the fame day that the 
church of St. Ninians was blown up. The explofion of 
the latter was fenfibly felt here, and gave rife to various 
conje£tures, till intelligence of the real caufe was received. 

The Duke of Hamilton is now honorary keeper of the 
palace. The emoluments connected with that office are 
enjoyed by an Englifh gentleman of the name of Carter. 

Church. — This building unites elegance with ftrength, 
and may be regarded as a complete fpecimen of Gothic 
architecture. Its length from E. to W. is 182 feet. The 
breadth, including the ailes, 100. The height about 90 
feet. The time of its erection cannot be afcertained. It 
may probably be referred to David I., who diftinguilhed 
himfelf fo fignally by ftruClures of that kind. 

The fteeple is adorned with an imperial crown, which 
has a fine effecl: from whatever point it is viewed.. The 
out fide of the church was adorned with feveral ftatues, 
and the niches remain ; but, in the height of antipapal 
zeal, all the figures were demolilhed, except that of Mi- 
chael, which efcaped probably from its being placed higher 
than the reft, rather than refpect to him as the tutelary 
angel. That he was reputed fo, appears from the {lately 
church dedicated to him, from one of the wells, which 
bears his name, and the town arms, which exhibit him 
with this infeription : Vis Michaelis collocet nos in coelis. 
But whatever the people here might, in ignorant times, 
attribute to his influence, it may be prefumed they now 
build their hopes of admiflion to heaven on a furer bafis.

The roof of the chancel is both elegant and durable. Ifc 
was erected by George Crichton, bilhop of Dunkeld, and 
adorned with the arms of that fee, and the initials of his 
own name. Some allege, this was impofed on the bifhop 
as a penance ; but it may be more honourably, and per- 
haps as juftly accounted for, from his attachment to the 
place, in which he originally officiated as vicar, and where 
he often refided from his connection with the court, as 
keeper of the privy feal. James V. ordered a throne and 
1 2 flails to be ere&amp;ed in this church, for himfelf and the 
knights of the Thiftle, intending their banners to be hung 
up there. But his fudden death, after the battle of Sol- 
way, and the commotions which followed, prevented the 
execution of that, and many more important defigns f. 

The town-houfe was raifed in 1668, under the direc- 
tion of Sir Robert Miln of Barnton, chief manager of the 
burgh. The roof was originally flat, and of lead, but has 
lately been exchanged for a more convenient Hoping one f .

its outward appearance. The E. part might be converted into an ele- 
gant place of worfbip, and would, it is believed, accommodate as many 
as the prefent. That, or fome improvements of a fimilar kind, will, it 
is hoped, be foon made. Appended to the church on the S. is the bury- 
ing-place of the Linlithgow family. The workmanfliip is elegant, and 
it does not hurt the fyrumetry of the original building. 

f Befides other accommodations, the town-houfe contains a large coun- 
cil-chamber, the fheriff court-room, fitted up in a complete ftyJe, a ma- 
fon lodge, and the apartment deftined for Dr. Henry's library. Affixed 
to this, on the back, is a new building, the lower part of which is de- 
figned for a corn market, and the upper for debtors, who have hithcito 
had no other place but the common prifon.

The Carmelites, or White Friars, had a convent at Lin- 
lithgow, which flood on the S. fide of the town. The 
eminence bears ftili the name of the Friars Brae, and the 
adjoining well bears a fimilar defignation. The applica- 
tion of their revenues cannot now be traced.— -This efta- 
blifhment, in point of antiquity, was the third of the kind 
in Scotland. It was founded in 1290 by the inhabitants 
of Linlithgow, and confecrated to the Virgin Mary. 

There is faiji alfo to have been a monaftery of Domi- 
nicans or Black Friars here. Some remains of a religious 
houfe, probably this, may ftill be difcerned in the E. part 
of the town. There was alfo a chapel, facred to St. Ni- 
nian, at the Weft-port, though no traces of it now re- 
main. There was another erection of a fimilar kind at 
Eaft Binny, in the extremity of the parifh j but no fatis- 
factory account of it can now be had. 

St. Magdalane's, on the E. of the town, was an hofpi- 
tium, or place of entertainment for Grangers. It had ori- 
ginally belonged to a fet of Lazarites ; but, on their ex- 
tinction or fecularization, was applied to this purpofe, ac- 
cording to the beneficial inftitution of James I. The

There are two eminences on the W . of the town, on 
one of which courts of juflice are faid to have been held

this circumftance, the name of Doom/dale given, which ifc 
ftill retains. 

To the W. of the town, near the bridge, is a field an- 
ciently ufed for military exercifes and amufements. It 
 has ftill the name of Joijling-haugh.

of one of the Scotch queens. Others trace it to the Erfe, 
Cahailree, or, ihe Jlrife of kings.

Ochiltree mill, traces ftill more diftina of a camp are to

in the Burrowmuir, amounting to about 300 *.

Remarkable Events that happened at Linlithgow and in its 
Environs. — When Edward I. came to afiert his claim to 
the fuperiority of Scotland, he lay with his vaft army, the 
night before the battle of Falkirk, on a track of ground to 
the E., which, though now enclofed, ftill retains the name 
of the Burrowmuir. He marched next day through Lin- 
lithgow, and defeated the Scotch army urtder Wallace and 
Stewart, Comyn and his adherents having previoufly withr 
drawn themfelves, 

Apparition to James IV. — The ftory of this apparition, 
which is faid to have preceded the battle of Flodden, has 
been often recited j and St. Catharine's aile, on the S. of 
the church, is mown as the place. There is no doubt 
that, while the King attended the evening fervice, one in 
an unufual form and habit appeared, difluading him from 
the enterprife, on which he was fo ftrongly bent. This 
probably was a ftratagem devifed by the queen, and car- 
ried into efte&amp; by fome of the courtiers. The cataftrophe 
which followed, connected with the previous appearance, 
would, in a credulous age, naturally eftablifh the belief of 
a fpecial interpofition from Heaven. 

Battle near Linlithgow Bridge. — This was fought be T 
twcen the Earls of Lennox and Arran, during the mino r 
rity of James V., It began on the plain oppofite to the 
Priory of Manuel ; but the molt bloody conflict was near 
the bridge. The action proved fatal to Lennox, and his

coins were alfo found lately in an old houfe of the town, when the workmen 
were digging for fand, about 500, of which 2o were gold, the reft filver. 
Many of them had impreflions of the different James's, and fome of Hen. 
ry IV. of England. Some of the gold coins were about the fize of a guir 
nea, others the half. Thefe had their luftre unimpaired, but the $fag 
ifieces were overgrown with ruft.

remains were depofited in the neighbourhood. Though, 
from the remotenefs of the event, and the cultivation of 
the ground, the fpot cannot now beexa&amp;ly traced, it was 
. long diftinguifhed by one of thofe memorials to which 
paflengers often added a ftone, called Lennox's cairn. 

The unfortunate Mary was born in the parifh of Lin- 
lithgow, about eight days before her father's death •, but 
removed a year after to Stirling, as thought a more fecure 
llation in thefe turbulent times. 

Linlithgow has been often remarked as the place where 
the Earl of Murray, the regent of Scotland, was (hot by 
Hamilton of Bothwell-haugh. The particulars are fo well 
known, that it would be needlefs to fwell this account 
with a detail of them. It is fufficient to obferve, that the 
projection of a balcony, the narrownefs of that part of the 
ftreet, and the regent's pofition on horfeback, were pecu- 
liarly favourable to the afTaffin's purpofe. Having taken 
previous meafures for efcapmg, and with a view to ob- 
ftrucl: purfuit, he fled to France, and continued there *. 

Burning of Solemn League and Covenant — This has been

* A lingular inftance of revenge occurred here in the beginning of 
laft century. One Crawford, while at fchool, had been ftripped of his 
co^t by a perfon in the town, who found him trefpafling on his ground. 
Having gone abroad, and rifen in the army, he returned to Linlithgow 
many years after, and avenged the indignity, by (tabbing the man who 
offered it on the very fpot. Accounts vary with regard to fome of the 
circumftances that followed, though they all agree with regard to his J 
being beheaded at the crofs. According to fome, after lying concealed 
a night or two in the Burrowmuir, he was apprehended, convicted, and 
put to death Others fay, that fome years after, being oppreffed with 
the weight of blood, he furrendered himfelf to juftice, requefling only 
to be indulged as to the mode of execution. His tomb is ftill to be fcen 
on the S. of the church; and though that be now defaced, is faid to 
have had engraved on it the figure of the inftrument by which he fuf- 
fcrcd, and which himfelf procured for the purpofe.

often objeaed to Linlithgow, and certainly took place 
here in 1662, on the anniverfary of the Reftoration. It 
may be confidered rather as a wanton expreflion of zeal, 
to which the many were impelled by a few, than an aft 
authorifed by the magiftrates, or approved by the judi- 
cious part of the community. The perfons who diftin- 
guifhed themfelves on this occafion, were Mr. Mylne, one 
of the bailies, and Mr. Ramfay, then miniftcr of the pa- 
rifli. The conduct of the latter is the more remarkable, 
as he had not only taken the covenant himfelf, but prefled 
it upon others with extreme rigour. Changing his prin- 
ciples with the times, he was firit made Dean of Ghfgow, 
then Bifhop of Dumblane, and afterwards raifed to the 
fee of Rofs. 

The magiftrates and council of Linlithgow gave a fump^ 
tuous entertainment to the Duke of York, when in Scot- 
land, before his acceflion to the throne. The town is 
faid to have long felt the preflure of the debt incurred by 
that magnificent difplay *.

During the ftruggle between Edward I. and the Scotch patriots, the gar- 
rifon ftationed here by that prince were difpoffefied of it by a curious 
device of. one Binnoch. He fupplied the caftle with hay, and being well 
known, had free accefs at all times. He propofed to Bruce to conceal 
fome men in his cart. Being introduced without fufpicion, and complete- 
ly armed, they eafily made themfelves mailers of it. This ftory, which 
is generally believed, reminds one of the ftratagem afcribed to Ulyfles in 
the i'rojan war. Binnoch was rewarded for this fervice with fome lands 
in the S. of the parifu, which ftill bear that name, a little foftened. The 
Binnings of Wallyford were faid to be defcended from him ; and, in allu- 
fion to that tranfaction, had for their arms, a hay wain, with this motto,.

Mjcellamous Obfervations.-lt has been already obferved, 
with regard to this parifh, that agriculture is in an advan- 
ced ftate. From die abilities and exertion of thofe en- 
gaged m that line, much may ftill be expected. Though 
the ground in the neighbourhood be not naturally fertile, 
that defeft is compenfated by art. The elegant houfe'

fet of queftions in oppofition to the new doctrine, which was favourably 
received at court, and much efteemed by thofe of his perfuafion. Being 
a great adept in theologicaJ controverfy, he was feledted by the Scotch 
clergy to defend the Catholick opinions, and diftinguifhed himfelf in fe- 
veral encounters with John Knox. Refuting to acknowledge his errors 
he was banifhed, through the influence of the reforming party, and be' 
tame afterwards abbot of the Scotch convent at Ratifbon, where he pre- 
lided many years. 

Kirkivood, rector of the fchool here, diftinguifhed himfelf at a future 
period by his learning, and ftill more by hjs long and obftinate conflict 
•with the magistrates and town council, whom he fatirifed under the de- 
fignation of the tiventy-fcven gods. 

Stewart of Pordovan was a gentleman of property in this parifh, re- 
peatedly provoft of the burgh, and reprefented it in the laft Scotch par- 
liament. He was not only averfe to the Union, but joined in a folemn 
proteft againft that meafure. Having made Preibyterian government the 
object of his peculiar attention, he wrote that well known book, in 
which the procedure in the feveral courts in this kingdom is fo diftinctly 
traced. 

Of the feveral perfons connected with this^parifli at a remote period, 
none is more frequently mentioned than Rob Gib, of facetious memory. 
He afted as buffoon to James V. ; and being allowed, on a particular 
occafion, to perfonate the fovereign, gave a pointed reproof to the cour- 
tiers, who urged their refpective claims to royal favour, that he had al- 
ways ferved his mafter for Jlark love and kmdnefs. His Majefty con- 
ferred on him the property of Weft Canibber in this parifh. which was 
enjoyed by his dependents even in the courfe of this century. The ori- 
ginal charter is faid to be ftill extant.

£foprietors in that quarter, have already embellifhed, and 
cannot fail to meliorate, a track of the parifh, which be- 
fore was comparatively in an uncultivated ftate. 

Linlithgow is well known to be a healthy place ; when 
infectious difeafes vifit it, which is rarely, the frmptoms 
are more favourable, and die effects lefs fatal, than in 
moft other towns. During the plague in 1646, which 
made fuch dreadful havock in the capital, the courts of 
juftice were transferred to Linlithgow, and held in the 
palace. The profeflbrs of the univcrfity are faid alfo to 
have removed here at that time. Many people near four- 
fcore are to be feen daily in the ftreets. Two in the pa- 
rifh have palTed their 90th year : The one enjoys all her 
faculties ; the other is deaf and feeble, but in other re- 
flects pretty found. A woman, near Canibber, above 
85, ftill purfues her ufual occupations, and walked lately 
a mile to attend a diet of catechifing. 

There is a well at Canibber, of qualities fimilar to Mof- 
fat. - It was formerly much reforted to in the fpring, but 
has for fome years been totally neglected. 

The wages of maid fervants are from 3I. to 4I. a-year, 
and that of men fervants from 7I. to 81. 

There are 2 inns at Linlithgow, provided with fuitable 
accommodations. There are alfo fome other houfes where 
perfons, to whom poft horfes are not an object, may find 
good entertainment. 

Befides the funds which the corporations have for the 
poor, with whom they are feverally connected, they have 
adopted a general plan, of which the good effects are fen- 
fibly felt. They have a repofitory capable of containing 
rtoo bolls of meal. This they fill at a proper time ; and 
if application be made, the town advances for that pur- 
pofe 1 col., without intereft. Thus they have always a

quantity to anfwer demands, are enabled to regulate tlie, 
price of the markets, and prevent private retailers from 
taking an improper advantage of circumftances that may 
occur. 

Among the ufeful inftitutions here, Dr. Henry's lib- 
rary juftly deferves to be named. That gentleman, well 
known to the world by his valuable hiftory, having ex- 
perienced the fweets of knowledge himfelf, benevolently 
wifhed others to (hare them. With that view, he be- 
queathed his books, under certain regulations, to the ma- 
giftrates and town council, and minifters of the prefbyter.y 
of Linlithgow, as the foundation of a larger collection. 
It is to be hoped, they will {how themfelves worthy of 
the trufl, and promote a defign of fuch general utility. 

Befides the Eftablifhed Church, there are two places of 
worlhip in the parilh *, one for thofe of the Burgher per- 
fuafion, which adjoins to the town, the other at Craig- 
mailin, about 3 miles diftant, to which the Antiburghers 
refort. The number of difienters in the parifli is about 
430. That alienation of heart which diverfity of religious 
opinions once produced in Scotland, feems now in a great 
meafure banilhed. 

While our countrymen are thus imbibing more and 
more of the fpirit of love, may they ever retain that of a 
found mind, and exert themfelves in their refpeftive lines, 
to fupport that glorious conftitution, which is found, from 
experience, to conduce fo erTedually to the benefit of the 
individual, which is 10 admirably calculated to enfure, un- 
der God, the profperity of the empire ! </p></div>

Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, Air. 

T ANGTONis fituated in that diftriet of Berwick- 
* mire called the Merfe; Its name, perhaps, was 
taken from the long ftraggling town of Langton, which 
extended from near the boundary towards Dunfe to with- 
in a few paces of the hpufe of Langton, and the prefent 
parim church. The town was of long (landing, and, 
like other border towns, fuffered at different times from 
the incurfions of the Englilh, having been burnt in 1558, 
by Sir Henry Percy and Sir George Bowes •, and at other 
times pillaged by marauding parties from Berwick and the 
other fide of the Tweed. Mr. Gavin, the late proprietor, 
finding a town fo near his houfe a hinderance to his im- 
provements, offered to its inhabitants to feu, on eafy terms, 
a pleafant and healthful fpot of ground about half a mile 
diftant. His offer was accepted ; and in a fhort time, not

one ftone was left upon another of the old town of Lang- 
ton. The new village is named Gavintown, in honour of it* 
founder, and contains at prefent 159 perfons. The parifh 
is in figure triangular, The mean length may be. about 4* 
miles, the mean breadth 2}. It contains about 7200 Eng- 
lifti acres. From the E. to the N. W. limit, the afcent 
is gradual 5 from S. to N., the afcent is the fame as far 
as the foot of the high grounds, known by the name of 
Langton Edge. On this edge, all the enclofed and culti- 
vated part of the parifh is prefented to the eye, as well 
as the whole breadth of the Merfe, and of Northumber- 
land as far as Wooler. And here the reflecting traveller, 
after recollecting with regret, how often the flat below him 
has been rendered, by direful war^ a defolate and enfan- 
guined plain, is pleafed 'with the variety and abundance 
with which peace and well directed induftry, in modern 
times, have clothed it. The foil of the parifli is various. 
In the lower and cultivated part of it, the foil is generally 
a loam of a reddifh colour, well adapted to turnip huf- 
bandry, and to the raifing of oats and barley, and fown 
grafles. There are fome fields of a very deep and rich 
loam, which make good returns when fown with wheat. 
All the fields are enclofed either with a ftone fence, or 
with a ditch or hawthorn hedge ; and here fome of the 
hedges, with the hedge-row trees, are found to thrive as 
well as in any part of the kingdom. The higher part of 
the parifh, which confifts of 5 {beep-farms, is covered with 
fine green pafture, and is accounted as dry and found 
fheep ground as is to be met with in the S. of Scotland. 
The air, as we have no {landing water near us, and are 
placed in the upper part of the Merfe, is reckoned as 
pure and healthful as in any quarter of the county. 

' Agriculture 9 



Of Langton. 



579. 



Agriculture, Cattle, Rent, &amp;c— Little was done for 
the improvement of the land here before 1758. Lang- 
ton-burn, a ftrong and clear ftream which runs through 
the parifh from N. W. to E., had its banks planted with 
foreft trees to a confiderable extent, about 80 years ago. 
The trees throve well, and have been long, and are ftill 
a (helter and ornament to the houfe and enclofures of 
Langton, as well as a beauty in the face of the country. 
Several fields too had been enclofed with fences of dif- 
ferent kinds a fhort time after the Reftoration, and had 
been for many years let from year to year for grafs to 
troop horfes. The foldiers, who were accommodated in 
barracks on the eftate, and in the town of Langton, fpoke 
of the pafture as the beft their horfes came to in the 
kingdom, and were particularly pleafed with the pure wa- 
ter which is to be had in plenty in every grafs field. In 
1758, Mr. Gavin purchafed the eftate, lying in the pa- 
rimes of Langton, Dunfe, and Longformacus. From that 
period till the time of his death in 1773, he was employ- 
ed in the improvement of it. The plans he laid down 
were judicious, and the profecution of them unremitted. 
The grounds were cleared of furze, and broom, and (tones, 
and of every thing that could impede the operations of the 
plough. The rock marl, with which the eftate abounds, and 
lime from the Northumberland hills, at the diftance of 16 
miles, were laid on as the foil required ; the fields were di- 
vided with fkill, and enclofed in the molt fubftantial man- 
ner. In a fhort time, Langton affumed a moft cultivated ap- 
pearance, rewarded the attention, and repaid the expenfe 
the proprietor had beftowed upon it. The rent in 1758 
was nool. j in 1773 it was let at upwards of 3000I. 
There are in the parifh 30 ploughs, all of them according 
to Mr. Small's conltru&amp;ion. The number of horfes is 

4 D z about 



Statiftical Accoiml 



about 70, exclufive of young ones ; the number of black 
cattle (December 1793) 380; a number lefs than ufual, 
on account of the apprehended fcarcity of fodder : The 
breed, a mixture of the Merfe and Lammermuir kinds. 
The fheep amount to upwards of 3500, and are of the Nor-, 

thumberland, Tweeddale, and Lammermuir breeds. The 

higheft yearly rent for land within the parifh, paid by one 
farmer, is 900I \ the loweft, 35I. There are feveral fmall 
pofleffions, which bring from 15I. to 35 1. of rent; but 
the tenants of them are employed chiefly in driving lime 
to the greater farmers, coals to tradefmen and others who 
have not horfes of their own, and (tones and gravel to the 
highways. All the enclofed grounds of the parifh are let 
from 2I. 2 s. to 15 s. the Englifh acre. The leafes are 
ufually for 1 9 years. The rent is all in money ; no kain 
or fervices are afked by the proprietors. There are 2 corn 
mills in the parifh, to which the tenants are thirled ; but 
this reftri&amp;ion has not, in my time, been confidered as 
any hardfhip. The valued rent of the parifh in the cefs? 
books is 3092 1. 14s. 2d. Scotch. The prefent rent is 
nearly 2660I. Sterling, of which 2600I. belong to the 
eftate of Langton ; the remainder to two gentlemen who 
hold of the proprietor of that eftate. Of the three heri- 
tors, two refide in the immediate neighbourhood, and the 
principal heritor refides in the parifh occafionally. 

Population, Sec. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, 
the population in 1755 was 290. The number of fouls in

The number of inhabited houfes is 87 •, a few are at 
prefent uninhabited. There are 12 farmers, befides thofe 
who occupy fmall poffeflions, 9 mafons, 7 houfe carpen- 
ters and plough-wrights, 8 weavers, 3 fhoemakers, 2 
tyackfmiths, 2 tailors, 2 thatchers, 1 cooper, 3 hedgers, 
apprentices included, and 4 day labourers. The reft of 
the men are in general hinds, ploughmen, barnmen, and 
fhepherds. The unmarried women, who are not hired 
from year to year, are employed in fpinning to manufac- 
turers and others throughout the winter, and in the fum- 
mer and harveft are occupied in hoeing potatoes and tur- 
nips, hay-making, reaping corn, &amp;c. The great bulk of 
the people are hearers of the Eftabliflied Church, but a 
considerable number are attached to the Relief, Burghers, 
Antiburghers, and Cameromans, and go to Dunfe and 
Chirnfide to hear fermon f.

* The regifter of baptifms, marriages, and burials, has never been 
kept with any degree of exaclnefs ; and I with not to have any thing in- 
ferted in this account, for the truth of which I cannot anfwer. 

f A fchoolmafter, who officiated as precentor in the parifh, about 3* 
years ago, is faid to have been (very innocently, in my judgment) the 
occafion of much feccfiion here. Anxious to improve the church pfalmo- 
dy, one Sunday afternoon, without confulting the minifter, he, with a 
few vocal friends who were acquainted with his intention, made a trial 
of finging the pfalm without reading the line. This innovation fo fhocked 
many of the hearers, that they never afterwards could be reconciled ta 
the Eftablifhed Church. 



5** Statiftical Account 

MpenJ, Church, School, Poor, &amp;c.-The (Upend is 5* 
bolls of oats, 32 bolls 2 firlots 2 pecks of barley, and 28I. 
17* 8d. money. The corn glebe was formerly about 5 
acres of the belt land in the parifh, to which was added 
the pafturage of 2 horfes and 2 cows, fummer and win- 
ter, over an cxtenfive range of rich grafs ; but, near 30 
years ago, the manfe being removed to the village of Ga- 
vintown, 10 acres of very indifferent outfield land, lying 
contiguous, and 4 1. 2s. of money, were accepted in lieu 
of the old glebe and pafturage. The patronage belongs 
to the Countefs of Breadalbane. The church was built in 
1736, and is at this time in a ruinous ft ate. The manfe, 
built in 1766, was, at that time, among the beft, if not 
the very beft manfe in the county. It is {till in tolerable 
repair. The fchoolmafter has a final! houfe in Gavintown 
to teach in. His falary is 100 merks, and 10s. of fee for 
acting as precentor and feffion-clerk. His icholars may 
be reckoned, on an average, 20 in number, whom he in- 
grafts in reading, writing, and arithmetick. The efta- 
blifhed fees of the fchoolmafter are is. 2d. a-quarter for 
reading and writing, and 2s, 6d. a-quarter for arithmetick. 
With this fmall income, being himfelf a virtuous man, 
and having an induftrious wife, he has brought up a fa- 
mily, and been always refpectable. The poor on the roll 
are ufually 9 ; 2 or 3 more receive an occafional fupply.* 
The yearly collection in the church amounts to about 5 L, 
the one half of which is referved for fuch perfons as de- 
cline being put on the roll ; the other half is added to the 
parochial affeflment. The afleflment, on an average of 5 
years, is 28 1. 14 s. ; the one half paid by the heritors, the 
other half by the tenants. The poor have at all times 
been well fatisfied with the provifion made for them. 
When, on a particular occafion, any thing extraordinary

of the proprietors of Langton, that the requeft of the 
kirk-feffion was never refufed % 

Antiquities.— On the farm of Raecleugh-head in the pa- 
rim, there have been, in ancient times, two military fta- 
tions. The extent of both can be eafily afcertained, as 
the ditches are difcernible at a diftance to this day. Thefe 
ftations, it is thought, were occupied during the wars 
carried on between the two kingdoms. In the reign of 
King William HI,, there was a confiderable encampment 
of both horfe and foot on the farm of Langhope-birks. 
The troops, it is faid, were encamped there at the defirc 
of Patrick Earl of Marchmont, a nobleman who very de- 
fervedly poffeffed much of the confidence of his fovereign. 

The 

* Price of Provifions and Wages. — The price of provifions in this pa- 
nto, lefs than 40 years ago, did not amount to one half of the pretent 
coft. Our flefh-market is in Dunfe, and, in that market, the advance 
upon the different articles fold, has, within thefe few years, been verj 
great. Beef and mutton are from 3d. to 4^d-, pork from 3d. to 4d., 
veal from 3d. to 5d the lib. Amfterdam weight. Lamb is never below 
3 d. ; hens are fold at 10 d. and 1 s. each ; eggs from 3d. to 7 d. the do- 
zen, according to the demand for them at Berwick for the London 
market; butter from 8 d. to lod. the lib. of 23 ounces. Hinds, or 
farmerii men fcrvants, with families, hired by the year, have from 16 L 
to 1 81. of gains or wages; an unmarried man fervant, victualled in hi! 
matter's houfe, has from 61. to 81.; a maid fervant for houfe-work has 
from 3 1. to 3 1. 5 s. yearly, but when hired for out-work, fuch as hoe- * 
ing turnips and potatoes, milking ewes, Sec. 4I., and fometimes more : 
labouring men have, by the day, from is. to 1 s. 2 d. in fummer, and 
10 d. in winter : women employed by the day in hoeing turnips, hoeing 
and digging potatoes, have from 6 d. to Sd. : in harveft the men have

The ftate of the kingdom at that time might render the 
collection of forces in different parts of tfie kingdom a 
meafure of great prudence. In 1792, on clearing the 
ground of a heap of ftones which had been collected up- 
on the top of the Crimfon, or Crameftone Hill, on the 
N. fide of the village of Gavintown, feveral earthen urns, 
of different fizes, were dug up. The urns contained hu- 
man bones, but had no infeription upon them. In the 
lands of Middlefield and Creafe, there are feveral coffins 
of ftone, containing human bones. On meafuring one of 
them, it was found to be 3^ feet long, 2 deep, and 2t 
broad. In the neighbourhood of the places where the 
coffins are found, there is a field which ftill retains the 
name of Battlemoor. 

Mifcellancotis Obfervations. — The people are in general 
above the middle ftature, and drefs, perhaps, better than 
their circumftances can well afford. Three brothers in 
the village of Gavintown, without any flock to begin with, 
• and without friends, have, by the making of fhoes, in lefs 
than 20 years, acquired upwards of 800I. I wifh I could 
record, that all the workmen of the parifh have been 
equally economical, induftrious, and fuccefsful. Mr. Alex- 
ander Low in Wood-end, who rents of the eflate of Lang- 
ton to the amount of 900 \. a-year, hath, by experiment 
and obfervation, acquired much knowledge of rural eco- 
nomy. He hath greatly improved feveral of the imple- 
ments of hufbandry, and is the inventor of a fteelyard for 
weighing hay, &amp;c, which it does with exactnefs, and is 
eafily removed from field to field. The fteelyard is made 
by James Allan wright in Gavinton, near Dunfe, and fold 
by him at 61. 6s. There are different quarries in the pa- 
rifh of the beft free-ftone. Feat and turf may be had in

the vicinity of the parifli, and at a moderate price, but 
coal from Northumberland, though, on account of the 
diftanoe, and the badnefs of the roads, it coft about 8 s. 
6d. for a two horfe cart, is the fuel mod ufed. 

There is one publick houfe in the village. If it be 111 
any degree a nuifance, we have ourfelves to blame, as the 
lheriffs of the county will grant it no licenfe,' without a 
certificate fubfcribed by one or two perfons in the parim 
of refpeclable character. </p></div>

<p>
Name, Extent, Surface and Soil. 

THE name of this parifh has been uniformly the fame y 
and the etymology commonly given of it is, The 
Town of the Mire. At a period very remote, this deriva- 
tion might perhaps be proper, though the general appear- 
ance at prefent by no means juftifies it. In length it is 
nearly 6 miles, and in breadth from 2 to 3. The weftern 
part {lands high, and is extremely pi&amp;urefque. From 
Bimerfyde-hill, the property of Mr. Haig, over which one 
of the moft publick roads in the parifh panes, the eye of 
the traveller is at once gratified with every thing beautiful 
and magnificent, wood, water, hills, ruins, and fertile fields. 
The reft of the parifh, gradually declining to the S., is 
alfo extremely pleafant ; the profpect being agreeably di- 
verfified with excellent enclofurcs, beautiful hedge-rows, 

and

3 nd thriving plantations. The foil towards the Tweed, par- 
ticularly the haughs, is fharp, with a gravelly bottom-, 
towards the N., and indeed through the reft of the pa- 
rifh, with very few exceptions, it is a ftiff clay, with a till 
bottom. 

Improvements. —While other places have been advancing 
in improvement, this parifh has not been negle'cled. About 
40 years ago, the tenants were miferably lodged, the fields 
open and expofed to every blaft, and hardly a tree to be 
feen, a few about the houfes of the different proprietors 
excepted. Now the fcene is agreeably changed ; the te- 
nants pofTefs warm and comfortable houfes, many of them 
large, and mod of them dated j the greater part of the 
arable land is enclofed, and furrounded with belts and 
clumps of plantation. The eftate of Mr. Scott of Harden 
in particular, which comprifes nearly two-thirds of the 
whole, exhibits a greater extent of neat thriving hedges 
and plantations- than perhaps is to be met with in the S. 
of Scotland. 

Agriculture and Produce. — Previous to the year 1766, 
the old Scotch plough only was ufed, and no manure 
thought of but what the farms produced. Since that pe- 
riod, immenfe quantities of lime have been annually 
driven from Lothian and England, at the great diftance 
of 26 miles. It anfwers extremely well j and though each 
cart, of 5 bolls, all expences included, cofts 10s. 6d., the 
farmer finds his account in ufmg it. Two horfe ploughs 
are generally ufed, and the moil approved methods of hus- 
bandry keenly followed. The quantity of grain annually 
fown, and the average return of each boll, is nearly as 
follows :

Barley from 160 to 180, £ 

Wheat from 100 to 130, - _ 7

Befides the above, there are generally from 1 80 to 2o» 
acres in red clover for hay, and from 100 to 120 acres in 
turnip. The total number of acres in -pafture and tillage, 
may be about 5550. 

Black cattle, young and old, from 540 to 560. 

Sheep, from 1400 to 1500. 

Horfes, young and old, from 120 to 130. 

The cattle are moftly of the Balmerfhire breed, and the 
greater part of them reared in the parilh. The iheep are 
of different kinds, and molt of them brought from differ- 
ent quarters. ^ Mr. Scott of Harden made feveral at- 
tempts to improve them ; for an account of which, fee

horfes in general are flrong, and many of them, when 
taken to market, bring high prices *. 

Population. — The population, according to the moft ex- 
act information that can be procured, is confiderably di- 
minifhed. About 60 years ago, there were 4 populous 
villages, 2 of which are now extinct, and the remaining

2 gradually difappearing. With refpeft to the abolition 
of °the firft, the numbers cannot be greatly leflened, as it 
chiefly confifted of 6 farmers, their cottagers, and 2 or 3 
mechanicks, who are now fettled more conveniently in 
the centre of their refpeftive farms. The non-exiftence of 
the fecond muft have made no fmall diminution, as there 
are people yet alive who remember to have feen 50 houfes 
all inhabited ; and fome of thefe fay, that they have heard 
their fathers mention double that number ; and indeed this 
tradition feems to be well founded, as the ruins of feveral 
houfes are (till vifible. The third, which was nearly, equal 
to the fecond, is fo mutilated, that fcarcely a tenth part re- 
mains. The fourth hath not fuffered fo eflentially, though 
the blank is too perfpicuous not to be obferved. At the 
fame time, it is certain, that the return to Dr. Webfter in 
1755 is dated only at 502 fouls, confequently there is a 
difference of 55 in favour of the population at prefent.

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c— The church was built in the 
1658, and has undergone many repairs : at prefent it is 
both neat and warm. The manfe was built in the 1767, 
and was repaired in the 1791, the year after the prefent 
incumbent was admitted. It is delightfully fituated ; and if 
an extenfive view of the adjacent country, Mr. Scott's plea- 
fure-ground, and the windings of the Tweed, could com- 
penfate for dampnefs, execrable architecture, and diftance 
from the church, might be faid to be very comfortable. The 
ftipend was augmented iol. in the 1776, and is at prefent 
32 bolls barley, Linlithgow meafure, 48 bolls meal, 460 1. 
Scotch in money, communion elements included, with a 
glebe of 14 Englifh acres, and a garden half an Englifh 
acre. There is a fchool, with a falary of 81. 6s. 8d., be- 
fides a dwelling-houfe and garden. The number of fcho-

* Climate and Bifeafes — The air is fliarp and clear, and confeqnenfly 
not inimical to health. Agues, before the lands were enclofed and drain- 
ed, were very prevalent ; the mod common difcafes now are, confump- 
tions, flow fevers, rheumatifm, dyfenteries, fcrofula, &amp;c. Meafles, fmall 
pox, and chincough, fometimes make their appearance, but are feldom 
very fatal.

lars, throughout the year, may be from 30 to 40.— Poor's 
rates were eftablifhed in the 177 1, and are nearly 3tl. a- 
year ; which, with the average annual colle&amp;ions 1 1 1., is 
generally fufficient. The heritors, however, by no means 
reftria themfelves to this, but cheerfully afiefs themfelves 
to the full amount of what the minifter and feflion deem 
neceflary. The landlords and tenants pay in equal pro- 
portions ; and though the latter are not confulted when 
the afieflment is made, they have never been known to 
grudge their fhare. 

Fifheries. — There are no rivers in the parifh, but the 
Tweed, forming the fouthern boundary ; there are 3 incon- 
fiderable falmon nfheries, which together may amount to 
20I. or 25 1. a-year. They might unqueftionably be greatly 
improved, were the mode of riming altered. The proprie- 
tors, however, have never as yet beftowed any attention 
on this object ; and confequently the fifhers follow the 
practice of their forefathers, angling, fetting fmall nets in 
cairns, when the river is in flood, and killing them with 
lifters, when the river is fmall and the evening ferene ; 
and this they call burning the water, becaufe they are ob- 
liged to carry a lighted torch in the boat. Long nets, 
fuch as are ufed near to Berwick, and upon the Tay and 
Tummel in the N., might certainly be employed in many 
places with great fafety and advantage. 

Proprietors and Rent. — There are 5 heritors, all of whom 
have dwelling-hcufes in the parifh. The valued rent is 
5675L 1 os. 6d. Scotch. : real rent about 2400 1. Sterling. 

Minerals. — There is an inexhauftible {lore of frec- 
ftone all along the banks of the Tweed ; but one quarry 

only, 



Slatiftical Account 



only, the property of Lord Buchan, has been wrought for 
feveral years. The ftone is of a reddilh colour, very du- 
rable, and will admit of the fineft polifh. 

Antiquity.— Thz abbey of Dryburgh, fo much admired 
by travellers, lies in the S. W. corner of this parim ; but 
as an account of it, written by the prefent proprietor, the 
Earl of Buchan, is publifhed in Grofe's Antiquities, it is 
needlefs to be very minute. The only thing which de- 
ferves our notice is, that his Lordfhip, while he has dif- 
played much tafte, and expended a great deal of money in 
digging up a variety of ftones of curious fculpture, and 
placing them in fuch a manner as to gratify and attratl 
the eye of the vifitor, has certainly, in fome refpetts, lef- 
fened that veneration which fo ancient an edifice is apt to 
infpire. 

CharaEler and Manners. — The inhabitants in general are 
remarkably induftrious, fober, and contented. From time 
immemorial, they have been diftinguifhed for their mode- 
ration, both in civil and religious matters 5 and no inftance 
has been known of any being guilty of thofe enormous 
crimes which are the fin and reproach of a nation. 

Difadvantages. — Though moil of the neceflaries of life 
are produced in the parifli, hardly any of them are fold in it. 
Even meal, in fmall quantities, can only be procured from 
neighbouring mills, there being none here : An inconve- 
nience, however, which will be of ihort duration, as a 
mill is now building in the moil centrical fituation in the 
parifh. Butcher meat cannot be obtained without fend- 
ing to Kelfo, Jedburgh, or Melrofe, the neareft of which 
is 6 miles. There are few houfehold articles, but what 

mufl

muft be brought from fome other quarter. The roads, for 
5 months in the year, are extremely bad : An evil, how- 
ever, which it is to be. hoped, will be con-eded. The 
diftance from coal and lime is a hardthip feverely felt, 
both of which mull be driven at the diftance of 26 miles. 
Want of carriers is another inconvenience ; every perfon 
being obliged to fend on purpofe for the moft trivial, ar- 
ticles. </p></div>

tria of country called a Parifh J and, like moft local 
names, has probably been framed at firft from fome real 
or fuppofed ' affinity to the fituation. ---The figure of the 
parifh is irregular, but the contents may W about 16 or 
1 8 fquare miles, moftly in cultivation, with fome thriving 
fir plantations, and very little wafte ground. * has no 
river nor confiderable ftream, but yet is fufficiently water- 
ed for domeftick and agricultural purposes ; and particu- 
larly, it is interfeded by the loch of Refcobie, which is 
a mile long, warned by the loch of Balgavies, in the pa- 
rifh of Aberlemno, on the N. and E., and was fo on- 
the S. and W. by the- loch of Reftennet, in the parifh 
of Forfar j but lately this laft mentioned loch was taken 
off by a drain, a projea which at firft was by many 
thought rather problematical j but the fuccefs has afford- 
ed ample j unification, by affording fpeedy indemnifica- 
tion, together with the permanent fource of a very hand- 
fome revenue to the owner, a gentleman of celebrity in 
the political world, and long and well known by the 
honourable, appellation of a friend to his country. Still, 
however, the fprings and rills, which formerly fed this 
drained lake, continue to difcharge themfelves by the 
drain into the loch of Refcobie, from whence, through 
the loch of Balgavies, iflues the chief branch of Lu- 
nan water, which gives name to a bay on the German 
Ocean, into which it falls about 12 miles E. from this 
kirk. 

All thefe lakes abound in marl ; a manure of approved 
and extenfive ufe in hufbandry, eagerly fought after by 
the induftrious farmer ; and where it is .fkilfully applied, 
producing very great efFe&amp;s, being nearly fimiiar to lime

inks operation on the foil: but here, and in ( ome other 
fta .ft.cal articles, fuch as hire, wages, &amp;c. the writer 
hncis lumfelf happily prevented by the previous accounts of 
others. 

From fo many lakes, with their adjacent marfhes, our 
climate may be fuppofed rather unwholefome ; but, in 
fa£r, it is otherwife. The fituation of the parifh is moftly 
vaihcular, lying between two hills, that of Dunnichen o U . 
the S., and of Turin on the N., which rife above 600 feet 
above the lakes, and, running parallel, form a kind of 
fpout or fucker, which frequently occafions a ftrong cur- 
rent in the atmofphere that purifies it, and, thus render- 
ing the air falubrious, keeps the inhabitants healthy. And 
hence, inftances of longevity, equal to that of any other 
country : a woman died here, this winter, at the very ad- 
vanced age, as is faid, of 104, and we have living in- 
ftances upwards of 80 and 90 ; our people are not liable, 
to frequent ficknefs, nor have we any local or peculiar 
maladies. 

Soil and Agriculture. —The foil is various : part of it rich 
and fertile, part of it poor and barren ; but Nature has 
furniflied the thrifty farmer with a ready and effectual 
remedy for the poverty of the foil, and the word may be, 
and is made productive by the due application of marl. 
In confequence, the value of land is much increafed ; the 
new farmer does not boggle at promifmg double or triple 
the former rent, and it is the laird's bufinefs to look to the 
payment. And though, from want both of means and 
ikill in adventurers, failures may fometimes happen, 
this does not difcourage others from ftepping forward,

even 011 higher terms; fo that, in general, farming is 
a profitable employment, and the people are fubftantial 
and in eafy circumftances, the effect as well as the re- 
ward of diligence and induftry, in an improved fyftem 
of management, agreeably to the old obfervation, " The 
hand of the diligent maketh rich." And indeed the 
genius of the country at large, encouraged by an in- 
creafed product and ready markets, " bleffed both in 
their balket and ftore," is ftrongly bent to agricultural 
improvement, on which, it is to be hoped, the New- 
Board of Agriculture will foon Ihed its friendly influence. 
This is one of the happieft directions which the genius 
of a country or people can take : it occupies their ta- 
lents and time ufefully and laudably, and, affording 
ample fcope for their fchemes and fancies, prevents them 
from running wild, and takes them off from thofe jars 
and controverfies, whether of politicks or religion, which 
always have been, and ever muft be, more pernicious than 
fcrviceable to fociety. 

The kinds of grain in ufe, are oats and bear, moftly bar- 
ley, fome peafe, and a little wheat here and there, with * 
large proportion in fown grafs : Hence corn and cattle arc 
the ftaple articles of our product, there being a very few 
ftieep. The cultivation of lint is alfo in practice, and ge- 
nerally fucceeds well. On the article of culture, I have 
to add with pleafure, that 

Intellectual improvement proceeds apace: About 16 
years ago, in the courfe of vifiting the parifh, there were 
found 3 people who could not read, and were become 
too old to learn ; at prefent, it is not known if there

be any of the natives of this defcription : Children are 
fent early in life to fchool, where they learn to read, 
and may acquire fuch other branches as they are ca- 
pable of and apply to : their proficiency is often very 
confiderable ; and this early tuition will happily be both 
ufeful and ornamental through Mfe. It is therefore to be 
wifhed, that they who have it in their power would take 
into their ferious confideration, the clamant cafe of pa- 
rifh fchoolmafters, whofe prefent fcanty provifion is by 
no means adequate to the exigencies of their condi- 
tion, or to the importance, toil, and labour of their 
office* 

Population. — There are no nobility, but feveral lairds, 
re'fident in the parifh ; and there are 8 heritors : The in- 
habitants, all ages, are about 934. The return to Dr. 
Webfter was 798*. Unlefs in very favourable and en- 
couraging circumftances, our marriages feldom come up 
to a dozen a-year ; and births, at an average, do not ex- 
ceed 30 : There being no regifter of deaths, their number 
is not exactly known.

chiefly of the Prefbyterian perfuafiom The parifh- 
church is the only place of worfhip in our bounds ; but 
we have fome Epifcopalians, and a few Seceders. 

Poor. — Our poor roll varies, from 4 or 5 to 10 and up- 
wards ; and among thefe is diftributed annually 17I. or 
1 8 1., arifing from the kirk collections, and the intereft of 
a fmall fum in the management of the feffion, our only- 
funds for poor : and mould thefe become infufneient, re- 
courfe muft be had on the heritors, who are faid to be li- 
able in the laft refort. Luckily, we do not feel our own 
poor very burdenfome ; but we are opprefTed with wan- 
derers : I have known 2 dozen of them before 1 2 o'clock 5 
and, laft fummer, near twofcore of them called in the 
courfe of one day. It was, indeed, a hard time ; and it 
would be a hard, nay, a bad thing, to fend them hungry 
away : for though many of them be extremely worthlefs, 
moft of them are extremely indigent ; and they muft not 
be call out to perifh : " Whofo ftoppeth his ears at the cry 
of the poor, he alfo mail cry himfelf, and {hall not be 
heard." — It is to be wifhed, rather than expected, that 
fome general plan, of fuch efficacious benevolence as would 
prevent (trolling, not by hard reftriclions, but by making 
it needlefs, were eftabliftied in the country ; and, till this 
be done, we muft be doing. Perth ufually furnimes out a

pretty well as to the fabrick, but not large enough for the 
accommodation of the parimioners, being only 50 by 20 
feet within the walls, and not well feated. The pre- 
fent incumbent ferved the cure about %\ years, from 17th 
April 1774, as affiftant to his predeceflbr, Mr. William 
M'Keay -, after whofe deceafe he received, with the con- 
fent of the whole community, heritors and parimioners, 
chiefly on the application of Mr. Hunter of Burnfide, a 
prefentation to the vacant charge. 

In confequence of this prefentation, the prefentee was 
inftalled on the 3d of April 1777, and is (till a bachelor.

Mifcellaneous Obfervatious. — In a furvey of this fort, there 
is a circumftance that delerves to be particularly men- 
tioned, as it contributes not a little to health and comfort ; 
the dwelling-houfes are much better and more commo- 
dious, and neater and cleaner kept than formerly : even 
the cattle are now better lodged, than the people were 
wont to be. This is a moil lenlible improvement ; and, 
befides giving an agreeable afpecT: to the face of the coun- 
try, is no bad prognoftick of the wealth of the inhabitants. 
As to people, there can be no doubt that cleanlinefs and, 
good air are to be ranked among the necellaries of life ; 
and as to cattle, they will be found always to thrive ben; 
in free and pure air, and nothing can hurt them more 
than to pen them up in narrow hampered booths, where

the air foon becomes foul and naufeous : hence ofteii 
fliades are, in fome cafes, preferable to clofe ftalls } and 
the larger the ftalls, the purer will be the air, and the cat- 
tle in better condition. It muft be acknowledged, that 
our fituation invites to tl^fe improvements, as the neigh- 
bourhood abounds in excellent materials, efpecially the 
hills of Turin and Pitfcandbe (this laft is a continuation 
of the other on the W. end), which contain inexhauftible 
ftores of ft one of various kinds, and of every dimenfion fit 
for ufe ; and where there are quarries now working, afto- 
niming to look at, and affording ample fubjecl: of con- 
templation and amufement to the naturalift and virtuofo; 
Gentlemen of this caft- would fometimes deign to come 
and fee, if they knew what is to be feert. Befides the dif* 
coveries to be made in the bowds of thefe hills, the ftu- 
penduous rocks that rife upon them, in proud contempt 
of human productions, may well be viewed as natural 
prodigies, and muft ftrike with amazement the eye of the 
ftnmgef. 

There is nothing obfervable in the way of antiquity* 
unlefs a ruin on the top of Turin-hill may be confidered 
in that 'light. It has evidently been anciently a ftrong 
hold, or place of - defence, confifting of various extenfive 
Contiguous buildings, with a circular citadel of about 40 
yards in diameter. The fituation has been well chofen, 
being fecured by an impregnable rock in front, much like 
the face of Salifbury Craigs, and of difficult accefs all a* 
round. It is now called Kemp or Camp Caftle. Alfo, in 
the E. end of the parrfh, on the eftate of Balmadies, there 
is a chapel-yard or burying-ground, in which it would 
feem no grave has been opened a fecond time ; and the 
tomb ftones are fo depofited, that a family hiftory might 
be collected from them for a long period back : There are

ftanding in a right line at the head of fo many parallel 
graves, which are faid to contain the afties of the parents 
and their children. At or near this cemetery, there has 
probably been a chapel or place of worlhip ; but all tradi* 
tion concerning it is loft. 

We have no uncommon migratory birds ; and it is 
doubtful, whether all birds, ufually reckoned of this clafs, 
do really belong to it. The ground of this doubt well 
appears, from the following obfervations refpe&amp;ing the 
fwallow : Owing to a hint given me by a neighbour, I 
have been, for fome feafons, pretty attentive to the firft 
appearance of this bird j but not accurate enough to mark 
the dates, till laft fpring, when, on the 2d of May 1793, 
I faw them, for the firft time, pretty early in the morning, 
in confiderable numbers on the loch (about 18 yards from 
the bottom of the garden), from which they feemed to 
be juft then in the procefs of emerging ; though, as there 
was fome rippling on the water, it was difficult to difcern 
the breaking of the furface ; but the obferver is pofitive, 
they juft then arofe from the lake, and therefore muft 
have lodged or lain fomehow at the bottom, fince the time 
of their difappearing laft year. The weather, all day, con- 
tinued as it began in the morning, moderate, with an eaTy 
breeze from S. W. ; and the fwallows, fometim.es in bo-r 
dies, fometimes in detachments, enjoyed themfelves in 
fkimming along the furface, or foaring aloft in the air, or 
fluttering about the fliores, but went very little way off 
the water till evening, when they collected over the lake, 
and difappeared within obfervation. With anxious ex- 
pectation, they were looked next morning, and all day 
through, but no appearance of them, nor for feveral days 
following 5 and, therefore, 1 there can be no doubt of their

that day's experiment, felt or judged the air not fufficient- 
ly encouraging for them to live in. Nor were they feen 
till the nth of May, when they were again obferved in 
the procefs of emerging from the lake, and continued 
playing their gambols, and fluttering about the fhores of 
it, till evening, when they difappeared as formerly, and 
were feen no more till the morning of the 21ft of May, 
when the manner of their appearing was exaftly the fame 
as before mentioned. This hit experiment fucceeded ; 
they felt, it mould feem, the temperature of the air en- 
couraging, and in a few days began to prepare their fum- 
mer dwellings. They have been known, fome feafons, to 
fhow themfelves fooner than laft year j and to go away 
ten days or a fortnight : but till laft fummer, when, it 
may be remembered, there was fome very cold, fharp, 
piercing weather, the narrator never obferved tKem to dis- 
appear twice after their firft coming : And he is now fully 
fatisfied, that the fwallow, inftead of being clafled with 
birds of paflage, mould be enrolled among the fleepers. 
But if any reader's fcepticifm mall fufpend his belief of 
this narrative, let him confider, it is no theory, but matter 
of fad, which is here narrated : And the reporter muft 
be excufed for thinking it clearly decifive of a queftion in 
the natural hiftory of this bird. If future obfervation mail

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010098">CLACKMANNAN</name>. 

(County of Clackmannan, Synod of Perth and 
Stirling, Presbytery of Stirling.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Robert Moodie.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, and Surface. 

CLACKMANNAN, fignifies the Kirk Town, or vil- 
lage of Annan •, from a well known Gaelic word, 
and Annand, the original name of the family of Annan- 
dale. In the beginning of the 12th centv -y, one of the 
firft of the Bruces who fettled in Scotlaau married Agnes 
Annand, heir to the Lordfhip of Annandale ; and foon 
after that period, the Bruces were in poflemon of Clack- 
mannan : fo that there is little doubt of this being the 
origin of the name. — This parifh is of a very irregular 
form. It extends from S. W. to N. E. nearly 6 miles, 
and about 5 miles from S. E. to N. W. At one place, 
however, it is not above 2 miles in breadth : and a dif- 
trict. of about 1300 acres of it, on the N. W. fide, is dif- 
joined from the reft of the parilh by a part of the pa- 
rifh of Alloa, of about 2 furlongs in breadth, which joins 

the

the parifh of Tillicoultry.-There are no hills in the pa. j 
nfh : the grou nd, however, is very mueh varied , but none 
* fo fteep as to interrupt the purpofes of agriculture. 

^//^.—Clackmannan is the head town of the county 1 
It is beautifully fituated on an eminence, gently rifinJ ■ 
out of a plain, from E. to W., to the height of JO o 
feet, above the level of the river Forth. On each fide 
of the village, the ground has a gradual defcent ; but is 
more bold and rapid from the W. end, where the old 
tower of Clackmannan is placed—The fcenery, beheld 
from this tower, is uncommonly picWfque and beauti- 
ful ; and has been veiwed with admiration by every tra- 
veller of tafte. The whole country around forms, as it 
were, one grand amphitheatre, where all the obj efts are 
diftinaiy feen, yet not fo near, as to difguft the eye. 
They are, at the fame time, infinitely varied. Beyond 
the town of Stirling, 9 miles to the W., the high moun- 
tains of Ben-More, Ben-Lady, and Ben-Lomond, are feen 
at the diftance of 20 miles, raifing their romantick tops 
above the clouds. From the bold fcenery of the town and 
caftle of Stirling, and the high jutting, rugged rocks a- 
round it, the river Forth defcends through a valley of fe- 
veral 1000 acres of the richeft carfe land; fometimes fplit- 
ting afunder, and forming, here and there, fmall beauti- 
ful iflands, which are always green. The fields, on eve^ 
ry fide of it, exhibit, in time of harveft, the mod lux- 
uriant, variegated, profpecl:, which the eye can behold. 
The various windings of the river are, at the fame time, 
diverfified in every poflibility of ferpentine ' form, that can 
add the moft exquifite beauty to the furrounding fcenery. 
It pafles by the village of Clackmannan, at the diftance of 
an Englifli mile to the S., where it is a mile in breadth.

Three mites below, it fpreads out, and forms the appear- 
ance of an extenfive inland lake, about 30 miles in cir- 
cumference ; having, on its different fides, the villages, 
harbours, and numerous Ihipping of Kincardine, Borrof- 
tounnefs, and Grangemouth. Ships .of various burdens 
are perpetually palling in full fail up and down the river ; 
while its banks are adorned by the feats and wooded plea- 
fure-grounds of the feveral noblemen and gentlemen ; 
fome of which are 1 laid out with much elegance and tafte. 

On the N. fide of the village of Clackmannan, a fmall 
beautiful river uTues from a deep glen, or hollow, {haded 
with large trees overhanging its banks ; and, bending for; 
a (hort fpa-ce through a verdant plain, it enters again a 
thick wood, which reaches within 200 yards of the tower, 
and which the river disjoins from the wood of Alloa, and 
the extenfive pleafure-grounds laid out by the late Earl of 
Mar : at the W. end of which* at the diftance of 2 miles 
from Clackmannan, is fituatcd the village and tower of 
Alloa,, with the harbour and (hipping. 

The view towards the N. is bounded, £t the diftance of 
4 miles, by the extenfive range of the high Ochil moun- 
tains, interfecled here and there by deep hollow glens 5 
in one of which, on a kind of promontory, with a deep 
ravine on every fide, (lands the ruins of Caftle Campbell, 
famous for being the original feat of the family of Argyll. 
Thefe monntains are covered with perpetual verdure, and 
form a fecure barrier againft the violence of the northern 
blaft. They not only add a high degree of beauty and 
grandeur to the furrounding fcenery ; they alfo fugged to 
the mind the idea of fomething more ufeful and more 
valuable, from the rich filver mines lately difcovered in 
that part of them, commonly known by the name of the 
Alva Hills. From the W. to the S. E., the view from 

Clackmannan

6o8 Statiflical Account 

Clackmannan is terminated by the Campfie Hills, and the 
high grounds in the neighbourhood of Falkirk and Lin- 
lithgow. The intermediate country is all rich and diver- 
fined : a great part of it alfo is claflick ground. Not far 
from the extenfive Carron iron works, the Tor-wood, fa- 
mous for the retreat of Sir William Wallace, appears in 
full view ; at a fmall diftance from which is feen the well 
known field of Bannockburn, the pride of the Scotch war- 
rior. — The bleak and barren track "of land, bounded by 
the Saline hills, to the E. and N. E., interfperfed here and 
there with frefli water lakes, and fome very thriving plan- 
tations, forms a ftriking contrail to the whole fcene. 

The village of Clackmannan itfelf, however, does by 
no means correfpond with a fituation fo uncommonly 
beautiful. Its ftreet is broad and regular enough ; but 
many of the houfes are wretched and mean. In the 
middle of the ftreet, ftands the tolbooth and court-houfe ; 
a heap of ruins ! and a nuifance to the publick. Here, 
however, the fherirF fometimes holds his courts * ; the 
county fiars are 'annually {truck here ; and here the mem- 
bers of parliament for the county have been always elect- 
ed. 



* The counties of Clackmannan and Stirling have one fheriff-depute 
between them ; and the moft part of the bufinefs is tranfacted by two 
fubftitutes, who have only very fmall falaries allowed for their trouble. 
Moft of the flierifF-fubftitutes in Scotland are in the fame fituation. 
Would it not be an object worthy of the attention of the legiflature, to 
have this ufeful clafs of men placed on a more independent footing, by 
allowing them falaries more adequate to the importance of the truft 
committed to them ? This could be done, either by a fmall tax on the 
fees of court, ?or in any other way that might be leaft oppreflive to 
the country. The independence of our judges is one of the greateft 
bleffings of the Britifb conftitution. Before the heritable jurifdidtions 
were abolifhed, the proprietors of the eftate of Clackmannan were he- 
ritable flieriffs of this county.

ThL is alfo one other village in the panfh, called New-

lately begun by the Devon Company in its immediate

certain profpe* of fuccefs, however, it is aftonilhing to 
fee, how little attention is paid to the form and regularity 
of its buildings. 

Climate and Difeafes.-^t climate is, upon the whole, 
rather healthy than otherwife. Though, from its vicinity 
to the Grounding hills, it is expofed to frequent and 
heavy rains, and the air thereby rendered lefs falubnous  
yet frequent inftances of longevity are found among the

* There are three bakers in the village, and eight grocers, or fliop- 
keepers. It has always had a pretty good inn; but feldom has bee. 
without a dozen of tipphng-houfes : a circumftance not very favonrable 
to the morals of the people. It has two fairs in the year ; one in June, 
and the other in September, called Bartholomew's Fair ; where horfes, 
black cattle, coarfe linen and woollen cloth, and all kinds of hardware 
and haberdlfhery goods are expofed. Formerly, this laft was a great 
market for wool brought from the fouth country : of late years, however, 
very fmall quantities of that article have been brought to it. 

There is a_tambouring fchool lately begun in the village, by fome 
Glafgow manufacturers, in which about forty young girls are taught ; but 
it is difficult as yet to fay, whether it may haye a good or a bad effecT:.

fmall pox is the molt frequent, and mpft fatal epidemical 
d,forder. The young are fubjeded. to its ravages every 
two or three years. In fome years, it is more fatal than 
m others. In 1790, almoft one half of the children, that 
were fe«ed. with it in the village of Clackmannan, died. 
Tl is is not to be wondered at : ConMenng the bad treat- 
ment, it is rather aftonilhing how any eicape. As foon 
as the infeclion has feized the child, he is put to bed j a 
large fire is kindled j he is fmothered up with blankets, 
that he may not catch cold ; while, to haften the eruption, 
a mixture of warm milk and whhlcy is, from time to time, 
poured down his throat. Among many of the farmers' 
however, and better fort of the inhabitants, inoculation is' 
become frequent, and is praftifed with great fuccefs. On- 
ly two inftances have occurred in the parifh, during the 
laft 14 years, of children dying, where this mode ha&amp;feeen 
ufed i and even thefe two inftances, it is faid, were owing 
to the parents not attending to the diredions of the fur- 
geon. Yet, notwithftanding all this, the prejudice againft 
inoculation is deeply rivetted in the minds of the great 
body of the people. They look upon it as a tempting of 
Providence ; and would confider themfelves as guilty of a 
fpecies of murder, if the event mould prove fatal. There 
have been fome inftances of children dying by the meafles 
and hooping-cough j but thefe are not numerous *.

pows or creeks in the parilh ; Clackmannan pow on the 
W. boundary, and that of Kennetpans towards the E., 
about a mile and a half diftant from the other ! both of 
which are in the diftrift of the port of Alloa. The pow 
of Clackmannan is formed by the mouth of the river 
Black Devon. The mean depth of water at the ufual 
fhipping place, is 10 feet, and 20 feet at the mouth of the 
harboiir. It was formerly crooked, and ran out a conn- 
derable way to the W. ; but was made ftreight, and deep- 
ened in 1772, by the proprietor, Sir Lawrence Dundas.

the neighbourhood. This, perhaps, may hrvc been owing to the little 
tare that is rrfken to keep the ftreets clean. Before every door is a dung- 
hill, on which every fpecies of nuifance is thrown, without the leaft re- 
gard to di-cency and cleanlinefs; fo that the infection fpreads with rapid 

progreis. • . , 

In 1789, a nervous fever, with very ardent fymptoms, proved fatal to 
feveral ltout ?oung men in the lower part of the parifli. Since that time, 
it has appeared in othc parts, but with much lefs violence ; though, in 
fome inftanees, protracted to a great length. 

* From many circumftances, it is highly probable, that the river was 
much broader at this place in former times, than L is at prefeht. A vil- 
lage, called Ferrytown, at the diftarice of five furlongs from the river, 
feems to have once flood on its banks. The intervening ground ftill goes 
by the name of Saltgrafs, and is under the level of high fpring tides, 
which ftrong fea walls, or banks, prevent from overflowing it. One of 
thefe walls feems to have been built at a very early period : too flight 
and fuperficial, however, to refift the violence of the tides, which fre- 
quently broke it down, and overflowed the land, till at length a reduc-

The tides in the river Forth, for feveral miles, both a- 
bove and below Clackmannan, exhibit a phenomenon not 
to be found (it is faid) in any other part of the globe. 
This is what the failors call a leaky tide, which happens 
always in good weather during the neap tides and fome- 
times alfo during the fpring tides, if the weather be un- 
commonly 

tion of the rent became abfolutely neceffary. By this time, the fediment 
of the river, which is a blue mud or foft clay, had again accumulated, 
and formed a confiderable track of fine rich land. In order, therefore, to 
fecure the old faltgrafs, as well as to make a new acquifition of 50 acres* 
Mr. Erlkine of Mar, the proprietor (who has been fo good as to furnifli 
an account of feveral of thefe facts), in 1776, began a new bank or 
wall, much ftronger than the former, and finiihed it in little more than 
fix months. The length of the wall is 1380 yards ; the height, 8 feet. It 
has a flope to the river of 2-§ feet for every foot of perpendicular height ; 
and the fide next the water was covered with fods, or turf, of one foot 
in thicknefs The fide next the land was fown with grafs feeds, and has 
one foot of a flope for every foot of perpendicular height. There were 
35,916 cubical yards of earth moved to form this wall, befides 915 yard* 
for turf; making in whole 36.S31 cubical yards, at 5 d. the yard'. The 
whole expence amourted to about 786I. Sterling. This, however, has 
not only effectually fecured the old faltgrafs land ; it has alfo gained 50 
acres of new land; which (deducting the repairs the old wall mult have 
received) yielded, during the firft feven years of a leafe, an intereft of 4 
per cent, for the money laid out ; and the remaining twelve years, an 
intereft of 7 per cent. It will probably amount to 12 per cent, when the 
prefent leafe expires, as the land is of the richeft quality. A great error 
was committed by the tenant who got the leafe of this new land. In- 
ftead of allowing it to remain in grafs for fome years, it was imme- 
diately ploughed, and thereby prevented from confolidating in a proper 
manner. The confequence was, it remained much longer in a wet ftate 
than arable land ought to do. 

This error was avoided, when, feveral years afterwards, another 
track of land, adjoining to the above, was in the fame manner gained 
from the river, to the eftate of Lord Dundas. It was paftured upwards 
of feven years; and the good effects now appear: it produces the molt 
luxuriant crops. The expence attending this acquifition did not exceed 
ene-third part of the former. Befides, a part of the wall enclofing it is

Sled the Crook of Devon. It panes the Rumbhng

of land formed by the river in the fame manner as the above, to the BL 
cf th? harbour of Kennetpans, belonging to Mr. Bruce ot Kennet, and 
rrtiich that gentleman alfo propofes to embank. 

Such undertakings, when properly conduct, are attended with many 
advantage.-. They not only add to the extent and value of eftates, but 
the, alfo contribute very much to the Met) of the navigation, by con- 
traain* the river, and thereby clearing and deepening its channel. 

There was formerly a falmon fifhing on the river Forth at this place ; 
but it has been difcontmued for fifteen years. Previous to that period, 
the falmon was commonly fold here at i d. the pound. There are always 
a few cruives placed in the river, in which a variety of fmall fifll are

one. The eftimate of the expence amounted only to a- 
bout 2000I. pounds Sterling. Had this plan been carried 
into execution, a track of more than 10,000 acres of coal, 
at prefent entirely locked up from the fea fale, would 
have been expofed to the publick market ; befides many 
other advantages of trade, that muft have accrued to the 
neighbouring country. The extenfive ifen works now be- 
gun by the Devon Company, on the banks of this river, 
renders it highly probable, that the plan will ftill be exe- 
cuted ; the advantage of water carriage being fo much 
fuperior to that of land. The Devon abounds in trout,-

and falmon are fometimes caught in it, which come up 
from the river Forth, in time of fpawning : a pra&amp;ice, 
however, very deftructive to the fifnery. 

There is another river called Black Devon, which takes 
its rife in the Saline Hills j and, running W. through the 
middle of this parifh, falls into the.Forth at Clackmannan 
pow. In its courfe, it fupplies with water two corn mills 
and a lint mill.' Two water lades, or aqueduas, are alfo 
taken off from it ; one of which drives an engine on the 
Clackmannan coal, and the other fupplies a great refer- 
voir which drives the engine on the Alloa coal. This re- 
fervoir goes by the name of Gartmorn Dam j but it is in 
faft a fmall beautiful lake, of 130 acres in extent, having 
a little illand in the middle of it, and abounds with perch, 
fome pike, and various kinds of trout. Part of it is in 
the parim of Alloa ; but by far the greateft part is in the 
parifh of Clackmannan. There is another fmall lake in 
the parilh, called Tullygarth Dam, confifting of 45 acres 
in extent, where a few fifh are fometimes to be found. 
Jn time of great drought alfo, the river Black Devon, at 
one place,' forms the appearance of a fmall lake, by hav- 
ing its water collecled together, for the fupply of the mills 
and 'coal machinery.

juft mentioned (one only excepted), form but a fmall part 
of their landed property. They all poflefs eftates in other 
parifhes ; and the confequence is, only two of them have 
their refidence here. The eftate of Clackmannan, belonging 
to Lord Dundas, is ftric~tly entailed, as well as the eftate be- 
longing to Mr. Erfkine of Mar. The houfe upon the eftate 
of Clackmannan is almoft a ruin, and not fit to be inhabit- 
ed ; the proprietor, however, it is faid, intends to take the 
advantage of fo delightful a fituation, and to build a houfe 
fuited to it, near to the fite of the old tower. From the 
feat of the family of Mar being at Alloa, in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood, there never was a houfe upon their 
eftate in this parifh. The houfe upon the eftate of Sauchy 
is placed at the diftance of about 60 yards within the pa* 
rifh of Alloa but the greateft part of the pleafure^grounds, 
and even part of the garden, are in the parifti of Clack- 
mannan. The pleafure-grounds are laid out and beauti- 
fied with much tafte and judgment. A great part of thefe 
grounds, when in the pofleffion of Sir John Shaw, once 
s formed a deer park, confifting of 100 acres, and furround- 
ed by a very high wall. The only houfe in the parifh, 
that deferves the name of elegant, is juft now finifhed by- 
Mr. Bruce of Kennet, from a beautiful defign of Mr. 
Harrifon of Lancafter. Placed in one of the fineft fixa- 
tions the country affords, it is alfo built in a ftyle of fu- 
perior elegance to moft of the houfes to be met with in 
Scotland •, and exhibits in all its paVts an equal attention 
to convenience and utility, as it does to elegance and 
tafte. 

Soil, Acres, Rent, &amp;c— The parifli of Clackmannan

of them nearly ready for cutting. There are upwards of 
20 acres of mofs in the parifh, and 70 acres of land from 
which the mofs has been removed, now under pafture and 
hay. A cold clay foil, with a wet bottom, predominated 
over a very great part of the 'parifh ; fome of it fo poor 
indeed as not to be worth the labouring. A few fpots 
however of a light dry foil, and even of a rich black loam, 
with a fine bottom, are to be found here and there. Part 
of the land in the neighbourhood of the villiage is of this 
quality ; and accordingly the rent of it is proportionably 
high. ' But the richeft and largeft track of land lies on the 
banks of the river Forth, confiding of 1000 acres of ex-; 
Cellent carfe foil, all very fertile. From this, it will eafily* 
appear, that the rent of the land mult be very much va- 
ried, according to its quality ; rifing from almoft nothings 
to 43s. the acre. The real rent of the parifh is 4700L 
Sterling, and is approaching towards 5000 1., as- the pre- 
fent leafes expire. The valued rent is 9155I. 17I. 
Scotch which probably was the real rent at the time of- 
the valuation. 

State of Agriculture, &amp;c— The agriculture of this partfk 
has undergone a very great change during thefe laft 15 
years. Many of the farms have been greatly enlarged % 
which has enabled the tenant to adopt every new im- 
provement. The fuccefs of one has induced others to fol- 
low the example : and at this time, almoft all the farmers.

formerly followed, of a continued rotation of beans, bar- 
ky, and oats, on the beft lands, that of fummer fallow, 
wheat, beans, barley, grafs, and oats, is now univerfally 
adopted ; while the lands of inferior quality have crops 
fuited to their foil. The foil in general is not favourable 
for turnips ; yet where it is favourable, thefe have been 
4bwn, and with fuccefs. The moft part of the wet lands 
have been drained, and the ridges made ftreight *, and 
thrown into a proper fize. Two horfe ploughs, of Small'* 
conftru&amp;ion, are ufed over all the parifh. 

But the moft material circumftance, in favour of th&amp; 
agriculture of this parifh, is a fpirit of emulation that was, 
with much propriety, raifed amongft the ploughmen them- 
felves. About 10 years ago, a number cf gentlemen in 
this neighbourhood formed themfelves uko a fociety, un- 
der the name of the Clackmanna:rfhh z Farmer Club, for 
promoting the purpofes of agriculture. One ox theiv firffc

Windfor, where it was expected he was to continue, He carried a plough 
With him from Scotland, and began his work in prefence of his Majeftjr, 
and a number of noblemen and gentlemen. It was acknowledged, that, 
land fo well ploughed had never before been feen in that country. Next* 
morning, however, inftead of going to his work, as he wat defired the* 
preceding evening, he was told, M Not to go near the King's farm at 
" Windfor, on any account whatever, nor to have the fmalleft inter- 
« courfe with any of his Majefty's farm iervants." After receiving a 
reward for his trouble, he left his plough, by fpecial defire, and returned 
to Scotland. It is difficult to conceive, how, in this inftanca, the jea- 
Joufy of the Englifli ploughmen prevented the falutary effects intended by 
this- i 11 ftr actor.

acre. But thefe are very rare : for when at any time the. 
xrop is uncommonly luxuriant, it is generally lodged by 
-the heavy rains, which are frequent here in the month of 
Auguft, and thereby rendered of little value. The aver- 
age produce of the whole of crop 1792, even from the 
Left lands, did not exceed 4 bolls the acre. The confe- 
quence was, that hardly any of the tenants were able to 
pay, from this crop, above a third part of their rent; 
while fome had not as much as defrayed the expences of 
feed and labour. In this ftate of real diftrefs to the fmal\ 
tenants, fome of the proprietors, with much humanity,

their tenants, and lengthened out the term of payment t©

* The farmers here have fome advantages, and fome cflfadvantages, 
' which perhaps are not peculiar to them. Thirlage is fortunately abolifh- 
ed over the greateft part of the parifli 5 but where it is not, it is ftill a 
caufe of much complaint, and of real lofs to the farmer. It is, indeed, 
a curfe of an unknown magnitude ; and it is aftonifhing how proprietors of 
land,' who have it in their power, do not fee their own intereft inputting 
an end to it altogether. Where it does exift, nearly a tenth boll is paid 
for grinding the corn. Yet, notwithftanding this, there is not a farmer 
who would not willingly mate a reafonable allowance for the mill rent. 
What lofs then can proprietors fuftain ? Let them think for a moment ; 
let them confider the hardlhips to which they expofe the very perfons, 
whom it is their intereft as well as duty to encourage and protect. A fmall 
farmer (we fliall fuppofe), who pays the higheft demand for his little 
fpot (and muft pay it), toils and labours, with unremitting attention, t9 
make it produce what is fufficient to fupport his family, and to anfvver 
the term day of his landlord. He is furely entitled to bring the produce 
of his labour to the beft market. Inftead of this, however, he dare not 
fell one boll of oats, without being ftibjedled to a penalty. He muft 
take them all to the mill, and intruft them, for days and nights, to the 
care of perfons, in whom he very often can place no confidence : while 
at the fame time, he expofes them to be deftroyed by the numerous 
(warms of vermin which ufually frequent thefe places. His family fuffers :

to be wrought about 30 years ago, and are working * the 
pre font trffae. The coal Mo Zey feam is alfo working at 
pre.cn! . : it was begun in 1792 , previous to that J 
it could not be wrought to kiif advantage. In this coal 
work, the method called the long way , is now introduced • 
that is, no part of the coal is left for pillars, but the whole 
taken out, which faves a great part of the coal. In fome 
Of the pits, the coal is brought to the top by women 
and boys ; and in others, by means of machinery. The 
coal is kept dry by means of an engine driven by water; 
Which is much lefs expenfive than a fire engine. The' 
price of coal varies according to the demand. In general, 
the price of great coal upon the hill is 5 s. the ton; of 
chows, 4s.. About 7000 tons are annually exported to 
Leith, Dunbar, Perth, Dundee, Montrofe, and other places, 
Thefe are taken to the harbour in waggons of a ton and 
a half : the mean diftance from the pits being about three 
quarters of a mile *. 

The working of the Sauchy coal is of a very old date. 
It is kept dry by a very powerful fire engine. It confift* 
of 4 fcams : the firft, or uppermoft, is 3 feet thick ; the 
fecond is 5 feet ; but this one has no roof, fo that it has 
never been wrought : the third is 5 feet, and is an excel- 
lent coal : the fourth is 9 feet: This laft, however, is 16 
fathoms below the bottom of the prefent engine pit, which 
is 47 fathoms deep. Previous to this period, a great part 
of the Sauchy coal has been exported ; but as it is now in 
the poffeffion of the Devon Company, it is highly pro- 
bable, 

* A collier, with his wife and daughter, earns 12s. in five days, which 
3s all the time he works in the week. Befides this, he has his meal from

table, that the moft of it will be ufed for their iron 
work. 

The Kennet coal confifts of two feams ; one of 30 inches 
thick, and another of 36. It was given up in 1726, and 
began again to be wrought in 1759. It has at prefent a 
fmall nre engine; but it is probable, it was once level 
free, as there is no trace remaining of any engine being 
upon it when it was firft wrought. The diftilleries in the 
parifh confume a great part of this coal. It produces 
yearly about 6000 tons of great coal, behdes a confider- 
able quantity of chows. After the year 1788, when the 
diftilleries were flopped, about 2000 tons were yearly 
{hipped fcr Leith. It has alfo a very extenfive laud fale *. 

&amp;ijli!!cr'u*s.— r T\\e two great diftilleries of Kilbagie and 
Kennetpar.s are both in the parilh of Clackmannan ; and, 
previous to the year 1788, the manufacture of Scotch fpi- 
rits was carried on at them to an extent hitherto unknown 
in this part of the illand of Great Britain. The diftillery 
laws have undergone various changes in Scotland. Be- 
fore the year 1784, the duty was levied by a prefumptive 
charge upon the warn (that is, fermented worts), taking 
it for granted, that the warn would produce one-fourth 
part in low wines, and that thefe low wines would pro- 
duce three-fifth parts in fpirits : hence, 100 gallons of warn

Formerly there were fait pans in this parifla, both at Kennetpans and 
•at Clackmannan pow, owing perhaps Jo the coal being fo readily pro-

w*s fuppofcd to yield 15 gallons of fpirits, and duty was 
charged accordingly; but inftead of 15, 20 gallons of fpirits 
were often drawn from the 100 of wafh. In Scotland, the 
furplus above 15 gallons was uniformly ieized, as fpirits 
prefumed to be fraudulently obtained ; while in England 
the diflillcr was allowed the full exercife of his genius, 
and got permits for the removal of his actual produce. At 
this period, the quantum of duty on a gallon of fpirits 
was more than double of what it has ever been fince. 
But the high rate of duty afforded fuch temptation to 
fmuggling, that the confumption of fpirits in Scotland 
was chiefly fupplied by the manufacture of illegal frills, 
and by fmuggling from abroad. Great difliliers could not 
fmuggle ; and being continually fubjetted to the furveys 
of the excife, the two diftilleries of Kilbagie and Ken- 
netpans depended entirely on the London market for the 
fale of their produce ; where, previous to the year 1784, 
they carried on an advantageous trade : though the duty 
on a gallon of fpirits in England was 1 3^ pence higher than 
in Scotland ; and though they had, at (hipping their feints 
for England, to pay down this difference on every gallon 
fhipped. In 1784, a law was paffed, rendering the duties, 
and mode of levying them, the fame both in Scotland as in 
England ; and at the fame time reducing the rate of duty 
each gallon about one half of what it had been formerly ; 
while it allowed the manufacturer a credit for 20 gallons 
of fpirits from the 100 gallons of wafh, and granted per- 
mits accordingly. The London difliliers expected, that 
by this equalization plan, the Scotch could not continue 
their trade to London, and pay the duties in the fame 
manner with themfelves. But in this they were miflaken ; 
for the trade increafed. And it is the opinion of the befl 
informed difliliers, that the London differs are not a 

match

match for the Scotch under an equal law. This mode 
waS continued till July 1786, when the licenfe aft took 
place, impofing 30s. a gallon yearly on the contents of eve, 
ry ftill ufed for delation in Scotland  continuing the laft 
plan with refpett to England (where the duty amounted 
to 28. 6d. for the gallon of fpirits), and impofing an ad- 
ditional duty of 28. on the gallon of fpirits fent from Scot- 
land to England : which additional duty was to be paid m 
London, on the arrival of the fpirits in the river Thames. 

This a&amp; was palled as an experiment, and was to con- 
tinue for two years. Under it, the London diftillers expeftr 
ed, that the Scotch could not continue the trade to Lent 
don. This trade, however, ftill continued to increafe ; 
which increafed alfo die aftonimment of the London trad- 
ers, who gave in a reprefentation to the Treafury upon 
the' fubjea. In confequence of which, and upwards of 
fix months previous to the natural expiration of the law, 
another law was paired, impofing a duty of 6d. a gallon 
on all Scotch fpirits fent to England, in addition to the 
former 2 s. ; while the duty on fpirits manufactured in Eng- 
land was allowed to remain at the is. 6d. When this aft was 
paffed, the Scotch diftilleries (lopped payment. The law 
continued in this way'till July 1788, when the licenfe duty 
in Scotland was doubled, and made 3I. a gallon, on the 
contents of the ftill ; and at the fame time laying the 
trader under fuch reftriftions, when he worked for Eng- 
land, as to amount to a prohibition againft his entering 
that market. And in July 1 793, the licenfe has been raifed 
to 9I. Sterling a gallon yearly. Previous to the year 1788, 
the quantity of corn ufed annually at the diftillery of 
I£ilbagie alone, amounted to above 60,000 bolls, and the 
annual quantity of fpirits made, to above 3000 tons. The 
black cattle fed annually were about 7000 •, fwine 2000.

The cattle were fold to butchers, who drove them to the 
Edinburgh and Glafgow markets : the fwine were killed 
and cured into bacon and pork for England. The work 
people employed were nearly 300. The diftillery and 
utenfils coft upwards of 40,000 1. Sterling; and when fold 
by the truftee for the creditors of the former proprietor, 
yielded about 7000 1, Sterling. 

No fituation could have been more eligible for a diftil- 
lery than Kilbagie ; and it was erected in the moft fub- 
ftantial manner. The buildings occupy a fpace of above 4 
acres of ground ; all furrounded by a high wall. The 
barns for malting are of a prodigious fize, and are 4 Ho- 
nes in height, A fmall rivulet runs through the middle 
of the works, and drives a threfhihg mill, and all the 
grinding mills necefiary for the diftillery j befides Apply- 
ing with water a canal, which communicates with the 
river Forth, of about a mile in length, cut for the pur- 
pofe of conveying both the imports and exports of the dif- 
tillery. 

The diftillery at Kennetpans, which is advantageoufly 
fituated on the very banks of the river Forth, was in pro- 
portion to that of Kilbagie, as three to five. And before 
thefe two diftilleries were flopped, they paid to govern- 
ment an excife duty confiderably greater than the whole 
land tax of Scotland. At prefent, the duty paid by both 
is about 8000 1. Sterling yearly. There is an engine, of 
Bolton and Watt's conftruction, at the diftillery of Ken- 
netpans ; being the firft of the kind that was erected in 
Scotland.

tent. Thefe confift at prefent of two blaft furnaces, and 
are fituated on the banks of the river Devon, near to the* 
old tower of Sauchy. The fituation, and fmgular ■ con- 
ftruaion of the Devon iron works, begun in July 1792, 
merit the attention of the curious in mechanicks and ar- 
chiteaure. A fteep bank rifes more than 50 feet above 
the level of the river, and is compofed of a mock, or very 
thick ftratum of free-ftone, very dry and uniform in its 
texture, and almoft free from cracks and fiffuresi Inftead 
of the ufual method of building with (tone and lime, the 
feveral parts of the works have been formed in this bank, 
by excavations made in the rock. Two furnaces, which 
are each above 40 feet high, and 14 feet diameter, and alfo 
the fpacious arches which give accefs to the workmen, at 
the bottom of the furnace, to draw off the liquid metal 
and flag, are cut out of the rock. The roof which covers 
the cafting houfe, a room 70 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 
23 feet high, is fupported by the fides of the quarry, and 
the folid pillars of the rock that were left for this purpofe 
in making the excavation. In like manner, is formed the 
engine houfe, and its apparatus, which is intended to fupply 
the two furnaces with wind, by throwing at each vibra- 
tion of the engine a fuflicient quantity of air, out of a 
large cylinder, into a long gallery or clofe mine, formed 
in the rock. This magazine of v/ind will contain above 
10,000 cubic feet of air, much condenfed by the power of 
the engine, as the gallery is very clofely {hut up, and made 
air-tight ; having only two apertures, one to receive the 
fupply of air from the air pump, and the other to admit a 
pipe that conducts the condenfed air to blow the two 
furnaces.

* This undertaking muft already have coft a large fum of money, al- 
though as yet only in its infant ftate : but the advantages that muft re- 
sult from it to every clafe of people, and to the landholders of this c*unty 
in particular, give great caufe to wiffi for its extenfion and profperity. 
The fituation has many peculiar advantages. The whole country around 
it abounds in coal, as well as in ftrata of iron-ftone ; and a vein of rich 
kidney iron ore, 18 inches thick, has been found in one of the neigh- 
bouring Kills. There is alfo a very fine lime-ftone rock, within a few 
miles of it, lately discovered in the Menftry hills, belonging to Major 
General Abercromby of Tullibody. So that when we add to all thefe 
advantages, the practicability of cutting a navigable eanal to join the river 
Forth, we may reafbnably expect that this undertaking will prove fuc- 
cefsful. 

f In the year 175^, the number of fouls in the parifti of Clackmannan 
was, according to Dr. Webfter's report, 1913 ; fo that there is an in- 
Creafe fince that period of 615. This may eafiiy be accounted for, from 
the number of people who, for many years, crowded to this place, in 
order to be employed at the diftilleries. It is probable, that the number 
of colliers has alfo increafed ; of thefe, there are in the prefent lift 605 
fouls. Previous to the year 1788, the" numbers in the parifli were ninth 
greater than in 1791; for when the diftilleries gave over working, a

been the. feat of the chief of the Bruces fn Scotland. It is 
not certain,, however, at what precife period John de 
Bruce, third fon of Robert, one of the Earls of Annan- 
dale, became proprietor of it. King David II. gave it to 
his kinfman, Robert Bruce, the firft laird of Clackmannan. 
(Diletlo confanguineoy faith the charter, dated at Perth the 
9th of December, a. regni 39), which muft have been a 
very fhort time only before his death. It is probable, in^

during the firft part of his reign ; fince we find, that, in

his publick accounts there *. 

The .old tower, which ftill remains, is faid to have been 
built by King Robert Bruce. From the ftyle of the budd- 
ing, indeed (for there is no date upon it), it appears to 
have been ereded about his time j and, from feveral names 
of places, we may conclude, that &amp; adually was the refi- 
dence of fome of the kings ; as the following names feem 
to indicate ; King's Seat Hill, King's Meadow Park, and 
others of a fimilar nature, in the vicinity of the tower. 
The greateft height of this tower is 79 feet. It contains 
a variety of apartments, and has been furrounded by a 
moat, with a draw-bridge, part of which ftill remains.

for many ages, the chief refidence of one of the moft an-

Reader, 

Since we are to fpeak of the genealogie of that heroick Prince King- 
Robert Bruce, take notice, in the firft place, that this firname (whither 
corruptly pronounced for Le Preux (the valiant), as in the old record* 
it is oftentimes written Le Breufe, or a Topicall firname De Bruis, from 
a town and caftle of that name in the Grifons country, hath originally 
from France; where, about the year 1145, lived Peter Brucie, famous 
for writing againft the Romifh errors of tranfubftantiation, whofe fol- 
lowers, by the Popifh writers, are' {tiled Petro Brufiani. About the year 
1050, divers noblemen of Normandy, coming over with Emma, fet- 
tled themfelves in England ; after her death (being hated of the Englifh) 
were forced to retire for Scotland, which was then nearly allied to the 
Duke of Normandy, by reafon that King Kenneth the III. and King 
Malcolm the II. married two daughters of that houfe amongft the reft. 

I. Adelme le Bruis, Preos or Breos (for fo diverfly is he named), ob- 
tained in Scotland the lands of Bouilden. This Adelme joined, in the 
year 1066, with William the Baftard, Duke of Normandy, in the con- 
queft of England ; and, for his valiant fervice, was highly rewarded with 
great lands there, namely, the caftle and barony of Skelton, and lordfhip 
of Cleveland, the lands of Hert, HertnefTe, Hertlepool, Danby, Leving- 
ten, Yarum, Guifburgh, Shorp, Sibthrop, Carleten, Weftly Brofton (

W years, and after his father's death, joined in the Re- 
beJUon m 1715 ; in conference of which, the title was 
attainted—The queflion, therefore, is, whether this Robert 
was to be confidered as dead in law, upon his being con 
demned (which was before his father died), fo that no 
after deed of his could afFeft the title as to the next heir  
If this be the cafe, as the title is faid to be to heirs whatl 
foever, Mr. Bruce of Kennet muft have a juft claim to the 
title of Burleigh,, by virtue of his grandmother's right, as 
the other filler was never married.

fones; ift. Adam, Lord of Skelton ; ad. Robert, Lord of Annandale. 
He founded the priory of Guifburgh, anno nao, and endowed it richly 
with lands and tythes. He affifted St. David, then Earle Huntingtone, 
in founding the abbey of Selkirk, which afterwards, when he came to 
the Crown, tranfpcfrted to Kelfo. This Lord Robert, as witnefs in the 
charter of mortification, has contributed his lands of Bouilden for increaf. 
ing the patrimony thereof. He died anno 1141, and was buried in the 
monaftery of Guifburgh : fo that they are miftaken who account this 
♦.obert to be the man who affifted William the Conqueror anno 106?,

Chefter, and got with her the lordfhip of Garioch. He was, for his ex- 
ceeding valour, firnamed the Noble. In the year 1264, he, with John

Henry the III.' of England againft the Barons. 

VII. Robert, his fon, fifth of that name, Lord of Annandale and Ga-

The clandeftine marriage, fpoken of by our hiftorians, was not be- 
twixt her and the Lord Robert Bruce, but with Thomas Mackintagart, 
her firft hufband ; who (being Earl of Carrick in her right), in the year 
1370, was fent with other noblemen to the wars of the Holy Land with 
iooo foldiers; and, dying there without ifiue, left his lady a widow, 
whofe marriage the King procured to his coufin Lord Robert Bruce, 
whereby he became Earl of Carrick. She bare many children to him ;

to Donald Earl of Mar. Second daughter Eufeme, married to Sir Tho-

Third, Marjory, married Sir Neill Campell of Loch. The fourth 
married to Sir Chriftopher Scaton of Seaton. This Robert is he 
who contended with Baliol, for the crown, and being perfidioufly ufed 
by King Edward Long Shanks (who made ufe of his power and friends 
to conquer Scotland, under pretence of maintaining his title), at length 
jerceaveing the treachery, and labouring in vain to get his fon, the 
Lord Robert Bruce, in his own power, whom King Edward caufed 
to be kecpt in Cailis as a pledge to bind his father to his fervice, 
and fo to withdraw himfelf into Scotland, brocken with grief and in- 
dignation. As he returned from! Hert to Annandale, he deceafed in 
the way, about Pafche 1304, and was buried in the monaftery of Holm 
Coultran. Obferve, here the reader is admonilhed of fome miftakes in 
writers of hiftory ; fome placing another Robert betwixt this Earl of 
Carrick and Robert the Noble, who married one of the heirs" of Htfnt- 
ingtoun ; fome afkrting that Robert the Noble himfelf was Baliol's com- 
petitor ; fome writing that Robert Earl of Carrick, who contended with 
Baliol, was the fame which afterwards fo happily came to the crown ; 
Whereas indeed Robert the Noble was father to the Earl of Carrick, and 
dyed before Alexander the III. King Robert alfo was but a child of ten 
•r twelve years in the time of contention, his father bemg ftill alive, who 
(as faid is) dyed anno 1304.

7?i feet from a high tower, and was little hurt; the very 
fame perfon, fometime after, fell 30 feet from the roof of

old coal-pit, 70 feet deep, and was got out fafe, having 
only his thigh bone broken. Thefe old open coal-pits, 
without the leaft fence around them, are frequent in all 
the collieries of this parilh. They are a pubhek nuifance, 
by which the lives of men are often expofed to real dan- 
ger.

while the other remained healthy. The bark was entire 
all round the trunk ; but the healthy branches continued 
yearly to decreafe a little. No farther obfervations, how- 
ever, can now be made upon it : for though it appeared to 
be a great natural curiofity, yet the proprietor, it feems, has 
not confidered it in this point of view, and, not thinking 
of the philofophical purpofes to which it might have been 
fubfervient, has lately cut it down. 

This parilh ftill opens a wide field for improvements of 
various kinds. There was formerly a ferry boat on the 
river Forth, oppofite the village of Clackmannan. This 
■would ftill be of great ufe and convenience to the country, 
both to the north and fouth. The harbour at Clackman-

built at that place, fo as to have many advantages of fixa- 
tion. 

The whole county of Clackmannan, and this parifh in 
particular, has long laboured under the greateft inconve- 
nience, from the uncommonly bad Hate of the public

THE FAIR ISLE. 
(County of Orkney.) 



TT is remarkable, that there mould be lying, at no 
JL greater diftance from us than half way between Ork- 
ney and Shetland, an Ifle,'whofe inhabitants feem to be 
as yet, almoft in a ftate of nature. The account of a 
fouth-fea ifland, could hardly attract more our curiofity. 
What feems to explain the Angularity of the cafe, is, the 
fmall fize of the Fair Ifle, and its lying remote from any 
neighbouring ones ; from which circumftances, it has nei- 
ther been in a condition to defend itfelf, on account of the 
fcanty number of its inhabitants, nor to obtain aid from 
thofe of other places. That it -was in former times pecu- 
liarly expofed to invaders and ravagers, appears from hif- 
tory. " The natives (fays Buchanan, who wrote in the 
century before laft), are by far the pooreft of all others \ 
for the fimermen from England, Holland, and other ma- 
ritime regions, who every year frequent thofe fcas, feize 
upon and carry away every thing, as they pleafe." Hence,

although fuch depredations have ceafed, thofe iflanders arc 
but hardly at this day emerging from the effects of fo 
precarious and diftrefsful a condition ; and beginning to 
form fomething like a fettled and a comfortable fociety. 

The Fair Ifle belongs to the parim of Dunroffnefs in 
Shetland • and the following account of it is taken from 
a paper drawn up by the Rev. Mr. Barry, minifter of 
Shapinlhay, in Orkney. 



The name of this ifle, perhaps may be derived from its 
being distinctly marked in the ocean, and feen by ma- 
riners at a great diftance feldom covered with fog arid, 
on a nearer approach, exhibiting its lofty heads, clothed 
with considerable verdure. Buchanan defcribes it with a 
good deal of accuracy. " Fara, or, The Fair IJle is a 
confpicuous object (fays he), both to the Orkneys and to 
Shetland. It rifes into three very high promontories, en* 
compaffed with lofty rocks ; and is every where inaccef- 
fible, unlefs upon the S. E., where, lowering itfelf a little, 
it affords a fafe Station for fmall veffels." It is 30 miles 
diftant from the moft northerly of the Orkney iflands, and 
24 from the S. part of Shetland ; extending in length from 
N. E. to S. W. upwards of 3 miles, and nearly 2 in 
breadth. 

The promontories are Malcolm's Head on the W., the 
Wart or Wardhill on the N. E., and the Sheep Craig at 
the S. E. extremity. This laft is a Stupendous and mag- 
nificent objea 5 a huge mafs of rock rifing in a conical 
form as it were from the ocean, to the height of 480 feet, 
and almoft entirely feparatcd from the ifland, either by

, 2 acres, produces a kind of grafs that maintains annually

their wool, as for the value of their carcaffes In feveral 
parts of this folitary Hie, where the rock has been foft or 
a ftratum of clay has prefented its furface the fea ha. 
dug many deep gulfs or gullies to a confutable dis- 
tance. Of this kind is the one on the S. E. fide of the 
ifland, called Stromceiler ; in which, tradition afferts, one 
of the mips of the Spanifh Armada, in the year 1588, 
fuffered fhipwreck. The inhabitants believe me is now 
converted into a rock, and covered with fea weed. Cap- 
tain Roe, from England, in 1740, when fifhmg the 
wreck, was fortunate enough to raife two brafs guns, of a 
large fize, and fome other articles of lefs value •, but hav- 
ing loft a man in the attempt, he defifted. About the 
year 1770, a fhip bolt, long and thick, with ftones ad- 
hering, was thrown afhore in a neighbouring gulf, and 
is now in the pofleffion of James Stewart, Efq. the pro- 
prietor. To the eye of a fpeaator who delights to con- 
template the wild irregularities of Nature, there is every 
where much entertainment. In one place, the rocks raife 
their bold brows, and ftretch out as it were to bid defi- 
ance to the fury of the ocean •, in another, they feem to 
Ihrink back, and are cut into immenfe caves and deep 
gulfs, that threaten to undermine and tear in pieces the 
whole ifland. Its extremities are all of them high ; the 
middle part is lower, and more level ; and the whole fur- 
face 01 it, which amounts to about 1800 acres, except in 
a very few fpots, is covered with knolis or hillocks. There 
5s, on the N. E. corner, a harbour for fmall craft, where

The people in this ifland are. increafing confiderably in 
number ; for in the laft 8 years, there have been 11 mar- 
riages, 64 births, and only 27 funerals. Since it came 
into the hands of the prefent proprietor, who purchafed 
it at a judicial fale from the Sinclairs of Quandel, the 
population has increafed one-fourth; and though it has 
not been in his poflelTion much above 20 years, it has 
brought him nearly triple his purchafe-money. The caufes 
of this profperity are various. Their pafture ground is 
very good ; on which they have 400 fheep, whofe wool 
and mutton are equally excellent, and alfo nearly 200 black 
cattle, befides fome goats, which have been lately im- 
ported, and horfes, which, for domeftick purpofes, they 
bring from Shetland. All thefe they take particular care 
of, and turn their produce to the beft account, in their 

fituatiom 



Of the Fair IJIe* 



foliation. Their arable land is about 75 acres ; and as it 
is divided among them in fmall and nearly equal parcels, 
every man attentively labours his little fpot with the fpade, 
there not being a plough in the whole illand. As the 
ftiores are high, and the water deep, they have little or 
no accefs to fea weed, which in the Orkneys is fo much 
ufed as a manure, and therefore they are obliged to have 
recourfe . to dung or compoft, by means of which their 
lands produce alternately excellent oats and barley. Thefe 
are the only grains they raife ; and when they have cul- 
tivated their land for two years, and had a crop of each 
kind, they lay it down to reft for one year, when they 
begin the fame courfe as formerly. They manufacture 
a little kelp in the fummcr feafon. 

Their boats* which are 14 in number, lie on the S. 
W. lhore, under the little town of Gelah, from which 
they go with only 2 or 3 men in themj who fit in the 
middle of the boat, and, with an oar in each hand, row 
over immenfe billows, in a fliort time, to a great diftance. 
In thefe pitiful fkiffs, in which a landman would fcarcely 
truft his life acrofs a river, they fly to the fifhing ground, 
almoft out of fight of the illand, where they catch plenty 
of fine code,' ling, tufk, fkate, holibut, mackerel, cyth, and 
other fifh of inferior quality. Thefe, together with their 
hens, chickens, fheep, eggs, &amp;c. they afterwards carry to 
fhips, which they obferve in the offing, though at the 
diftance of 15 or 20 miles, and barter them to great ad- 
vantage, for various articles of food and clothing. They 
fpin alfo excellent linen yarn, and difcovcr much dexte- 
rity in manufaduring their fine foft wool into ftockings, 
gloves, nightcaps, and other wearing apparel. If they do 
not difpofe of their whole fifh, mutton, hens, ftockings,

they refervc the remainder for the payment of their rents, 
which in whole amount to about 8ol. Sterling annually. 
The proprietor, abundantly fenfible that their money is 
fcarce, and indeed almoft unneceflary, receives his rents 
in the articles they can beft fpare , he furnifhes them with 
thofe they ftand moll in need of, and, in return, takes 
what they either raife from the ground, or procure by 
purchafe or manufacture. The ifland is reckoned one of 
the Shetland ifles ; and the cultivated ground in it, like 
that of Shetland, is divided into mark lands, according to 
which, it pays cefs, as there has been no valuation in 
that country. It makes part of the county of Orkney, 
pays a feu-duty of 200 merks to Lord Dundas, and 34 1. 
Scotch, compounded vicarage teind, to the minifter of 
Dunroffnefs, as belonging to his parifh. From its fertility 
in raifing excellent grain, its affording pafturc for plenty 
of fheep and black cattle, from the myriads of fifh, of the 
largeft fize and of the fineft quality, that perpetually fwim 
around its coafts, fome are of opinion, it would be an ex- 
cellent fiftiing ftation. 

The people are all of them fober, prudent, and induf- 
trious : The men are remarkable for ftrength and vigour,
