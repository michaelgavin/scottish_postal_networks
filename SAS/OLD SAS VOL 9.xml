* This feems to be exaggerated, as Mr Keith fays the 
number in 1750 was only 1302. 

-j- This, for the reafons afligned by Mr Gillies, feems to be 
exaggerated. 

X Mr Maxwell does not afcertain the precife number •, but 
as he mentions that the town of Stewartown " has increafed 
fome hundreds, fince he was fettled," ( which was in 1758) 
the population in 1793 is probably rather above than below 
3000.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2287588">RUTHERGLEN</name>. 

(County of Lanark, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Glasgow.) 

By the Rev. Mr David Ure, A. M.</head> 



<p>Extent, Surface, &amp;c. 

THE parifh of Rutherglen extends, on the fouth bank 
of the river Clyde, about 3 miles in length, and a- 
bout i£ in breadth. It contains fome of the moll fertile 
and beautiful plains, that are to be met with in the flrath. 
of Clyde. Thefe plains comprehend the eftates of Shaw- 
field, Farme, Hamilton-farm and Rofebank. They are 
partly fecured againft inundations from the river, by artifi- 
cial banks, extending in length no lefs than 3700 yards: 
Vol. IX. A Their

Their tops are 18 inches higher than the height of the flood 
in 1782, the greatelt ever known in Clyde. It rofe about 
1 8^ feet above low water. The rife of the tide in the ri- 
ver terminates at Rutherglen. 

Agriculture, ifc. — The whole pariua is arable, and is 
rnoflly inclofed, chiefly with thorn hedges, in fingle 
rows. The foil, being in fome places a fine loam, and 
in others a rich mould, produces, by the concurring affift- 
ance of a climate generally mild and warm, fertile crops of 
oats, wheat, barley, peas, beans, potatoes and graffes. For 
this and fome other reafons, improvements in agriculture 
are, in this place, making confiderable progrefs. There are 
3 kinds of ploughs ufed in the parifh the Scotch, the 
chain, and the Rutherglen plough. The lafr was, for the 
fiift time, made here about 50 years ago; and confequent- 
ly, according to Lord Karnes's account, muft have been a- 
mong the firft improved ploughs in Scotland. The plan 
after which it was conflrudted, was propofed by a Lady 
Stewart, grandmother to the prefent Earl of Buchan : She 
came from Goodtrees to the Farme, where flic lived feve- 
ral years, and was uncommonly active in promoting agri- 
cultural improvements. It is nearly as light as the chain- 
plough, and anfwers well in a free foil; it has long ago 
found its way into all the parifhes in the neighbour- 
hood. The molt part of the land is in tillage, for which 
rcafon there are few cattle in the parifh. The number of 
cows is no more than 207 ; about 100 of that number be- 
long to the inhabitants of the borough, and are moflly pa- 
[hired on a fmall common, adjoining to the town. Of 
borfes there are no; but the greateft part of them 
belong to the coal-work and to carters. The valued 
rent of the parifh, which belongs to 139 heritors, of whom 

41 



of Ruthergltn.

41 are non-refidents, is L. 2100 Scots: The real rent 
may, at an average, be rated at L. 2 Sterling the acre. 

Borough. — The capital of the parifh, and from which it 
derives its name, is the ancient borough of Rutherglen ; fi- 
tuated 2i miles to the S. E. of GJafgow. This town, 
which is faid to have been at firft built by Reuther, one of 
the Kings of Scotland, was erected into a royal borough by 
King David I. about the year 11 26. Its privileges and 
immunities, as appears from charters yet extant, were very 
great. Tbefe, however, were gradually diminilhed, as 
Glafgow and the neighbouring towns rofe into confe- 
quence. It, is, fince the Union, inrolled with Glafgow, 
Renfrew and Dunbarton ; and in conjunction with them, 
fends a member to the Britilh Parliament. No borough 
in Britain enjoys a more free and unerabarraffed election of 
magiftrates and council. 

Fairs. — The market-day is not now frequented ; but 6 
fairs are annually held in the town, and are famous for the 
beft draught-horfes in Europe. It is faid, that more than 
a century ago, one of the anceftors of the prefent Duke of 
Hamilton, brought with him to Scotland 6 coach-horfes, 
originally from Flanders, and fent them to Strathaven, the 
caftle of which was at that time habitable : The horfes 
were all ftallions, of a black colour, and remarkably hand- 
fome. The farmers in the neighbourhood readily em- 
bracing the favourable opportunity, made this foreign breed 
crofs with the common Scotch kind; and thereby procu- 
red a breed fuperior to either. From this, a ftrong and 
hardy race of horfes was foon fpread over the country ; 
but in many places, owing to negled, was left to degene" 
rate. By want of proper attention, we often let flip the 

moft

moft favourable opportunities of improvement, and fuffer 
unmanly indolence to deprive us of many bleffings we 
might otherwife enjoy. A high degree of credit, however, 
is due to the farmers in the upper part of the county, for 
their unremitting endeavours to improve this excellent 
breed. They pay ftricT: attention to every circumftance 
refpe&amp;ing the colour; the foftnefs and hardnefs of the 
hair; length of the body, breaft and moulders of their 
breeders. No inducement whatever, can lead them to en- 
courage the breed of a horfe, that is not poffeffed of the 
beft qualities. Providence commonly favours the atten- 
tive and the diligent. Their laudable attempts have pro- 
ved to be fuccefsful, and Britain is now reaping the me- 
rited fruits of their well directed care. Every farm almoft, 
through the extent of feveral pariihes, fupports 6, or at 
leaft 4 mares ; the half of which are allowed annually to 
foal. The colts are moftly fold at the fairs of Lanark and 
Carnwath, and bring to the owners from L. 5 to L. 20 
each. They are generally purchafed by farmers from the 
counties of Renfrew and Ayr, where they are trained for 
the draught, till they are about 5 years old ; they are then 
fold at the fairs of Rutherglen from L. 25 to L. 40 each ; 
from thence they are taken to the Lothians, England, &amp;c. 
where they excel in the plough, the cart and the wag- 
gon. 

Population. — The parilh contains 286 dwelling-houfes, 
inhabited by 444 families, containing i860 perfons ; of 
whom 907 are males, 953 females, and 297 children un- 
der 6 years of age. The number of fervants is 69, of 
whom 21 only are males. The increafe, fince the year 
1755, if the return ,(988) made to Dr Webfter was accu- 
rate, is 872. The following is a lift of the number of

The increafed population muft be owing to the rapid pro- 
grefs of manufactures in this part of the country. 

Wages. — Owing to this alfo, fervants are fcarce, and their 
wages high. A man-fervant receives, belides bed, board 
and warning, L. 5 the half year •, and a woman-fervant 
from 40 s. to 50 s. A labourer, when hired by the year, 
receives 1 s. every day ; when not hired by the year, he 
has from 15 d. to 18 d. a-day. Artificers, as mafons and 
wrights, get 2 s. for their day's wages. But the practice of 
undertaking by the piece, almoft univerfally prevails. 



CharaEler of the Inhabitants. — The prefent inhabitants 
are active and induftrious, and under their good manage- 
ment, the peace of fociety is preferved. They are confi- 
derable adepts in borough politics. This, however, does 
not, in general, obflruct an induftrious application to their 
feveral employments. But their tranquillity meets, at 
times, with Ihort interruptions : A competition for their 

influence 



Statijlical Account 



influence, in a vote for a member of Parliament, fome- 
times convulfes the community ; enervates the finews of 
induftry ; and brings ruin on fome few individuals. On 
thefe occafions, one would be ready to think, that liberty 
was turned into licentioufnefs, and that the privileges of 
royal boroughs were curfes, inllead of bleffings, to the per- 
fons pouefled of them. But where is the conftitution that 
is free from defefts ? or where the people that may not in 
fome inftances go wrong ? It may, however, be obferved, 
that the inhabitants are fo far from being bad members of 
fociety, that none of them have, in the memory of man, 
committed any crime, for which they were liable to pu- 
blic punifhment. They are ftrongly attached to the Efta- 
bliftied Church ; there being not above 8 or i o families be- 
longing to fedlaries. 

Trades, ManufaEiures, &amp;c. — How the inhabitants are 
employed, will appear from the following lift of mechanics 
and labourers within the parifh : The number of indivi- 
duals employed in each occupation is annexed :

Of the weavers, 10 only continue at cuftomary work ; the 
reft are employed in the muflin branch. Moft of the ma- 
fons profefs the wright bufinefs. About three fourths of 
the fmiths are nailers, and work to employers in Glafgow. 
Mr Robert Bryce hath diftinguifhed himfelf for making 
edge-took, efpecially augers and fcrews, both black and 
polifhed. He fells the black from 3 s. 6 d. to L. 1, 5 s. the 
dozen, wholefale ; and the polifhed, from 13 s. to 
L. 2 : 9 : 6 the dozen. His carpenters and coopers 
axes and adzes, are fold from 5 d. to 8 d. the lb. All his 
tools, on account of their excellent workmanfhip, and ex- 
tremely good temper, are preferred, in Glafgow and 
Greenock, to any from England. His demands are al- 
ways greater than he can execute. For grinding his tools, 
he prefers the ftones from Hamilton-hill, in the neighbour- 
hood of Glafgow, to Newcaftle grindftones. The former 
are compofed of a fmaller grit than the latter, but take 
down remarkably faft ; they wear equally round, becaufe 
no part of them is harder than another j and they are not 
intermixed with nodules and ftreaks of the martial-pyrites, 
which are extremely hurtful to edge-tools, and frequently 
render grindftones totally ufelefs. — Mr Bryce hath alfo ac- 
quired a peculiar Ikill in the dextrous management of bees. 
He can, without killing the queen-bee, unite different 
fwarms, or parts of fwarms, and make them keep together 
in harmony : His apiary is fometimes flocked with 
42 hives. — There are two printfields in the parifh,. 
known by the names of Rutherglen and Shawfield-bank 
printfields. The former is carried on by Mr Cummin and 
Company, and the latter by Mr Dalgleifh they employ- 
about 200 perfons. All the women in the parifh find a- 
bundance of fuitable employment. Every 4 looms give 
work to at leaft one woman, who winds the yarn for them.

There are no fewer than 22 tambouring machines-in the 
town ; 4 young girls commonly work at each ; and gain, 
by their united labour, about 2 s. the day. 

Minerals. — The coal-works carried on at Stonelaw, by 
Major John Spens, are of long ftanding. There is no ac- 
count when coals were at firft wrought in this place. But 
from the number of old waftes, the period mud be very 
remote. At prefent, about 126 perfons are employed in 
the works. The water is raifed by a fteam-engine, which, 
about the year 1776, was erefted by Gabriel Grey, Efq; 
of Scotftown. The coals turned out are of different qua- 
lities, but all of them are very good. They are fold on 
the hill at led. the hutch, weighing 400 lb. but it com- 
monly exceeds that weight ; carriage to Glafgow is 4 d. 
fo that a cart load of three hutches, weighing about 13 
cwt. is laid down in the ftreet for 3 s. 6 d. But two 
wheeled waggons, . containing 6 hutches, are commonly u- 
fed. Some of them that lately were occalionally weighed, 
contained no lefs than 33 cwt. of foft coal ; which, how- 
ever, is fpecifically heavier than hard coal. The empty 
waggon generally weighs about Si cwt. The whole, a- 
mounting to 41 cwt. is drawn by a fingle horfe, which 
goes to Glafgow three times a day. Glafgow is diftant 
from Stonelaw 3^ miles. Such heavy draughts, drawn by 
one horfe, even for a greater length of road, is not unfre- 
quent in this country. The waggon i3 generally 2 feet 
in depth ; 34 in breadth ; and 5-5- in length ; the wheels 
are 44 in height ; the horfes employed are of the Lanark - 
fliire breed. Their fuperior excellency, after the above 
mentioned exertion of their ftrength, to which they are 
daily accuftomed, need not be called in queftion. A con- 
fiderable quantity of iron ftone is turned out along with 

the

the coal at Stonelaw. It fells at 5 s, 6d. the ton on the 
bill; and is delivered at Clyde iron-work for 6 s. 6 d. 
There are two excellent free-ftone quarries in the parifh, 
which have been wrought for forae hundred years paft. 
The (tones find ready fale in Glafgow and its neighbour- 
hood. 

Public houfes.— Rutherglen is by no means deftitute of 
grocery fhops and public houfes. Of the latter there are 
no fewer than 26 within the town. Thefe, although more 
than fufficient for ordinary demands, are not able to ac- 
commodate ftrangers that frequent the fairs. To fupply 
the deficiency, every inhabitant claims a right, eftablifhed 
by immemorial pra&amp;ice, of felling ale and whifky, licence 
free, during the time of the fairs. This cuftom, which is 
hurtful neither to the revenues of Government, nor inte- 
reft of the community, is profitable to fome induftrious fa- 
milies who inhabit capacious houfes. 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor, Ifc — The church is a 
fmall but very ancient ftru&amp;ure. There is no account 
when it was built. The conftru&amp;ion of the pillars and 
arches, and the ornaments on the capitals, feem to place its 
date at a more remote diftance, than the time when the 
churches, ornamented with high and cluttered pillars, fharp 
pointed arches, large windows, &amp;c. were built. — The fti- 
pend, including the allowance for communion-elements, is 
147 bolls, 14^ pecks of visual ; of which, 55 bolls are of 
oats r 34 of barley ; and the reft of oat meal. It is, how- 
ever, moftly paid in money, according to the market price 
of the vidhial. The glebe contains 44. acres, part of which 
is occupied by the manfe and offices. The Magiftrates 
and Council, the heritors refiding within the borough,

and thirteen pound land thereof; the members of the kirk- 
fefiion, and the tenants of Shawfield, have jointly the 
right of prefentation. — The public fchool is generally well 
frequented. The falary is L. 10 Sterling yearly. The 
ftated wages are 2 s. the quarter for Englifh ; and 2 s. 6 d. 
for writing, arithmetic and Latin. There are commonly 
one or two private fchools in the town. — The number of 
poor in the parifh, confidering its population, is not great. 
There are only 26 on the poor funds : thefe are to the 
whole inhabitants nearly in proportion, as 1 is to 72. 
They are moftly aged and infirm women. Each receives 
from 2 s. to 5 s. a-month. There are befides a few in- 
digent families who are occafionally affifted, as the kirk- 
feffion, to whofe care the overfight of the poor is intrufted, 
fees proper. The funds for anfwering the above purpo- 
fes, are raifed from the weekly collections at the church 
door on fabbaths ; from proclamations of marriage, and 
the annual intereft of a fmall fum, accumulated chiefly by 
pious donations. Thefe different fources, for there is no 
poor-tax in the parifh, procured to the feffion, from Febru- 
ary 1790 to February 1791, the fum of L. 52 : 13 .-3^. 
The difburfements, during the fame period, were L. 46, 
16 s. Balance added to the ftock, L. 5 : 17 : 3I. One or 
two of the poor are allowed to beg within the bounds of 
the parifh but no where elfe. 

Roads and Mill. — There is no part in the country where 
better roads are to be found. The great turnpike road 
leading from Glafgow to London, by way of Kilbride, 
Muirkirk, Dumfries, Sec goes through the town. On this 
road is a toll-bar, the only One in the parifh. The chief 
ne of communication to Glafgow is by Rutherglen 
bridge, which was, in 1775, thrown' over Clyde. It is 

not 



of Rutherglen.

not burdened by any pontage, being built by a free fub- 
fcription, to which the borough contributed nearly L. iooo 
Sterling. — The only mill in the parifh is the town's mill, 
conftru&amp;ed for grinding oats, barley and peas. To it are 
aftricled all the borough lands, at the thirlage of the 40th 
part of the grana crefcentia, feed and horfe corn excepted. 
The miller is entitled to half a peck for bannock-meal, out 
of every 6 firlots, grinded at the mill ; and the mukerer, 
or millar's fervant, has additional what is equal to the half 
of the bannock-meal for his fee. 

Copies of the charters belonging to the borough ; de- 
fcriptions and drawings of the pillars in the church ; of the 
fpoils of fepulchral tumuli ; of vegetable irnpreflions found 
in the earth ; of bafaltic columns, and of feveral other 
fubje&amp;s of antiquity and natural hiftory, belonging to the 
parifli, are given in Mr Ure's hiftory of Rutherglen and 
Eaft Kilbride, from which the above account is abftra&amp;ed.

NUMBER II. 
PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4982551">>BUCHANAN</name>, 

(County of Stirling, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Dunbarton.) 

By the Rev. Mr David Macgibbon.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, ifc. 

OUCH AN AN was formerly called Inchcailhch, the 
name of an ifland in Lochlomond, where the church 
was till the year 1621, when a confiderable part of the 
parilh of Lufs, at that time on this fide of the loch, was an- 
nexed to the parifh of Inchcailloch. Some years after the 
annexation, the walls of the church in Inchcailloch failing, 
and the people likewife not finding it convenient every 
fabbath, cfpecially in ftormy weather, to be crofling over 
to the ifland, worfhip was performed in a church near the 
houfe of Buchanan, which was originally a Chapel of Eafe 
belonging to the parifh of Lufs. From this chapel, which 
was called the church or chapel of Buchanan, the whole 

united 



of Buchanan. 13 

united parifti came by degrees to be called the parifti of 
Buchanan, lnchcailloch fignifies " the ifland of the Old 
" Women fo called, becaufe in former times there was 
a nunnery there. The parifti of Buchanan has been reck- 
oned 18 computed miles long, and 6 broad. The cultivated 
part of the fouth end lies eaft and weft between the moor of 
Buchanan and the river Endric. A long tracl: lies along 
the north fide of Lochlomond to the upper end of the pa- 
rifti, near which there are two glens crofting the parifti from 
eaft to weft, Glendow and Glenarclet, both of which are 
inhabited. 

Rivers. — The Forth has its fource in the upper end of 
this parifti. From feveral fprings, and from rains in thefe 
high grounds frequently falling, there i3 collected a fmall 
burn or rivulet, which runs down Glenguoi into Glendow, 
and by the addition of feveral large burns in that glen it 
is conliderably increafed : At the lower end of the glen it 
is called the, water of Dow, and below that the water of 
Duchray, (as it pafles by the place of Duchray), and not 
till it pafles by the church of Aberfoil is it called the Forth. 
This river takes its courfe through Monteith by Stirling. 
The river Endric, which is the boundary of this parifti in 
the fouth, has its fource in the weft end of Dundaff, or 
Fintry hills, and runs through the parifties of Fintry, Kill- 
cairn, and Drumen, till it reaches the parifti of Buchanan, 
where it flows in beautiful curves through the fertile haughs 
(or flats) of Buchanan and Kilmaronock, and falls at laft into 
Lochlomond. This river in the winter feafon, when the 
loch is full, covers a great part of the lower grounds on 
both fides of the parifties of Buchanan and Kilmaronock, 
and when the water lies dead and goes off" gradually it en- 
riches the ground ; but the floods have often proved hurtful 

in

in the fpring after the feed was fown, and oftener in harveft, 
both before the corns were cut down and afterward, carry- 
ing fome away and greatly damaging the reft. In harveft 
1782, in a flood, the haughs of Endric, in this parifli, were 
covered with water, and immediately after, there came 
fnow and intenfe froft, fo that in fome places people walked 
on the ice above the Handing corn. 

Caves. — In Craigroftan there are feveral caves in which 
lawlefs people ufed to Ikulk and hide themfelves ; thofe are 
known by the names of the moft remarkable perfons who 
ufed to frequent them. There is one commonly known by 
the name of King Robert's cave. What gave it that name 
was, that King Robert Bruce, after his defeat at Dalrec, 
in the weft end of Strathfillan, pafled that day, with very 
few with him, down the ftrath, crofted the water of Fal- 
locb, and came down the north fide of Lochlomond to 
Craigroftan. Night coming on, when he arrived at this 
cave, he flept there ; next day he came to the laird of 
Buchanan, who conduced him to the Earl of Lenox, by 
whom he was preferved for fome time, till he got to a 
place of fafety. The report is, that the night in which 
King Robert flept in the cave, he was furrounded with 
goats that ufed to lie there in the night, and that 
when he arofe in the morning, and found himfelf fo 
comfortable, he was fo well pleafed with the goats as his 
bed-fellows, that, when he came to be king, he made a law 
that all goats fliould be grafs-mail (or grafs-rent) free. 

Hills.— The Grampian hills run through this parifli from 
S. W. to N. E. and divide the lower from the higher 
grounds. There is one pretty high hill in the midft of 
thefe called the Conic hill : But the higheft hill, in this 

part 



of Buchanan. 



1 S 



part of the country, is in the upper end of the parifli, called 
Benlomond, which is about 1080 yards above fea level. The 
afcent to the top of this hill directly weft is fteep, but from 
the fouth it is more gradual, till near the top, and then it 
is fomewhat fteeper. From the top of this hill there is, in 
a clear day, a very extenfive view to the eaft as far as E- 
dinburgh, to the fouth as far as Ayr, with the frith of 
Clyde, and the iflands in it, Arran, Bute, &amp;c. as alfo to 
the weft fea and the iflands of May, Jura, Stc. 

Lochs or Lakes. — Though Lochlomond cannot be faid to 
be in any one parifli, yet as the parifli of Buchanan extends 
14 or 15 miles up the fide of the loch, and feveral of the 
inhabited iflands make a part of it, the greateft {hare of the 
loch may be faid to fall to the parifli of Buchanan. This • 
beautiful lake, lying from S. to N. has always been reck- 
oned 24 computed or 36 meafured miles in length. The 
breadth towards the fouth end is from 8 to 10 miles ; to- 
wards the north end it is not near fo broad. The north 
end is confiderably deeper than towards the fouth end ; 
the depth at the foot of Benlomond is about 120 fathoms ; 
in the fouth end it is about 20, and in many places not a- 
bove 14. All above Rowerdennan the loch never freezes, 
however intenfe the froft be ; but what is fouth of Rower- 
dennen frezes, fo that men, and even horfes with their loads, 
have travelled upon the ice, when covered with fnow. As 
there are feveral rivers which pour a great quantity of 
water into the loch, aud as there is but one way by which 
it empties itfelf into the fea, the loch, in rainy feafons, rifes 
to a confiderable height, fo that from it loweft ebb it has 
been known to rife upwards of 5 feet. In this loch they 
reckon about 30 iflands, but there are only 13 or 14 that 
can be faid to be of any value, the reft being very fmall,

and fome of them but the points of bare rocks. The moft 
valuable iflands are divided between the families of Mon- 
trofe and Lufs ; 4 of them, belonging to the Duke of Mon- 
trofe, are in the parifh of Buchanan ; 3 of thefe, namely, 
Inchailloch, already mentioned, Inchfael, which fignifies " the 
.! Lon S Mand," and Incheruin, " the Round Hand," have 
a tenant in each of them with arable and pafture ground ; 
but by far the largeft and the beft of all the iflands, and 
which likewife belongs to the family of Montrofe, is Inch- 
murin ; in this ill and the Duke of Montrofe keeps his 
deer, and a forefter to take care of them. This ifland, it 
is faid, belongs to no parifh, but the people in it get 
church privileges, when they apply for them, at Buchanan. 
In the fouth end of this ifland, the ancient family of Le- 
nox had a caftle, but it is now in ruins. There are alfo 
three fmall lakes or lochs within the parifh, namely, 
Dulochan, Locharclet and Lochamnancairn. In Du- 
lochan there are fome pike, in Locharclet there are pike 
and large trout, in Lochlomond there are falmon-trout, 
eel, perch, flounder, pike, and a fifli peculiar to itfelf, call- 
ed pollac. This fifh is of the fize of a large herring, and at 
times is caught in great quantities on this fide of the loch 
with draught nets ; they are beft in the months of July 
and Auguft. Salmon was more plentiful lafl year on this 
fide of the loch than for many years pafl, owing to the 
flakes and nets upon the mouth of the Leven to prevent 
the fifli from coming up, being pulled out ; and yet falmon 
fold lafl year dearer than before, owing to the carriers at- 
tending more regularly than formerly, and carrying them 
off to Glafgow, &amp;c. Salmon, which ufed to be fold at 
1 d. and 3 d. the pound, fells now at 5 d. and 6 d. 



Woods. 



of 'Buchanan. 17 



]y 0Q ds. Near the houfe of Buchanan there is an old oak 

wood ; great additions have been made to which within thefe 
40 years paft. The prefent Duke of Montrofe is planting 
a great deal of different kinds of trees in the bottom of Bu- 
chanan, which in procefs of time, if properly ta .en care of, 
mull turn out greatly to the advantage of the family, as 
well as to the beauty of the place. In the ifland of Inch- 
caillocb there is a large oak wood. From the Grampian 
hills to 1 : the north- end of the pariih, along the fide of the. 
loch, is one continued wood, confuting of fome allies, alders, 
hazels, but moftly oaks. Woods are of late become very 
valuable on the fides of Lochlomond, as the timber and 
bark are eafily tranfported by water to Glafgow, Port- 
Glafgow and Greenock, and fometimes are carried to Ire- 
land and the welt of England. 

Climate and. Difeafes. — This country in general is rather 
wet, not however unhealthy. Fevers are rare, and gene- 
rally brought from other places, especially from the towns, 
and from the public works that are going on at no great 
diftance from hence, as bleaching, printing cloth, and fpin- 
ning cotton ; the children or connections of people in this 
pariih turning fickly in thofe places, are brought home, and 
fometimes the neighbor rs are infected by them. In ihat 
way alfo the fm all- pox was brought into this pariih in 
winter laft. The difeafe Spreading faft, about 30 of the 
young people in the neighbourhood where it was, took it ; 
10 of whom died. All the parents whofe children had not 
taken it, (two or three excepted), as if it were with one 
confent, inocnLted their children at one and the fame 
time i fo that there are juft now under inoculation in this 
pariih 128. Several of whom I have fcen ; many of 
them appeared to be pretty eafy ; others had a good

deal of the pox, but are now in a fair way of recove- 
ry. Two only died.— What we reckon old people in this 
panfli live till they are between 70 and 80 years fome 
reach 85 or 86 ; only 5 that I can remember, fince I came 
to this parifh, reached 90, 2 of whom died going 98. 
There is one living at prefent who is going 99 ; he is re- 
markably healthy, rifes every day by 7 or 8 in the morn- 
ing, and if it is a good day, takes a lhort walk, before 
breakfaft ; he has no complaint of his light, hearing or me- 
mory, and his hand is as fteady as when he was a young 
man ; he was in arms in the year 1715 with his country- 
men the Highlanders, and is the only man alive in this 
part of the country who was out at that time. 

Agriculture^ is'c. — The foil is of different kinds. The 
haughs of Endric are deep, and very fertile for grafs or 
corn. The riling grounds towards the moor of Buchanan, 
are partly gravel, partly mofs, and partly till, with 
rocks and flones, both above and below ground, in the way 
of the plough. Upon the fide of Lochlomond above the 
pafs, the ground is drier than below, but rocky and ftony. 
The crops are oats and barley. Some few peas are fown, 
which do very well where the ground is limed, but they 
are in danger of fuffering in harveft in this rainy country. 
Some few have tried turnip ; they would grow very well* 
but they require more attention in the feafon that the peo- 
ple of this country are providing turf or peats, than they 
can well bellow upon them. They all plant plenty of 
potatoes, and the common people feed at leaft one half of 
the year upon them. Oats, if the feafon anfwers, are fown 
in the beginning of April, barley through the month of 
May, and fometimes in June. There is little flax raifed, 
and none but what is for private ufe. A greater quantity 

of

of grain than was neceflfary for the maintenance of the in- 
habitants, was raifed ; but of late years a great part of the 
richer grounds being put under grafs, has considerably di- 
miniflied the produce in general. The generality of the te- 
nants keep near a third more of cattle than they have pa- 
fture for ; which, though they will not believe it, turns out 
more to their lofs than their profit. There are 5 entered 
ftills in the parim, which do more than confume all the bai- 
ley that grows in it. The common Scots ploughs are ge- 
nerally ufed ; but inftead of being made by the farmers 
themfelves^ as formerly, they are now, for the moft part, 
made by fuch wrights as are moft remarkable in the coun- 
try for making them, fo that they are not now fo clumfy 
and heavy as ufual. But by far the greater part of this pa- 
rim confifts of hill or moor ground, and is covered with 
rocks, mofs and heath. For 6 miles up the fide of the loch, 
each farm has a fhare of the moor which is contiguous to 
itfelf; but feveral miles of the north end of the parifh 
have of late years been all put under (heep-pafture. There 
are only 27 ploughs going in the parifh this year. 

Till of late there was rather a want of induftry in this 
parilh, owing to what the farmers alleged, the fhortnefs of 
their tacks, which gave them no encouragement to improve, 
and the difficulty of getting manure : But a lime quarry 
being fome years ago found out in the moor above the pafs 
near a mofs where they get peats for burning the lime, the 
farmers in the neighbourhood make lime there every year, 
which they bring to their grounds. This has proved of con- 
fiderable advantage to their farms. The farms below the 
pafs the Duke has inclofed and fubdivided, partly by ditch 
and hedge, and partly by Hone fences : By building the 
ftone fences, the farmers who were employed in providing 
ftones, had an opportunity of clearing their grounds of a 

great 



20 



Statijlkal Account 



great many (tones, which they flood very much in need of. 
Aud iome of them fince in their wet grounds have been 
rafting drains and filling them with ftones, by which their 
grounds receive a double advantage. The multures for 
fome time paft have been converted into money, fo that 
there is little more given now than what is neceffary for 
working the grain. 

Population.— According to the return made to Dr Web- 
fter, the numbers were 1699. The inhabitants have de- 
creafed confiderably fmce fome part of my predeceffor's 
time. In one of his lifts, the number was between 1500 
and 1600 ; according to the laft lilt which I took of them, 
they were only 111 1 fouls, and the number is not increa- 
fing. There is no regiiter of marriages kept j but the re- 
gister in order to the proclamation of banns is regular- 
ly kept ; and by the lame it appears, that the number 
of proclamations from the beginning of the year 1760 to 
the beginning of 1790, is 241 $ from 176c to 177©, is 82 \ 
from 1770 to 1780, is 83 ; and from 1780 to 1790, is 76 : 
The yearly average upon the whole, is 8. The numbers 
of births from 1760 to 1790, is 409; from 1760 to 1770, 
is 147-3 from 1770 to 1780, is 143 ; from 1780 to 1790, 
is 119. The yearly average is about 13. 

There are no manufactures in this parifh. There are in 
it 6 weavers, 3 ftiocmakers, 2 tailors, 1 fmith, 2 boat-car- 
penters, 2 millers, no wrights nor mafons, except fuch as 
work conftantly to the Duke of Montrofe. All the fer- 
vants in this parilh are doraeftic or houfehold, except fuch as 
work to the Duke, who have each of them who go under 
the denomination of his workmen, a houfe and garden, a 
cow's grazing-park, for their accommodation, with 4 a- 
cres of ground. The wages of labouring fervants are daily 

•increafing, 



of Buchanan. 2 1 



increasing, owing greatly to the public works going on in 
the neighbourhood, the enlarging of farms, and the turning 
off of cottagers. Men fervants get from L. 7 to L. 9 in the 
year, and fome of them more. Women fervants get L. 4, 
and fome of them more. A man to work a day's work, or 
a darger, as they are called, is not eafily had ; amd when 
got, he takes 10 d. a-day with his victuals. Tailors get 
8d. and vi&amp;uals. — Some years ago there were feveral Ro- 
man Catholics, and a few of the Epifcopal Communion ; 
but there are none of thefe denominations now, fo far as I 
know, at leaft as common refidenters. 

Stipend, School, Poor, Ifc. — The living confifts of 24 
bolls oat-meal, together with L. 62 : 8 : 2, with manfe and 
glebe. The Duke of Montrofe is patron. The minifter, 
it is faid, is titular. There are 6 heritors, 5 of whom have 
a {ingle farm each •, the reft of the parifh belongs to the 
Duke, who is alfo fuperior of the other five. — There are 2 
fchools, which for feveral years part have been regularly 
taught •, the parochial fchool, and a fchool appointed by the 
Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. The paro- 
chial fchoolmafter has a falary of L. 8 : 6 : 8, with a houfe ; 
for every marriage he has 13d.; for every baptifm, 4 d. 
for teaching to read Englifb, is. 6 d. the quarter, and for 
writing and arithmetic, 2 s. The charity fchool is kept 
at Sallochy, about 6 miles above the church, for 3 years ; 
and then at Inverfnaid, about 7 miles farther up the coun- 
try, for other 3 years, alternately. The charity fchool- 
mafter has a falary of L. 10 as fchoolmafter and catechift ; 
he has alfo quarter wages from fuch as are able to pay, 
which I underftand turn out to about L. 4 ; but he is obli- 
ged to teach the poor gratis. — The number of poor upon 
the lift is about 40, fometimes 1 or 2 more. I fay upon

the kft, becaufe we only mark down the principal head of 
the family who receive charity, and are fupplied by the 
country and the parifh, though in fome families there may 
be the hufband and the wife, and in others fome fmall chil- 
dren befide the hufband and wife, or a widow with a 
fmall family in ftraitened circumftances j fo that if every 
individual were to be put in the lift, the number would be 
pretty confiderable. There is no provifion made in this 
parifh for the poor ; they are obliged to beg from houfe to 
houfe through the year, and get their proportion of what 
collections are gathered on the Sabbath days, to bay cloaths 
and other neceffaries ; and when any of them conic to be 
in ficknefs, or infirm and unable to go about, they have to 
depend upon the charity of their neareft neighbours, and 
what can be given them extraordinary of the poor's mo- 
ney. Several years ago the county of Stirling attempted 
to confine their poor within their refpe&amp;ive parilhes ; and 
after feveral meetings about it, all the parifhes, as far as I 
know, except Drumen and Buchanan, agreed to the plan ; 
by which means the poor of the parilhes who agreed to it 
were better fupplied, and the people freed of a good deal 
of trouble in ferving them at the door ; and befides, were 
not liable to get their goods ftolen, as formerly, by vagrants 
who went about begging. The poor are every day beco- 
ming a heavier burden upon the inhabitants of this parifh, 
occafioned by the belt growing farms in the lower end of 
the parifh being put under grafs, and the fmall farms in the 
head of the parifh, many of them being united together and 
put under fheep, and let out to people in other parilhes who 
give nothing for the fupport of the poor, but leave them a 
burden upon the refidenters. There is about L. 280 be- 
longing to the poor of the parilh, moft of which has been 
uiven in different donations by the family of Montrofe. 

Manners 



of Buchanan, 



Manners and Morals. — The people are generally fober. 
There are no villages in the parilh, nor even what defervesJ 
the name of a clachan at the church. There are only 3 
licenfed public houfes ^ It is an advantage to the morals of 
the people that there are fo few. The people are hofpi- 
table, and very charitably difpofed towards the poor. They 
live in peace and harmony among themfelves, and are very 
ready to oblige and affift one another when need requires. 
I cannot now recollect one law procefs between the inhabi. 
tants before the iheriff or commiffary, fince I came to the pa- 
rim ; any difference among. them ufed to be made up at the 
barony court, and there have been very few differences 
even before the barony court for many years part. There 
has no murder been committed time immemorial 5 no per- 
fons have been committed to prifon, or banifhed for any 
crime, except one family who came to refide here, finding 
it inconvenient to live any where elfe, and one individual 
who came from the fouth, when purfued in his own coun- 
try, took flielter here for a few days, and afterwards fuffer- 
cd at Edinburgh. 

Advantages. — One great convenience which this parifh. 
has, is, that almoft every farm has mofs in the moors be- 
longing to itfelf or contiguous to it •, fo that in moderately 
dry fummers the people may have plenty of good peats. 
But after all, confidering the time that is fpent in cutting 
the peats, fetting and keeping them to the drought, and 
carrying them home, which is a great part of the fummer's 
work, befides the danger of lofing them all, or mod of 
them in rainy feafons, 1 leave it to^my neighbours to judge 
whether it would not be better to caft fewer peats, and 
ferve themfelves partly in coals, especially fince they have 
now got a turnpike road to the coals. One great advan- 
tage 



24 



Statijlical Account 



tage which the lower end of this parifh has received of late 
years, is a new line of road from Drumen to Rowerdennan, 
which (the ferry intervening) joins the great road from 
Dunbarton to Inverary on the fouth fide of Lochlomond. 
There is always a ferry-boat kept by the family of Mon- 
trofe at Rowerdennan, and another by the family of Arro- 
char on the oppofite fide. The ferrying place on this fide 
has, of late years, been made pretty convenient for paflen- 
gers •, a quay has been built both for the fafety of the boats, 
and for the conveniency of horfes getting into and out of 
the boats ; as alfo a convenient public houfe. The line 
of road from Drumen to Rowerdennan was begun and for- 
med by the ftatute work ; bridges were built on the burns* 
partly by the vacant ftipend, partly by the bridge-money 
got from the county, and partly by the Duke's money 
This road while carried on by the ftatute work, went on 
very flowly ; though begun above 30 years ago, it could 
not be faid to be finimed till laft year ; but now that it is 
finifhed, it muft greatly attract the attention of travellers, 
being for feveral miles up the fide of the loch, highly beau- 
tiful and pi&amp;urefque ; interfperfed with woods and beauti- 
ful fields of grafs and arable grounds ; commanding at the 
fame time an extenfive and delightful prolpeft of Loch- 
lomond, and of the principal iflands in it, as alfo of the 
many fine feats around the loch. 

Mifcellaneous Ob fcr nations. — In the lower end of the pa- 
rifh is the houfe of Buchanan, the prefent feat of the family 
of Montrofe. This place for near 700 ye»rs belonged to 
Buchanan of that ilk, and was the feat of that ancient fa- 
mily, but has been now for fome time in the poffeffion of 
the family of Montrofe. — At Inverfnaid in the upper 
end of the parifh, there was, about 80 years ago, a fort 

built 



of Buchanan. 



built near mid-way between Lochlomohd and Lochcatrine j 
the defign of which was to guard the pafs between the two 
lochs, and prevent the cattle and goods of the people in 
the lower parts of the country being ftolen and carried 
away northward, as alfo to be a check upon the country 
around it ; the people thereabout being as ready as any o- 
thers to take away their neighbour's goods. This fort was 
burnt in 1745, but was afterward repaired. There ufed 
to be a company of men ftationed there fome time ago ; 
but, for feveral years paft, it has been fupplied with a few 
men from the caftle of Dunbarton. 

The people on the fouth fide of the Grampian Hills, 
fpeak nothing but Englifli ; on the north fide, fuch as have 
been born and brought up there, fpeak the Englifli and 
Gaelic. Of late years, feveral tenants from the fouth fide, 
have removed ■ to farms on the north fide •, thefe fpeak 
Englifli only. All the names of places within the parifh 
are Gaelic : as, Coldrach, * The Back of the Oaks Blar- 
vokie, or « Plain of the He-Goat Stronmacnair, 1 The 
' Po^t of the Hill, belonging to the Son of the Heir 
BenIomond\ ' The bare green Hill.'

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1020232">GOLSPT</name>, 

(County of Sutherland, Synod of Sutherland an» 
Caithness, Presbytery of Dornoch.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Keith.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

CUlmalie was the ancient name of this parifli. Got 
fpy is probably derived from goul fpaut ; — goul fig- 
nifying, ' a figure refembling a branch of a tree,' and fpaut 
' a fpeat.' Probably the burn of Golfpy ran in that form, 
and had often a fpeat or flood ; which is ftill the cafe, altho' 
the form is much changed by reafon of frequent inundations. 
The place perhaps got its name from the figure of the 
burn, and the circumftance of its fpeats. — This parifh ex- 
tends from Strathfteven, the N. E. end, to the Little Ferry, 
S. W. along the fea, nearly in a ftraight line ; and mea« 
fures about 8 miles. From the boat of the Little Ferry, it 
rut along thai arm of the fea from S. E. to N. W. for 3 
miles, and thus forms nearly a right angle at the weft end. 



of Golfpy. 



27 



By the moft dire&amp; road from one end to another, it is 10 
meafured miles in length, and from fea to hill in the 
hroadeft part, about a mile and an half, and about a 
mile in the narroweft part, exclufive of a good deal 
•of barren hilly ground. There is a bank which runs 
along the burn of Golfpy due weft from the fea for 5 
miles, where there are feveral inhabitants. It is flat 
for 10 miles in length from the coaft, and from a 
mile to a mile and a half in breadth. The foii in 
general light, but of a good quality and fertile. In fome 
parts it is deep, and mixed with clay, and very fertile. The 
S. W. end is fandy; the N. E. end flony. No part is 
high, or having high rocks. The hills on the fide facing 
the fea are covered with ihort black heath, and fome what 
rocky. On the oppofite fide the heath is long, with a mix- 
ture of grafs, and the ground for moft part mofTy. The 
air is dry and healthy. There are haddocks, whitings, cod, 
fmall rock red cod, cuddies, fkate, fine turbot and flounders, 
taken with lines. Gn the Little Ferry branch, mufTels, 
cockles, are gathered in plenty ; flounders, trouts of various 
kinds, and a few falmon are taken with nets. All thofe are 
in feafon as in other places : The country around purchafe 
all. Seals and porpoifes are on the coaft; fometimes fmall 
whales are feen near it ; and there are infhuices of 
fome being driven on fhore. About 5 or 6 years ago, 
haddocks were a penny the fcore ; now they are a penny 
each. There is a good deal both of tangle and bell-weed 
on the coaft, and ufed for manuring the lands to great ad- 
vantage. About 30 ton of kelp is made every third 
year. The tides run from eaft to weft, and from welt to 
.eaft. There is a pretty ftrong current in the Little Ferry, 
but not remarkable. 

Population.

Population.— About 100 years ago, the population is 
fuppofed not to have been above one half of what it is at 
prefent. In 1750 the number of inhabitants was 1302 ; at

The proportion between the annual births and the 
whole population is as 1 to 26 •, between marriages and it, 
as 1 to 85 •, between annual deaths and it, as 1 to 36. 
Each marriage, at an average, produces 7 children. The 
population would frill increafe were manufactures efta- 
bliflied. In Dr Webfter's report the number is 1790; 
but this feems t be exaggerated Several go in fpring 
to the South of Scotland, where they find berte encou-

but there are 42 of thofe houfes with only i inhabi-

Produce, &amp;c. — There is kail, potatoes, turnip, and every 
kind of garden roots ; firs of different kinds, afh, elm, al- 
der, plane-tree, narrow-leaved fervice, birch, hazle, alfo 
furze and broom. On the farm of Dunrobin, are at 
this time black cattle, of 3 and 4 years old, which 
would fell at L. 10 a-head. They are not large, but 
remarkable well ftiaped, well haired, and hardy. The 
number of black cattle may be 1100; of fheep 1000 ; 
of horfes 350. About 1000 arable acres, and a great ma- 
ny wafte. About 400 acres, or nearly fo, of grafs or 
pafture lands'. 850 acres may be employed in railing 
corn ; in raifing barley 330 acres; oats 180 ; peafe 14c; 
turnip 70 ; potatoes 160 ; and 150 acres are in fown grafs, 
befides ico acres of pafture ground. The parifh fup- 
plies itfelf with provilions ; and can fell 200 bolls of 
victual, and about 200 black cattle at an average. 
They fow peafe here in the beginning of March; 
oats about the middle ; and bear from the 20th of 
April to the 20th of May : They reap bear in Auguft and 
beginning of September, and oats and peafe almoft all in 
September. There are 500 or 600 -acres, befides hill ground 
common, all of little value, fit only for fheep pafture. 
About j miles fquare are planted with trees. The land 
rent of the parilh may be L. 700. The beft arable land is 
1 boll ; beii pafture 5 s. 6 d. the acre •, inferior 3 firlots a-

grounds, 55. No other farms in the parifh exceed 13 a - 
*res, and few are fo extenfive. Moft of the largeft farms arc 
inclofed; the fmaller ones are not. The people, in gene- 
ral, are convinced of the advantage of inclofures. In 1 78a 
and 1783, they paid their rents nearly in viftual, and had 
feed for their land. Tradefmen and others, whom the 
farmers could not fupply, got foreign victual that came to 
the country in fpring and fummer 1783 ; and all were well 
fupplied. 

Stipend and Poor. — The ftipend, including the glebe, is 
about L. 76. The patronage is vefted in the Countefs of Su- 
therland and Earl Gower. There are 100 on the poors lift ; 
and many objects of charity in the parifh befides. The 
annual collections are L. 6 at an average ; befides, there are 
L. 53 Sterling of a fund, being a prefent from the family 
•of Sutherland, to the poor, which produces annually L. 2, 
13 s. Fines, for delinquencies, may amount, at an ave- 
rage, to L. 3 : 6 : 8 ^ out of all which, the feffion-clerk, 
catechift, and kirk-officer get about L. 4 Sterling. 

Price of Provijions and Labour. — Beef and mutton 2^ d P

fummer, and 5 d. in winter : Carpenters and mafons 
1 s. 6 d. ; tailors is. A common labourer, when married, 
gets 4 bolls bear-meal, ac 10 ftone weight, and 2 bolls oat-

partly both, maintain their family pretty well. The 
wages of a male fervant, including perquifites, are e-

a-year. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . — There was a Ikirmifli on 
the plain between Golfpy and the Little Ferry, in the year 
1746, between a party of the rebels and the militia of the 
country, where the rebels were worfted, and feveral men 
of rank taken prifoners.— No remarkable wreck has hap- 
pened. — The mountain of Binbhragie may be about 3 quar- 
ters of a mile high. There is plenty of moorftone, freeftone, 
grey flate, all ufed in building houfes and fences. — Some 
are quarried, and a great many are got on the furface. — In 
1775 the burn of Golfpy overflowed the glebe-lands, and 
others adjacent; and in November 178 1, it overflowed 
the fame twice in the courfe of 10 days. — The number of 
ploughs in the parifh is 90, and all of the common kind, 
except thofe at Dunrobin ; the carts are 24. There is 1 
two-wheeled carriage. — There is 1 village along the fhofe 
of Golfpy. — There are the remains of an old caftle, fuppofed 
to be Piclifli, 3-4ths of a mile due well from the houfe of 
Dunrobin ; fome cells entire. — The fize of the people is 
from 5 feet 5 inches, to 5 feet 9. The greateft height 
which any have attained is 6 feet. — The inhabitants are 
oeconomical, humane, contented, and not fond of a feafaring 
life. — There are 3 boats conftantly ufed in fifliing, fome- 
times for freighting. None have entered the Navy, except 
thofe that were prelfed, or given up as the complement 
due from each boat's crew. Property is not changing,

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="NA">LOGIE and PERT</name>, 

(County of Forfar, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Brechin.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Peter.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Air, &amp;c. ** 

IT Teems probable, that the parifh of Logie, or Logie- 
Montrofe, as it was formerly called, was annexed to 
the parifh of Pert perhaps about the year 1610 or 1615. 
Logie, which is a very common name through Scotland, is 
faid to be of Gaelic extraction, and to fignify a ' flat or 
* low lituation,' which particularly correfponds to that of 
the Old Church of Logie, which is fituated in a hollow or 
low ground, by the fide of the Northefk river. Pert 
is of uncertain origin. The Old Church of Pert is like- 
wife fituated on the banks of the Northefk, very near the 
Old North Water Bridge, and about 3 miles up the river 
Vol. IX. E from

from Loipe. The United Parifh is fomething of an oblong, 
or rather elliptical form, though by no means regular; its 
gr ateft length from E. to W. is more than 4 Englifh miles, 
and its greateft breadth from S. to N. about 3 miles. The 
lower part of it lies along the banks of the river North- 
elk, which, by a beautiful curve, divides it towards the- 
north and eaft, from the pariihes of Marykirk and St Cy- 
rus. The upper part is pretty high, generally bending 
with a gentle declivity to the river, though good part of it 
likewife has a fouthern expofure. — The foil, chiefly in the 
lowev parts, is a deep clay, yielding, even in an uncultiva- 
ted ftate, plenty of natural grafs. That, in the higher 
grounds is partly a light loam, and partly of ablackrnoor- 
ifh caff, with a clay bottom, fpontaneoufly producing in its 
natural ftate, or when left uncultivated, a fhort heath, inter- 
mixed with furze and broom. — The air is in general fharp 
and falubrious, chough now and then rains and fogs from the 
fea, perhaps, in fume meafure, contribute to render it un- 
w ioleiome- The molt prevalent diftempers are fevers, which 
foinetimes prove highly infectious and epidemical. This 
was particularly the cafe in 1787-8, when, in little more 
than the fp .ce of a twelvemonth, about 30 individuals 
died of a malignant fever, which genrrally produced a de- 
lirium about the 4th or 51I1 day, and cut them off in lefs 
than a week after. Perhaps an officious, though ill-judged 
attention, lb own by the people in vifiring their lick neigh- 
bours, tended to 'pi ead the contagion, which might be ag- 
gravated by the want of a due regard to cleanlinefs, and to 
thf admiflion of frelh air. It was remarked, that though 
feveral young perfons who were feized with that fever re- 
covered, no one advanced in life, or even above the age of 
3c, experienced a recovery. The other difeafesmoft com-

doubt, prove "the more fatal, as the common people Mill 
ihow a very general averiion to inoculation. The plague 
raged here in 1648. 

Springs, Rivers, &amp;c— There are feveral fprings, though 
not of very great celebrity; one of them is a ftrong mine- 
ral, which is faid to be fer viewable in itomach dilordcrs. 
There is a fpring well in the old church-yard ot Logie, 
which was formerly much 'reported to by people who had 
fores There is a very copious fpring in Martin's Den, 
that would fill a bore of 4 inches diameter, nourilhing great 
abundance of water, with crefTes in its ftream. And there 
is in a field, near the fpot where the old manfe ot* Pert 
flood, a plentiful fpring of excellent water, likewife feeding 
a great quantity of watcr-creffes. Both rhis, and the fpring 
in Martin's Den, are fuppofed to be anti-fcorbutic. Tft( re 
is no lake, nor any river, except the Northeik already men- 
tioned, commonly called the North Water, dividing the 
counnes of Angus and Mearns. This river furnifflies a ti- 
tle to the noble family of Northeik, who formerly polTef- 
fed a large track of land in the pariih of Pert, and neigh- 
bourhood, on both dde 3 of the river, now in the pofleiTion of 
the Earl of Kintore and others, h ofe Hill, which gives 
title to the eldelt fon of the Earl of North, ik, is an emi- 
nence on the road fide, near the gate of Inglifmaldie, (a 
feat belonging to Lord Halkerton, now E ut ol Kintore,) 
and a little to the northward of the North Water Bridge ; 
whereas the Southefk, which runs part the town of Brechin, 
gave title to the Earl of Southelk, who was attainted m 
I7I5- 

The North Water produces excellent trout ,and falmon ; 
the latter, fome years in conhder.ible quantities, in that 
part of it which bounds the pariih of Logie Pert are caught, 
fome years from Candlemas to Michaelmas, (the legal term 

of

of fifhing here,) upwards of izoftone, though fome feafons 
often not half that quantity. The falmon-fifhing in this 
part of the nver has for fome time part, been much hurt 
by a dam-dike belonging to a proprietor of the fifhing be- 
low, the height of which prevents the falmon from getting 
up the ftream. To remedy this evil, recourfe has lately 
been had to a procefs at law. The falmon here are chiefly 
caught with the net, though angling both for trout and fal- 
mon is likewife frequently praftifed. The falmon are rec- 
koned in greateft perfection during the months of February, 
March, and April. They are commonly fent for fale to 
the Boil-houfe at Montrofe, where, at an average, they 
bring about 5 s. the ftone •, from thence they are exported 
to the London market. When fold on the fpot, towards 
the beginning of fpring, they frequently fetch 6d. a 
pound. 

Minerals, &amp;c— There are here feveral freeftone quar- 
ries, the rock rather foft, and at t no great depth from the 
furface. What ftones they have hitherto produced, have 
been ufed by the proprietors for their own private purpo- 
fes. But what particularly deferves notice, is the limework, 
which for fome years has been carrying on, and is ftill car- 
rying on to greater and greater extent in the diftricl: of Pert. 
Limeftone was firft difcovered here about the year 1780. 
For fome time it was wrought in the ufual way, but of late 
an attempt has been made by the principal proprietor, and 
with no inconfiderable fuccefs, to work it by mining, in 
the fame manner as coal is wrought in the fouthern parts 
of Scotland ; and a fubterraneous drain, intended to be a- 
bout 15 fathoms deep, and 400 yards in length, is now be- 
gun to be cut for clearing off the water from the quarries. 
The main ftratum, or vein of limeftone, extends from the 
Northefk nearly in a S. W. dire&amp;ion, through the whole 

pariili 



of Logie and Pert. 



37 



parifh of Pert, and enters the parifh of Strickathrow, where 
it is likewife wrought to fome extent. There are feveral 
veins, under one another, at different depths from the 
furface. One principal vein is at the depth of about 6 
feet, and nearly 12 feet thick To ufe the ftyle of the 
workmen, it is covered with a flrong fcourdy ftone, mixed 
with lime, and the pavement or bed is a thick body of red- 
difh freeftone, in which are feveral thin feams of limeflone. 
The vein now mining, which is fuppofed to be rather of 
fuperior quality *o the reft, is at the depth of more than 40 
feet. The feveral quarries are faid to have produced this 
year, upwards of 16,000 bolls of fhells ; each boll of fhells 
yielding about 3 boll:- of lime of exceeding fine powder. 
The lime is reckoned remarkably good, and is very lit ei- 
ther for building or manure. It is fold by wheat meafure 
at 1 s. 9 d. per boll ready money, and is. iod. credit. 
There are a good many hands employed in this work, efpe- 
cially in fpring and fummer, perhaps from 20 to 30 or up- 
wards. Good hands are allowed is. 2d. a-day, and 
when engaged by the quantity, at the rate of 6 d. the boll. 
About L. 2 being allowed for powder for 1600 or 1700 
bolls. The limeflone is burned with what is called Coom 
Coals, (the fame the blackfmiths ufe,) brought from Inver- 
keithing and other parts of the frith of Forth to the port 
of Montrofe, and from thence carried in carts to the lime- 
work. This coal is generally purchafed on the fpot, at 
3 s. 6d. the boll, the freight to Montrofe, exclufive of cu- 
ftom dues, is about 1 s. 5 d ; the cartage from Montrofe to 
the quarries, (about 7 miles diftance,) 2 s. the boll or 72 
ftone. In confequence of the above advantage of lime, 
improvements are faft advancing in this neighbourhood, and 
the value of land is every year riling. One proprietor is 
faid to have let fome of his farms at quadruple rent, after 
having fallowed, limed, drained, and inclofed the ground. 

The.

The duty on. coal, for burning lime into manure, falls very* 
heavy, and the taking it off, would not only operate as 'ait 
encouragement to the farmer, but might tend much t* 
the improvement of the country in general. 

Animals, Birds, &amp;c. — The animals of the wild kind arc 
chiefly hares, foxes, weafels, and polecats. The birds are, 
crows of different kinds, efpecially the rook, the raven, 
and the caiion crow ; partridges, blackbirds, herons, 
thrulhes, Iky and wood-larks ; magpies, robins, wrens, 
linnets, goldfinches, bulfinches, wood-pigcons, hawks of 
different fpecies. Gulls are found to flock hither before a 
ftorm from the fea, and we have prodigious flocks of fpar- 
rows, which are peculiarly deltrudfive to early grain. 
There is likewife found here in gardens, about the fruit 
feafon, a bird called by fome the oofal, faid to be but a re- 
cent vifitor in this part of the country, pretty much refem- 
bling the blackbird, only of a lighter dun colour. It devours 
fmall fruit very voracioufly. We have three fpecies of 
the fwallow. Our migratory birds are the cuckoo and 
fwallow, which laft makes its appearance in May, and dif- 
appears about the end of O&amp;ober. The moor of Pert fur- 
nifhes the lapwing, appearing in March, and difappearing 
about the end of harveft. In that moor alfo are plovers, 
wild ducks of different fpecies, (hipes, and wild geefe, 
which, though they do not ueft here, lodge in the moor, 
fometimes in hundreds during the night. The parifli alfo 
breeds a confiderable number of black cattle of a middling 
fize. 

Population- — According to the return made to DrWeb- 
fter, the numbers were then 696. There can be no do- 
cument found for ascertaining with precilion the ftate of the 
population here at a very early period, it appears from the 

feflion 



of Logie and Pert.

fcffion regifter, that between the years 1720 and 1730, the 
number of births each year, at an average, was from 20 to 
34. the number of mania es from 4 to 7, and the number 
of deaths from 12 to 16 ; from which it fhouid ieem, that 
the population then was nearly as great as at prefent. 
There are two circumftances which have tended much to 
di ninith the population here, as well as in feveral places 
of this neighbourhood, the monopoly of farms, and the dif- 
ferent mode of farming which has of late years been adopt- 
ed. There are in this parifh fundry initances ol two or 
more farms having been joined into one, which mull occa- 
fion a diminution of tenants; and as feveral^of the farmers 
now make ufe of hire/1 fervants in place of cottagers, and 
plough with one man and two horfes, in place of two men 
and four horfes formerly ufed ; this, likewife, though no 
doubt a more ceconomical fcheme, is lefs favourable to po- 
pulation, and tend^ to the decreafe of numbers. Owing to 
thefe caufes, the number of individuals would be reduced 
below what it formerly was, were it not for two other cau- 
fes, proving more than an overbalance, the limeworks al-r 
ready mentioned, and fome bleachfields, ISc. in the diftrift 
of Logie, which afbrd employment to a confiderable num- 
ber of hands. The amount of the population in the month 
of February this year (1 791) was about 999 individuals, 
of whom 469 were males, 530 females. None refide in 
towns, one family excepted, who generally refide for fome 
months during the winter feafon in Montrofe. . There is 
likewife a lady with her maid-fervant, not included in the 
above amount, who refide during the fummer in the old 
manfe of Logie. There are only two places in the parifh, 
which, with any fort of propriety, can be called villages, 
vim. North Water Bridge, and Mains of Craigo, the one 
containing only about 70 individuals, and the other about

Of thefe about 6 or 7 are 80 and upwards, none of them, 
however, have arrived at 90.— The number of farmers ha- 
ving families, and who earn a livelihood by farming, is a- 
bout 36. Of thefe about 5 or 6 pay from L. 100 to L.200 
Sterling of yearly rent ; the fecond clais from L. 20 to L. 50 
or more ; and the third clafs from L. 5 or L. 6 to L. 20. 
Befides thefe, there are feveral who occupy fmall tacks, 
which they hold chiefly of landed proprietors ; but which, 
being infufficient for their fubfiftence, they have recourfe 
at times to hiring for manual labour, or exercife fome trade, 
fuch as weaving, 13c. In this parifli, befides the bleachers 
and millers afterwards to be mentioned, and thofe employ- 
ed under them, there are 5 fmiths, 2 coopers, 9 wrights, 4 
mafons, 10 weavers, 7 tailors, 4 fhoemakers, 1 butcher, 1 
dyer, 4 merchants or ihopkeepers, 2 flax-drelTers, and about 
20 apprentices and journeymen in whole under thefe. A few 
hands are occafionally employed in falmon fifhing, one fer- 
rvman at the boat of Craigo, feveral miners employed at the 
limeworks, a few houfehold fervants, above 80 labouring fer- 
vants, male and female, and 2 ftudents. More than one third 
is fuppofed • have been born in other parilhes or diftridts of

are to the whole population, nearly in the proportion of 1 to 
42. Suppofing both parties parilhioners, the proportion be- 
tween the annual marriages and the whole population would 
be nearly as 1 to 99 but as it frequently happens, that fome 
one of the parties married belongs to a different parifh, 
this muft vary the proportion accordingly, and make it 
confiderably lefs. The annual deaths to the whole popu- 
lation, may be, on an average, as 1 to 86 or 90. The num- 
ber of married men having houfes is about 160 ; the num- 
ber of bachelors having ditto, 14, and widowers having 
ditto, 10. Each marriage, at an average, produces between 
4 and 5 children. None were ever known here to have died 
for want. The people in general being fob-r and indu- 
ftrious, fuch crimes as murder and robbery are unknown. 
One or two lome years ago emigrated to America, though 
from no neceffity, or want of good employment at home. 
None have been banifhed from the parifh as far back as carr 
be remembered. A few cottages have been fuffered to tall, 
but others in general have been built in lieu of them. 
The number of inhabited houfes is about 224, and the 
number of perfons at an average to each inhabited houfe, 
is between 4 and 5. 

Manufa&amp;ures, &amp;c. — The following are the principal : 
Two matter bleachers rending with their families, one at 
the bleachfield of Logie, the other at the bleach field of 
Craigo. At Logie bleachfield, belonging to a company in 
Montrofe, who have the field in tack from the proprietor 
of C raigo, there is a complete apparatus for bleaching of 
thread, and the quantity bleached here annually is from 
60,000 to 70,000 fpindles, which is almofl wholly difpofed 
of at the London market. This work, which was fet a-go- 
ing about 30 years fince, but which has of late been on the 
increafe, affords employment each feafon to about 40 hands,

men. women, and boys. Finding their own visuals, they 
receive of wages from 3 s. to 5 s. a-week, according to 
their age and expertnefs at the bulinefs.— Craigo bleachfield, 
which is likewife rented from the proprietor of Craigo by 
a gentleman in Montrofe, is at preient fubfet to a bleacher 
It was formerly ufed for bleaching of thread, but is now 
chiefly employed for whitening cloth. It affords work du- 
ring the proper leafon to 6 or 7 hnnds, at about 8d. a- 
day. Bo.h fields lie on the banks of the Northeik, within 
h.ilt' a mile of one another. The rent is extremely mode- 
rate, only a good deal has been laid out on proper houfes, 
machinery, i$c. At the mill of Craigo, befides the mill for 
grinding meal, there is a mill for cleaning yarn for the 
duck manufacture, and brown meeting ; it likewife con- 
tains an apparatus for beating coarfe thread, and furnii'hes 
pretry conitant work for 3 hands, each of whom may earn 
at the rate of lod. a day Here alfo is a flax mill, employ- 
ed in breaking and fcuiching flax, after a much improved 
method, at the rate of at lead 1500 ftones avoirdupoife 
yearly. This mill gives conitant employment to about 8 
h mds, each earning from 7 s. 6 d. to 9 s. a-week. The 
flax wrought here is all for home confumption. Near the 
above is a waukmill and dyehoufe. At the mill of Logie, 
belides a meal and barley mill, there is hard by the river 
fide a fnuff mill, held in feu from Craigo by a merchant in 
MoMtiofe. Between 30 and 40 years ago , when this mill 
wao firfl eredled, and when importation of tobacco was al T 
lowed at the port of Montrofe, there were annually manu- 
factured here, and fold at about 1 s. the lb. for exportation, 
near 40, - 00 lb. fnuff. Since the importation of tobacco at 
Montrofe was prohibited, this manufacture has confiderably 
declined. Tobacco for this mill is now conveyed coaft- 
wifc by the Canal from Glafgow. There is now only one 
perion employed here, and about 5000 lb. of fnuff annual- 
ly

\j manufactured and fold for home confumption, at the 
rate or 2 s. 4d. the pound. There is lifcewiie here a mill, 
with io beaters for beating thread. In the united pariih. 
are 3 meal mills, employing a miller, befides affiftants. 
The whole pariih of Pert is under thirlage to the mill of 
Pert, forae paying and others T ' r multure, befides 
knavelhip, ifc. The whole land of Craigo is under thir- 
lage to the mill of Craigo at ^ Jf befides knavelhip, ifc. 
There is no thirlage at the mill of Logie. This thirlage, 
which is a fort of old feudal tenure, by which tenants and 
others are bound at a certain fixed race, to have their corns 
ground at certain mills, is generally conlidered as a grie- 
vance, and is at fome mills a prelude to very indifferent 
ufage. 

Agriculture, &amp;c. — Some woodlands on the eftate of 
Craigo are found to produce a confiderable variety of mofs, 
no fewer thin 14 or 15 different fpecies, fome of which 
have been tranfmitted for the inflection of the Royal So- 
ciety at London. Some of the old woods are Scots fir, others 
a mixture of hard wood, fuch as am, elm, oak, birch, &amp;c. 
The young plantations on the different eftates in the pariih. 
confilt p-rtly of Scots fir, and partly of larix, fpruce, 
plane, elm, beech, afh, birch, in Ihort, an intermixture 
of all kinds, commonly raifed in nurferies. — About 450 
acres have been planted here within thefe 10 or 1 q years 
paft ; and of thefe about 270 acres were inclofed, and 
nearly planted out the 2 laft^years. — According to the 
bed computation, there are from 180 to 190 horfes 
in the pariih, young and old ; about 740 black cattle, 
exclufive ot calves, about 200 of which are annually brought 
up. There was formerly a great number of (heep in this 
parifh ; but fince the inclofing of fields and fowing of arti- 
ficial grak took, place, the breeding of fheep has in reat

meafure been given up ; fo that there is fcarcely now 100 
fheep in the whole ; pariih, and thefe are chiefly kept for 
the ufe of the table. The parifh can afford itfelf a very 
tolerable fupply of various kinds of provifions. It does not 
export any confiderable quantity; but finds in general a rea- 
dy market for grain of different kinds at Brechin and Mon- 
trofe, where it is bought partly for the ufe of the inha- 
bitants, and partly by commiifion for exportation to other 
places. Both at Brechin and Montrofe, but efpecially the 
latter, a good deal of bear and barley is fold for malting. 
Till of late years very little ground was fown in artificial 
graffes. It is faid the firft ever known in the parifh was a- 
bout the year 1746 or 1747, when a perfon in the parifh 
of Pert having fown a ridge with clover, got a public pro- 
clamation made for people to keep off their fheep and cat- 
tle from it, which brought many to fee it as a matter of 
curiofity. Oats are generally fown about the end of 
March, and begin to be reaped about the ift of September, 
and fometimes later. Barley is fown about the middle of" 
April, bear later ; and both are commonly reaped rather 
earlier than oats.. Peafe are fown and reaped much about 
the fame time with oats. Wheat is fown here in Septem- 
ber and Oftober, and reaped about the fame time with 
barley. The ripening of the diffei-ent corn crops is rather 
retarded by the liming now fo much in ufe. Flax is fown 
about the end of March, and reaped the ift of Au- 
guft. Turnips are fown about the middle of June ; grafs 
feeds according to the different crops with which they are 
fown out; and hay is ufually cut in July. The grofs a- 
mount of the parifh in Scots acres, with the different ways 
in which thefe at an average are employed, are as follow :

The valued rent is L. 381^ : 9 14 Scots. The real rent, 
including the value of what the feveral proprietors hold in 
their own poffeffion, furplus rents, rents of mills, bleach- 
fields, &amp;c lime works not included, may be from L. 1800 
to L. 1900 Sterling. The number of ploughs is about 55 ; 
of carts 64. Several of the ploughs are of the old Scotch 
kind, others of a lighter conftru&amp;ion. The belt arable 
land in the parifh lets at about a guinea an acre ; that of an 
inferior quality at about 10 s. or 15 s. The number of 
farms is rather diminifhing, owing to junction or monopo- 
ly. Moft of the parifla of Pert, and a good part of Logie, 
is incloied, partly with hawthorn, and partly with furze 
hedges on funk fences. No doubt hedges are a great bene- 
fit in point of Ihelter, as well as ornament. They are 
only found inconvenient in a wet harveft and low fituation. 
The hawthorn likewife harbours prodigious flocks of fpar- 
rows, which devour confiderable quantities of grain. Per- 
haps ilone fences, built pretty high, might in ibme refpecls

be preferable, as fheep could be more commodioufly kept 
within thefe ; and furely it is a circumftance much to be 
wifhed, that the breed of iheep were more encouraged here 
than it now is. Many of the people in the parifh have 
ftill an unreafonable averfion to inclofing, notwithstanding 
its many obvious advantages. 

Advantages and Difadvajitages. — It is an advantage, that 
the centre of the united pariihes, lying at nearly an equal 
diftance from the market towns of Montrofe and Brechin, 
about 4 or 5 meafured miles from either, there is found 
a ready fale for grain, poultry, butter, cheefe, eggs, &amp;c. 
But then there is a difadvantage refulting to thofe of the 
parifh who have fuch articles to buy ; becaufe on account of 
the demand at thefe towns, enhanced of late by a number 
of monied men, who have fettled in thefe places and neigh- 
bourhood, there is no article of provifion can be purchafed 
within the parifh, but at a very dear rate, and even higher 
than in the above market towns. There is likewife a tem- 
porary difadvantage,which thofe efpecially of the poorer clafs 
are beginning to feel : The coal has here, for a considera- 
ble time, been the principal article of fuel, yet the common 
people have in a good meafure likewife depended partly on 
furze and broom, and partly on turf and peat. The furze and 
broom begin to fail, as mofl of the waftes, from whence 
thefe were procured, are either inclofing or converting 
into corn ground. The article of turf becomes ftill fcarcer, 
as the moors from which that was got, are now for the 
mod part inclofed and planted, and the low country mofies 
which furnifhed peat, become every day more and more 
exhausted, fo that in a few years a total failure of them 
may be apprehended ; and as to peats from the hills, the 
diftance from hence, which is 10 or 12 miles, part of it 
very fteep and difagreeable road, renders it extremely diffi- 
cult, 



of Logie and Pert, 47 

«ult, as well as expenfive, to procure them ; fo that the pa- 
riihioners here, in a Ihort time, will be chiefly confined to 
two articles, wood and coals. Burn-wood at prel'ent is 
by no means plentiful ; and though there be a good many 
rifing plantations in the parifti, yet thefe moftly confitt of 
hard wood ; and, at any rate, feveral years muft elaple be- 
fore they can prove ferviceable in the way of fuel. On this 
account, there will be at leaft a temporary neceffity of u- 
iing a greater -quantity of coal, which will fall very heavy 
on the poorer fort, by reafon of the additional tax on that 
article, all to the north of the Red Head, a promontory 
near Arbroath. It is hoped the Legiflature will be in- 
duced to abolifh this very partial and unreafonable tax. 
Under this article, it may be proper to remark, that the 
bl ,:c 1 fields, lime quarries, 6cc. in the parifli are a very con- 
fiderable local advantage, as t'iey furnilh employment, efpe- 
cially during the fpring and lummer feafoui, to near 80 in- 
dividuals; befides, the fmaller tenants, and others who have 
horfes, earn no inconfiderable profit, by carting coals to 
the liine-works from Montrofe. 

Stipend, School, Poor. — The value of the living, including 
the glebe, is one year with another about L. 80 Sterling. 
The patrons are the Crown, and the New College of St 
Andrew's per vices. The fchoolmafter's falary, including 
fchool-fees, and other perquifites, is better than L. 20 Ster- 
ling a-year, befides a free houfe and garden. He has in 
the winter fealon from 40 to 50 fcholars, and in fummer 
from 30 to 40. His terms for Latin and arithmetic are 
as. 6d. the quarter; writing 2S. ; reading Englifh is. 6 d. 
The number of poor in the parifti at prefent receiving alms, 
is about 25. The annual amount for their relief, may be, 
one year with another, about L. 40 Sterling. 

Prices ofProvifions, Labour, &amp;c— All kinds of butcher 
peat fell nearly at 4 d. the lb. except pork, which is about 

3i*.

3 1- d. ; eggs, 4 d. the dozen; fowl,, from is. 8 d. to 2 s. 
the pair, according to the feafon ; chickens, 7 d. the pair; 
ducks, is. 4 d. ditto; butter, at an average through the 
year, may be reckoned at %\ d. the lb. ; whereas, about 30 
or 40 years ago, beef or mutton could have been bought 
here at i^d. the lb. ; a pair of good chickens, at 2 d. a do- 
zen ; eggs, at 1 d. ; butter, at 4 d. tne lb. and other articles 
in proportion. — The wages of an oidinaiy labourer are about 
8 d. a day in winter, and 10 d. in lumraer, finding his own 
provifions ; of a mafom about 1 s. 8 d. ; of a wright, about 
I s. 4 d. ; of a tailor, 1 s. if he finds his own viduals, and 
6 d. if victuals are afforded him. The mafons and wrights 
moll frequently work by the piece. — Coal, Scotch and 
Englifh, is the chief article of fuel here, though peat, turf, 
furze, broom, and wood, are likewife occasionally ufed. 
The Scotch coal is at prefent about 8 s. the boll at the 
port of Montrofe, the boll weighing 70 ftone, cartage from 
thence about 1 s. 6 d. or 2 s. the boll, according to the di- 
ftance. The Englifh coal, which is likewife much ufed, is 
about is. 6 d. the barrel, fix barrels being fuppofed rather 
better than a boll of Scotch. Peat from the moffes in Fet- 
tercairn parifh, about 6 miles diftant, is bought on the fpot 
out of flacks at 1 s. the foot, the cartage about 1 s. 6 d. the 
cart load. The cart load of broom or furze, cofts from 1 s. 
to is. 6 d. ; turf can fcarcely be got at any price ; dead 
wood is fold here at about half value. With regard to the 
expence of a common labourer when married, if he have a 
family confiding of three or four children, it cannot be lefs 
than L. 12 or L. 13 Sterling a-year ; yet if he and his 
wife be frugal and induftrious, they may make a fhift to 
earn a tolerable livelihood, efpecially, if they have a kail 
yard, and maintenance for a cow, as is pretty generally the 
cafe here. The man may gain at the rate of 8 d. or 9 d. a 
day, the wife, by fpinning, may earn 8 d. or is. a- week,

even when occafionally engaged in nurfmg; and the children, 
when 7 or 8 years of age, begin to be hired out as herds. 
Though the food of the labourer be but coarfe, yet he has 
plenty of meal, potatoes, and milk, and his bed is generally 
good. Pottage, brofe, and flummery, are the peafants three 
ordinary meals. The wages of men fervants in hufbandry 
throughout this parilh and neighbourhood, are from L 6 to 
L. 7 Sterling a-year, and they are commonly engaged half 
yearly. The wages of women fervants, who are like wife 
engaged by the half year, are about L. 3 a-year, together 
with what is called bounties, confifting ufually of an apron 
and a yard of coarfe linen, value in all about 3 s. The har- 
•veft wages of men reapers are, now for good hands about 
L.i, 5 s. and women ditto about 16 s. 8 d. befides victuals. 
When engaged by the day, men get about 1 s. women, 
8 d. and their victuals. 

Stature, Manners, Drefs, See — The people are ordinari- 
ly of a middling ftature, the men being from 5 feet 5 inch- 
es high, to 5 feet 10, and the women from 5 feet 2 or 3 
inches, to 5 feet 7, though there are feveral of the men 6 
feet, and of the women 5 feet 9 or 10. There are inftan- 
ces of fome individuals having reached the height of 6 feet 
3 or 4 inches. — The people in general are dilpofed to indu- 
llry, and feem fond of agriculture. There are no manu- 
factures carried on in the parilh, excepting the limeworks, 
bleaching, &amp;c. already mentioned, only the women find 
excellent employment in fpinning factory yarn, given out 
by the Ihopkeepers in the parilh, for which at prefent 
they get at the rate of 1 s. and even 15 d. the fpindle. The 
people do not feem to poflefs any fondnefs either for a fea- 
faring or military life ; the former, however, they look 
upon to be rather more reputable than the latter, which, 
,on account of its fuppofed connexion with profligacy and

irreligion, they regard in a degrading point of light, and 
when the ion of fober and difcreet parents inlifts to be a 
foldier, they give him up in a manner for loft. Though 
the parifhioners here in general cannot be charged with 
want of ceconomy, or with being more expenfive or luxu- 
rious than their neighbours, yet it muft be acknowledged, 
that their mode of living now is widely different from 
what it was 30 or 40 years ago. About that time, except- 
ing in the houfes of perfons of property or in a genteel 
ftation, tea was unknown ; but now there is fcarcely a houfe 
in the parilh, excepting thofe in indigent circumftances, in 
which tea is not ufed at leaft once a-week, and by many of 
the farmers twice a-day. Formerly butcher meat was fel- 
dom or never ufed by the*lower or middling ranks, except 
about Chriftmas, but now it is no unfrequent article at any 
feafon of the year. Next to oat and bear meal, potatoes, 
which begin to be much eiiltirated, conftitute the principal 
food of the poorer clafs. — The mode of drefs likewife, 
within thefe 20 or 30 years paft, has undergone a very 
confiderable alteration. Formerly the women of inferior 
ftations appeared at church on Sundays in bed blankets, or 
tartan plaids; but now they wear fcarlet plaids, or duffle 
cloaks and bonnets ; and maid-fervants are fometimes as well 
dreffed as their miftreffes. Formerly farmers and refpecla- 
ble tradefmen were contented with the blue bonnet, and 
with fay for their beft clothes, while hiremen and appren- 
tices wore coarfe grey, or white woollen cloth, home made ; 
but now, . not only farmers and malter tradefmen, but 
farmers fervants, apprentices, and cottagers, frequently ap- 
pear at kirk and market in hats and Englifti broad cloth. 
Formerly clocks and watches were not ufed in the parifh, 
excepting, perhaps, by the laird or minifter ; but now, in 
general, every farmer has his eight-day clock, and almoft 
every fervant has his watch. — With regard to the ftyle in

Which the gentry in this parifli live, it can fcarceiy be rec- 
koned more fplendid and fdmptuous than it was 20 or 30 
years ago, though, generally fpeaking, there is an increafe 
both of fplendour and luxury in many places of the neigh, 
bourhood, occafioned chiefly by the influx of wealth from 
the Eaft and Weft Indies. 

Antiquities.— There are in the parifh or diftrid of Lo- 
gie, at nearly a mile to the weft of the manfion-houfe of 
Craigo, and a little to the right of the public road, lead- 
ing from the Old North Water Bridge to Montrofe, 
three remarkable tumuli, called the three Laws of Logie, 
and not far from thence, on the border of the parilh of 
Montrofe, a fourth tumulus, called Leighton's Law. Of 
the three Laws of Logie, two have been opened, in dig- 
ging fand or gravel for the roads. In one of thefe, fome 
years ago, was found a ftone coffin ; not any ways cut or 
wrought, but confifting of feparate pieces in a natural ftate, 
ibmething refembling grey flate (tones. Within it was a 
human fkeleton, having the bones of an extraordinary lize, 
moftly entire and of a deep yellow colour, but when touch- 
ed, exceedingly brittle. The fecond Law was found to 
contain four human fkelcons, depofited only at about a foot 
depth from the furface, likewife confining of exceedingly 
large bones j and at a very little diftance from thefe was 
found a beautiful ring, fuppofed to be of ebony, as black as 
jet, of a fine polifh, and in perfect prefervation. This ring, 
which the minifter of the parifli has in his cuftody, is of a 
circular form, flat in the infide, and rounded without ; its 
circumference is about 12 inches, and diameter 4. The 
thicknefs of its rim in the middle is more than half an inch, 
and its greateft breadth about an inch and a half, which di- 
miniflies in a gradual proportion till it is only abont ^ of 
m inch. It lets in an ordinary hand, would fit a pretty

large wrift or arm, and perhaps may have been worn as a'- 
bracelet by fome perfon of diftinftion. In the fame tumu- 
lus, at about 4 feet from the furface, was found an urn full 
of afhes, fomtthing in the fhape of a common bottle with- 
out a bottom, lying horizontally, with the neck end clofe, 
and of a fubftance refembling a crucible. There were like- 
wife difcovered in the fame place feveral cavities, near 6 
feet from the furface. The third and largeft of the three 
Laws, which has not yet been broken up, contains a fpace 
equal to the •§ of an acre, nearly circular, with a fort of 
foffe round it, filled up with round Hones, intermingled 
with pieces of glafs. There is reafon to believe, that thefe 
Laws, if duly examined, would be found to contain many 
more bones, urns, Sec : but there is no tradition concern- 
ing them, by which it can be afcertained whether they 
have been raifed by the Danes or Romans, or ancient Cale- 
donians. Mention is made by Buchanan in his hiftory of 
Scotland, to which Gordon alludes in his Itenerarium Sep* 
tentrionale, that about 1000 years ago, a little before the 
celebrated battle of Luncarty, in the reign of Swino, a par- 
ty of Danes landed at the mouth of the Elk, and fought in 
that neighbourhood feveral ikirmifhes with the Scots ; and 
it is not improbable but thefe Laws or mounds might have 
then been raifed, in burning or burying the {lain. Or, as 
Law is a word of Saxon origin, perhaps thefe tumuli might 
have been begun by the Saxons, who, at a very early pe- 
riod, are faid to have made incurfions all along the coaft of 
this ifland. The three Laws, with the adjacent ground, 
have been lately inclofed and planted by the proprietor of 
Craigo.— Eaft from the above Laws, in a ftraight line, and 
within a plantation of Craigo's, are three large ftones fet up 
on end, with two others very near them, in a fimilar por- 
tion ; and to the eaft of all are the remains of a circular 
fort of building, about 16 yards in diameter. The ground

• was lately trenched, but no mark of human bones difco- 
vered. This is conje&amp;ured to have been a drudical tern- 
pie. 

Roads, Bridges, &amp;c— There are two, or rather three pu- 
blic roads, leading through the united parifh. Befides thefe,. 
are fundry private or by-roids. Till a year' or two 
ago, the roads in the parifh were made and kept in repair 
by ftatute labour ; but by a late act of Parliament, the fta- 
tute labour in this county was converted into money. By 
the aft, the occupiers of lands, whether proprietors or te- 
nants, are liable to pay yearly, an affeflment in money, for 
the lands occupied by them refpe&amp;ively, according as the 
faid lands Hand valued in the tax-roll of the county, at a 
rate not exceeding the fum of L. i, 4 s. Sterling for each 
L. 100 Scots of valued rent. Accordingly in this parilb, 
now, the landed proprietors being affeffed in proportion to 
their valued rents, levy the affeflment from their tenants 
according to the real rents they pay, and they again from 
their fubtenants ; the proprietors, at the fame time, being 
accountable for what they themfelves occupy. This mode 
is deemed rather more favourable to the poorer clafs of in- 
habitants, than the exaction of the ftatute labour in kind, 
but is thought more burdenfome on the farmer. Turn- 
pikes are conlidered as by no means neceffary here ; and 
the erecting of them at prefent would be rather an unpopu- 
lar meafure. — With regard to bridges, 2 have been built 
this fummer in the parifh of Logie, chiefly by fubfcription, 
on the road leading from Marykirk to Montrofe. On the 
weft public road are 2 fmall bridges, built fome years ago. 
As to being kept in repair,, they are now upon the fame 
footing with the public roads. The principal bridge in the 
parifh, and which canneds it with the Mearns, Is the- 
North Water Bridge, confiding of 3 arches* of exceeding

ftrong work. This is now commonly called the Old Bridge, 
with a reference to the new one, which fome years ago 
was built acrofs the North Water, near the mouth of it, on 
the great coail road. The old North Water Bridge was 
built by John Erikine of Dun, fuperintendant of Angus 
and Mearns, upwards of 200 years ago. Concerning the 
builder of this North Water Bridge, popular tradition fays, 
" That having had a dream or viiion, that unlefs he mould 
build a bridge over Stormy Grain, where 3 waters run in 
one, he would be miferable after death. Accordingly go- 
ing out one day in a penlive mood, and walking along the 
banks of the North Elk, he met an old woman near the 
fpot where the bridge now ftands, and alking the name of 
the place, received for anfwer, that it was called Stor- 
my Grain, where 3 waters run in one. Hence, recog- 
niling this to be the fpot to whieh his dream alluded, he 
immediately fet about building a bridge there ; but the 
bridge being founded, and the work going on, a fpeat in 
the river fwept it away, upon which he ordered the bridge 
to be begun anew. But after it was conliderably advanced, 
it tumbled down a fecond time. Mr Erikine was now fo 
much difcouraged, that he fell into a deep melancholy, 
and kept his bed. One day, however, obferving a fpider 
attempting to weave a web, he faw it fall down ; making 
a fecond attempt, it was equally unfuccefsful ; but trying a 
third time, it fucceeded. Accordingly encouraged by this, 
he caufed it be begun a third time, and had the good for- 
tune to fucceed." Whether there be any real ground for 
this traditionary 'ftory or not, it is by no means abhorrent 
from the call of mind that charadterifed thofe times. 

Mifcellaneous 01 fer -nations . —In 1782, the crop was not 
all got in till confiderably after Martinmas. Ten bolls of 
bear were then purchafed at the feffion's expence, for the ufe 

of 



of Logie and Peru 55 

ef the poor at the rate of 24 s. the boll, and were either fold 
at a reduced price, or given gratis 5 befides a prefent of 10 
bolls, confifting of a mixture of oats, barley, rye, &amp;c. recei- 
ved then from Government, was diftributed among the poor. 
Oat-meal here at that time fold at 2CS. the boll.— There 
are two principal alehoufes, in a manner neceffary, as be- 
ing on public roads, with one or two more, perhaps, lefs 
requifite. The bad erFefts of thofe on the morals of the 
people are not very perceptible, though the increafe of pu- 
blic houfes both in town and country is always to be re- 
gretted. The heavy Excife laws, and the enormous duty 
on malt, make beer lefs brewed in private families than 
formerly, though perhaps, whilky is more ufed. Within 
thefe ten years paft, near 30 new houfes or cottages have 
been built in the parifh where there were none before ; 
perhaps, about half a dozen during that fpace have been 
pulled down, or fufFered to fall into ruins. Employing cot- 
tagers in agriculture, is thought by fome of the farmers 
here to be lefs frugal than keeping hired fervants in the 
houfe, though it no doubt, is more favourable to popula- 
tion.— The meadows and lower grounds on the Northelk 
are very fubject to inundations, which have fometimes done 
confiderable damage, efpecially in the time of harveft. In 
J 774» when the river rofe to an almoft unprecedented 
height, it fwept away a great deal of cut corn, and laid flat 
fundry fields that were uncut, fpoiling them with fand ; 
and laft autumn, an uncommon flood fwept away from a 
farm in this neighbourhood, on the oppofite banks of the 
river, more than half an acre of ground, with about 60 bolls 
of lime lying upon fallow \ at any time fix hours of wind 
and rain from the S. or S. E. will make it rife, fo as to o- 
verflow all its banks. — In the year 1784, a very remark- 
able meteor was feen here, as it was through the moft part of 
the kingdom, as well as in fome foreign parts. It made 

its

Statijlical Account 



its appearance about 7 o'clock in the evening, moving in a. 
rapid and majeftic manner, fomething in a direction from 
N. W. to S. E. having its vifible magnitude equal to that 
of the full moon, and a light much fuperior ; at length it 
difappeared as it were in the ocean. This meteor muft have 
been of prodigious bignefs, its velocity imnienfe, and its 
altiiude many miles.— -The common people here make ufe 
of the ordinary Scottifh dialect, with lefs tone than they 
fpeak in Fife, though not near fo fhort as they do in Aber- 
•deenfhire. With regard to the names of places in the pa- 
rilh, many of them feem to be of Gaelic or Celtic extrac- 
tion. — Property in land here is very often changing $ of 
this there have been no lefs than four material inftances s in 
the united parifh of Logie and Pert, within 8 or 10 years 
paft ; and during that period, or little more, near the banks 
of the Northelk, and within the extent of 5 or 6 miles, no 
fewer than 8 eftates have been in the market, and changed 
their proprietors. This rapid alienation of property, may 
in one inltance or two be accounted for on political confi- 
derations, but is chiefly imputable to the two following 
caufes : — Some of the old proprietors having been men of 
pleafure, and not fufficiently attentive to their worldly in- 
tereft, were obliged to fell their land from the impulfe of 
neceflity, or pecuniary embarraffment ; others of them, a- 
gaiu, who had feveral children, having, in contradiction to 
the old feudal fpirit, made liberal provifion in their fettle- 
ments for the younger branches of their families ; this ren- 
dered the fale of their ellates unavoidable on their demife. 
Land fells here at 25 or 30 years purchafe, and feems to be 
on the increafe. — The people are by no means ungenerous 
or uncharitable, according to their circumftances ; if at any 
time they fee virtue or induftry in diftrefs, their chearful and 
ready fupport is not wanting ; but when vice is plunged 
into wretchednefs, perhaps their pity is too much withheld, 

from 



tf Logte and Pert.

from not making a proper difcrimination between the per- 
fon and the crime, the vice and the niifery it involves. 
The people enjoy the comforts and advantages of fociety 
in a very tolerable degree, though the increafe of taxation, 
and of the price of provifions, efpecially with regard to 
the poorer clafs, operates as a confiderable abatement. Se- 
veral of the tenants enjoying long leafes at the old rent, 
which is nearly one half lefs than what their farms would 
let for at prefent, have in their hands the means of a com- 
fortable fubfiitence, and by induftry and frugality may be- 
come rich. But the new leafes in general bein$ pretty far 
ftretched, and the wages of fervants every year growing 
higher, thofe, it is to be prefumed, who hold fuch leafes, 
if they are not extremely a£tive and induftrious indeed, 
muft find confiderable difficulties. Were the Wages of fer- 
vants rendered in fome meafure ftationary, and greater 
moderation obferved in the railing of rents, not only might 
tenants and their fervants be on a more eligible footing, 
but landed proprietors would enjoy greater and more perma- 
nent fecurity, befides the generous fatisfa&amp;ion of not entirely 
engrofling the fruits of honeft induftry. Were there pre- 
miums allotted by monied men for the improvement of 
barren ground, and the melioration of ground already in 
fome meafure cultivated, (the improvement or melioration 
to be eftimated by an impartial jury,) many beneficial con- 
fequences might enfue.

Presbytery of Paisley.) 

By the Rev. Walter Young, M. A. F.R. S. Ediiu</head> 



<p>Name, 8cc. 

r I " HE name Krfkine was written in ancient charters Irif- 
kyn. Antiquaries are not agreed, whether the fami- 
ly of Mar, who held the lands oi Erikine until the year 1638, 
gave their firname to the lands, or received it from them. 
Crawford is of the latter opinion, in confequence of his gene- 
ral principle with regard to the allumption of fixed firnames 
by the proprietors of land. Other antiquaries relate a ftory 
of the firname Eris-Skyne having been given by King Mal- 
colm II. to the founder of that noble family, on occafion of 
a military atchievement. The lands or caftle of Erikine 
have probably given name to the church, and of courfe to 
the whole parochial diftridt annexed to it. The form of

the parifli is oblong •, the length from eaft to weft, and a 
little north, is about 6 Englifh miles, and the breadth 
from 3 to 4 ; the number of acres which it contains is not 
known. It is bounded on the north wholly by the river 
Clyde. 

Surface and Soil. — The general appearance of the eaft- 
ern part of the parifli is flat, with gentle fwells. A ridge 
of hilly ground runs through the weftern divifion. As this 
however declines gradually on the north fide towards the 
Clyde, and on the fouth towards a valley, there are even 
in that divifion confiderable traces of arable ground. The 
foil is in general light and not deep. In the north-eaft 
part of the parifli, it is a blackifli or dark grey mould, mix- 
ed with gravel, having under it gravel, or a mixture of 
fand, clay, and gravel ; in lome places till, and under that 
rotten rock or freeftone. From this ftru&amp;ure, that tract a- 
bounds with fprings of excellent water. The foil being 
warm and dry, is well adapted for producing oats, bear, 
and fown graffes ; it alfo yields plentiful crops of potatoes 
of the beft quality, and of turnips. It is not fo proper for 
wheat and peafe ; and even the oats and barley which it 
produces are fomewhat inferior in quality, or weigh lefs to 
the meafure than what are produced in ftronger and deeper 
foils. But perhaps the moll valuable property of this foil 
is the difpofition it has to run to grafs. When it is allow- 
ed to reft, if it has been judicioufly managed, and not over- 
cropped, it in a year or two becomes covered with a thick, 
fward of grafs, often mixed with white clover, which, 
though not of the richeft quality, is abundant, and conti- 
nually improves during the 4 or 5 years that the ground re- 
mains in pafture. The fame things may be obferved of 
the weftern divifion of the parifli ; only as that is more 
hilly, the foil is more mallow and ftony, and in general 

lies

lies over whin rock. There are 6 or 7 farms in the fouth-eaft 
part of the parifh, which are lituated along the edge of, or 
within an extrnlive tracf of flat or carfe ground, a great part 
of which is covered with peat mofs, and has probably been 
all fo. The foil of thefe 'arms is a deep clay, and abundant- 
ly fertile. It may alfo be obferved, that foreft trees thrive 
well in many places of the parifh, particularly in rhe neigh- 
bourhood of the Clyde. — There is no lake nor river in the 
parifh ; the boundaries of it are for the moft part marked 
out by fmall ftreams or burns. The Clyde, which waihes 
the northern edge, is in breadth, when the tide is full, from 
about a quarter of a mile at the eaft, to above a mile and a 
half at the weft end of the parifh. The ground immedi- 
ately adjoining to the Clyde is every where flat. The 
breadth of this plain is various ; at one place, (hence call- 
ed Longhaugh), it may be near a quarter of a mile ; but in 
molt places, it is not above the half or fourth part of that 
extent. Behind the plain, the bank generally rifes pretty 
fuddenly to a confiderable heighth. As the Clyde ha? 
fuch a wide bed, land floods feldom raife it very confider- 
ably, unlefs a ftrong S W. wind, and a high tide occur 
at the fame time. In that cafe, fome of the low grounds are 
covered, but feldom any remarkable mifchief is done. — 
There are fome freeflone quarries in the eaftern part of 
the parifh. Two of them in one of Lord Blantyre's parks 
have been wrought of late for the great canal, and for 
building new quays for the ferry. Some appearances of 
coal have been difcovered in thefe grounds, but they have 
never been properly purfued. The hills in the weft part 
of the parifh are in general green ; the tops of them only 
are covered with heath.

Climate and Difeafes. — Although a confiderable quantity 
of rain falls here, as in all other places on the weftern fide 
of the ifland, the air cannot properly be called moift,and may 
be pronounced upon the whole healthy. By the light foil, 
and gTavelly bottom, the water is loon abforbed, or it runs 
off by the hollows ; and as any hollow, or flat pieces of 
ground, which are not ploughed, are always compleatly co- 
vered with grafs, there are no unwholefome marfhes. A- 
gues, dyfenteries, and luch other difeafes as are occafioned 
by noxious effluvia from the foil, are fcarcely known by 
name. The molt prevalent diltempers are fevers, arifing 
from cold and other cauies. Thefe at times become in fome 
degree epidemic, or go thro' a confideriible number of families. 
Thefe epidemics are hardly ever of a very malignant nature, 
and feldom above 3 or 4 perfons die in the courfe of them. 
They are probably fpread and aggravated more than they 
would otherwife be, from two caufes, both of which, how- 
ever, are gradually diminifhing : iji, From large families 
being often crowded together in fmall houfes, where too 
little attention is given to cleanlinefs and ventilation ; and, 
"idly. Prom an idea which the country people have, that it is 
their duty frequently to vifit their neighbours when in dif- 
trefs. Hence it happens, that the place in which the fick 
perfons are lying is frequently crowded with people, the 
patients are ftifled, and the infection is fpread. Thefe epi- 
demic fevers appear at the rate of about once in 2 or 3 
years. The fmall- pox Hill makes occafionally confiderable 
ravages among the children, as the people are only begin- 
ning to overcome their prejudices againft inoculation. 

Ferries. — There are 2 ferries acrofs the Clyde in this pa- 
rim. One of them, called the Eaft Ferry; or Ferry of Er- 
Ikine, is nearly oppofite to the village of Kilpatrick, and 
ferves for tranfporting horfes and carriages, as well as foot- 

pafiengers. 



62 



Statiftical Account 



paflengers. The quays for it were lately built, and are 
abundantly commodious. The other called the Weft Fer- 
ry, is oppofite to the caftle of Dunbarton, and is chiefly 
ufed for foot-pafiengers. 

Fificries. — There are two or three falmon filheries in the 
Clyde, as it pafles along this parifli ; but as the fifhing 
banks are more contiguous to the oppofite or Kilpatrick 
lhore, none of them are occupied by inhabitants of this pa- 
rifh. The fifh are taken in large nets, the rope of one end 
of which being made fall to the fhore or bank, and the net 
laid in folds upon the flat end of a boat, the boat is rowed 
a certain way into the river, dropping the net as it goes a- 
long, and, having made a fweep againlt the tide, is brought 
back to the place from which it fet out. The net is im- 
mediately afterwards drawn afhore. The right of catching 
falmon on moll of the fifhing banks in Clyde from Ren- 
frew, as far down as the confines of Ayrflrire, belongs by 
ancient charter to the burgh of Renfrew. The falmon 
fifliery in this tradl has, for many years, been rather fcan- 
ty. The operations for improving the navigation of the 
river, which were executed by the town of Glafgow a- 
bouc 20 years ago, are thought to have been prejudicial to 
it. The falmon are either carried to Renfrew, or fold in 
the neighbourhood. The medium price is about 5 d. or 
6 d. the pound. Befides falmon, there are in this track of 
Clyde, confiderable quantities of large red trout, which 
are fometimes catched by fet lines ; and people who have 
propsrnets, often take confiderable quantities of fpirlings, 
(fmelts) and of fhrimps. 

State of Property.— The landed property of this parifli 
is diftributed among 8 heritors, whofe valued rent exceeds 
h. ioo Scots, and 9 fmaller heritors or feuars. The land 



of Erjkine. 



63 



is occupied by 10 proprietors, who keep in their own hand 
the whole or fome part of their ground ; by 48 tackfmen, 
who may be called farmers, in fo far as they fubfifi wholly 
or chiefly by their farms ; by 12 who have fmaller farms, 
and when not employed upon them, work as day-labour- 
ers ; and laftly, by 22 handicrafts men, or people of diffe- 
rent profeffions, who have fmall pieces of ground taken ei- 
ther from the landlords or from tenants for fupplying their 
families with milk and other articles of provifion. The 
valued rent of the parifh is L. 4451 Scots. The real rent 
is at prefent about L. 2980 Sterling. 

Cultivation. — Of the whole land of the parifli, about twe» 
thirds are arable, and nearly that proportion may be in a re- 
gular courfe of tillage and paflure. The old fyilem was to 
take at leafl two, and for the moft part three fucceffive 
crops of oats, and after that to allow the ground to reft, aj 
it was called, or to remain in paflure. The farmers ufed 
their own dung, fo far as it would go, for potatoes and 
bear, but imported no foreign manure. This was nearly 
the ftate of hufbandry till about the year 1775 or 1776, 
when the late Alexander Lord Blantyre, having, upon the 
death of his brother , fucceeded to the eftates and honours 
of that family, came to refide at Erfkine. He had for a 
number of years before that time been engaged in a courfe 
of practical farming in Eaft Lothian, in confequence of 
which he had not only acquired an accurate and extenfive 
knowledge of the general principles of agriculture, but was 
able to defcend into the detail of it, and to direct and over- 
fee every minute operation. He was immediately fenfi- 
ble, that the hufbandry of Eaft Lothian would not fuit the 
light foil and moift climate of Erfkine. He perceived, at 
the fame time, that the fyftem of the country was bad, and 
that by more gentle cropping, by more plentiful manuring, 

and, 



6 4 



Statiflical Account 



and by introducing fallow crops and fown grafles, the 
ground would be gradually improved, and its produce up- 
on the whole augmented, fo as more than to repay the ad- 
ditional expence. That he rffight be well acquainted with 
the nature and the powers of the foil, as well as fet an ex- 
ample to the country, he took under hid own management 
the parks of Erikine, and two or three firms in the neigh- 
bourhood. The fyltem which he purfued was nearly as 
follows : After the previous neceffary operations of inclo- 
fing, draining, clearing of (tones, &amp;c. he took a crop of oats. 
The following year, after three and fometimes four 
ploughings, and plentiful liming and dunging, he took a 
fallow crop. For this he preferred turnips, as he never 
failed to have a large return of them, as they Hood the win- 
ter better than cabbage, and left the ground in better con- 
dition than potatoes ; and, as the foil had not fufficient 
depth for carrots or parfnips, the third year he laid down 
the field with grafs feeds. As a crop or nurfe to the grafs 
feeds, he tried wheat, barley, and early Effex oats. The 
firft did not fucceed well, and upon the whole he gave the 
preference to the laft. He cut the hay for one or two 
years thereafter, and then allowed the ground to remain in 
pafture. 

Soon after he fettled at Erikine, the leafes of moft of the 
farms in the barony expired. He was very unwilling to 
difpoffefs the old families, fome of whom had occupied 
thefe grounds for generations. He knew at the fame time, 
that they had neither flock nor fkill fufficient to enable 
them to pay a rent adequate to the real value of the land. 
He propofed to them to pay a very moderate advance of 
rent, lefs indeed than moft of them expefted, with about 7 
or 8 per cent, of the expence of inclofing ; but that they 
fhould be bound to obferve a mode of management fimilar 
to his own •, in particular, that they fhould not have two 
„ fuccefiive' 



of Erjkine.

i'ucceffive crops of oats upon the fame ground, and that they 
fhould introduce turnips and fovvn grafies into their iyftem. 
With thefe conditions all of them but one complied, nd 
took their farms for 19 years. They however complained 
of the reftridions. They thought, that they were allowed 
too few crops of oats, the ftaple commodity of the country, 
during the courfe of their leafe ; they were not well ac- 
quainted with the turnip hufbandry, nor with the method 
of buying, fattening, and felling cattle. Upon after reflec- 
tion, his Lordmip thought proper to relax the rigour of his 
reftri&amp;ions, and to allow them more difcretionary powers. 
From the example, however, which he had given them, 
and the fpirit he had iufufed into them, they all 
began with vigour to improve their farms. They 
purchafed confiderable quantities of lime and foreign 
manure. They became more active and induftrious ; 
and though the turnip hufbandry was never carried by 
them to any extent, and is now generally laid afide, 
they all adopted the practice of laying down their 
fields in good condition with fovvn graffes, having a ready 
and fecure market for their hay in the towns of Port-Glaf- 
gow and Greenock. The confequence of this has been, 
that the country is confiderably improved both in appear- 
ance and in value ; the tenants are eafy in their circum- 
llances, and indeed wealthy for their nation ; their rent is 
paid in general with perfeft punctuality, and there is eve- 
ry reafon to believe, that, upon the expiration of the lea- 
fes, they or their fons will be able and willing to pay a 
rent cqnA to what may be confideved as the jufl value of 
the ground. The writer of this account feels a particular 
fatisfa&amp;ion in having an opportunity of exhibiting fuch an 
example, and at the fame time of paying a defer ved tri- 
bute to the memory of an amiable and refpedtable noble- 
man, and a mofl worthy and ufeful citizen, whofe death

public misfortune. His conduft as a landlord was not on- 
ly humane, but highly judicious, as it equally tended ta 
promote the real intereft of the proprietor and tenant, and 
the general advantage of the country. 

About 20 years ago, the two-horfe plough, with the 
curved mould board and feathered fock, was introduced in- 
to this country by Mr George Orde. The ufe of it is now 
become univerfal, and the country wrights conftrudt it 
with neatnefs and accuracy *. 

The larger tenants commonly make the greateft part of 
their oats into meal, for which there is a conftant demand. 
Of this they retain what is neceffary for their own fami- 
lies. They difpofe of part in the neighbourhood, and the 
reft they either fend to public market, or fell to the dealers 
in the neighbouring towns. They difpofe of their potatoes 
and hay in the fame manner \ and almoft the whole of the 
bear or barley that is raifed, is carried to the towns. The 
labourers, handieraftfmen, and fmaller tenants, who do not 
raife produce fufHcient for their families, either purchafe 
from the larger tenants, or when the price of meal is high, 
and the ports are open, they buy Iri/h, or other imported 
meal ; fo that there is frequently both an exportation and 
importation of this principal article of provifion. What 
the proportion may be cannot well be afcertained ; it va- 
ries every year according to the feafons and the prices of 
grain. It is believed, however, that upon the whole there 
is confiderably more corn, &amp;c. produced, and more fheep

Population. — By the poll-book of the county of Ren- 
frew, made up in the year 1695, there is reafon to believe, 
that the number of fouls in this panfli was at that time 
confiderably above 900. By the returns to Dr Webfter 
in 1750, it was 829. From lifts taken up by the prefent 
minifter in 1771, the number of fouls appeared to be about 
870. The year after that, a trad of land, which had been 
let in fmali farms, and uppn which 12 families relided, 
was, at the expiration of the leafes, converted wholly into 
a grazing farm. At prefent no more than 3 families live 
in that trail in houfes lately built, the old fteadings having 
been allowed to fall. In the courfe of a few years after 
that, 1 or 2 fmall farms, and fome cottages, were fuppref- 
fed, by which the population was ftill farther diminiihed. 
Since that time it has been pretty much Itationary, and is 
rather greater at prefent than it was 8 or 10 years ago.

the year 1792, the numbers were as under:

There is a regifter of baptifms and marriages, from 
November 1705 to the prefent time, which appears, to 
have been regularly kept, unlefs, perhaps, for fome 
few years before and after the year 1750. From this 
regifter, the following numbers of baptifms and mar- 
riages, in the feveral periods of 10 years, from the begin- 
ning of the year 17 10, to the beginning of 1790, have been 
extracted.

of Er/kine. 



The excefs of the population above the ufual proportion 
of births and burials is probably to be accounted for chief- 
ly from this circumftance : The greater! part of the fer- 
vants in the parifh come from Argylefhire, between the 
ages of 14 and 20. Many of thefe, after remaining a few 
years, leave the parifti, and are replaced by others. As 
they have commonly got over the childrens difeafes before 
they come here, and are remarkably healthy, very few of 
them die during their refidence in the parifh. They there- 
fore increafe the population, without at all increaling the 
number of baptifms, or fenfibly increafing the number 
of burials. If to '150, the produ6l of 25 by 26, there be 
added 127, the number of fervants, the fum 777 probably 
exceeds the mean population, for the period for which the 
average is taken. 

Stipend, School, Poor. — The ftipend is no bolls ifirlot of 
oat-meal, and L. 25 : 18 : 2y§ Sterling of money, including 
communion-elements. The glebe confifts of between 5 
and 6 acres of ground, all arable. Lord Blantyre is patron. 
—The fchoolmafter teaches reading, writing, arithmetic and 
book-keeping. His falary is 200 merks Scots a-year, be- 
fides L. 1 Sterling as feffion-clerk, and 10 s. for teaching 
poor children ; he has alfo a free houfe. He receives for 
teaching reading 1 s, 6 d. the quarter, and 2 s. for writing 
and arithmetic. The average number of fcholars is 30. — 
The annual amount of the various branches of the fund for 
the relief of the poor, on an average of 10 years, including 
the intereft of L. 120 of accumulated ftock, is L. 27, 6 s. 
At prefent 9 perfons, including a foundling boy, receive 
regular penfions, and 3 or 4 receive occafional fupplies.

Lan^uage.^T^ weftern dialed of the Scots language, 
is perhaps no where fpoken in greater purity than in this' 
and the adjoining parilhes. The moft unking peculiarity 
of that dialed*, is a difpofition to Ihorten the penult and 
prolong the laft fyllable of words, when the ftrufhire of 
them admits of that being done. The vowel which is ex- 
preffed in the penult fyllable, is for the moft part the ob- 
fcure imperfect found which the Englilh give to the cha- 
racter e when between two confonants ; and the lengthened 
vowel of the laft fyllable is very often the Englim found 
of a in the word part. The penult is pronounced with the 
acute accent, or rifing inflection of the voice, and the laft 
fyllable with the inverted, or falling and rifing circumflex. 
The intervals between the extremes of gravity and acute- 
nefs of tone, are often confiderable. — A few names of pla- 
ces in this pariih, as Glenftiinnoch, Barcloch, and fome o- 
thers, beginning with the fyllable bar, feem to be of Celtic 
origin ; but the greatefl part of them are Englilh com- 
pounds, defcriptive of the fituation of the place, or expref- 
fing fome circumftance relating to it, ^as Craigton, Long- 
haugh, Dryknows, Longbank, Woodcockhill, &amp;c. 

Roads. — The great turnpike road from GlafgoW to 
Greenock paffes through this pariih. As this road has un- 
fortunately been carried over fome very high grounds, and 
in confequence of that is extremely incommodious for the 
heavy carriages which are continually pafiing between 
thefe towns, an act of Parliament has lately been obtained 
for making a new road aloug the fide of the Clyde, the 
line which ought originally to have been purfued. This 
new road is now begun to be executed. Although there 
are excellent materials for making roads in moft places of 
this pariih, the crofs roads through it are ftill in an indiffe- 
rent condition, owing to the difficulty of calling out the

fUtute labour, and rendering it efficient. An aft of Par- 
liament has lately pafled for converting the llatute labour 
of this county into money, which, from the trial that has 
been made this fummer, promifes to be attended with the 
moll beneficial effects. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The principal advantages of 
this parifh may be accounted the dry foil and the good wa- 
ter with which it abounds, and the facility with which 
roads may be made through raoft places of it. The chief 
difadvantage is the diftance and high price of coal, lime, 
and foreign manure ; in confequence of which it will not 
probably, at leaf! for a courfe of years, become a confider- 
able feat of manufactures. There are extenfive peat mof- 
fes in the parifh and neighbourhood. This, however, is 
found to be a precarious and even an expenfive fuel. 
Coals are every year becoming more in ufe, although the 
greatefl part of them muft be brought from about Glaf- 
gow, diftant 13 or 14 miles; and, when carried by land, 
now coft 7 s. the cart of 10 or 11 hundred weight *. 

The prices of provifions, the day's wages of labourers 
in hufbandry, of carpenters, mafons, tailors, &amp;c. and the 
wages of fervants, are the fame in this parifh as in the neigh- 
bouring parifhes of Houfton and Kilallan. See vol. I. 
p. 324, 325. It may now be added to what is there ftated, 
that in confequence of the rapid progrefs of manufactures 
in Paifley and the neighbouring towns and villages, the 
wages of country fervants and labourers are continually ri- 
ling, and to fuch a degree as to be feverely felt by tne 
farmers in the country. The fums, though confiderable,

which they may expend in procuring lime and manure, 
may be refunded by the increafed quantity and value of 
their produce ; but the continually growing expence of ma- 
nagement can be no otherwife repaid to them, but from the 
advanced price of their commodicies ; and from this ad- 
vantage they are eifeclually precluded by the copious im- 
portation from Ireland and other places, which never fails 
* to happen whenever the price of oat-meal exceeds 16 s. the 
boll. The efFect of this may probably be, to induce the 
tenants in this country to turn a greater proportion of 
their lands into grafs. It is hardly neceflary to obferve, 
that every labourer, who is moderately induftrious, has it 
in his power to make a decent provifion for his family. 

One of the laft trials for witchcraft which happened in 
Scotland, had its origin in this parifti in 1696-7. The per- 
fon fuppofed to have been bewitched, or tormented by the 
agency of evil fpirits, or of thofe who were in compact 
with them, was Chriftian Shaw, daughter of John Shaw of 
Bargarron, then about 11 years of age. A Ihort account 
of this trial may be feen in Arnot's Collection of criminal 
trials. Three men and four women were condemned to 
death as guilty of the crime of witchcraft, and were execu- 
ted at Paifley. A particular account or journal of the ex- 
traordinary circumftances of this cafe was drawn up at the 
time when it happened, every paragraph of which is affirm- 
ed to have been originally fubfcribed by witnefles, a- 
mong whom we find the names of almoft all the noble- 
men and gentlemen, and many of the minifters of the 
neighbourhood. The narrative was afterwards- printed 
without thefe fubfcriptions, along with a very pious and 
decently written preface by the publifher. There were 
fubjoined to it the atteftations of a phyfician and i'urgeon, 
the judicial confeffions of fome of the perfons accufed of 
witchcraft, and an abftra£l of the pleadings of the advo- 
cates 



of Erjkine.

cates on the part of the Crown, and of their charge to the 
jury. Thefe laft, in their reafonings upon the nature of 
the evidence, and the credibility of the fads, and in the 
anfwers to objections, difcover much learning and ability. 
A few copies of the original publication are ftill extant, 
and a new edition of it was a few years ago printed at 
Paifley. It may furnifh ample matter of fpeculation to 
thofe whofe objeft it is to trace the progrefs and variation 
of manners and opinions among men. The fubfequent 
hittory of this lady is, however, more interefting to the po- 

litical enquirer. 

Having acquired a remarkable dexterity in fpinning fine 
yarn, (he conceived the idea of manufaduring it into 
thread Her firft attempts in this way were neceffarily on 
a fmall fcale. She executed almoft every part of the procefs 
with her own hands, and bleached her materials on a large 
flate placed in one of the windows of the houfe. She fuc- 
ceeded, however, fo well in thefe effays, as t6 have fuffi- 
cient encouragement to go on, and to take the afliftance of 
her younger fillers and neighbours. The then Lady Blan- 
tyre carried a parcel of her thread to Bath, and difpofed of 
it advantageoufly to fome manufacturers of lace, and this 
was probably the firft thread made in Scotland that had 
croffed theTweed. About this time a perfon who was con- 
nected with the family, happening to be in Holland, found 
means to learn the fecrets of the thread manufadhire, 
which was then carried on to great extent in that country, 
particularly the art of forting and numbering the threads 
of different fizes, and packing them up for fale, and the 
conftruction and management of the twilling and twining 
machines. This knowledge he communicated on his re- 
turn to his friends in Bargarron, and by means of it they 
were enabled to conduct their manufacture with more re- 
gularity and to a greater extent. The young women in 

th« 



76 Statiftical Account 



the neighbourhood were taught to fpin fine yarn, twining 
mills were ere&amp;ed, correfpondences were eftabliihed, md a 
profitable bufinefs was carried on. Bargarron thread be- 
came extenfively know , and, being afcertained by a flamp, 
bore a good price. From the inftru&amp;ions of the family of 
Bargarron, a few families in the neighbourhood engaged 
in the fame bufinefs, and continued in it for a number of 
years. It was not to be expe&amp;ed, however, that a manu- 
facture of that kind could be confined to fo fin all a diftricl:, 
or would be allowed to remain in fo few hands for a great 
length of time. The fecrets of the bufinefs were gradually 
divulged by apprentices and affitlants. A Mr Pollock in 
Paifley availed himfelf of thefe communications, and laid 
the foundation of the well eftabliihed and extenfive manu- 
facture of thread, which has ever fince been carried on in 
that town. From that time, the women in this neighbour- 
hood have continued to pra&amp;ife the fpinning of fine yarn, 
which they difpofed of to the Paifley manufacturers. With- 
in this twelvemonth, however, many of them have laid a- 
fide the wheel, leaving that ufeful implement of domefiic 
induftry to be occupied by thofe of higher rank, and have 
applied themfelves to the eafier, the more elegant, and at 
prefent the more profitable employment of flowering 
muflins.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q632993">MELROSE</name>, 

(County of Roxburgh, Synod of Merse and Teviot- 
d ale, Presbytery of Selkirk.) 

By the Rev. Mr George Thomson.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

BEfore the abolition of hereditary jurifdi&amp;ions, Mel- 
rofe was a burgh of regality. The name is fuppofed 
to be Gaelic, compounded of Mull and Rofs, ' a bare pro- 
* montory,' remarkably defcriptive of a little peninfula a- 
bout a mile to the eaft, formed by the windings of Tweed, 
which is ftill called Old Melro/e, and famous for its ancient 
monaftery, one of the firft feats of the religious Culdees in 
this country. The parim is in length fronvN. to S. about 
7 miles, and in breadth towards the N. 5, towards the S. 
near 7 miles. — The town of Melrofe is pleafantly fituated 
on the north fide and bottom of the Eildon hills, and on the 
edge of a fertile valley, upwards of a mile in length, inter- 
fered 



7 8 Statiflical Account 

fefted by Tweed runniug through it in a Terpentine direc- 
tion, and furrounded by hills of a confiderable height. In 
this valley, befides Melrofe, are the villages of Danieltoun, 
Darnick, Bridge-end, Gattcnfid.-, and Newftead, moll of 
the inhabitants of which hold their poffeflions in feu, as do 
alfo the inhabitants of Eildon and Newtown, two villages 
farther down the river, and of Blainflie, a village on the 
weft fide of Leader, at the north extremity of the parilh. 

Soil, Agriculture, and Produce. — The foil is various. 
The fouth end of the parilh is moftly a ftrong clay, excel- 
lently adapted for wheat. The banks of the Tweed are a 
fine light dry foil, fit for all kinds of grain. On the north 
fide of the Tweed, the foil is of three kinds : ijl, A light 
earth, mixed with fand, upon a gravelly bottom ; 2dly, A 
ftrong clay upon a till, full of fprings, and very wet ; 
$dly, Mofs. For about 5 miles fquare, the north part of 
the parilh is hilly, and makes excellent ftieep pafture, in- 
terfperfed with a few fmall fields of corn. For its improve- 
ment it has been fuggefted, that the different proprietors 
ftiould make large ftrips of plantations, inclofed with 
ftone fences, both to fhelter the land, and to confume the 
furface ftones which encumber it, and that the additional 
rent would amply compenfate the trouble and expence. 

Within thefe 30 years, the farmers have made vaft pro- 
gress in agriculture. Through their unremitting induftry, a 
great quantity of ground, formerly covered with heath, 
broom, and furze, has been bared, and now produces excel- 
lent crops, or is converted into good pafture. The value 
of land has confequendy very much increafed. A feu of 
feveral acres, purchafed about 40 years ago at L. 10, was 
lately fold at the advanced price of L.150 Sterling.— The 
parilh is fuppofed to produce double the quantity of grain 
that it did about that time. The manure employed is 

lime, 



of Melrofe. 



79 



lime, marl, and dung. The firft of thefe, though diftant 
20 miles, and from fome places 25, is in general very much 
ufed. As the land, owing to this diftance, and to the ad- 
vance in the price of cattle, wages of fervants, &amp;c. is im- 
proved at a great expence ; the profit of the former fcarce- 
ly bears a juit proportion to the increafe of rent, and of e- 
very other article. 

The Englifh plough drawn by a horfes, has fuperfeded the 
old heavy Scotch plough drawn by 4 oxen and 2 horfes. 
The rotation of crops upon the clay land is fallow, fucceeded 
by wheat ; peafe, barley laid down with grafs and opened 
with oats. Upon the dry light land, it is fallow or turnip, 
barley laid down with grafs and opened with oats. The 
wheat is of an excellent quality ; the barley good, though 
inferior to that of the lower parts of Roxburghfliire and 
Berwickfhire ; the oats in general produce, at an average, 
near 8 ltone the boll, Linlithgow meafure. Thofe of Blainf- 
lie have been long famed for feed. This muft be owing to 
fome peculiar coldnefs in the foil, and northerly or eafter- 
ly expofure of the fields, which makes thefe oats agree with 
any foil and expofure to which they are carried. There is 
a great demand for them from England and different parts 
of Scotland, and they commonly fetch fome millings the 
boll above the ordinary price of feed oats. 

The parifh contains 280 horfes, 1006 black cattle, 13,729 
lheep. The black cattle are of a middlingyfize, and excellent 
for fattening ; in general, they do not exceed 60 ftone when 
flaughtered. The fheep are of a breed between the long 
white-faced humble fheep, from the fouth of Teviotdale, 
and the fhort Highland kind. In fmearing, to one pint of 
tar was formerly ufed only alb. butter, but now 31b. and 
fometimes 41b. by which, though lefs fmearing materials 
are found neceffary, the expence is greater ; but in return, 
the quantity of the wool is thereby increafed, and the qua- 
lity 



8o Statijlical Account 

lity improven. This laft efFeft is not acknowledged by 
fome of the farmers. A change of breed is the moft effec- 
tual method of improving the wool, and it mufl be frequent- 
ly done to prevent the wool from degenerating again, like 
grain fown often on the fame ground. Some farmers al- 
lege, that the wool might be improved to a great extent, 
were they not prevented from making the attempt by the 
nature of the climate and pafiure, as fine woolled fheep are 
more tender in their conftitutions than thofe that are coarfe, 
they are lefs able to bear the feverity of the winter-ftorms, 
and never thrive upon a wet pafiure. From want of at- 
tention to thefe circumftances in attempts to improve the 
wool, confiderable lofs has been futtained in this parifh. 
As fome paftures, from their being wet or dry, expofed 
or fheltered, are adapted to fheep of a hardy or a delicate 
conftitution, this points out what quality of wool they can 
produce. By a few experiments on a fmall fcale, the in- 
telligent farmer will eafily find out to what degree of im- 
provement he can bring his wool, with fafety to his flock. — 
Allowing ioo fleeces to a pack, the parifh produces in i year 
137^ packs of wool, which fells from 10s. to 15s. the 
ftone. 

There are feveral orchards about Melrofe and the neigh- 
bourhood, and the gardeners raife a great many green and 
cabbage plants, which are carried to Clydeidale, and even 
fo far as Dumfries. The fruit and plants together, may, 
at an average, yield annually L. 300.— The valued rent of 
the parifh is L. 19,985 14:6 Scots. 

Manufa&amp;ures.—Mclrofe has long been famed for linens, 
named Melrofe land linens, for which commiffions have 
been received from London and foreign countries. So far 
back as the year 1668, the weavers were incorporated un- 
der what is called a Seal o/Caufe, from John Earl of Had- 
dington, 



of Meh ofe. 8 1 

fthjton, then " Lord of the lordftiip, and bailie principal 
of the regality of Melrofe." For feveral years paft this 
trade has, 'from a variety of caufes, been very much upon 
the decline. If fomething does not occur to prevent it, 
Melrofe will in all probability foon lofe the name and bufi- 
fiefs, (as they themfelves exprefs it), of manufacturing 
thefe linens. Its importance to this place, and its rapid 
decline, will appear from the following ftatement taken 
from the ftampmafter's yearly abftract : From the ill No- 
vember 17 J4 to in* November 1755, there were (tamped 
33,2824 yards, valued at L. 2575 : to : u£. In the 10 
fucceeding years there was no great rife or fall in the quan- 
tity and value of linens. From November 1764 to No- 
vember 1765, there were ftamped 3 2,3 oo| yards, value 
L. 2495 : 14 : 9$. From November 1773 to November 
1774, 20,789! yards, value L 2051 : 16 : 7^. In the fol- 
lowing 10 years, the quantity was fo far down as I779 a 
yards, value L. 1845 : 12 : 4 Sterling *. 

Vol. IX. L A 

* The following are the caufes to which this decline has been af- 
cribed : i ff, The attention of the truftees for manufactures, 8cc. has been 
principally directed, of late, to the encouragement of the woollen manu- 
facture through Scotland. In Galafliiels, and that part of this parilh 
which is contiguous to it, they have laid out a considerable fum in build- 
ings and machinery ; and the manufacturers there have drawn annually, 
for feveral years, from L. 40 to L. 70 Sterling, in premiums. This lias 
enabled them to give more to fpinners, than the profits on linen can af- 
ford, and has, of courfe, diminiflied the number of linen-fpinners, and 
fpoiled their hands for that employment. z! % Women-fervants get fo high 
wages, and are fo much employed in out-work, that a fufficient number' 
of. them cannot be procured to fpin linen-yarn, though the price of fpin- 
ning it has been confiderably advanced. About Io. years ago,, the price* 
were only, for fpinning 4 hanks yarn from 1 pound of lint, I s. 2 d. ; for 
5 hanks, 1 s. 4 d. ; for 6 hanks, 1 s. 8 d. ; and for 7 hanks, 2 s. The 
prefent prices are, for 4 hank,, 1 s. 7 d. ; for 5 hanks, is. 8d. ; for 9 
hanks, as.; and for 7 hanks 2s. 2d.: Some fpinners get for 7 hanka, 
« s. 4d. Si.-ice the American war, the price of Dutch liax has great- 

ly rifen, and the land here is moftly unfit for raifing any.

A few hints have been fuggefled by the principal _ 
fafturers for the recovery of this decaying trade. Thefe 
ihall be given in their own words : « Were the truftees to 
give encouragement to weavers by premiums and extras on 
well made pieces of linen, as was done through Scotland a- 
bout 40 years ago, it might have as good an effeft as it had 
then, the tradefmen being much better now than when 
they began their prizes at the above period ; and were en- 
couragement given alfo to young girls to fpin properly, 
much might be expected. This could be done by employ- 
ing fome fpinning miflreffes in different little towns through 
the parifli, and offering fome prizes to the befl fpinners, in 
order to prompt the emulation of the fcholars. Finally, 
were fome attention paid by the proprietors to a decaying 
bleachfield, thefe things, and what elfe their wifdom may 
fuggeft, might Mill, through the blefftng promifed to the 
diligent, recover a falling back ftate of bufinefs." 

In order to encourage this manufacture, the bleachfield men- 
tioned above was fet on foot through the patriotic exertions of 
the Reverend Mr James Brown, late one of the minifters of 
Edinburgh, and previoufly minifter of this parifh. During 
his refidence at Melrofe, and for feveral years afterward, 
the bleaching bufinefs was carried on with confiderable fpi- 
rit and fuccefs. For fome time pafl it has declined. In 
dry feafons, there is a great fcarcity of water in the field, 
though abundance might be procured at no great expence. 
The buildings are old and in great difrepair, and little is to 
be expected from the proprietors. The property is divided 
into a great many {hares, fo low as L. 5 •, fo that the pro- 
fits which might be derived from it are no ways adequate 
to ftimulate the exertions of the proprietors, mofl of whom 
are in good circumftances, and independent of this bufinefs. 
Befides, no dividends of profits having been made among 

them for feveral years, they are little difpofed to be at 

j much

much expence in repairs and improvements on what they 
already confider as a dead flock. To carry on this bufi- 
nefs with advantage, the field mould be let to an intelli- 
gent bleacher, or the property thrown into the hands of 
one or two proprietors who might find their account in fu- 

perintending it. 

Of late, however, it is faid, that owing to the good ma- 
nagement of the prefent bleacher, the bufinefs has been up- 
on the increafe. From his ftatement, it appears, that ia 
the year 1787 there were whitened 715 pieces of linen; 
in 1788— 855 ; in 1789—917 -, in 1790— 1202 ; in 1791— 
1232. This cloth does not all belong to the parifh, but is 
taken in from different parts of the country. 

The woollen manufacture has of late been making confi- 
derable progrefs, efpecially in the neighbourhood of G-ala- 
fhiels, for which fee the Statiftical Account of that pariih, 
Vol. II. p. 299. Befides what is done by them, there are 
manufactured annually in Gattonfide and Melrofe, at an a- 
verage, about 282 ftone of wool, the cloth of which may 
yield about L. 1041. Since November 1791, feveral 
looms, both here and in the neighbouring parifhes, have 
been employed in weaving cottons. In addition to thofe 
employed by the manufacturers near Galafhiels, there are 
80 looms in the parifh ; 20 of which are employed in 
weaving cotton, 30 in woollen, and 30 in linen-work. Du- 
ring the fummer, when the demand is greatell, fome of the 
woollen looms are employed in weaving linen j but as cot- 
ton is found both more cleanly and more profitable than 
either woollen or linen, it is probable, that fhould the de- 
mand for it continue, the number of weavers employed 
in that line will gradually increafe. 

"Population, &amp;c. — This parifh contains at prefent 2446 
inhabitants. According to Dr Webfter's report, the num-

bers then were 2322. There are of thefe Burgher-Sece- 
ders 128 ; Anti-Burghers 151 ; Relief 53 . Methodilts 18 ; 
m all 350 diflenters. Befides thefe fectaries, fome of the 
diff rent clafles of Independents and Anabaptifls mention- 
ed in the StatifUcal Account of Galafhiels, have, with their 
manufactures, been imported into this parifh. Mr Milne, 
in his s efcription of this parifti, publimed in 1743, makes 
the number of examinable perfons 1800. If he compre- 
hended all above ic years of age, the population muft have 
undergone little alteration, but feems rather to have in- 
preafed than diminiihed *. 

The 

* A ftatement might be given of births, marriages, and burials, from 
our parifli-regifter, but it is very incomplete ; becaufe the Seceders, con- 
■fidering this as an appendage to the Eftabliihcd Church, rather than an 
jnftitution calculated to promote the civil intereft of their pofterity, do 
not in general regiflrate the names of their children ; and, becaufe the 
temptation to neglect this among the lower clafles of people, has alfo been 
increafed by the late tax upon regiftration. They think that the money 
required out of their fcanty funds, for this purpofe, is better employed in 
providing againft prefent wants, than in fecuring a very diftant, and per- 
haps uncertain, good to their pofterity. Nor can the marriage-regifter 
be depended on, as there are many irregular or (as they are commonly 
called here) o'er-the-march marriages It is fufpected that certificates to 
this purpofe, are fometimes forged or antedated by the parries, in order 
to conceal a previous blunder that may have been committed. This prac- 
tice is alfo countenanced by fome Epifcopal Clergymen upon the border, 
who, for the fake of the beggarly fee of office, marry all who apply to 
them, without even requiring any evidence of the parties being legally 
entitled to this privilege. There have alfo been inftances of Fifcals in 
Royal Burghs, and of other Courts, fummoning parties before a Juftice of 
the Peace, who. on their acknowledging a previous marriage, (which per- 
haps never took place), decerns them to pay a tine, and adjudges one half 
of it to the profecutor. Certificates of regular proclamations have alfo 
been produced, not only here, but in all the neighbouring parifhes, from 
the Seflion-clerks of Edinburgh, Canongate, and Weft Church, in favour 
of people who were never two days refident within their bounds ; and on 
fuch certificates, many marriages have been celebrated. This evil claims 
the attention of the Legiflature.

The prevailing difeafes in the parifh are confumptions 
and rheumatifms. The latter may be owing to th- levere 
cold to which the lower clafles are exnofed during the win- 
ter, from the vaft t-xpenfe of fuel, which cannot be ufed to 
fuch extent as is neceffary for their health and accommo- 
dation. Coal, their principal fuel, is diftant a mile farther 
than lime, and fells at gd. and lod. the hundred weight in 
fummer, and fometimes higher in winter. The ague for- 
merly prevailed much, but for fome years has greatly fub- 
fided. This may be owing to the improvement of the 
country by drains, and to the people's being better fed and 
clothed. — They are now getting above the prejudices a- 
gainfl: inoculation. This happy difcovery for the preser- 
vation of mankind is more and more praclifed, and with 
the greateft fuccefs. The writer of this account, as well as 
his predeceflbrs, has, in his intercourfe with the parifh lon- 
ers, laboured to obviate their fcruples, and recommended 
the practice. Through fuch permafion, feveral children 
have been inoculated, whofe parents have afterward ex- 
prefled their gratitude. It is hoped, that in a fhort time, a 
practice will become univerfal, which has been already 
begun, and through the bleffing of God, will continue to 
be a mean of faving many infants from an early grave. 

Religion, &amp;c. — Notwithstanding the many religious fe&amp;a- 
ries which exift here, a fpirit of mutual forbearance pre- 
vails. That inveterate rancour, to which the divifions 
in our church gave birth about 50 years ago, is now almofl 
worn away through the friendly aid of time, the only cure 
for fuch an evil. AH parties are difpofed to live in peace, 
and to interchange the offices of good neighbourhood with 
one another. In fo large a fociety, as may be expected, 
exceptions rauft be made. In general, however, the peo- 
ple have always been diftinguifhed for their good fenfe, 

fobriety, 



^ Statijlical Account 

fobriety, and a decent and uniform attendance upon public 
ordinances. Thofe who adhere to the Eftablifhed Church, 
are fteady in their attachment to her principles and govern- 
ment, and are equally removed from a fiery bigotted [zeal, 
and from a lukewarm indifference about religion. 

Stipend, School, &amp;c. — The Duke of Buccleugh is patron. 
The flipend, including L. 100 Scots for communion-ele- 
ments, is 48 bolls of vi&amp;ual, 2-3ds oat-meal, and 1.3d bear, 
and L. 886 : 13 : 4 Scots. The glebe confifts of 4 Scots a- 
cres, of the word land in the neighbourhood, lies at an in- 
convenient diftance from the manfe, and has always been 
reckoned by the different incumbents to be incapable of 
improvement, and fcarcely worth the labouring. It is 
hoped, that the heritors will foon fee the propriety of re- 
moving this inconvenience, in return for the many fertile 
fields thrown into their hands by the Prefbyterians at the 
Reformation, efpecially as the minifter receives only L. 20 
Scots for a grafs- glebe. — The fchoolmafter's falary, and o- 
ther emoluments, are about L. 20 yearly, befides the fees 
of teaching in general near 8o fcholars. He has alfo a 
commodious dwelling-houfe, and a tolerable garden. The 
ftated fchool-fees are, the quarter, for Englilh is. 6 d. ; for 
writing 2S. ; for writing and arithmetic 2 s. 6 d. ; and for 
Latin 5 s. For the accommodation of the highland part of 
the parifli, Mr Robert Moffat, portioner of Threepwood, 
mortified, in the year 1759, the fum of 1000 merks Scots, 
the intereft of which is, in terms of the deed of mortifica- 
cation, applied towards the maintenance of a fchoolmafter 
in that quarter. 

Poor. — The poor are fupported by a voluntary aflefT- 
ment of heritors, moft of whom are feuars, and by the pu- 
blic collections made at the church-doors upon Sundays.

For this purpofe, they regularly meet once every quarter, 
along with the kirk-fefiion, to confider the ftate of the 
poor. At fuch meetings applications are made for ad- 
miflion to the charity-roll, and a weekly penfion, or a tem- 
porary fupply, is granted. No plan that has been adopted 
or conceived can be more juft or beneficial than the one 
adopted here. By the lower claffes of people the lands are 
cultivated, and their value increafed. To whom, there- 
fore, can they fo naturally look for maintenance, when, 
through age or difeafe, they are unable to provide for 
themfelves, as to thofe who may have reaped the fruits of 
their part induftry, when in the vigour of their days, and 
favoured with health and ftrength ? As the non-refiding, 
as well as the refiding heritors, are fubjecl: to this affeff- 
ment ; and as it is impofed according to the valuation of their 
refpe£live properties, they are burdened only in proportion 
to their fuppofed advantages, from the pari induftry and ex- 
penditure of the poor. Upon the fame principle, commerce 
might become an object of affeffment, the value of which, 
(if not left to the capricious judgment of affuming fuperi- 
ors, but to an equitable jury), might, without entering in- 
to the fecrets of trade, be nearly afcertained *.

and where there is no appearance of a continuing burden, fupply is granted 
without this furrender. The weekly penfions are fmall, and do not alto- 
gether fuperfede the neceffity of charitable affiftance from friends and 
neighbours. This will appear from the following ftatement : For the

In addition to the above valuable account, tranfmitted by 
the Reverend Mr Thomfon, the prefent roihifter, it may 
not be improper to fubjoin the following fhort extrafls, 
from a " Defcription of the parifh of Melrofe," publimed 
in 1743, ^ the Reverend Mr Milne, then paftor of that 
parifh. 

^^._The.Monaftery of Old Melrofe was probably 
founded about the end of the fixth century. Bede* gives 
us an account of its fituation on the bank of the Tweed f, 
and like wife of its abbots. This place was a famous nurfery 
for learned and religious men ; and probably continued till 
the other one at the prefent Melrofe was founded by King 
David. The convent of Old Melrofe was inclofed with a 

ftone 

L. 87, 5 s. T'ntil lately, the heritors made a demand of one half of the 
weet- ly collections, and allowed the other half to be diftributed by the 
kirk-feffion ; but confidering that their terras of meeting are diftant, and 
that a great deal of diftrefs might intervene, which would require inftant 
relief, they have now given up the whole collections, to be diftributed by 
the felnon. Thefe collections are employed to meet the wants of fuch 
as may, through difeafe, be reduced to a temporary poverty ; to augment 
the pennons of thofe upon the heritors roll, if found neceflary ; and if the, 
funds will admit, the heritors fometimes recommend fome of their peti- 
tioners for a temporary fupply, to be relieved out of them. For thefe 
reafons, there are no beggars in the parifh,— that nuifance to fociety, and 
oppreffion upon the public, particularly upon well-difpofed people in the 
lower ranks, who are lefs able to bear it. In no place, indeed, are the 
poor better attended to. or fupportcd at fo fmall an expence. Charity 
is here reduced to a regular fyftem of operation, which does not leave its 
objeits to a precarious fubfiftence. but fecures for them a certain well- 
regulated relief iu the day of poverty and diftrefs ; and the objects- of &amp; 
are as happy as their reduced circumftances will admit.

ftone'wall, reaching from he fouth corner to the weft cor- 
ner of che Tweed, where the neck, of land is narrow •, and 
the foundations of the wall are ftill to be feen. I do not 
think there has been any great building about it ; for as Bede 
acquaints us, their churches then were all of oak, and co- 
vered with reeds. The lkuation of the place is moft plea- 
fant and agreeable, being almoft furrounded by Tweed, 
and having a line profpeft towards Gladfwood. 

\bout a mile to the welt of this on the Tweed, (lands 
the village of Newftead, a place remarkable for another 
abbey on the eaft lide of it, called Red Abbey-Jleed. 

About half a mile from Newftead, on the fame fouth 
fide of the Tweed, ftands the prefent Abbey of Melrofe. It 
is famous for its monaftery, which was very large and fpa- 
cious, as appears from the ruins of it yet remaining ; one 
of the molt magnificent in the kingdom ; and continues ftill 
to be the admiration of ftrangers, who, in refpecl of the 
height and embellishment of its columns, with all kind of 
fculpture, the beauty of its Hones, and fymmetry of its parts, 
reckon it one of the beft of the Gothic ftructurts they have 
feen. It was founded by King David in 1 136 ; dedicated to 
the Virgin Mary, and endowed with large revenues and ma- 
ny immunities, as appears by the charters granted to the ab- 
bot and convent, by our kings. The monks were Cifter- 
.tians, and the monaftery of Melrofe was a mother-church 
or nurfery for all of that order, in many various and remote 
regions of Scotland. 

The church is built in form of St John's crofs. The 
chancel, which is a very irately fabric, is ftill ftanding; its 
roof is very curious, and has much of the fcripture hiltoiy 
upon it. I have taken the meafure of what is ftanding of 
this church, although much of the weft part is fo entirely 
demoliihed, that we cannot know how far it has reached 
in that direaion. Its juft length is 258 feet; breadth 1374;

circumference about 943 ; height of the fouth window 24, 
breadth 16 ; height of the ealt window 34^ breadth l^f; 
height of the fteeple 75 ; the fpire gone. The eaft window, 
at which was the great altar, is a beautiful ftructure ; con- 
fiding of 4 pillars or bars, with a great deal of curious work 
between them; and on each fide, a great number of niches 
for ftatues. On the cop, an old man with a globe in his 
left hand, refting on his knee, and a young man on his 
right ; both in a fitting pofture, with an open crown over 
their heads. On the north and fouth of this window, are 
two others of fmaller dimenfions. The niches are curiouf- 
ly carved, both the pedeftals and canopies, and on which 
feveral figures of men and animals are curioufly cut. On 
the fouth-eaft of this church are a great many muficians 
admirably cut, with much pleafantnefs and gaiety in their 
countenances, accompanied with their various inftruments. 
Alfo nuns with their veils; fome of whom richly dreffed. 
The fouth window is very much admired for its height 
and curious workmanfhip : Niches are on each fide and a- 
bove it, where have been ftatues of our Saviour and the 
apoftles. Beiides, there are many other figures on the eaft, 
or on the weft fide of this window : Monks curioufly cut, 
with their beards, cowls and beads : A cripple on the back 
of a blind man : Several animals cut very nicely, as boars, 
greyhounds, lions, monkies and others. There are about 
68 niches in whole ftanding •, the ftatues were only demo- 
lifhed about the 1649. 

So far, with refpecl to the outfide of the church. With- 
in, on the north fide of the crofs are beautiful pillars, and 
the fculpture as frefh as if it had been newly cut. On the 
weft fide is a ftatue of St Peter with a book open, his right 
hand on it, and two keys hanging on the left. On the 
fouth fide of this ftatue, is that of St Paul with a fword. In 
the middle of the crofs flood the fteeple, a piece of noble ar-

chite&amp;ure, a quarter of it yet ftanding, but the fpire 
gone. The roof of the fouth fide of the crofs is ftill 
ftanding, where is a beautiful ftair-cafe, much admired by 
(h ingers, the roof of it winding like a fnail-cap. There 
was within the church a vaft number of fonts curioufly 
carved, and where were altars dedicated to various faints. 
In the portion' of the church where worftiip is at prefent 
performed, are two rows of pillars of excellent workman- 
mi p, especially that to the fouth -eaft, which for the fine- 
nefs of it, looks like Flander's lace. 

With regard laftly, to what was in part, or altogether, 
feparated from the bixty of the church, there was a cloyfter 
on the north fide, a part of the walls of which is ftill re- 
maining ; and where mav be obferved pleafant walks and 
feats, with a great deal of fine flowers nicely cut as lilies, 
&amp;c alfo ferns, grapes, houfe-leeks, efcalops, lir-cones, &amp;c. 
The door at the north entry of the church is curioufly em- 
bofied, and the foliage here, and in feveral places of the 
church, very beautiful. There were alfo here a vaft many 
fine buildings within the convent, for the refidence and fer- 
vice of the abbot and monks, with gardens an* other con- 
veniences ; all this inclofed within an h**gh wall, about a 
mile in circuit. Befides the high cburch, there has been a 
large fine chapel, where the ma«fe now is, and another houfe 
adjoining to it, where the foundations of the pillars are ftill 
to be feen. On the nwth fide of this houfe, there has been 
a curious oratory or private chapel, the foundations of 
which have been difcovered this year, and a large ciftern 
of one ftone, with a leaden pipe conveying the water to 
it. 



Camps, &amp;c. — A little to the fouth of Melrofe are the 
three Ei/don hills. The bafe of them may be in compafs

6 or 7 miles ; the height of two of them to the north about 
If mile. On the top of the north-eaft hill are plain vef- 
tiges of a Roman camp well fortified, with two foffes and 
mounds of earth, more than i| mile in circuit, with a large 
plain near the top of the hill, on which may be feen the 
preetorium, or the general's quarter, lurrounded with many 
huts. It has all the properties of a well chofcn camp, ac- 
cording to the rules of Vegetius. There is a large profpeft 
from it of all the country ; it has many fprings of good 
water near it ; the fides of the hill have been covered with 
■wood, and the camp is of that extent, that neither man, 
beaft nor baggage could be ftraitened for room. On the 
north fide of the middle hill, Mr Milne feems to place a 
fecond camp, from which he fays is a large ditch for 2 
miles to the weft, reaching to another camp on the top of 
Caldfhielhill. This camp (probably he means, that on the 
north fide of the middle hill) has been ftrongly fortifi d 
•with a double trench, and the circumvallations of it conti- 
nued for a good way. This camp, with that called Caltle- 
fteed, makes almoft a triangle with the large camp on Eil- 
don hills. 

To the S. W. ot thefe hills there has been a beautiful 
military road, railed in foi^c places high above the ground, 
and of a corifiderable breadth, with military ftations in fome 
places upon it.' In fome parts it is carried through lakes and 
marines, and has had a communication with the camp at 
Caldfhiels, and likewife with another camp on the north 
fide of the Tweed called the Rink. 

On the head of the hill, on the fide of which the village 
of Gattonfide is founded, north of the Tweed, there has 
been a large camp. It has a wall around it of ftone, about 
half a mile in compafs. About half a mile from this camp 
to the eaft, on the top of the hill, oppofite to Newftead, 

there

there has been a large camp with a deep ditch. It feems 
to have been about 3 quarters of a mile in circumference, 
and is called the Chefter know or Knoll. 

Mr Milne dufcribes other camps, feveral of them large, 
and gives an account of other antiquities and particulars re- 
ferring to this pariih.

PARISH of <name ref="NA">INNER KIP</name>, 

(County of Renfrew, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Paisley.) 

By the Rev. Mr Thomas Brown.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

THE fituation feems to have given rife to the name, 
which is partly Gaelic ; Inner, by fome called In- 
ver, implies the ' mouth of a river,' which agrees with the 
fituation of the church and village ; immediately below 
which, the fmall river Kip empties itfelf into the fea, or 
frith of Clyde. This parifli is bounded by the frith of 
Clyde upon the W. and N. In length, from E. to W. 
along the more, it is 7 miles in a ftraight line ; but conli- 
derably longer, if all the little bays were followed ; in 
breadth, 6 miles. It was much more extenlive two cen- 
turies ago, comprehending then the two parilhes of Gree- 
nock. 

Climate and Surface. — From fituation, the climate is ra- 
ther wet, and rains are frequent and heavy ; yet very 

healthy, 



of Inner-kip.

healthy, by means of the fea-air, which feldom allows any 
fogs or noxious milts to fettle down, nor froft and fnow to 
continue long. By this the fummer heat is alfo mode- 
rated to a very defirable equality. The inhabitants are 
feldom vifited by epidemical diftempers, or local difeafes. 
The rheumatifm is indeed complained of, but not gene- 
rally. Great numbers of children are fometimes fweeped 
off by the fmall pox. An unconquerable averfion to in- 
oculation, expofes them at all ages to this difeafe, which 
is very fatal, when of a bad kind. Though there is no in- 
ftance of remarkable longevity, yet there are many of con- 
fiderable age ; it is not uncommon to fee men and women 
of 80 employed daily in their ufual labour ; and one wo- 
man is confiderably above 90. The furface of the country, 
in general, is no lefs pleafing to the eye, than the fkuation 
is conducive to health. From the fhore to the S. E. is a 
gradual and irregular afcent, beautifully varied with plains, 
gentle declivities, and eminences clothed with furze and 
broom, interfered by fmall rivers or burns, which are fome- 
times loft in deep glens, fhaded with wood, and fometimes 
water rich and fertile meadows. On one fide, furrounded 
with lofty mountains, covered with heath ; on the other, 
waflied by the frith of Clyde, conftantly crowded with the 
foreign and coafting trade to and from Greenock; the 
towering fummits of the Ifle of Arran terminate the view 
to the S. W. 

Soil and Agriculture. — The foil upon the more is light, 
fandy, and of quick vegetation ; farther in the country, it 
is a little wetter, and more inclined to a red gravel. The 
moor-grounds are covered with heath, and in fome places 
afford mofs of a confiderable depth. More than one half 
of the parifli is moor, and a great part of that a common 
undivided ; a confiderable part natural meadow, and the 

remainder

Slatijlical Account 



remainder arable. But as no meafurement hns been taken, 
how many acres are of each, cannot be conjectured. From 
the appearance of the country, it may be fuppofed that 
more land was in tillage 50 years ago than at prefent. 
Moft part of the arable, and a great part of the low paflure 
lands, are inclofed with good none fences, which the pro- 
prietor erefts, on the tenant paying '7^ per cent, for out- 
laid money, and on condition he leaves them fencible at 
the end of his leafe. Agriculture here has made but (low 
progrefs, and ftill the improvement of land is little attended 
to ; perhaps for the following reafons : The foil, which is 
light, will hardly bear the labour requifite to clear it of 
weeds ; and when put into a ftate'j from which a good crop 
might be expected, it is ealily hurt by the feverity of dry 
or wet weather. Allowing the crop to anfwer the expec- 
tation of the farmer, the price it biings, is feldom a fuffi- 
cient compenfation for expenfe and labour \ this is owing 
; to the immenfe quantity of grain imported into Greenock, 
and from which port it is circulated through the country, 
to a great diftanee, whereby it is kept lower than in moft 
inland places.. Another thing which impedes agriculture, 
is, the farmer pays his rent much eafier from his dairy 
than his plough ; and for his encouragement, he finds a 
ready market, and good prices for all kinds of produce, 
grain excepted, in the town above mentioned. In order to 
favour this mode of farming, great part of the land is 
thrown into grafs ; fo much only is ploughed, as is barely 
fufficient to fupport the cattle through winter. The me- 
thod of working land in general, is to reft it 3 or 4 years, 
and plough it 2 ; feldom doing any more to it, than what 
their cattle and manure do. The dung ot the cattle is ufed 
in railing barley and pot uoe^. which are excellent in quali- 
ty, and frequently coniideraole in quantity ; beiides thofe 

confumed 



of Innerkip.

eorrtumed in the parifli, many bolls are carried to Gree- 
nock. 

From this method of farming, there are fome exceptions 
among the tenants ; and efpecially 2 or 3 heritors, who do 
the lands they hold in their own hands great juftice, and 
are well repaid. Excepting what is done by thefe, agri- 
culture is nearly in the fame ftate it was 50 years ago. Du- 
ring many years, the farms have been increafing in extent, 
as well as in valui, confequently at prefent much dimi- 
nilhed in number. The number of acres in crop cannot 
well be known. If the feafon be favourable for ploughing, 
the price of cattle, and the produce of the dairy low, more 
is thrown into crop than when thefe are otherwife. Crops, 
in general, are but very moderate, as may readily be ex- 
pected, from the manner of improving, and confift chiefly 
of oats and a little barley. Rye grafs has been introduced, 
but is not much followed after. The old Scots plough, 
drawn by 3 horfes, is moftly in ufe. Ploughing commonly 
begins about the middle of March, fowing the firlt week 
of April, reaping the end of September, or beginning of 
October. The farmer generally holds his own plough, 
where there are no children, or not grown up. As the 
tillage is not great, the produce is not nearly fufficient for 
the inhabitants. Though there are few farms, if any, in 
the parifh, that can be called (tore farms, yet there are 50 
or 60 fcores of flieep •, almoft one half of thefe are allowed 
to range in the common moor, during fummer, and come 
down to the low grounds in winter. It the price of lands 
be a proof of value, here they fall nothing below thofe 
fyuematically improven ; when fold, which is feldom, they 
bring from 40 to 50 years purchafe. The valued rent of 
-the pariih is L. 3 177 Scots.*

Population.— According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls was then 1 590. It may be fuppofed, from 
feveral circumflances, that the number of " inhabitants in 
this parifli has rather decreafed. In almoft every part of 
the parifli ruins of dwelling-houfes are feen ; and the fmall 
farms which belonged to thefe, annexed to others. The 
villages, as might have been expefted, have not much in- 
creafed ; alfo moft of the young men, having an inclination 
for a feafaring life, leave this place, and fettle where they 
are employed. From thefe reafons, it is to be conceived, 
that the inhabitants are not fo numerous as formerly. 
From an account taken in the 1792, the number appears to 
be of families 344 ; of fouls 1280. Of thefe, almoft in each 
of the villages, Daff and Gourock, is 1.3d ; the other third 
in the country part. Males and females are nearly equal. 

There 



much owing to the increafe of labour, as to the decreafe of hands. Ever 
fince fmall farms and cottages became parts of larger poffeffions, the num- 
ber of hands, who work for hire, has diminiflied. The effect of this was 
confiderably felt formerly, but of late more fenfibly. The country is now 
fo much drained of its ufeful labourers, by the different manufactures, 
that the farmer can hardly either find fervants, or afford the high wages. 
Any advance he has upon the different produ&amp;ions of his farm, with dif- 
ficulty balances the rife of rents. A ploughman's wage is from L. 9 to 
L. i2, with victuals; a woman's, from L. 3 to L. 4; a mafon's. as. a car- 
penter or houfe-wright, 1 s. 8 d. a-day ; a day-labourer, is. 6 d. There 
are fome both higher and lower than thefe. The neceffaries of life, that 
cannot be brought from a confiderable diftance. have greatly increafed, 
and are ftill increafing, meal excepted. Oat-meal of this country produce, 
rates commonly from 1 id. to Is. 2d. but feldom above is. the peck; 
beef, from 6 s. to 6 s. 6d. theftone; mutton, from 5d. to 6-id. the pound; 
frefli butter, from 10 d. to 1 s. the pound ; fait butter, 13 s. the (tone ; po- 
tatoes, at a medium, 6 A. a peck. White fiffi, haddocks, and cod, new 
taken, are fold at 1 d. the pound ; falmon, 4-id.

tion of the parifli minifter. Sir Michael Stewart:, B'a-- 
ronet, of Blackball, is patron.— The fchoolmafter's fala- 
ry is ioo merks Scots; and the whole amount of his in- 
come, as teacher and feflion -clerk, is about L. 16 a-year ; 
for which he teaches Engliih at i s. 4 d. writing at 1 s. 
6 d. ; arithmetic at 1 s. 8 d. a-quarter. This, with his o- 
ther perquifites and falary, amounts only to L. 16, and with 
this he maintains a numerous family. Befides the paro- 
chial fchool, there is one in the village of Gourock, where 
the teacher is fupported by the wages, without either fala- 
ry or houfe. Neither of thefe fchools are fo well attended 
as might be expected, from the number of inhabitants, and 
the eafy terms on which education is got. — The poors 
funds are managed by the feflion, and confift of L. 4.C0 
flock, befides the weekly collections. Out of this, a little 
is allowed to about 34, who are on the roll, confifting of 
thofe unable to work, and of thofe incapable to earn what 
is fufficient to maintain themfelves and families. They re- 
ceive from 2 s. to 4 s, 6 d. each a-month. Befides this, 
twice a year the fum of L. 8 or L. 9 is divided among the 
moft needy, fome of whom are not on the lift. The poor 
live in their own houfes, and none are allowed to beg ; but 
there are great numbers from other places. 

Roads.— The public road, which runs through this pa- 
rifli, and leads to Irvine and Ayr, is kept in good repair 
by the ftatute labour. John Shaw Stewart, Efq; of Gree- 
nock, fome years ago altered the line of that part which 
leads from this to Greenock, confuting of above 5 miles, and 
generoufly executed the whole at his own expenfe, which 
is of great utility to the county. It is probable, that this, 
with the crofs roads, which are very bad, will now be 
much better, by levying, at a certain rate, and applying 
the money raifed under the direftion of truftees, agreeable

o an aft of Parliament obtained this year for that purpofe. 
There are no tolls in the parifh, and only one ferry acrofs 
the frith of Clyde, which is about 5 miles broad, to Du- 
noon in Argyleihire. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There are 5 heritors, Sir 
Michael Stewart, Baronet, of Blackhall, John Shaw 
Stewart, Efq; of Greenock, Duncan Darroch, Efq; of 
Gourock, John Wallace, Efq; of Kelly, and Duncan 
Campbell, Efq; of Langhoufe. Befides thefe, there are 
a great number of fmall feuars ; — two heritors only relide. 
Sir Michael Stewart, whofe refidence is Ardgowan, is pro- 
prietor of the greateft part of the parifh. The houfe is de- 
lightfully fituated upon the fhore, about a mile from the 
church, and commands a moll: extenlive profpecT: of the 
frith of Clyde. It is large, and built at different times, 
confifting of an old fquare tower of great antiquity, and a 
modern dwelling-houfe, furrounded with a confiderable 
quantity of plantations. The lands round it are well inclo- 
fed, and judicioufly improved. The other refiding heri- 
tor is Duncan Darroch, Efq; whofe refidence is Gourock, 
pleafantly fituated on a large bay. — There are two vik 
lages, each of ivhich contain about 1.3d of the inhabitants, 
as mentioned formerjy. Daff, in the barony of Innerkip, 
Sir Michael Stewart's eftate, ftands near the church, is di- 
flant from Greenock 5; miles, and from the village of Largs, 
9 miles on the other fide. The other village is Gourock, 
on Mr Darroch's eftate. From fituation, this place is very 
convenicnt for trade, having fufRcient depth of water for 
veffels of any burden, and good fhelter. In this village, a 
rope- work commenced in the 1777, and fucceeds well. 
It employs at prefent 49 people, and manufactures about 
165 tons of hemp yearly. The walk is 200 fathoms long, 
one half of which is covered with a flate roof. On the-

outfide is a walk for white-work of the fame length.— In 
the neighbourhood of this village an attempt was made for 
coal fome years ago, which, if fuccefsful, would have been 
of great advantage to the country; but meeting with cop- 
per ore, the undertakers were diverted from their firft ob- 
ject. This new difcovery promifed well both in richnefs 
and quantity -, but being wrought by a Company, who 
were chiefly engaged in England, it was fo managed as to 
defeat the expectation. — On Sir Michael's eftate are 3 
mills, 2 for grinding corn, and 1 for drefling flax. On Mr 
Darroch's eftate are 2, 1 for extracting oil from lintfeed, 
and the other for wafhing materials belonging to the rope- 
work Company. — There are 18 public-houfes, greatefl part 
of which might eafily be wanted ; however, it does not ap- 
pear that they are very hurtful to the morals of the peo- 
ple. Only 2 of thefe hare a licence for all kinds of li- 
quors. — During the fummer months, this place is much 
frequented for fea-bathing ; a number of houfes are kept 
moftly furniflied on purpofe, and hired by families from 
Glafgow, and other inland places, which is of great advan- 
tage to the inhabitants. — The filh caught here, are the fame 
with thofe round the weft coaft of Scotland ; and there are 
no fea-fowls, nor land-animals, fo remarkable as to deferve 
particular defeription.— The inhabitants in general are in 
eafy circumftances, fober and induftrious.

NUMBER VIII. 
PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4916970">BIRSE</name>, 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery of 
Kincardine O'Niel.) 

By the Rev. Mr Joseph Smith. </head>



<p>Name, &amp;c. 

THE ancient name of the parifli is faid to have been 
Prejs, meaning in Gaelic a " wood or thicket." 
Great part of the parifli was, and is ftill covered with na- 
tural wood, fuch as fir, birch, afh, alder, mountain afh, gean 
or black cherry, holly, hazel, afpen, and fome oaks, &amp;c. 
Befides the natural wood, there are fome thoufand acres 
inclofed and planted with various foreft trees, fir, birch, 
a(h, elm, beech, plane, horfe chefnut, fprnce, larix, and 
willows of all forts, &amp;c. &amp;x. all are in a thriving Hate, and 
many of them already fit for ufe. The parilh then takes 
its name from this circumflance, namely, its having always 
produced a deal of fine wood. The name has been greatly 
corrupted. It feems to have been written Prei/s, then 
Breifs, and this is infci ibed on the communion cup about 
a century ago. In fome writings it is called Braj's, and 

now 



*°4 Statijlical Account 



now it obtains the name of Birfe. The names of the great- 
*r part of the places in the parifli are evidently derived 
from the Gaelic language ; for example, Prejbeg, now Birfe- 
leg, « the little bufli;" Pre/more, now Birfemore, " the 
large bum." 

Extent and Situation. — Its extent from E. to W. is about 
10 meafured miles, and, including that range of the Gram- 
pian hills belonging to the parifli ; its extent from the ri- 
ver Dee on the N. towards the S. is in many places nothing 
lefs. It is indeed narrower towards the eaft end of the pa- 
rifli, but by all who are thoroughly acquainted with its ex- 
tent, it is deemed equal to a figure of 10 miles fquare. 
The parifli church is diftant from Aberdeen, the neareft 
poft town, about 27 meafured miles. It is the mod fou- 
therly parifli in the county of Aberdeen. With refpecl to 
the inhabited part of the parifli, it may be divided into 
three large ftraths or diftricts. The largeft of which, in 
the fouth-eaft end of the parifli is called Fetighfide, (or vul- 
garly the Eajlfide of the hiil, meaning Corfe Dardar.') It 
has the Feugh running through it. It is about 3 miles 
long and 2 broad. The houfe of Finzean is in the north 
weft corner of it, and being furrounded on the north and 
weft by hiils and woods, is remarkably flickered and plea- 
fan tly fttuated. Its name Finzean, is faid by thofe con- 
verfaut in the Gaelic language to be defcriptive of its plea- 
fan t fitUHtion. The heritor has always refided. Directly weft 
on the banks of the Fcugh, and among the Grampian hills 
is fituated the Forejl or Glen Birfe, partly inclofed and cul- 
tivated, and partly in common for pafture. The middle 
ftraih or diftricT: is called the Water, vulgarly the burn of 
Coattic, as that burn runs through it. It is about 4 miles 
long and 1 broad. On the fouth of the burn is Midftrath, 
and on the north Bailogie, formerly named Tillyfnaught. 
i Both

of Birfe. 105 

Both are delightfully fituated, being encircled with hills and 
woods. The proprietor of Midftrath has not for fome time 
relided, confequentlj the manfion-houfe is almoft a ruin. 
The houfe of Ballogie is fitted up with tafte by the pro- 
prietor, who refides. In its neighbourhood, and on the public 
road that paffes through the parifh from E. to W. is the 
neat little village of Marywell, where they are improving 
the fields, and building neat fmall houfes under the aufpices 
of Mr Innes the proprietor. Directly weft on the banks 
of the Chattie is Glenchatt, partly cultivated, and partly 
fet apart for pafture. The moft northerly diftrict is along 
the fouth fide of the Dee; through it runs the burn of Birfe. 
In it is Balfour, where a fmall heritor refides. The church 
and manfe are there fituated, very inconveniently for the 
greater part of the parifh. This diftricl is about 24- miles 
long, and i\ broad. It is vulgarly called the Six Towns. 
The whole parifh is divided into what was called 24 towns j 
and in the opinion of fome fkilful men, each town may 
contain from 80 to 85 acres arable. Upon this fuppofition, 
there may be reckoned about 2000 acres and upwards un- 
der cultivation, exclufive of the Foreft, where there are now 
120 acres and odds under cultivation. The number of 
acres under wood in the parifh may be equal to the num- 
ber under cultivation. 'No trees, however, grow in what 
is called the Foreft ; yet there is reafon to believe, that it 
once produced a great deal of various forts, particularly hol- 
ly. In fome old houfes in the parifh, fome wood that grew 
in the Foreft ftill remains ; tradition fays, that the remain- 
der of the wood growing in the Fcreft was confumed by 
fire. The neareft farm to the Foreft is called Woodend. 
To the parifh belong in property, or at leaft by fervitude, 
four forefts or glens ; in all of which, probably wood has 
been produced, namely Glen-Birfe, Glen-Aven, Glenchatt* 
and Glenfleudrum. 

Vol. IX. O Surface,

Surface, Soil and Climate. — The furface is uneven, hilly, 
and even rocky and mountainous. It is beautifully diver-, 
fified with hill and dale, wood and water. Many fpots in 
it are mod delightful they afford the pleafures of a rural 
life -n abundance, and fiich as can relifh thefe pleafures 
mud be highly delighted with the variegated appearance 
of the country. The foil is light and fharp, fandy in fome 
places, in others a dark brown loam. It is moilly on a 
hard and gravellifh bottom. In a few places the bottom is 
inclined to clay ; when juftice is done to the foil, the pro- 
duce will fufficiently reward the hufbandman for his labour 
and expenfe. The air is pare, and the climate temperate 
and healthy. On the banks of the Dee fnow lies not fo 
long as in fome other places. Tht re are no difeafes pecu- 
liar to the parifh. Many of the inhabitants arrive at a good 
old age, as the population-table will evince. Some families 
feem to have their blood tainted with the fcrofula ; lome 
complain of rheumatifm (more frequently indeed than their 
forefathers), and a lew young people die of c on fu nipt ions. 
In general, however, they are a blooming healthy race. 
Inoculation is practifed a little with fuccefs ; the fenfible 
part of the people do not feem averfe from it. 

■Hills and Mojfis, Birds and Game, ifc. — As there are 3 
ftraths or diftricls of which the parifti is made up, fo there 
are 3 large ridges of hills taking their rife towards the ri- 
ver Dee, and running in a S. W. direction till they termi- 
nate in the heart of the Grampians, of which indeed they are 
a part. Peter-hill, the White-hill, and Mulbrax, are in the 
fouth ridge. — The Ords, the Shooting-greens, (over which 
the great road leading from the river Dee to the Cairn 
o'Mount paffes); Tomcairn, Corfe-Dardar, (over which 
the public road from E to W. paffes); hills of Midftrath 
and Arntilly, Larnachip, and Bracken itaik, are in the mid- 
dle 



of Birfe. 107 

die ridge. The moft northerly ridge takes its rife at Inch- 
bair, and terminates at Cairnferg. On the W. of the pa- 
rilh are the hills of Birfemore, Deuchry, and Mount Ga- 
niach, which is the higheft hill in the pariih. Indeed, 
Mount Battach, or the north fide of it, is claimed as belong- 
in? to Birfe. Its height by Garden's map of the county of 
Kincardine, is 1150 yards above the level of the fea. 
Mount Battach is confidcrably higher than Mount Ganiach, 
which is conjeftured to be about icoo above the level of 
the fea. Peter-hill and Mulbrax are next in height to 
Mount Ganiach, and may be rated at 900 yards. Cairn- 
ferg, which is a remarkably confpicuous conical mount, 
may be about 700 yards. The reft of the hills fall gra- 
dually lower in their refpe&amp;ive ridges northward and eaft- 
ward, till the ridge enters the pariih of Strachan, or termi- 
nates at the river Dee. There has been no map or diflincl 
meafurement of this pariih. The height of the hills cannot 
therefore h€ exadlly fpecified. In Garden's map, the htua- 
tion of part of this pariih may be feen. All the hills are 
rocky and covered with heath, int rperfed with paflure, 
ftraths and green vallies. There on the Grampian hills 
our frugal fwains do literally feed their flocks. The hills 
produce a variety of herbs, the names and virtues of which 
we cannot pretend to fpecify ; alfo many forts of berries, 
the blue berry, cranberry, cloudberry ; in rocky places, 
the bramble, rafp, and ftrawberry of a fmall fize. The 
hills alfo abound with mofs ; it is indeed inexhaultible, but 
of difficult accefs. In the moffes fituated in the lower 
grounds of the parifh are dug up the remains of old oaks, 
■which appear to have been of a prodigious lize. In the 
hill moffes the fir is found, commonly the root, and fome- 
times the whole tree, as frefh as if fallen yefterday, .al- 
though it has been buried hundreds, perhaps thoufands of 
years. The oaks are not quite fo frefli. The hills alfo a-

mooting feafon, the keen and adtive fportfman frequents our 
parifh, to enjoy upon our hills and moors his favourite a- 
mufement *. 

Springs and Rivers, ifc—No fpring or well in the parifli 
has acquired fame from its medicinal virtue, yet fome mi- 
neral fprings are to be found, and have been reforted to by 
feveral of the inhabitants ort account of fcrofulous, gra- 
vellifh or ftomachic complaints. On Mount Ganiach there 
is a well called St Corn's well, in honour, probably of the 
celebrated faint of Icolumk.il; but concerning this well 
there is no tradition. The parifli abounds with fine fprings 

or 

* In a country fo hilly, rocky, and woody as this parifli, there is fuch a 
variety of the feathered tribe, as renders it difficult to know the proper 
names of them all. Among the refident birds, may be reckoned eagles 
or earns, (now rare), hawks of all kinds, gledes, owls of all kinds, moor- 
fowl, blackcock, ptarmagan, partridge, heron, wild-duck, teal, fliell- 
drake, magpie, raven, crow, jackdaw, the wood-pigeon, the fieldfare, Iky- 
lark, wood-lark, the bountain, goldfinch, the chaffinch, the wren and 
golden -crefted ditto, the fparrow, redbreaft, woodpeckers of the larger 
and lefier kinds, thrufli, flailing, fnipe, ouzel, bat, tomtit, common and 
green linnet, yellow-hammer, blackbird, and the wader, a bird frequent- 
ing running water, and many others. The migratory birds are, the wood- 
cock, fca-magpie, |fwallow, martin, bullfinch, cuckoo, wagtail, ftone- 
chatter, fand-lark, rcd-fliank, land-fail, dotterel, king's-fifher, grey and' 
green plover, &amp;c. The bullfinch, wood-lark, golden-crefted wren, and 
fome fay the fparrow, have only appeared within thefe 20 years. In win- 
ter, the fnow-birds refort in flocks to the cultivated parts of the parifli, 
and difappear as the year revolves, and the weather turns mild. — The 
quadrupeds, befides domeftic animals, are the red and roe deer. Thefe 
abound in our plantations, where the hind calves, and brings up her 
young. Thefe are troublefome to the hufbandmen. Befides the com- 
mon hare, we have the mountain-hare, in winter, white as fnow j alfo the 
fox, badger, otter, pole-cat, martin, weafel, and ermine. The wolf, 
when in Scotland, had vifited our mountains ; for towards the weft end 
of the parifli, there is a place in the Grampians, ftill known by the nams 
of the Wolf-Hnim.

them, it is watered by the Dee on the north ; the Aven 
towards the fouth; the Feugh, the water or burn of Chat- 
tie, and the burn of Birfe, running through the thrco 
ftraths of the parifli. The Dee abounds with excellent fal- 
mon, grilfe, fea trout, flerlings (here called dowbrecks,) 
trout and parr, with fome pikes and frefli water flounders 
with finnicks. Dee is faid to produce pearl lhells, but 
pearls have rarely been found. Feugh is the molt confi- 
derable river. It alfo produces falmon, and moll of the 
forts of fifli above mentioned. It would abound with them 
all, were they not flopped by a confiderable water-fall near 
its influx into the Dee, oppofite to Banchoryternan, and 
which prevents the falmon from getting up unlefs when 
the river is flooded. The Feugh receives Aven before it 
leaves the parifli of Birfe and the Dee, when running through 
the parifli of Strachar-, it is a very rapid river, and often 
overflows its banks. The Aven, the Chattie and the burn of 
Birfe, abound with trout of all forts, alfo eels. No rivers 
or rivulets afford the angler better fport than thefe *. 

Agriculture and Produce. — It muft be confeflfed that a- 
griculture in this country is rather in an imperfecl flate j 
many of the people continue rivetted in their prejudices a- 
gainfl: the modern improvements in hufbandry. All, how- 



* Towards the fpawning feafon, falmon grilfe, and fea-trout, come up 
in great numbers into the rivers and burns, and even into the brandies of 
them. The fpawning feafon is thought to be from the middle of Octo- 
ber to the end of November ; during which time fifliing, which, by the 
by, is always with the rod or f P ear. is prohibited. We have, however, a 
fpecies of falmon, called by the country people candavaigs, that frequently 
do not fpawn before the month of April or May ; thefe. therefore, are in 
perfedhon when the others are not. They are grofier for their length 
than the common falmon, and often (of a large fize) upwards of 2 0 or° 3 o 
pound weight. They are faid to come from the coafts of Norway.

ever muft allow, that thefe improvements have commenced 
m this parifh, and that fome of the tenants have done more 
in the way of farming to purpofe, than manj of their neigh- 
hours in feveral places around. Several have upon their pof- 
lefhon a fmall limekiln ; they purchafe the limeftone at fome 
of the quarries in the parifh, and burn it with peat, mixed 
often with wood, or even with fome coals from Aberdeen. 
The lime they lay upon the grounds has much effeft. Some 
however aver, that to lime their ground is to no purpofe, 
as, fay they, it has no effect, becaufe the ground is on lime' 
ftone : Whether this be a juft remark, or only an excufe 
for indolence, is left to the fkillul farmer to decide ; where 
a fufficient quantity of lime is allowed, it cannot fail to en- 
Cure a crop. Seventy bolls of Midftrath lime flacked, and 
each boll containing three corn firlots, will be fufficient for 
the worft outfield in the parifh. When bought at Mid- 
ftrath, each boll cofis is. 4d. which indeed is very high ; 
but even at that price little can be burned for fale, as fuel 
is at fo great a diftance. The limeftone is inexhauftible, 
and the lime of an excellent quality. Some are cleaning 
their ground, by fallowing, by a little green cropping, and 
by laying it down with artificial graffes, others are going 
on in taking 2 or 3 fucceffive crops of oats, and 1 of bear, 
(when they give the ground a little dung), without allow- 
ing fome portions of their ground any reft in a century. 
Indeed when the poorer fort of it is completely exhaufted 
by fucceffive crops, they muft let it reft ; but for years it is 
almoft ufelefs. Some are going on with fpirit, inclofing 
and clearing their ground of ftones. Others are throwing 
every impediment in the way of the improver, by tramp- 
ling down the fences, and by not only neglecting to remove 
the ftones from their fields, but even by alleging, that the 
ftones are beneficial to the foil, and tend to nourifh the 
crop. In the eaft end of the parifh, where liming is chief-

Jj attended to, it is thought a capital blunder is commit- 
ted ; tor the foil wing is the plan they have adopted. They 
lime, and often at the fame time, dung part of the worft of 
their farm (outfield). They take two fucceffive crops of 
oats, the effed of the lime for the firft crop is not very per- 
ceptible, the fecond crop ib excellent. Bear is fown for 
the third crop, nnd he who did not lay on the dung with 
the lime, now does it. This crop amply repays the ex- 
penfe. It is now humbiy fubmitted to the fkilful impro- 
ver, whether they ought not with this crop to fow it out 
with artificial grafles ; if thr} did fo, they would keep the 
ground in heart ; but inftc-ad of doiqg fo, the greater part 
take other two crops of oats. Thefe they have very good. 
Still by this plan, however, and by taking fo many crops 
of oats, they exhaufl the ground to a great degree Any 
part of their infield which they have cleaned, and had un- 
der green crop, they generally lay down with graffes, and 
to encourage them to this laudable practice, Mr Farquhar- 
fon of Finzean, prefented feveral of his tenants with fome 
quantity of grafs feeds Lift fpring ; the like had been done 
by Mr Gerard of Midftrath, in a former year. The dif- 
tin&amp;ion of outfield and infield ought as much as pofTxble 
to be laid afide, and equal jufiice mould be done to the 
whole farm, be it fmall or great. Winter herding ought 
to be pra&amp;ifed ; but to this, they who are leaft induftrious, 
and have leaft to care for, are, as may be expected, moft a- 
verfe. The number of acres under .cultivation cannot be 
eafily ascertained, they are already rated at about 2200, 
more might be improved, and certainly have been arable 
on the hills and moors. Indeed, there might be an addi- 
tion of feveral hundred acres by trenching the baulks or 
waite flips of ground that in many farms do ftill abound. 
Of the above number of acres, we may reckon one-fixth 
part in lee or natural grafs. A fmall proportion is annually

m green crop, not above 30 acres, with the like number 
fovvn out with artificial gaffes, crop 179 r , independent of 
the farms in the particular poffeffion of the principal refiding 
heritors, Finzean and Ball ogie. Thefe farms are con- 
fiderablj improved, and have been for fome years in 
grafs. The prefent proprietors, who lately came to the 
poffeffion of their reipeftive eftates, are now beginning to 
put them under crop ; and Mr Innes of Ballogie takes 
the lead in improvements in the parifh. The number of 
acres mentioned above, in green crop, and laid out in grafs, 
is exclufive of the heritors farms, which were only be- 
gun to be cropped lad year. It is alfo but doing the te- 
nants juftice, to mention, that in crop 1792 they had dou- 
bled the number of acres under green crop, &amp;c. This cir- 
cumftance marks our fmall, but rapid progrefs of improve- 
ment. Oats and bear are the principal part of each crop. 
Some peafe, and a little rye, are alfo produced. Potatoes 
are not raifed for fale, being at a diflance from any market 
town ; but abundance of them are raifed for the ufe of the 
inhabitants, and the foil produces them remarkably good. 
The grain is of an excellent quality, the oats yielding more 
meal, and the bear more fpirit, than grain produced from 
a deeper foil. In the parifh a little flax is raifed ; and as 
the foil feems to agree with it, a greater quantity will now 
be raifed than formerly, when no lint mill was in all this 
country. The Earl of Aboyne has remedied this incon- 
venience by erecling one in 1791, in the parifh of Coul, a 
few miles to the north of this parifh. It will greatly ac- 
commodate the country, and has conflant employment al- 
ready. The parifh can \vell fupply itfelf with provifions ; 
no wheat indeed is produced, but the people here ordinari- 
ly ufe cakes of oat-meal. The lands are rarely let by the 
acre, a cumulus rent is taken for the whole farm, large or 
fmall. Some of the land is let at the rate of 15 s. or 16s.

the acre; in general 10 s. and indeed fome of it dear e- 
nough in its prefent ftate of 2S. but capable of improve- 
ment. The higheft rent paid by one tenant is about L.60. 
The current rents of the poffeffions are from L. 10 to L. 20, 
and fome as low as from L. 3 to L. 5 *. 

Befides grain, the parifh produces a deal of wood which 
it exports. Numbers of black cattle and fheep are an- 
nually fold, and taken from our hills and put upon rich 
pafture ; they turn out to great account. Black cattle fetch 
from L. 2 to L. 7. Sheep are worth from L. 4 to L. 12 the 
fcore, fome few fell at 14 s. each. Horfes are worth from 
L. 5 to L. 15 •, and fome few from L. 15 to L. 25. Some 
of them alfo are reared in the parifh. It is famous alfo for 
producing honey of great richnefs and flavour. In a fa- 
vourable year a good deal is exported. Two men in the 
Six i owns exported 100 pints each, in furnmer and autumn 
1791. The pint confifts of 5 lbs. Anifterdam, and fells 
from 2 s. 6d. to 4 s. 2d. A little butter ar.d cheefe is alfo 
exported. In feveral gardens in the parifh, there is a 
good number of fruit trees bearing fruit. The crop of 
apples on one tree in the garden of Midftrath fold once for 
a guinea. The garden of Finzean being fenced both by

ter the manner of horfes. By many the old Scots plough is {till ufed, and 
anfwers belt in rough ftony ground. The better fort, and the active te- 
nant, who has improved his farm a little, have procured ploughs of the new 
form. Seed time begins about the middle of March, harveft about the 
firft of September. Indeed, for feveral years pall, both have been much 
later, owing to the cold and uncommonly rainy feafons. On the eftate of 
Ballogie, Mr Forbes, the late proprietor, found, and ufed as a manure, a 
kind of marl, with fome effect. The death of the heritor prevented the 
•working of it for any time. The prefent proprietor intends to try it a-

nature and art from every noxious Waft, produces apples in 
fize and flavour equal perhaps to any in Scotland. Wool, 
ana fome coarfe woollen cloth nianufa6tured in the parifh,is 
alio exported. Real while wool can hardly be obtained, 
fince the introdu&amp;ion of the black-faced iheep, where wool 
is neither fo fine nor fo white as that of the fmall breed, 
which formerly did more abound. This article mall be 
.concluded by mentioning, that the Kincardine and Alford 
farming fociety have offered premiums for the beft fleece of 
wool ; alfo for an acre of outfield, upon which 70 bolls 
flacked lime is laid ; alfo for an acre under green crop, and 
laid out next year with artificial grafles, all within their 
diftricl: j they have judged well in offering fmall premiums 
for one acre, as this will tend to excite emulation among 
the tenants, even of the leaft poffeflions. The Society 
" deferve well of their country *." 

Property 

* Prices of Labour, Wages, far. — The price of labour is greatly in- 
creafed, from what it was. There are living in the parifh two eld men, 
(tenants), who, in their younger days, were fervants, the one at 2o s. and 
the other at 3° s - a-ycar. For young men to do the fame work now, 
there mult be paid from L. 4 to L. 5, and from L. 5 to L. 6, with their en- 
tertainment, in which they are moft extravagant, often requiring bettep 
entertainment than the tenant can afford to himfelf. Women fervant* 
have from L. 2 to L. 2, ro s. ; and a few houfe fervants, L. 3 ; herd-boys, 
from 12 s. to 23 s for the fummer half-year. When the children of the 
tenant grow up, he employs them. This is his firft relief. Before, he was 
much at the mercy of mercilefs menials. A day-labourer, of whom we 
have few, gets 6 d. and victuals, at fome work he requires more ; for in 
harveft, he gets is. and upwards; a wright, 8 d. and lately 10 d. ; % 
tailor, 6 d. and victuals ; a mafon, from t s. 6 d. to 1 s. 9 d. without 
victuals. The blackfmith works by the piece, and is very extravagant in 
his demand. The weaver alks 2i d. or 3 d. for what was formerly done 
at 1 d. the ell. Shoes are at an exorbitant rate, triple of what they were 
30 years ago. The poorer fort have much ado to purchafe that neceftary 
article. — The women of the parilh are chiefly employed in the knitting of 
ftockings, or fpinning of lint-yarn. By the former they earn, when work- 
ing 



/ 



of Birfe. 



Pfoptriy and Valued Rent. — The landed property of the 
parifh (which was church-lands) has undergone feveial 
changes. Gordon of Cluny was once proprietor of up- 
wards of two-thirds of the parifh. From time to time he 
fold a town, or a part of a town, as a purchafer offered, 
and as he had occafion for money. This gave rife to a 
great number of proprietors in Birfe, till at laft the parifh 

came 



ing on their own account, i s. 8 d. or 2 s. the week , by the latter, a little 
more. If working on account of a matter, they often earn lefs. At three 
ftations in the parifh, wool is given out, and the ftockings taken in, 
monthly, by the Aberdeen manufacturers, or their fervants. At feveral 
itations, lint is given out, and the yarn received, by one appointed by the 
manufacturer. In all forts of weather, the holier keeps his day punctual- 
ly, and the poor are fure of what they have earned. By the induftry of 
the wife and his own labour, if in health, the cottager is enabled to bring 
up his family ; and many active women, either by the above employ- 
ments, or by' making, during the furnmer, a piece of coarfe woollen cloth 
;for fale, greatly aid their hulbands in making up the rent of their pofief- 
fions. The eftablifhment of thefe factories, as the country people call' 
them, have been a great bleffing to the country m general. 

Price of Promifions. — This is much regulated by the Aberdeen mar- 
ket. When meal, upen which the people chiefly fubfilt. is low priced 
there, it foon becomes fo here. Grain, in general, is double the price at 
what it was 30 years ago. During the years 1790 and 1791, meal fold 
from 13 s. to 17 s. the boll ; (9 ftone Amfterdam is often given for the 
boll) ; bear, from 15 s. to 19 s. the boll. Beef and mutton are fometimes 
purchafed from the Aberdeen market, and fometimes procured by feeding 
at home. After counting every coft, we have meat cheaper, than when 
brought from Aberdeen. Butter fells from 6 d. to 8 d. the pound ; cheefe,. 
from 5 s. to 6 s. the ltone. The pound here confifts of 28 ounces Avoir- 
dupois. Eggs formerly at I d. the 14, now fell at ii d. and 2 d. the 12 ;■ 
4 chicken, 2 d. and a hen from 6 d. to 8 d. ; falmon, in its feafon, about 
3 d. the pound ; any other fort of fiih is fcarce and dear. The neceflaries 
of life are at leaft one half dearer, and articles of luxury more than double., 
within thefe 40 years. This is a circumilance greatly againft fuch as 
have ftationary livings. It mull be confeffed, that what were articles of 
luxury in our hardy forefathers day, are now become articles that ate 
reckoned neceflaries, as tea-,-

came into the hands of a few, fo that there are now onfj 
fix heritors and the church feflion. Two of the heritors 
and the church-fdlion have a very fmall property. Land 
has fold from 25 to 30 years purchafe. The wood upon 
the eftate often enhances its value. The valued rent is in 
cumulo L. 3139 : 8 : 4 Scots. Two of the principal heri- 
tors, and one fmall heritor relide.

Church, Stipend, &amp;c — The King is patron. The church 
was built in 1779, at a confiderable expenfe, and is a moft 
fubftantial and commodious edifice, fuperior to moft, and 
inferior to few places of worfhip in the country. The fti- 
pend is L. 50 money, 16 bolls of meal, at 9 ftone ; 8 
bolls of bear, with L. 2 : 15 : 6 T 5 T , communion-element 
money. The glebe is fcarcely legal ; but part of it, parti- 
cularly the garden, is valuable. The incumbent is accom- 
modated with a farm, otherwife the glebe and offices would 
not render the fettlement very convenient. The manfe, 
for years, has been as infufficient as any in the country. 
The fum of L. 269 is allowed forjjgiving it a thorough repair, 
and for building a good addition, which, if properly ap- 
plied, and the work fufEciently executed, muft render the 

manfe abundantly commodious. 

X / Poor.- 



of Birfe. 



Poor.— The church-feffion became proprietors of a piece 
of land, upwards of a century ago, which yields from L. 4 
to L. 5 yearly. Dr Gilbert Ramfay, late of the ifland of 
Barbadoes, mortified, in 1732, for the behoof of the poor, 
L. 500, from which they have had intereft at 5 per cent. 
The late Robert Farquharfon of Finzean, mortified 600 
merks : L. 20 were left by the late Ifaac Robertfon of Gre- 
nada, in 1789. As yet the feflion has only recovered L. 15 
of that legacy. With this fum, the feffion have L. 125 
lent cam, at 44 per cent. There is ftill due, befides a con- 
fiderable fum loft, the fum of from L.40 to L. 50, a debt, 
which it is to be hoped, will in time be recovered. The 
weekly collections at prefent amount to L. 9 or L. 10 an- 
nually. Ten years ago they were not more than a third 
of that fum. The fines of delinquents, which are not ri- 
goroufly exacted, and fome fmall payments for the mort- 
cloth, are ftill to be added. Such being the funds deftined 
for the fupport of the poor, it is hardly to be wondered, 
that feveral put in a claim, efpecially as the beft tenant 
iometimes in a parilh, is not aftiamed to have his father, 
mother, or near relation, on the roll, which amounted here 
to 50 at laft diftribution ; however, not above a third of 
thefe receive fupply, unlefs at the two general diftributions 
of the intereft of Dr Ramfay's mortification. Few of the 
poor are altogether unable to provide for themfelves ; ma- 
ny are houfekeepers in indigent circumftances ; feveral wi- 
dows and young families. To thefe, to the aged, and the 
infirm, we give occafional relief ; to fome we allow 8 s. a- 
quarter. We allow 8 s. for an interment. None are al- 
lowed to be in ftraits, and almoft none belonging to the pa- 
rilh go about and beg : yet of ftrolling beggars we have 
our fhare. In fummer 1783, part of the money laid out at 
intereft was taken up, and meal bought with it for the re- 
lief of the indigent. Crop 1782 was by no means fo defi-

cient in this parifli as in many others, yet meal fold from 
L.i, is. to L.i, 5s. the boll. Grain ripens pretty 
early in many places on the banks of the Dee, 

Schools. — There is a parochial fchool, to which belongs 
the ufual trilling falary of 100 merks. The perquifites of the 
fchool mailer, as feffion clerk, are poorly paid, particularly 
lince the commencement of that odious and unp rodu&amp;ive 
fax impofed on baptifms, &amp;c. The confequence is, that 
few childrens names are regiftered. Till the people be 
relieved of this tax, and till even fome plan be de- 
vifed to compel a regular regiftration of every bap- 
tifra, marriage, and burial, no exa£t ftatiltical account 
of any parilh from a public regifter can ever be ob- 
tained ; no comparifon can ever be made of the ftate of a 
parifh at different periods, with fuiheient accuracy. There 
are great chafms in the regifters of this parifli. It might 
have a good effect, were the regifters of every parifli regu- 
larly called for and examined by the prefljytery annually. 
The baptifm tax, &amp;.c. is not only unpopular, but hurtful to 
a ufeful clafs of men, the fchoolmafters, who are ufually 
the feflion-clerks. Many, to fecure the fmall trifle of dues 
that remain, agree to pay the tax themfelves ; fo that, in 
thofe inftances, the clerk lofes more than the Revenue 
gains. The number of the fcholars at the parifli fchool is 
about 20 in fummer, and upwards of 30 in winter. The 
fchool-fees are as low as in any parifli. The teacher can- 
not make above L. 10 a-year. Shall we hope that the per 
riod is not far diftant when this ufeful body of men will be 
befriended by Government, and fuflicient falaries appoint- 
ed for them? Dr Ramfay, above mentioned, mortified al- 
fo L. 50c for the iupport of a free fchool in the eaft end of 
this parifli. There is a good fchool-houfe, but no fund for 
its fupport. There is a glebe of about 6 acres. The place 
is in the gift of Sir Alexander Ramfay, Bart, patron of all 

Dr 



of Birfe.

Dr Ramfay's mortifications. The number of fcholars that 
attend is, for the winter feafon, when the ichoolmarter 
teaches by or along witli a depute, from 20 to 30 and up- 
wards ; during all the reft of the year none. The place is 
well fituated for an academy, and might be made to turn to 
much account to the mafter and the public The fchools 
of this parifti have been in repute. Every fchool will be 
fo or not, as it happens to be taught by one, who is not on- 
ly a man of moderate abilities, but who gives attendance, 
and adds perfeverance. Without thefe, what do abilities 
in any Station avail ? In fome corners of the parifli, they 
hire young men to teach for the winter fealon. 

Chamber and Size of the People.— They are active and 
induftrious, fupporting themfelves and family comfortably, 
and feem in general contented with their lot. At church, 
and at all public occafions, they are clean anddecent; punctual 
in their attendance on public worlhip, and the ordinances 
of religion, though many of them are at a great diftance 
from church •, far more expenlive in their mode of drefs and 
living than their forefathers •, but can afford it : — " All is 
the gift of induftr}'-." They are fond of Social and convi- 
vial meetings ; yet Iefs addicted to drinking than they were 
fome years ago. Indeed the young people fquander much 
of their ca(h and their time in frequenting markets, mar- 
riages, and other merry meetings ; fo that often they have 
not a great deal to begin with when they take up houfe, 
notwithstanding their extravagant wages. On thefe occa- 
fions they often hurt their morals, and render themfelves 
unfit for the duties of their Stations. Both men and wo- 
men are of the middling Size; few men above 5 feet 10 
inches ;. many of a lower Stature, and thefe the ableft bo* 
died. They are (hrewd and lively, (lender and hardy j 
differing confiderably in their make from the people on

the fouth fide of the Grampians. They are hofpitable at. 
all occafions ; but though remarkably fo to ftrangers, they 
are not fond of them lettling among them. They fhow no 
particular fondnefs for, nor, if their country need it, anypar- 
ticular averlion to the military or feafaring life; fome of them 
have betaken themfelves to both, and 3 Chelfea penfioners 
refide in the parifli. The falhionable vices of the town are 
unknown among them. Some years ago, 1 low-fpirited 
wretch finiflied his life ; this excepted, there has been no o- 
ther fuicide. No perfon has been baniftied or capitally con- 
victed, fo far as is known to the incumbent. Few in the 
parifli have been bred to letters, yet none are illiterate. 
The Englifli or Scotch language is univerfally fpoken ; a 
few inhabiting the foreft underftand the Gaelic, but thefe 
came originally from the upper part of the country. 

Roads and Bridges. — The principal roads in the parifli, 
are the great road from the Cairn o'Mount, which enters 
this parifli at the Bridge of Whiteftone, a mile north from 
the Inn of Cutties Hillock, and leads northward to the Dee 
at Inchbair. This road is in excellent repair, owing chiefly 
to the exertions of the patriotic Sir Alexander Ramfay, 
Bart. Another road pafles through the greater part of the 
parifh, from the Ferry, over the Dee at Aboyne, to the* 
Bridge of Whiteftone. This, and the other roads in the 
parifli, were made, and are kept in repair by the ftatute- 
labour, which is exa&amp;ed in kind, but in a very remifs 
manner. The road's confequently are in fome places, par- 
ticularly in the eaft end of the parifli, fhamefully bad. Ia 
■winter, and wet feafons, thefe are moft uncomfortable. We 
have certainly excellent materials for roads ; and if even the 
rate of 1 s. 6 d. fixed by law, were levied, and properly lai* 
out, (as is done in a neighbouring parifli), certainly our 
roads could foon be rendered comfortable. Turnpikes are 

quite

*uite unknown here, and the refort on our roads is too lit- 
tle for the expenfe of them. Dr Ramiky, above men- 
tioned, built a bridge of five arches over the Feugh at 
Whiteftone. It accommodates the public very well, be- 
ing on the great fouth and north road. There is no bridge 
over the Chattie. One over it is greatly wanted, below 
Marywell, and alfo below Inverchatt. There is a bridge 
over the Burn of Birfe, nigh the church. But in no place 
is a bridge fo much wanted, nor could one be built that 
would accommodate this parifli, and the public in general/ 
fo much as at Pot-arch, over the Dee, near Inchbair. The 
great fouth and north road paffes the Dee there. This 
road is greatly frequented, and is ufed by the military, be- 
ing much nearer from Edinburgh to Fort George, than a- 
long the coaft. During this very feafon (179a), the mili- 
tary had occafion to life. this road repeatedly; once going 
north, to quell the riots in Rofs-lhire ; a fecond time, in 
going from Fort George, on account of the difturbances in 
Dundee. The Dee is a rapid river, always inconvenient, 
often dangerous and inipaffable. Had the latter been the 
cafe on the above emergencies, what might the confe- 
quences have been ? Befidas, there is no other place on all 
this rapid river, where a bridge could be ere&amp;ed at fo little 
expenfe, and at the fame time be of fuch public utility. 
Nature has pointed out the fpot where it ought to .be. At 
Pot-arch, lefs than L. 1500 would do more to accommo- 
date the public, than L. 5000 would do aim oft any where 
elfe over a river of the fame magnitude. It is faid that 
Dr Ramfay meant alfo to build a bridge over -the Dee, at 
Pot-arch, had he not been deterred from the undertaking, 
by the extravagant eftimate of an unlkilful architect. A 
plan of this bridge, which is fo much wanted, is in the 
Houfe of Finzean ; and had the late Haughton been fpared 
•for lome years, it is faid fome means would have been de- 

vifed 



124

vifed to have got the plan executed. Though former at- 
tempts to get a bridge erected over the Dee at Pot-arch, 
have repeatedly proved abortive, we fhall Hill hope that 
foon fome public fpirited character may be found, who will 
ftrive to fee the attempt crowned with fuccefs. Subfcrip- 
tions could be obtained to iome amount, but ftill it is to be 
feared that public aid would be abfolutely neceffary. Be- 
fore concluding this article, it deferves to be mentioned, 
that a road lb planned, and begun to be made, through the 
weft end of this panlh, over the Grampians. It will pafs 
through Glen Chatt, the Foreft, and Glenelk, and be 15 
miles nearer from a great part of this country, to the 
county of Angus, &amp;c. than by the Cairn or Mount Road. 
It will greatly accommodate the traveller and trader, par- 
ticularly drovers and dealers in cattle. 

Advantages and Dif advantages. — One great advantage 
that this parifh enjoys, is its abounding with limeftone, 
which is to be found in many places on or near the fur- 
face. The belt is at Midftrath and Ballogie. From thefe 
quarries, the tenants are chiefly fupplied with the lime- 
ftone which they burn at home. The greateft number of 
hands is employed at the Earl of Aboyne's lime-works 
at Birfe Moor. It is, however, much againft the im- 
prover, that fuel is fo difficult to be obtained. The greater 
part of the fummer feafon mult be fpent in procuring that 
neceffary article, confequently little of it can be fpared to 
burn the limeftone* Finding, however, the great benefit 
of lime as a manure, amazing exertions are made to pro- 
cure fuel, (to burn the limeftone), not only by cutting 
cart-roads alorrg the fteep hiMs, to the moffes, and by pur- 
chafing wood, but even by going at times to Aberdeen 
for coals, which pay the high duty, and mull be brought 
acrofs the Dee. In this cafe, the want of a bridge at Port- 
arch 



of Birfe. 



12$ 



arch is grievoufty felt. This would give more eafy ac- 
cefs to the Aberdeen market, and for coals. Our diftance 
from market, and the difficulty of procuring manure, is 
much againft us. Aberdeen is not only the neareft market 
and manufacturing town, but even the neareft poft-town ; 
a circumftance much againft this country. It is in our fa- 
vour that we have plenty of mofs of the beft fort, though 
not of eafy accefs, as peat and turf is the fuel ufed in the 
parifh, with wood, particularly brufhwood. That our 
country abounds with different forts of timber, and all of 
an excellent quality, is certainly an advantage. We have 
alfo plenty of granite-ftone, and the beft materials for build- 
ing ; and it is but juftice to the tenants, to fay that they 
are every clay erecting better houfes than they formerly 
occupied. But whatever our local advantages be, there is 
one great difadvantage under which we labour, that often 
counterafts and outweighs them all, namely, the difficulty 
of procuring, pleafing, and paying labouring fervants. This 
evil is feverely felt by all ranks in this country, and, if 
matters do not foon take a favourable turn, muft effectu- 
ally ruin the tenant. Confidering the infolence and beha- 
viour of fervants in general, words muft fail to defcribe the 
evil. Another evil that is pretty feverely felt, is the fer- 
vitude at the mill. To be liable for the fixteenth peck 
there, of all the produce, befides pretty high payment for 
grinding, over and above the multure, muft check the ar- 
dour of the improver. The multure, at fome of the mills, 
is converted ; at others, the grievance exifts ; and confe- 
quently, in that quarter of the parifh, improvement of 
land does fcarcely exift. The payment of either certain 
handfulls or diffifulls of meal to the miller for his work, is 
not very convenient. The equitable way, is certainly to 
weigh the quantity paid, and this ought to be fixed by law. 
It is alfo fubmitted to the public, whether any perfon has a 

title

landlord, are few, in comparifon of what they were. Thej 
all perform a carriage to Aberdeen, or like diftance, year- 
ly, fome of them are bound to provide a certain quantity 
of peats yearly; they alfo yearly, or occafionally, bring 
wood, flate, and lime to the heritor. The carriage of ma- 
terials for church, manfe, fchool, and mill, is performed by 
them. It muft be obferved, however, that the tenants do 
not fail in exading fervices of various kinds from the fub, 
tenants; and what is worfe, in feveral places take their 
fmall poffeffions often from them, after they have carefully 
improved them. The cottager muft be at the nod of his 
mafter, perhaps the menial is lefs fo. 

Antiquities and Eminent Men.— On the hill, about a mile 
Jiorth-eaft of Finzean, bearing the name of Corfe Dardar, 
there is a place marked near the way-fide with a long gra- 
nite-ftone, which lately flood erect, but now broken down. 
It is reported that King Dardanus, the 20th from Fergus I. 
was there put to death, when flying from his rebellious 
fubjedts. At a fmall diftance from this fpot, are two cairns, 
one very large, and in the form of an oblong ; they are 
now covered by the woods of Finzean. On the top of the 
hill, named Cairn Ferg, there is a large cairn of a conical 
fhape. Some fay it has been erected in memory of an e- 
minent perfon. Others, that the ancient inhabitants re- 
forted thither and worfhipped the fun, even before the com? 
mencement of Druidifm. If however, Druidifm were the 
firft religion in this ifland, which muft have been the cafe, 
if peopled from Gaul, perhaps this might have been 
a place where they burned fire, or performed fome rite of 
their religion. In various places there are feveral huge 
1 ftones 



of Birfe. 127 

•tones lying above the ground ; a few near Inchbair feera 
to have been a Druidical temple. In the year. 1779, when 
they were razing the foundation of the old church, there 
was found a hill ftone near fix feet long, with a two-hand- 
ed long fword, a hatchet and a crofs carved upon it. The 
ftone is now fet up erect in the wall of the church-yard. 
In the Foreft or Glenbirfe, there is Handing a good part of 
a caftle, which was built by Gordon of Cluny, for a hunt- 
ing feat, and which is now by the tenant converted into a 
ftieep-cot. In ieveral places, particularly between Mary- 
well and the church, there appears a narrow flip of ground 
that has been fenced on both fides by ftone walls, faid to be 
built by order of King Kenneth III. for confining the deer 
which he wiftied to drive from this country, to flock a deer 
park which he built in the brae of the Mearns, near his pa- 
lace of Kincardine. The wall of that park, it is faid, cart 
ftill be traced, and is called the Deers-dike. In this parifti 
part of the Kirktown farm is called Deer-hillock. At Eafter- 
Clune there are the fmall remains of a fquare tower, faid to 
have been built by Archbiftiop Rofs, who was proprietor 
of the place. It is univerfally agreed, that Eafter-Clune 
was a (hunting or) fummer-feat of one of the bilhops of 
Scotland, fome fay, St Andrew's, others, Dunkeld. — Befides 
the archbiftiop or biftiop to whom the tower belonged, and 
who was a native of Birfe, the parifh has given birth to 
lome others whofe names deferve to be mentioned. Dr Gil- 
bert Ramfay, late Reftor of Chrift's church, in the ifland of 
Barbadoes, was a native of this parifti. He mortified, under 
the patronage of Sir Alexander Ramfay of Balmain, Bart, 
and his heirs, L. 2000 Sterling, the intereft for the fupport 
of 4 ftudents of divinity ; L. 1200, the intereft for the fup- 
port of 4 ftudents of philofophy •, and L. 1000, the intereft 
to fupport a profeffor of the Oriental languages, all at the 
Marifchal college. His donations to this parifti are already- 
mentioned.

mentioned.— Dr Alexander Garden, late of Charleflown, 
South Carolina, eminent for his fkill as a phyfician, cele- 
brated alfo for his learning and polite converfation as a 
gentleman. lie was an American refugee, and caufed a 
marble monument, with an inscription in Latin, truly claf- 
fical, be eretted in the front of the church wall here, to the 
memory of the late worthy Mr Alexander Garden, his fa- 
ther, who was upwards of 50 years minifter of this parifli, 
and who died upwards of 90 years of age. — Dr Rofe of Birfe-

of Newmill, was many years at the head of a flourifhing 
academy which he had near London. — The famous George 
Rofe, Efq; of the treafury, is grandfon to the late Do- 
nald Rofe of Wener-Clune. Here we note, that many of the 
name of Rofs or Rofe, were proprietors once in Birfe ; of the 
name we have only now a few tenants. — Captain David 
Ochterlounie, mortally wounded at the firft attack made by 
General Wolfe on Quebec, when the Britifh were forced 
to retreat, and the Captain taken. So much was he the fa- 
vourite of the celebrated Wolfe, that he fent to the town 
to the Marquis de Montcalm, defiring that particular care 
mould be taken of the Captain. He died in two days. — A 
living character might be added, Dr William Farquharfon, 
phyfician in Edinburgh, famous for his addrefs in curing 
cancerous complaints. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiovs. — A rocky fubftance appears 
from Tillyfrulky to the river Feugh, which feems to have 
been in a fufible flate, and refembles the lava emitted by a 
volcano. It is near the furface of the ground.— There are 
two, fometimes three ale-houfes in the parifh ; the traveller 
has occafion to call at them, and the people do Hill tranfacl 
too much of their bufinefs in thefe and houfes of a fimilar 
fort.— None ever died for want.— In 1791, one family emi-

trees of all forts are certainly on the eftate of finzean, yet, 
among memy others, two remarkable trees grow, the one 
at Midltrath, and the other at Ballogie, which have defer- 
vedly been reforted to and admired by the curious. The 
one at Midftrath is afh, and meafures upwards of 20 feet in 
circumference at the ground, from 17 to 19 feet little above 
the ground. Its branches are as large as ordinary trees. It is 
vulgarly called the Maiden of Midftrath. The tree at Bal- 
logie is birch of the weeping fort ; fome think it 100 feet 
high, others only from 70 to 80. It has a ftraight flem of 
50 feet and upwards, and 5 feet in circumference through 
the whole. Many young trees of the above kind on the 
burn of Chattie, are in a fair way of equalling foon this 
beautiful one *. 

Vol. IX. R 

* To the north-eaft of Finzean, is a hill called the Gallow Hill. Ano- 
ther is near te Ballogie. There the Barons of old, who held their eftates 
with power of pit and gallows, put to death any of their tenants or de- 
pendents, who were fo unfortunate as to fall under their difpleafure. What 
blefled days do we now enjoy, in companion of thefe ? How thankful to 
God, and loyal to the King, ought we therefore to be ? Our cafe has 
been meliorated, and, by a wife Legiflature, will, by -degrees, be fo ftill. 
Were fome of the duty taken off the leather and the malt, this would 
greatlyieafe the fubjecT: in this corner. Were the landlords to grant long- 
er leafes, and be pleafed to take a moderate converfion for the multuj« 
paid to the mill, this would encourage the tenants to improve, and would 
wean them from the old unproductive mode of farming. Were allow- 
ance given them for the ftone-foot of their houfes, as well as for the tim- 
ber, which, by the by, is done in the land of Ballogie, this would induce

them to be at fome expenfe in building neat honfes, witnefs what is al- 
ready done in Monywell. Were allowance given for inclofing, (theparifh, 
for the moft part, being uninclofed), and were the inclofures protected by 
winter herding, ro which the heritor fliould bind them, this would be pa- 
tronizing the improver, and be productive of the moft beneficial effects. 
"Were care taken by all to improve the morals of themfelves, and all a-- 

Tound them, how happy and profperous might our land and people be ! 

As to the ftate of r. remote corner of this parilh, called the Foreft, or 
Glen-oirfe, in the year I 724, the firft inhabitant went to refide, and cul- 
tivate the ground there ; now there are 120 acres and odds under cultiva- 
tion, yielding upwards of L. 60 rent. There are 147 inhabitants. Being 
removed from the means of education, their children and young people, 
in number 37, are in great want of a teacher. In a neighbouring glen, 
called Glenchatt, there are near 50 inhabitants ; formerly only a few fa- 
milies. By the increafe in thefe glens, perhaps the population of the parifli 
is equal to what it was 30 or 40 years ago; though, in many places, there 
are fewer inhabitants, owing to the union of farms, &amp;c. Application has 
been made lately to the Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge, in 
behalf of the above glens, that a teacher may be nominated for them ; 
and we truft the Society will lend a favourable ear to our petition.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415852">KIN GOLD RUM</name>, 

(County of Forfar, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Meigle.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Badenach.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Climate, &amp;c. 

r I "HE origin of the name feems to be uncertain. It is 
-* faid to be derived from the Gaelic, and to fignify, 
" The Town between the Drums," This fignification is, 
at leaft, expreffive of the local fituatiori of the kirk and 
kirktown, which Hand between two drums or eminences, 
with the burn of Cromby running between them. The 
parilh is about 7 miles from N. to S. and %\ from E. to W. 
It is properly a hilly or mountainous diftrict, with fmall rivu- 
lets between the hills, in which there is good angling for 
trout. In the north part of the parilh the mountains rife 
to a confiderable height, efpecially Catlaw, whofe eleva- 
tion above the level of the fea, has been found, by baro- 
metrical menfuration, to be 2264 feet, and at the bafe of 
which, on the N.E, there is a chalybeate fpring, ufeful in 

weakoeues.

weaknefles. On Catlaw, and the adjoining mounta.- 
partly green, and partly heath, there is excellent pafture 
for flieep ; and Catlaw mutton is remarkable for its fupe- 
rior delicacy and flavour. There is but little flat land ; al- 
moft the whole of it doping gently with a north or fouth 
expofure. The climate is nearly the fame throughout the 
whole parifli, and any variation is owing to expofure and 
local lituation. Along the braes of Balfour and Baldovie, 
lying to the fouth, and flieltered with a rifing ground on 
the north, the air is rather milder and more temperate 
than in any other part of the parifli ; and both fpring 
and harveft fomewhat earlier. The air, however, in gene- 
ral is cold and fliarp, yet extremely healthy ; and to the 
falubrity of the air and the water, it may probably be ow- 
ing that agues never make their appearance. The preva- 
lent difeafes are fevers, colds, fore throats, and confump- 
tions. 

Soil, Produce, and Rent. — The foil is various : In fome 
places it is a kind of clay, cold and wet; in others a light 
fand ; but in general is a rich black mould. The principal 
crops are barley and oats. CM 7 late years wheat has been 
raifed in particular places, efpecially in the braes of Kenny 
and Baldovie, with great fuccefs. Turnip and potatoes, 
clover and rye-grafs, are common in every part of this pa- 
rifli. A fmall quantity of peafe is fown chiefly for fodder, 
and on every farm more or lefs flax feed, for domeftic ufes. 
More grain is railed than is confumed by the inhabitants ; 
a part of their barley is bought by a diftiller in the parifli, 
and the remainder, with the oats, wheat, and meal, are 
carried to the Dundee and the Kirrimuir markets. Both 
fpring and harveft are later than in the vale of Strathmore, 
to the fouth, owing to more frequent fliowers among the 
hills, and to a keener air in the narrow openings between

;ueni, than in a wide extended vale. The foil is in moft 
places of excellent quality, and climate only is wanting to 
render it extremely productive. The valued rent of the 
parifli is L. 2555 Scots ; the real rent about L. 1600 Ster- 
ling. Moil of the leafes were granted feveral years ago, 
and many of them are faid to be extremely reafonable. 
The arable acre is from 5s. to 18 s. and the number of ara- 
ble acres is between 3000 and 4000. There is no map of 
the parifli, nor can the wafte land and rough pafture be af- 
certained with any degree of precifion. There are 8 heri- 
tors, 1 of whom refides conftantly, and another occafion- 
aUy. 

Improvements. — Within the laft 20 years confiderable 
improvements have been made. The fituation is favour- 
able for manure, from being in the immediate vicinity of 
an inexhaultible fund of fliell marl, a part of which lies in 
the parifli, and belongs to the proprietor of Balfour, from 
which his own tenants have privilege, by their leafes, to 
any quantity which their improvements require. Befides 
laying out the fields in a regular manner, fallowing, and 
marling, feveral farms have been inclofed with fubttantiat 
ftone fences, an improvement which greatly enhances their 
value. Planting likewife is going on in different places, 
and in particular upon the eftate of Captain Wedderbura 
of Pearfie, where, befides a confiderable portion of the ara- 
ble land being inclofed, there are plantations to a great ex- 
tent. A good deal of attention has alfo been paid to the 
breeding of horfes and cattle, as well for fale as for private 
ufe, and the breed of both has of late years been much im- 
proved. Upon the eftate of Pearfie, cattle, bred out of 
froall highland cows, have arifen, from the richnefs of the 
pafture to fuch a fize, as to bring L. 10, L.12, and fome- 

times 



*34 Statijlical Account 

times L. 15 a head, for turnip-feeding, or heavy car- 
riages. 

Antiquities. — On a hill culled the Schurroch, to the weft- 
ward of the church, there are in three different places, e- 
qually diftant from each other, feveral large (tones, ere&amp;ed 
in a circular form, called here Druds altars, which is evi- 
dently a conuption of Druids alters, and mows them to 
have been places of Pagan worihip. Upon the top of ano- 
ther hill, called Catlaw, already mentioned, which bounds 
this pari;h on the north, there is a very large cairn of 
ftonei, in a circular form alfo; but whether ufed as a place 
of worihip, or of obfervation, from whence fignals were 
given to the couniry, on the approach of an enemy, is un- 
certain. The cai'tle of Balfour, formerly the principal re- 
lidence of Ogilvy of Balfour, an ancient family, and a de- 
pendent of the family of Airly, has fome claim to anti- 
quity. As there is no date to be feen upon any part of 
the walls, which are (till Handing, it is not generally known 
in what year it was built: The ftru£ture is evidently in 
the Gothic (tyle and, from fadts connected with it, about 
which there is no uncertainty, mull be upwards of 200 
years old, and might probably have been e reeled about the 
middle of the 161b century. The family of Balfour is 
funk into the family of Fotheringham, and Colonel Fothe- 
ringham of Pourie, by the female line, is proprietor of the 
eftate of Balfour, the molt extenlive, and the belt land of 
any in the parilh. 

Population, ISc. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls was then 780. The population is dimi- 
nifhing. The prefent number is about 600,. Of whom are 
18 or 20, who are Epifcopalians ; and 2 men and 1 wo- 
man, who are beceders. The number of families is 129.

No manufactures are carried on in the parilh. There 
are but few tradefmen of any delcription, and thefe few 
are employed for parochial purpofes ; almoft all the reft 
of the inhabitants being engaged in the operations of huf- 
bandry. The decreafe of population, as above ftated, is 
owing partly to the union of farms, and partly to tradef- 
men and fmaller tenants removing to villages and fea-port 
towns, from intereft or convenience. In confequence of 
this decreafe, together with the flourilhing Hate of manu- 
factures in Angus, the wages of labouring fervants have a- 
rifen in a quadruple ratio y within the laft 40 years *. 

Stipend^ 

* For example, the beft ploughman in this parifli, and perhaps in the 
Braes of Angus, could have been hired about 40 years ago, for L. 2, or 
L. 2, 5s. in the year; whereas good ploughmen are receiving at prefent, 
from L. 8 to L. 9 The rife in the wages of women fervants, day labou- 
rers, and harveft reapers, is in the fame proportion ; and, for the laft ten 
years, has been more rapid than in any period of the fame extent, within 
the 40. The farmer is however enabled to meet this advance of the price 

of

Stipend, Poor, Wc— The ftipend is 82 £ bolls viftua!, 
and L. 22 : 8 : 3 T fl T money, beiides a manfe and glebe of a- 
bout 4 acres. The church was originally a parfonage, be- 
longing to the Abbey of Arbroath ; and the greater part 
of the prefent ftipend is payable from abbey-lands in that 
neighbourhood. Towards the end of the 12th, or in the 
beginning of the 13th century, a donation of the parifli 
was made to the abbey by Sir Allan Durward of Len- 
trathen, and this donation is faid to have been confirmed 
by a charter from the Hoftiary of Scotland, of date 1253. 
From the time of the donation by Sir Allan Durward, un- 
til fome years after the middle of the 16th century, the 
lands of Kingoldrum continued in the pofleflion of the Ab- 
bey, and about the year 1565, the greater part of them is 
faid to have been feued cum decimis inclujis. The burden 
of the ftipend continued ftill to fall upon the Abbey, and 
after the erection of the Abbey into a temporal lordmip, it 
devolved upon the titular of the tithes. The confequence 
of which was, that, by the decreet of provifion, dated in 
the year 1635, more than one half of the prefent ftipend 
was allocated upon abbey-lands in the neighbourhood of 
Arbroath, from which it continues to be payable to the 
minifter of Kingoldrum till this day. — In a parifti in which 
there is no village, and fcarce any houfeholders who have 
not fome employment adequate to their fuftenance, there 
cannot be many who (land in need of alms. The number

whom are heads of families, and receive a weekly allow- ^ 
ance. Befides collections in the church on tiie Sundays, 
there is a confiderable fund belonging to the poor, the in- 
tereft of which, together with the weekly collections, is 
fufficient for every purpofe of parochial charity. In the 
year 1782, the year in which the prefent incumbent was 
ordained, it does not appear that the number of poor in- 
creafed, and the only difference between that and other 
years, feems to have been a more liberal difburfement to 
fuch as were already upon the roll. 

Manners, &amp;c. — Plainnefs of manners and honefty in their? 
dealings, characterize the inhabitants of this diilricT:. In 
their feveral occupations they are induftrious, and at the 
fame time carry on their bufinefs without noife and without 
feuds. Many of them are in eafy circumftances, and all 
live within their income. Their ftature is about the mid- 
dle lize ; their food plain, and they poffefs all the fpirit and 
activity of Highlanders. In profemon they are Prefbyte- 
rians, and well attached to the family on the throne. If 
their zeal is temperate, it is not the lefs real ; want of enthu-- 
fiafm being no proof of indifference, but, on the contrary, of 
foundnefs in principle. Whether the parilh has produced 
any eminent men, either in fcience or in arms, is uncertain ; 
it is faid, however, to have given birth, to a famous actrefs 
on the Englifh ftage.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4667159">ABERNYTE</name>, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Dundee.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Adamson.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, and Soil. 

ABernyte is evidently of Gaelic origin, referring to the 
fituation of the village, near the confluence of two ri- 
vulets, one of which had probably obtained the name of 
Nyte. It is nearly equally diftant from the towns of Perth 
and Dundee ; and is entirely lituated in thofe hills that rife 
gradually from the Carfe of Gowrie, to the top of the ridge 
of Dunfinnan. The higheft point of which, called King's 
feat, is 1050 feet above the level of the fea, and is in this 
parifti. The mod cultivated part of the parifti lies 700 or 
800 feet lower, and is diftant from the frith of Tay in a 
right line about 3 miles. This parifti forms a kind of irre- 
gular oval, becoming very narrow at each end ; its great- 
eft length little more than 3 miles, its greateft 
breadth about 2 •, the valley, abont half a mile in length, 
in which the village is fituated, and the braes on the fides 
of it, are of a light, dry, fertile foil, lying upon a bed of 

coarfe 



of Abernyte. 



139 



coarfe gravel, or rather rotten moor ftone. The grounds 
higher up, of a deep, loofe, poor foil, and partly of mortar, 
or coarfe till, oil a bed of wet gravel. Toward the tops of 
the hills the foil is thin and rocky, producing little but 
coarfe grafs, mixed with heath. The number of acres in 1 
the parifti cannot be accurately afcertained, but is eftima- 
ted at 1600. 

Heritors and Rent. — The parifti is divided among 4 heri- 
tors, 1 of whom poffefles more than half of it ; none of 
them refide. The valued rent is L. 11 26 : 13 : 4 Scots, 
and the real rent about L. 830 Sterling. The farms are 
let either at a fixed fum for the whole farm, or at a certain 
value the acre ; fo that the rent of different kinds of foil 
cannot be accurately ftated, every farm containing fome 
portion of hill or moor ground. The valley in which the 
village and church ftand, is let at L. 1 Sterling the acre, be- 
ing divided into fmall poffeffions. 

Climate, Difeafes. — The air, as in other hill countries, is 
dry and cold ; feed time and harveft, later than in the low 
grounds of the Carfe of Gowrie. Oats and peafe are fown 
from the end of March to the middle of April ; potatoes 
and flax in the end of April ; barley from the ift to the 
end of May ; turnips in the beginning of July ; wheat from 
the end of September to the middle of November. Wheat is 
generally reaped about the end of Auguft ; the harveft of the 
other crops fucceeds foon after. In the higher and moorifh 
part of the parifti, it is often the end of November before 
all is got in. No epidemic difeafes have been remarkable 
for their ravages in this parifti, except thofe common every 
where among children. The people have very lately be- 
gun to permit inoculation for the fmall pox. About 40 
years ago, fome people entertained an idea, that the hill

Statijiical Account 



country was lefs healthy than the low wet land of the 
Carfe. The reverfe is now undoubtedly the facl: here 5 for 
fome years paft in the fpring, a rufh fever has vifited the low 
grounds on each fide of the hills, viz. The Carfe and Strath- 
more, and carried off numbers •, very few, however, of the 
inhabitants of this parilh were infected, and none died. Of 
epidemic difcafes, it may be remarked, jhat agues, which 
fome years ago appeared in great numbers, both in high 
and low grounds, have now entirely vanifhed. This has 
been attributed to the draining of wet lands, and more nou- 
rifhi ng diet of the people. I have been affured, that 30 
years ago, if a farmer in the fpring wanted 4 of his cot- 
tagers for any piece of work, he generally ordered 6, 
knowing the probability that fome of them, before the 
work could be tinifhed, would be rendered unfit for labour, 
by an attack of the ague. Rheumatifms, called emphati- 
cally the pains, prevail in this diflrict., as in mod places of 
Scotland. The moft general difeafe, however, in this di- 
{[r'i£t, and particularly in this parifh, is fcrofula ; not a fa- 
mily of moft of the indigenous inhabitants of the lower ranks 
is free from it. Some labourers in this parifh are at pre- 
fenc deprived by it of the power of earning their fubfift- 
ence. This evil feems rather to be on the increafe, from the 
carelefsnefs of the people themfelves, and the intermar- 
riages of the unfound with the healthy. 

Population. — According to the return made to Dr Web- 
fter, the number of fouls was then 258. The population, 
though now nearly the fame as at the beginning of the cen- 
tury, has decreafed confiderably within thefe 20 years. 
The number of inhabitants, on iff. January 1792, was 345; 
of examinable perfons, u e. above 8 years of age, 276.

The great number of deaths in 1784 and 1791, was ow- 
ing to the natural fmall pox. — The average number of 
births, at the beginning of the century, is 11. 5. At that 
period, the regiiter of marriages and deaths is very inac- 
curate ; 1 have therefore taken no average of them. The 
whole number of houies at preient is 73 ; fo that the num- 
ber to a family is 4.7. The proportion of births to the 
whole number, is - - I in 28.75 

of deaths, - - 1 in 49 

of marriages, - 1 in 49.2 

To afcertain the population at the beginning of the cen- 
tury, we may take 12:345:: 11.5: 330.6. It appears that 
the method mentioned for afcertaining the real ftate of 
population, of multiplying births by 26, and deaths by 36, 
would give an inaccurate ftate of the numbers of this pa- 

rifh.

To afcertain the population,' we may take 12:345 
:: 15.7 : 451.3. The examination-roll was 367. There- 
fore 276 : 345 :: 362 : 456.8. It appears then that this 
has decreafed at leaft 100. To confirm this account, 
it may be added that two villages, which then confided of 
60 houfes, have now only 3c •, that another, which had 8 
or 9, has now only one ; though, to compenfate this lofs in 
part, fome new houfes have lately been built in different fi- 
tuations. Depopulation was produced here, by the fame 
means Which brought it about in other places, the expul- 
fion of cottagers. Their difufe, however, arofe here from 
a caufe different from the common one ; in general, it pro- 
ceeded from the enlargement of farms, and junction of fe- 

vcral

veral into one. Here, by the diminution and feparation 
of farms. Previous to 1769, the whole eftate of Aber- 
nyte, which is more than half the parilh, was let to four 
farmers, who poffeffed their arable" lands in the old itate of 
run-ridge, and held their grafs in common. A divifion 
was then made, and the eftate fph't into five farms of a 
larger kind, and 8 or 10 of fmaller dimenfions. The te- 
nants of this laft order, being generally manufacturers, with 
large families, managed their little farms without the afiift- 
ance of any fervants. And the others preferred unmarried 
fervants, who, living in the houfe, were conftantly under 
their eye, to cottagers ; who having families at home, were 
fuppofed to pay more attention to them than was confillent 
with their mafter's interefl. Another caufe that has affect- 
ed population in fome degree, is the non-refidence of fome 
farmers, and the inclofing and turning into grafs a large 
farm, which has now upon it neither farmer nor fervant. 
In a large diftridt the operation of thefe caufes would be 
fcarce felt ; but in a fmall parifh like this, their erFefts are 
more confpicuous. There is fcarce a place in the parifh. 
now that deferves the name of a village. Three hamlets 
, contain among them 41 houfes. The other houfes are 
fcattered through the parifh ; many of them ftand fingly, 
a few of them in pairs or greater numbers. All the inha- 
bitants are natives of Scotland. There are 88 married per- 
fons ; 13 widows and 3 widowers; males above 8 years, 
126; females, 150; males below 8, 39; females, 30.

Agriculture y 



*44 Statical Account 

Agriculture, r.-Very confidence improvements have 
taken place in this pari/h within thefe 20 or 30 years. One 
* them I already hinted at, the abolilhing the mn-ridge 
iyltem. The mcon veniencies. of the old iyilem, an d its in- 
fluence in retarding improvement, are very obvious. But 
indeed the genius of the country at that, time was little di- 
rected to this important objecl. Proprietors farming their 
own lands made as little progrefs as the oppreffed tenant. 
About 20 years ago, a new fpirit feemed to arife in all this 
part of the country. Improvements took place every 
where. Certain circumftances in the fituation of this pa- 
rifh retarded their progrefs among us for fome years. One 
of the moft powerful of thefe circumftances, was the fhort 
leafes given to the tenants. Many farms were held only 
by the year. This, however, was lately remed : ed in fome 
degree, and leafes for 19 years granted through all the pa- 
rifh. Improvement followed of courfe, furze and broom 
were grubbed up on the hills, and the land ploughed for 
the firft time ; bogs were drained, and pafture and outfield 
grounds brought into more perfect cultivation. There is 
ftill much outfield ground in the higher part of the parifh. 
One farm is divided into 15 acres infield, and 125 outfield, 
befides moor grounds. The means of improvement here 
are green crops, particularly artificial graffes, fallowing and 
lime. A little marl was ufed fome years ago, but it is now- 
all exhaufted; within a convenient diftar.ee, lime is pre- 
ferred as a more ftimulating manure, while it is lefs perni- 
cious to the foil, marl having been found to exhauft the 
ground very completely in a fhort time. Lime is procu- 
red from Polgavie, a harbour on the Tay, about 4 miles 
diftant. It is brought chiefly from the frith of Forth and 
Sunderland, and fome fmall quantities from Newburgh, on 
the other fide of the Tay. It is purchafed at the harbour 
at the following prices: Newburgh, the boll barley mea-

wheat meafure, is. 6d. The, general allowance the acre, 
25 bolls barley meafure, or 34 of wheat meafure. Lime is 
lanl on with a crop of wheat or barley. The manner of 
ploughing uniformly is with two horfes and one man ; the 
plough is the common Englifh. No cattle are ufed in huf- 
bandrv in any p :rc of the parifh. The number of ploughs 
is 31, of cans 35. No rotation of crops can be faid to be 
obferved in this parifh. They endeavour to have wheat e- 
very 4th year, for which they prepare the ground by fallow, 
peafe, potatoes, or by a half fallow after flax. The quantity 
of grain produced cannot be ftated with precifion. Number 
of acres fown with wheat about 70 ; peate 20; potatoes 12 
or 14; flax 16; turnip 14; grafs 70; bailey about 120 j 
oats is the principal crop, but it is impoffihle to Rate the 
number of acres, as that varies every year as the feafon 
may fuit for breaking up outfield grounds. Litile barley is 
fown in outfield, and bear is not cultivated. Various fpe- 
cies of wheat have been introduced here from the Carfe, 
but the Scots white wheat is chiefly cultivated, having from 
its hardnefs been found mofl: fu'ited to the climate. The 
oats ufed are the common white, a few parcels of black and 
grey in the outfields, and foine eaily Dutch in rich foils. 
Several experiments have been made with other kinds of 
early oats, with larger grains, but none have turned out fo 
profitable as thefe, which often produce 10 bolls the acre. 
The general produce of an acre may be eftimated, of wheat, 
barley and infield oats, about 7 bolls each ; outfield oats 4 ; 
peafe 3. Peafe are not fown for the crop, but merely as a 
mean of melioration. The kind commonly ufed is an ear- 
ly black. Beans are very feldom attempted. Flax pro- 
duces 25 ftones the acre ; quantity fown is 10 pecks the 
acre. I he feed is generally favecl ; though little of it is fit 
for lowing again, it brings about is. the peck for the oil- 
VoL - 1X - T mills.

mills. It is to be obferved, that the firlot, both barley and 
wheat is a Scotch pint larger than the ftandard, This may 
be in fome degree owing to a privilege poffeffed by the burgh 
Of Dundee, of taking a ladleful from every boll delivered in 
the town or at the harbour—About 80 young cattle are 
reared annually, which are fold at the ag e of 2 or 3 years 
Very few are fed in the parifh. Eight or 10 young horfes 
are annually bred. The number of horfes is 86 ; of milk 
cows 122 ; the cattle here are of a fmall breed, frum 15 to 
30 (lone; there are now no fheep kept,- within thefe 4 q 
years, there were two confiderabie flocks, whofe walks have 
been converted into tillage, or occupied by black cattle, ta 
, Which r coarfe pafture is better adapted". 

Mannfi&amp;ures, IVages, Prices, &amp;c— From the ftate of the 
cultivation of the parifh, it is evident, that numbers of

from ao to 30 yards a day. In the parifh are 3 mills, a 
for corn, and 1 for flax. One of the mills only has thiN 
lage, which is not very extenfive, nor are the multures 
heavy, amounting on infucken or grain thirled to a 1 5th 
part of the meal produced, on outfucken, to a 20th. Flax 
is fcutched at 18 d. the ftone. On a fmall ftream called 
Tidyad, which feparates this parifli from Longforgan, there 
are, within the fpace of a mile, 9 mills, 4 of which are for 
flax, 2 others within the fame fpace were lately pulled 
down, as they flood within a piece of ground laying out 
for pleafure ground *. 

Living 

* The wages in this diftrict are, for a labourer, 8 d. or 9 d. with his 
victuals ; from Is. to I s. 4d. without ; when engaged by the feafon for 
threfhlng, 9 d. the boll. There is yet only one threfliing-mill in the pa- 
rifli. Wages of a wright, 1 s. 4 d. ; of a tailor, 8 d. with victuals. Out- 
work is generally done by the piece. Wages of a man fervant, from L. 8 
to L. 10 a-year ; provilions to thofe who do not eat in the houfe, 16 pound 
of oat-meal the week, and 6 d. for milk, Or a cow among two or three ; of 
women fervants. from L. 3 to L. 3, lo s. which are not paid wholly in 
money, but partly in certain perquifites called bountiths. Women not 
engaged in fervipe, are employed in fpinning yarn for linens and thread. 
For fpinning, they receive from 1 s." a d. to 1 s. 5 d. the fpindle, of which 
they fpin a half one the day. It appears from Boetius, that linen was very 
early a confiderable manufacture at Dundee, and it ftili continues the 
ftaple of this country. A woman's hire for weeding, is 5 d. with victuals,, 
or 8 d. without ; in harveft, 9 d. and 10 d. ; in harveft, a man's 1 s. Th« 
common practice is to hire for a whole harveft, when a man receives from 
L. 1 to L. 1, 5 s. ; a woman, from 15 s. to 1 8 s. A harveft lafls from 3 to 
5 weeks. In the Carfe, where the harveft is earlier, and of fliorter dura- 
tion, they have frequently finilhed before we begin here. Hence it is 
no uncommon thing for a perfon to reap two harvefts, and in the courfe 
«f 5 or 6 weeks to earn, a man L. 2, 10 s. and a woman L. 1, 10 s. fhe 
provifions for reapers uniformly in this country, are bread and ale for din- 
ner ; they are allowed fomewhat more than a pound of oat-bread, and 3 
mutchkins of ale.— -The prices of provifions have been doubled here with- 
in thefe 20 years. Butchers meat is from 3 d. to 4 d. the pound; a fowl,

Livinq of the People. — No luxurious mode of living has 
yet obtained among any clafs in this parifli. To the farmer, 
the farm or the parifli fupplies aimoft every dainty except 
fugar and tea. Seldom any fpirit is uied but whilky. The 
wages earned by labourers, compared with the price of 
provifions, point out that the rearing of a family cannot be 
attended with great difficulty. There has not been an in- 
ftance of a family applying for relief to the feffion when 
the parents were in health. The ftaple provifion among 
the labouring clafs is here, as in aimoft all Scotland, oat- 
meal. Very little meal of peafe or barley is now eaten, 
while wheat flour is daily coming more into ufe. Every pea- 
fant poffeffes a milk cow, which, if he rent no land, cofts 
about L. i, 10 s. a-year. Great part of this clafs occupy 
an acre or two of land, and thus fupply themfelves with 
milk at lefs perceptible expenfe. From Auguft to April, 
potatoes in a great meafure are fubftituted for oat-meal, to 
which they add a little falt-meat. In fpring and fummer 
they fcarce tafte butcher- meat, except a little unfed veal, 
which fells from i4 d. to 2 d. the pound. Since fo much 
attention was paid to breeding cattle, this article of pro- 
vifion is become fcarcer. Tea and fugar are little ufed by 
this clafs of people, though they are daily becoming more 
falhionable. Their chief luxuries are fnuff, tobacco and 
w hi Iky ; the ufe of whilky has become very great. In 
this fmall parifli there are two licenfed, befides fome pri- 
vate 

from 4 s. 6 d. to 5 s. 6 d. the ftone. The price of wheat is commonly a- 
bout 6 d. or 1 s. above, and barley 1 s. below the Haddington market. 
Oat-meal from 10 d. to 1 s. 1 d the peck. The price of grain from this, 
country, in the Canal and other markets, to which it is exported, has 
been much hurt of late by the injudicious practice among fame buyers, 
of mixing in the fame cargo the fine large full grain of low rich foils, with 
the lean light fluff from the hills. This parifh raifes a great deal more 
provifion than ferves itfelf. The overplus is difpofed of in the markets of 
Perth, Cupar in Angus, and Dundee, chiefly in die laft.

vate retailers. It has not, however, produced hitherto 
any very lentible alteration on the conftitution and morals 
of the people. Perhaps, in a hill country, and where, by 
the permiilion of finall Hills, there is little temptation to 
adulterate the fpirit, its efFefts may be lefs deleterious. 
T'n^ ufe of tobacco may almoft be Lid to be exceffive, e- 
fpccially among the female fex; there is fcarce a young 
woman, by the time me has been taught to fpin, but has 
alfo lt-arnt to fmoke. Smoking feems to have been intro- 
duced here as an antidote to rheumatifm and ague; the 
favourable alteration, however, with refpefi to thefe dif- 
eales, has produced only a greater avidity for this indul- 
gence. Fuel is not an expenfive article. In fummer the 
peaiantry burn only broom and furze, which they fre- 
quently have for the cutting, at all times for a fmall price_ 
The light lands in the hills, after being a year or two out 
of tillage, are over-run with broom. Indeed, about 43 
years ago, when the exceffive badnefs of the roads render- 
ed the tranfportation of fuel difficult, it was reckoned no 
inconfiderable improvement to fow out light lands with 
broom for fuel. In winter they burn turf and coals, which 
lalt fell at Polgavie from 3 s. 6 d. to 4 s. the boll, of 800 
wt. We have no peats. Coals are found the cheapen: 
fuel; but the badnefs of the roads renders the carriage dif- 
ficult. Hitherto the roads in this pariih, being a fmall one, 
and having no refident heritor, have been much neglecled. 
Now that the principal roads are making by tolls, it is to 
be hoped, that the crofs roads will be attended to, without 
which this great improvement will be of no ufe to the hill 
country. To render the conveyance of coal and lime 
more eafy, it was lately propol'ed to cut a canal from the 
Tay to the foot of the hills about Baledgarno, about half 
a mile below this. This ufeful projecl, however, feems at 
prefent to be dropt. A canal would undoubtedly be of 
3 great 



Statiflical Account 



great advantage to this diftria, to the town of Cupar Ifi 
Angus, and to great part of the back country, where they 
are obliged to fetch their coal and lime from Perth or Dun- 
dee, at a much greater diftance than the head of the in- 
tended canal would be. The little expenfe that would be 
incurred in cutting a canal through a countiy almoft per- 
fectly level, would very foon be repaid by a trifling 
duty. 

Stipend, School, Poor, is?c. — The living confifts of 27 bolls 
of barley, 2 of wheat, and 4 of oat-meal, and L. 365 
Scots. Part of the ftipend is paid out of certain funds be- 
longing to the Cathedral of Dunkeld. A grant for L. 42 
was procured from the Crown in 1744, to be divided a- 
mong the minilk-rs of Dunkeld, Bervie and Abernytej 
but from the manner in which the money is collected, they 
are able to realize only about 8 guineas each. -The whole 
ftipend may be worth L. 62. The glebe con lifts of about 
10 acres, one half of which is rocky pafture ground. The 
King is patron. — The fchoolmafter's falary is only 100 
merks Scots, with a houfe and garden. The fcholars may 
amount to 30. The fees are, for reading, 1 s. for writing, 
arithmetic and latin, 1 s. 6 d. ; the whole living, including 
feffion -clerk's emoluments, does not amount to L. 15 a- 
year. — The average number of poor maintained by the 
parifh is 3 or 4. The fund for fupporting them arifes from 
contributions on Sundays, and fome fmall fees for the ufe 
of the pall, &amp;c. The annual amount of the collections 
and fees is about L. 13. This fund is more than fufficient 
for the maintenance of the poor, and .has been accumu- 
lating for feveral years paft. No perfon belonging to the 
parifh is permitted to beg. The poor, in general, earn 
fome part of their own fubfiftence, though there are occa- 
fionally fome whofe whole fupport muft be derived from

the parifli. It mould be obferved, that the whole of the 
fund cannot be laid out upon the poor ; every feffion umft

more than they uiually do to their clerk, who, in all country 
parilhes, is alfo the fchoolmalter, as the landed proprietors 
in Scotland i'eera determined to oppofe the juft claims of 
this molt ufelul body of men to fome increafe of fala-

* In 1782-3, this parifh fhared with the reft of the country, in the late- 
aefs and fcantinefi of the crops. But the feiTion's fund was found fuffi- 
eient for the additional claims then made upon them, and this parilh de. 
clined accepting any of the Government bounty given to the North of 
Scotland ; though fome of the more opulent parilhes in the neighbour- 
hood claimed their lhare. The year 1740- 1 feems, from all tradition, to 
have been more diltre'img to the poor than 1 7S2-3. The country itfelf 
produced a much fmaller quantity of grain. That moft ufeful vegetable, 
potato, was unknown ; manufactures were in a much lefs flourilhing 
ftate ; and cattle, the ftaple commodity of this country, at that time bore no- 
price ; a cow or y.ung ox, now worta L. 5 Sterling, felling then for L. io-, 
er L, iz Scots. It appears, from tradition, and our feffton record, that 
mucu of the peoples diurels here, arofe from want of employment ; which- 
difablcd them from purchaling meal, though fold at a lower price than 
in 1 783. The heritors of this parilh. according to a general order of the. 
county met twice, to conlider the ftate of the poor, and of the fund 
for their fupport. The feflion's fund was found adequate to the relief of 
the neceilitous, during the whole of that fevere feafon. This fund they 
expended in purchafing oat-meal, which they diftributed according to the 
wants of families, allowing 8 pound the week to young perfons, and thofe 
unable to work. " They appointed alfo lint to be bought, and given up- 
" to thofe women that are c. -fable of fpnning, that they may p.irilj work 
" for their own livelihood." I have quoted thefe words of the record, 
becaufe they evince, cither that the art of fpinning was not univerlally prac- 
tifed, q| that fome number had been difabled from working. The rirft is 
moft likely. This extract Ihows alfo the low ftate of the manufacture at 
that time. A woman is now able not only to earn her fubfiftence by 
fpinning, but to fave money. The flax was then bought, that they might 
fart/y work for their livelihood. Yarn then fold for lefs than the fpin-

CharaBer of the People.— AM the inhabitants belong to 
the Eftablilhed Church, except i Unitarian, i family of 
Epifcopals, and i of Biptifts. There are few diftrifts in 
Scotland that have been Ids dirturbed by religious diffennons 
than the Carfe of Gowrie. From Perth to the extremi- 
ty of the county towards Dundee, a populous diitrid of 
18 miles in length, and 5 or 6 in breadth, there are but 
1 meeting houfes for feparatifts, each of which has but a 
fmall flock. The inhabitants of this diftricl: were much 
reproached by the zealots of M century, for their fupinenefs 
and carlefTnefs about their controverfies ; though the people 
here are moderate, they are not juftly reproached with in- 
attention to religion ; in general they attend its fervices 
well. The people are indufbious and peaceable, though 
unrefined in their manners. Few have been known to in- 
lilt in the army, fewer have entered into the navy, none 

belonging 

ning of it now colls. Wheels for two hands, now nniverfally ufcd in this 
•ountry, were not then introduced. Wheels of any kind, indeed were 
little ufed. The rock and fpindle were the only inftruments for manu- 
facturing yarn. — Another circumftance, in the record, points out the 
great (traits to which the people were reduced. It is well known what 
zeal the people of Scotland at that time cheriihed for a ftrict oblervation 
of the Sabbath ; yet, fix or feven of the people having, in the beginning 
of harveft, got in fome early parcels of grain, united in fetting the mill a- 
going, that they might have meal for immediate ufe. The feuion were 
under the neceflity of taking cognifance of this breach of the Lord's day. 
And the miller having ftated to them, that he never let on the mill on 
— the Lord's day, but for the behoof of fuch people as reprefented to him 
" that they could get ne 'tht r tned to buy nr borro-v, $wd h-ul 
and the people alio having declared that they were in ablblute want, the 
feflion found them not deferving of cenfure. Among this group of cul- 
prits, was Mr Alexander Nicol, at that time fchoolmnfter of this parilh. 
He, at that time, was much regarded as a poet in this corner, and fuffered 
the proverbial lot of that unfortunate race. He publilhed two fmall vo- 
lumes, chiefly in the Scottilh dialect. The firft called Nature without 
Art, and the other the Rural Mufe. He was afterwards tranflated t« 
Coilace.

belonging to this parilh has ever been the fubjeft of a cri- 
minal trial. One perfon only has emigrated to America. 
There is no record of any murder having happened in the 
parifh; tradition mentions 1 filicide about 50 years ago. 
Belief in the power of fpells and charms ftill prevails here 
in a great degree ; they attribute power to them only in in- 
ternal diioruus, and fome chronical difeafes. A know- 
ledge of them is confined to a few families. The recourfe 
of the people to remedies of this kind is lefs to be wonder- 
ed at, as they are always adminiittred gratuitoufly, and 
many of them are at a diltance from a regular practitioner 
in phytic. It mult be a considerable time before every 
fpecies of fuperftition be eradicated from the minds of 
people, who coniider every thing as facred that has been 
ianctioned by the belief of their fathers. 

Curiofities and Antiquities. — There is a water fall at the 
head of a den, whofe depth is about 50 or 60 feet perpen- 
dicular. This den continues for about half a mile, when 
it lofes itfelf in the Carfe of GoWrie, at the village of Ba- 
ledgarno, in the parifh of Inchture. In this den Mr Gray, 
fome years ago, attempted to open a Copper mine; but 
though he found fome ore, it was not judged woith work- 
ing. On the edge of this den, King Edgar of Scotland 
built a caftle, to overawe a powerful body of robbers, who 
then infeited the country. No veftige ot the building now 
remains : a farm-houie, built upon the fite, ftill retains the 
name of the caftle. Upon the top of a hill, called Glenny- 
law, are two cairns ; and a few years ago there was ano- 
ther in the glebe, under which a few bones were found. 
Thefe are faid to have been railed in confequence of a bat- 
tle between two powerful families, the Grays of Foulis and 
the Boyds of Pitkindie, in this parifh, in which the latter 
were victorious. On the fame hill is one of thofe circles,

called Druidical, confuting now only of feven ftoncs. And 
m Stockmuir, about a mile from this one, there is another 
of nine ftones ; both have confifted of more ; three or four 
hive been taken from the firft not long ago. In a few- 
years, there will be no veftige of either. This laft is Situ- 
ated juft at the loot of Dunfinnan Hill, on which was the 
refidence of the famous Macbeth. The fite of his caflle 
was admirably chofen for a place of defence, being a coni- 
cal rifing on the weft end of the hill, almoft inaccefliblcex- 
' cept on one fide. The excellence of its fituation had be- 
fore pointed it out to Kenneth III. and other Kings, as a fe- 
cure place of refidence. The fite of the caftle is w ithin 
the pariih of Collace — Upon the top of King's-feat, ano- 
ther part of the fame hill, in this parifti, there is the ruin of 
a circular incloiure, fimilar to Macbeth's caftle, but much 
fmaller. This, as it commanded a more extenfive profpecl 
than the caftle itfelf, taking in befide a vaft extent of coun- 
try, great part of the fea-coaft, from the mouth of the frith 
of Forth to the South Elk, probably was a watch-tower 
or out-poft ; and, from this circumftance, had received its 
name. So prevalent is the notion, that all great atchieve- 
mcnts in former times, were performed by men of fuperior 
fize and ftrength, that Macbeth's caftle, though the hiftory of 
it is fo well known, is called by no other name, among 
the vulgar, than the Giants Houle.

PARISH of <name ref="NA">BIRNIE</name>, 

(County of Elgin, Synod of Moray, Presbytery 

of Elgin.) 

By the Rev. Mr Joseph Anderson.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

THIS parifh was named Brenutb about the beginning of 
the 13th century: A name probably derived from 
Brae-nut, i. e. " High land abounding in nuts for many 
hazle trees once grew upon the fides of the hills and banks 
of the rivulets, and the general appearance of the parilh is 
hilly. The natives pronounce it Bum-nigh, i. e. " A vil- 
lage near the burn or river." This etymology is defciip- 
tive enough of the particular place now called Birnie. The 
remoteft houfe is 7 miles from Elgin, where the port goes 
thrice eaft and welt every week. The figure of the parilh 
is irregular, but comes neareft to an oval fhape ; the dis- 
tance from the N. to the S. extremity being about 5 miles t 
and from the E. to the W. about 2. 

Surface and Soil. — The greateft part of the furface confift- 
ing of feveral high hills covered with heath, makes in ge- 
neral 



Statijlical Account 



neral a bleak rugged appearance ; the cultivated foil, how- 
ever, in the valleys, and on the fides of hills, and the 
feveral falls of water in the rocky channel of the rivulets, 
have formed fome beautifully diverfified fcenes. The un- 
cultivated foil confills of moor and peat mofs, with fome 
interjacent plots of green paiture. The arable land in ge- 
neral is fandy, mallow, ftony and fteep, lying either on a 
bed of rock, or of compacted gravel. Some fields contigu- 
ous to the Loflle, confift of loam either upon a clayifti or 
fandy bed. Several plots of a mofly and moorj nature are 
to be found both among the high and low lands. 

Rivulets, \3c. — The parifli is adorned with the three ri- 
vulets of Lennock, Barden and Rulhcroock, which flow in- 
to the river Loflie. Ihe Loflie taking its rife in the parifli 
of Ediakillie, and gliding through Dallas, begins at its con- 
fluence with the burn of Lennock, to run by part of the 
weft fide, and then through the north end of this parilh, 
and after a courfe of about 18 miles from its origin to its 
mouth, flows into the fea at the harbour of Loflie-mouth. 
The river abounds in burn trouts and eels. Some falmon, 
finnacs *, and white trouts fwim up the river about Lam- 
mas, which give fine diverfion to the angler. The mod 
remarkable inundations happened in the years 1768 and 
1782. Three-fourths of the farm of Over-bogs have been 
deftroyed by land floods, which have hurled from the hills 
an immenfe quantity of ftones and fand, and left them upon 
that plain field, where the river fometimes parts into two 
or three ftreams. 

Climate. — 

* Finnacs are a fpecies of fifli in colour and tfiape like a falmon. They 
weigh from z lb. to 4 th. White trouts are of a lefs fize, but of a whiter 
colour. They are fuppofed to be two fpecies of fea trouts. In April, 
flioals of the fry of each fpecies fwim down to the fea, from which they 
do not return fooner than July.

Climate— Ite is P ure alon S the banks ° f the L ° ffie ' 
but rather moid among the hills. They rife to a confidet- 
a bl- hei- ht above the Lottie, and attratf more fhowers than 
the iow land. The inhabitants, however, in each of thefe 
puces, are equally healthful, and free from any diforders, 
but fuch as are common all over this country. 

Minerals, Trees, Animals, fcfW-A large chain of rocks 
extend eaft and weft through the middle of the parifh. The 
greateft part of the country houfes are built with moov 
i (tones, which abound in every hill. - Some ftrata of free- 
ftone, of flate and limeftone, have been lately difcovered. 
The freeftone and flate have been ufed in repairing the 
church and manfe. There are fome oak, birch, hazle, am, 
and plane trees; but they are not diffident for fupplying 
the implements of hulbandry. Some large trunks of oak 
and fir are dug out of the moffes. Of thefe the inhabitants 
make very ftrong couples and lath for their houfes. Fruit 
trees are fcarce. The ftirubs of broom, furze, juniper, floes, 
hips and brambles, are innumerable. 'The water-lilly is 
the only herb, which perhaps is peculiar to this parith, it 
grows in the Gedloch. Moorfowl, partridge and hare are 
the principal game. The Earl of Moray, as tradition re- 
lates, ufed often to hunt and Ihoot on thefe hills. That he 
might have accommodation during the fporting feafon, he 
allotted a croft of land to the vintner, and another to the 
blackfmith for which the one paid a rofe, and the other a 
horfe flioe, yearly, if required. The crofts ftill retain the 
names of Brewer's-croft and Smithy-croft. The lapwing 
appears in March, the cuckoo in April, and the fwallow 
in May ; they all begin to diiappear about the end of fum- 



xner.

Wheat and rye are fown in November. Several at- 
tempts have been made to present fmatm wheat without 
fuccefs. By a few recent experiments, however, there is 
ground to think that fmut may be prevented by drying the 
feed wheat on a kiln with a flow fire of peats. Ten fii lots 
of wheat may be reduced by the heat to about eight. No-

thing would be more agreeable than to hear that others 
are equally fortunate in making fimilar experiments. — ( ats 
and peafe are fown from the 13th oi March to the middle 
of April ; barley from the middle of April to the begin- 
ing of June ; turnip feed from the 25th of June to the 
middle ot July. — Harvelt begins about the 12th of Septem-

The late Earl of Finulater and Seafield, a nobleman of 
diftinguifhed character, induced his tenants to make confi- 
derable improvements in agriculture, by encouraging them 
to fallow their fields, to fow grafs and turnip feeds, and 
plant potatoes. All which are obvioufly of great advan- 
tage to the farmer. He promoted alio the manufacture of 
flax and wool, by giving fpinning wheels to the farmers 
wives and daughters. They now manufacture the whole of 
the wool of their own fheep. Of a ftone of wool they make 
from 36 to 40 ells of excellent plaiding, which they iell for 
about is. the ell. When they have done with manufactu- 
ring the wool, fince the foil does not produce flax to per- 
fection, they employ themfelves in ipinning flax imported 
by the merchants in the neighbourhood, who allow them 
3d. for each hank of the coarfelt, and 6d. for each hank of 
the finelt yarn which they fpin. 

Population, ISc. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls was then 525. — The numbers in 1781 
were 460; in 1791, were 402. To explain the decreafe, 
befides 24 perfons who have emigrated to America, two 
farms are poffefled by tenants who do not refide in the pa- 
riih, for the purpofe of pafture, where 4 tenants formerly 
lived. Befides there are 4 tenants who poflefs as much 
land as 8 did before. There were 6 heritors in 1 766, fince 
that period the Earl of Findlater has purchafed all the lands 
except a croft of about 5 acres.

Patron, the Earl of Moray. The glebe, grafs inclofure, 
and garden, contain about 9 acres. The church, built with 
hewn freeftone, confilts of a nave and choir. Part of the 
walls was repaired in 1734, as appears from the date on the 
bell-houfe. The late Mr Shaw, a learned and refpedtable 
clergyman of this prefbytery, who publilhed the hillory of 
this province in 1775, fays, that it is probable, that the bi- 
fliop's firft cathedral in this diocefe was fituated in Birnie, 
and that Simeon de Tonei, one of the bifliops of Moray, 
was buried in Biruie in 1184. It is held iu great venera- 
r tion 



of Birnie. 161 

hoh by many in this county. They ftill, in forae meafure^ 
entertain a fuperftitious conceit, that prayers there offered 
up three feveral Sabbaths will furely be heard. Info- 
much that when a perfon is indifpofed, or of bad behaviour, 
this common faying obtains, 1 You have need to be pray- 
ed for thrice in the church of Birnie, that you may either 
end or mend." 

There are 18 poor now inrolled, who have nothing to 
depend upon for their fupply but the weekly voluntary 
collections, and a (hare of a mortification, which amount on- 
ly to about L. 7 a-year. That fum is diftribiiLed among 
them every year, and goes but a Ihort way towards fupply- 
ing their wants. The aged and infirm, therefore, mull tra- 
vel beyond the bounds of the parifh, and implore alms from 
the charitable. It is remarkable, however, that 20 years 
ago, there was but one common beggar in the parifh. He 
was blind, and led from door to door. To the poor who 
are not able to work, nor go from home, the parilhioners 
prove their charitable difpofition, by putting fome meal in- 
to bags, hung up in the mill, for the purpofe of their relief, 
when they are grinding their corn there, or by fending them 
at other times fuchi quantities of meal and of fuel as they 
can fpare. 

Mijcellaneom Obfervations. — The talleft man in the parifh 
is 6 feet 2^ inches. The general (ize of the people is fup- 
pofed to be 5 V feet. — The year 1 782 was very remark- 
able for the latenefs and coldnefs of the harveft, which on- 
ly began the 15th Oaober that year. At a moderate com- 
putation, one half of the corn was damaged by the froft 
and heavy falls of fnow. The icartity and high price of 
meal that enfued was truly alarming ; and had nor Pro- 
vidence put a ftop to holtilities in America and Europe, 
and given the Britifh Parliament time to mind the ftate of

North Britain at that period, thoufands muft have perifned - - 
for want of bread. Happily, in confequence of fome fup- 
ply of meal from Government, and by importing corn and 
meal from the Continent of Europe, none died for want of 
the neceflary means of fubuftence. At that time potatoes 
were often ufed in place of bread by many. A family, 
conlifting of 9 perfons, had nothing elfe to eat for a whole 
week, and yet they looked pretty well. — There is plenty 
of heath, furze, broom, turf, and peat. Peats are the beft 
fuel. A great many, beiides the parifhioners, are fupplied 
with peats from the moffes of Birnie. Two hundred loads 
of peats are requifite to keep a good fire in a room, and a- 
nother in the kitchen, for a year. They cannot be caft, 
dried, and carried home, at the diftance of 4 miles, for lefs 
than ( s. the load. — The people are indullrions, temperate, 
and cheerful, though poor. Munc is their favourite diver- 
fion. Some of rhem can play on the bagpipe, and others 
on the violin. Ff.rocious manners have given place to ci- 
vilized. Tiiere has been no inftance of fuicide or murder 
during the lair 26 years. Neither has any one been ba- 
niihod, or fuffered capital punilhment. They fpeak Eng- 
Iiih, in the Scotch dialed. It is remarkable in this, as well 
as in other parifhes of this county, that when the confo- 
nants r and s meet, as in the words horfe, curfe, &amp;c. the let- 
ter r is quiefcent, and the common people pronounce thefe

*n oblong figure, named the coronach, are ftill kept as the 
remains of antiquity. Tradition relates that the bell -as 
made at Rome, and confecrated by the Pope.— The bible-, 
Jlone, having the figure of a book dutinftly engraven, lying 
about a mile eaft from the church, on the tide of the road 
leading from Birnie to Rothrs, has probably been pla ed 
there as a land- mark.— The Cairn of KUifo einan, of a co- 
nical figure, 300 feet in circumference at the bafe, has been 
probably placed over the remains of a brave man, wnofe 
exploits are now forgotten. — The cave in the middle of a 
deep high rock, near the Gedloch, was, according -^tra- 
dition, haunted about 100 years ago by a gang of armed 
ruffians, who had no vifible way of obtaining the means of 
fubfiftence, but by theft and robbery. The happy confti- 
tution we now enjoy has fuppreffed all fuch lawlefs han- 
ditti. — A.11 who have feen the falls of water in the Lin of 
the Shoggle, and the Eats of Glenlaterach, much admire 
them, and the adjacent wilds. There is about 20 feet of a 
fall of water in each of thele places. — Some velliges of an 
incampment can be traced in a well-aired dry fituation, wa- 
tered on the weft fide by the burn of Barden, and fortified 
on the E. and N. by a valley. It commands a profpecl of 
the Moray Frith, from Speymouth to Cromarty Bay. 
Probably the Danes, after invading this part of the coun- 
.try, had a camp there. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The pafture for cattle 
and Iheep annexed to the fever al farms in the Highlands, 
is of great advantage to the tenants \ but the arable land 
being much expofed to the north, the corn growing there 
is late in ripening, and frequently damaged by froft. — From 
the winter folllice to the vernal equinox, heavy falls of 
fnow often cover the face of the earth, and deprive the 
fheep of convenient pafture. They, having nothing but 

ftraw

ftxaw to eat in the folds, become lean and feeble ; info- 
much, that when the ewes yean, many lambs die ; becaufe 
their dams have not milk enough for them. The owners 
would therefore do well to provide a fufficient quantity of 
turnip and hay for the ewes. — Materials for the implements 
of agriculture are fcarce. An afh tree cofts the artificer 
himfelf from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. Sterling the foot. It would 
therefore be equally advantageous to the proprietors and 
tenants, that fuch an extent of wafte ground were inclofed, 
and planted with afh, birch, and alder, as might furnilh the 
farmer with every neceflary utenfil of timber.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6408048">KILMORY</name>, 



(Isle of Arran, County of Bute, Synod of Ar- 
gyle, Presbytery of Kintyre.)



By the Rev. Mr John Hamilton.</head>  



<p>Origin of the Names Arran, Kilmory, &amp;c. 

r TP v Rad it i o n fays, that the name Arran is derived from 
a plat of ground in the north end of the ifland, 
where a battle was fought by Fin or Fingal, (the chief 
of the giants,) who inhabited this ifland, with Manus, the 
King of Swedland's fon, where was a great flaughter. 
Fingal being conqueror, the plat of ground was called in 
Gaelic by a name which literally fignifies, " Fin's flaugh- 
" ter." Ar and Fin being joined, make the name in 
Gaelic to be, in the genitive, Arfhin, or the " Slaughter 
" of Fin," which by degrees was written Arran. — Kilmo- 
ry fignifies, in Gaelic, " St Mary's Chapel," or in Gaelic 
itfelf, CM Mkuire. The ifland of Arran contains only- 
two pariihes, Kilmory and Kilbride. Kilmory parifli ex- 
tends 30 miles in a femicircular form, from Dippin on the 

fouth

fouth-eaft, to Lochrannza, in the north extreme of Arwm, 
It is bounded on the S. E. S. W. and N. W. by the lea ; 
and in the narroweft place is only 6 miles from Kintyre ; 
on the N. E. by a fpacious central common moor, where 
the horfes and fheep of the ifland range promifcuoufly in 
fummer. — The furface of the parifh is uneven and hilly j 
the foil is various, partly gravelifh, clay ; and niuffy, -nnd 
is capable of producing light crop: of barley, oats, (in 
fome places,) peafe, and flax only for private ufe •, but po- 
tatoes are planted in every tarm, and are tne general food 
of the people. 

Difeafes. — The difeafes here, are cancers, rheums fevers 
brought from other countries, and a great death of new- 
born infants, by the falling down ot the jaws ; and fome 
women die in childbed, boih which lait two are attributed 
to the unlkilfuincfs of midwives, who venture upon the 
practice from natural courage, without neceflary and pro- 
per knowledge, there being none duly qualified in the 
ifland. The oldelt man now living in the parifh is 88, a 
few more have turned So, and there lias been an inftance 
of i who reached 95. 

Rivers, Lochs or Lakes. — The burns here, which fcarce 
deferve the name of rivers, have, fome of them, their 
foui ce from lochs or lakes in the mountains, and fome from 
numberlefsfprings ; after a fhort and rapid courfe they empty 
thenifelves into the fea ; they abound with line trouts, and 
fome falmon. There are 3 lochs or lakes •, the principal 
of which is Earfay loch, in the weft of the ifland, which 
abounds with trouts of different fizes, and fine falmon, 
which are caught by cruives and draught-lines. 



Cavcs.-~ 



of Kilmory. 



Caws. — There are feveral natural caves, the principal,, 
and which highly excites the curiofity of ftrar.gers of all 
ranks, is one in the weft of the ifland, oppofite to Camp- 
belkown, called the King's Cove, becaufe, as tradition af- 
firms, King Robert de Bruce and his retinue lodged in it 
for fome time, when taking fhelter in retired places, be- 
fore his defeat of John Baliol, and acceffion to the throne 
of Scotland. It is 40 yards long, 16 broad, and about 20 
high/in which are feveral engravings and antique figures ; 
feemingly a coat, of arms, and forms of weapons are cut in 
the rock \ a little within the entry are the letters M. D. R. 
The cave is fo fpacious, that fermons have been preached 
in it to fome hundreds of hearers at- different times. About 
2 miles fouth from it is another cave, which could contain 
20 j perfons 1 ; but nothing elfe remarkable in it. 

Hills and Sea Coaji^ — The highefl hill is Beinnbharfbionn 
or the " Mountain of the white top," fo called, from its 
being covered a great part of the year with fnow it ftands 
in the N. W. part of the ifland, and is fuppofed to be 2 
miles high •, but the adjacent mountain called Goatfield, 
though not quite fo high, is yet more remarkable, as it 
produces brilliant ftones. The fea-coaft, efpecially in the 
E. and S. part of the pariih, is a proud and very unhofpi- 
table fliore ; but towards the W. and N. fomewhat lefs fo, 
excepting a large funken rock in the W. S. W. part of the 
parifli, alinoft oppofite to Campbelltown, called the Iron 
Rock; it lies confiderably off the land, and has proved de- 
trimental to many velfels. 

Light Houfc.—ln the ifle Pladday, a mile off the land, 
in the eaft part of the parilh, a light houfe has lately been 
creeled, with two different lights, to diftinguiih it in the 

night 



i68

night from thofe on the Mulls of Kin tyre, Galloway, and 
Cumbray. 

Fijb.— The fea-coaft abounds with fifh of different kinds, 
fuch as herring, falmon, fcate, cod, ling, lythe, flounder, 
haddock, whiting, Sec. but the inhabitants have not ac- 
quired the art of being very beneficial to themfelves in 
fifhing any of thefe but herring. There is alio in thefe 
feas a hugh fifh, called Sail-fifli, which is caught by flicking 
-them with fharp-edged inflruments, of the harpoon kind •, 
they fcre productive of good quantities of oil ; but the 
fifhermen mull be dexterous when about to flick the fifh, 
as the attempt is fometimes dangerous. 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor. — In this parifh are two 
places of worfhip, exclufive of that occupied by the cate- 
chol in the north end of the ifland. The principal paro- 
chial kirk is at Kilmory, in the fouth end of the ifland, re- 
built in 1783, with Gothic windows, and 1 gallery. The 
other place, called Shifken, is 6 computed miles weflward. 
The Duke of Hamilton is patron, and fole proprietor, ex- 
cepting two farms. The flipend is L. 70, exclufive of a 
manfe and glebe. — There are two parochial fchools. The 
falary allowed to the principal is L. 50 Scots, the half of 
winch is paid by the Duke of Hamilton, and the other by 
the tenants of the diflrift. To the other fchool is allowed 
L 40 Scots, paid alfo in halves, as aforefaid. The parifh 
is divided into 2 parochial diftri&amp;s ; each of the fchool - 
mailers has in his own diflricl:, 1 s. for marriage, 6 d. for 
baptifm, and L. 6 Scots each for feffion-clerkihip •, their 
number of fcholars may be 50 each, more or lefs ; but 
there are alfo many petty fchools. The wages are invari- 
ably 1 s. the quarter for reading, 1 s. 6 d. for writing, and 
a s. 6 d. for arithmetic. 

The 



of Kilmory. 



The number of poor on the parilh-roll is 40, who are 
fupplied by che weekly collections as often as the fund 
admits ; but which is quite inadequate to their need. Such 
therefore of them as can go about, receive alms from the 
country people ; and thofe who are decrepit or confined to 
bed, are, in addition to the furplus received from the fef- 
fion, fupported by country charity fent to them ; for the 
people, according to their abilities, are very charitable, and 
attentive to real indigence. 

Exports. — Several hundreds of black cattle are annually 
exported to Ayrlhire ; they are bought up by different 
perfons, and ferried in every month from May to Decem- 
ber ; fo that their number cannot eafily be afcertained. A 
conliderable quantity of barley is alfo exported to Greenock, 
Saltcoats, Irvine, Ayr, and Campbelltown ; but 3 licenfed 
diftillers have lately been ere&amp;ed in the ifland, which will 
exhauft a great part of the barley that can henceforth be 
fpared. Alfo kelp is manufactured here, and exported, 
perhaps 60 tons in the year. They alfo export fin all quan- 
tities of mutton, and linen yarn, by all which commodities, 
they are enabled, in addition to induftry and ceconomy, to 
pay their rent, and an f we r the other exigencies of their 
families. But as the ifland breeds no horfes, the people 
are obliged to buy at dear rates, in Argylefhire, and o- 
ther places ; they alfo frequently buy lheep for breed in 
Ayrfhire,as iriftormy fnowy winters many of their fheep die. 

Advantages and Bifadvantages. — The chief advantages 
are good water and pure air ; which are counterbalanced by 
many difadvantages. There are in this parifh no fafe harbours, 
by which many real lofles are fuftained ; expenfe, lofs of 
time, and foretimes lofs of lives and property, attend the 
^avoidable neceffity of having recourfe to extramaritine 

VoL ' IX « Y markets,

markets, both to fell what they can fpare, and buy the ma- 
ny things they need. 

Language. — The mother tongue is the Gaelic, which is 
univerfally fpoken ; yet per Ions advanced in years nnder- 
ftand the Englifti language tolerably ; they acquire it by in- 
tercourfe ivith other countries, and are greatly affiled by 
having the organs of fpeech formed in their youth, it be- 
ing the firft language they are taught to read. 

Migratory Birds, and Amphibious Animals. — We have 
tranfient vifits of the fwan in winter, the fieldfare in time 
of fnow, and the green plover in May and June, &amp;c. — ■ 
The otter, an agile animal, and of the canine form, often 
reforts here •, its fkin fetches a good price, and notwith- 
ftanding his vigilance, he fometimes falls a prey to the 
markfman ; alfo the feal, although feldom \ its Ikin is like- 
wife valuable. 

Agriculture, ISc— There are in this parim 440 horfes, 
1388 cows, 208 j fheep, 102 goats. There are fown 1320 
bolls oats, 190 bolls barley, 330 bolls potatoes, 18 bolls 
peafe, 9 bolls flax- feed. The old Scotch plough is generally 
ufed here, drawn by 4 horfes. The nature of the foil is 
fuch, that they cannot begin early to till, and can have time 
only to till, at an average, at the rate of about 14 bolls the 
plough.— The rent of the parifli is L. 2398 a-year. 

Population.— According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers then were 2277, at prefent there are in the whole 
of Kilmory 3259 ; but thefe are not all fupported by the 
produce and internal induftry of the pariih, many of the 
young people go to fervice to the neighbouring countries, 
efpecially Ayrftnre ; many of the young men are employ-

the Royal navy, and a great number in all the different 
branches of Britifh trade. — -From Dippin to Earfay, (ex- 
clusive of what is from Earfay to Lochranza, and which is 
under the charge of a chatechift,) there have been in the 
courfe of the year 1791, 71 baptifmsj and 21 marriages. 
Dippin is 16 miles from Earfay; Earfay 14 from Loch- 
ranza. No bill of mortality kept.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012311">St ANDREW'S, LHANBRYD</name>, 

(County of Elgin, Synod of Moray, Presbytery 

of Elgin.) 

By the Rev,- Mr William Leslie.</head> 



<p>Geography and Natural Hi/lory* 

Y HjMBryd, fignifying in the original, " St Bridget's 
Church," was united to St Andrew's, to which laft, 
two other chapels had alfo been joined before the Reforma- 
tion. This pariih meafures about 3 Englifh miles from 
W. to E. along the highway from Elgin to Spey ; and 
from S. to N. about 4, exclufive of an improvement in the 
hill I mile diilant, on the S. disjoined by an intervening- 
ikirt of the pariih of Elgin, to which it pertains. It was 
originally the moor where the cattle were collected for 
drawing part of the teinds of both pariflies, before they 
were converted into money, from which it retains the name 
of TeindJand', and on account of its diftance from Elgin, the 
inhabitants have in general ranked themfelves in this pariih. 
The general appeai nice of the country is a plain, in which, 
feveral low hills rife, lb arranged as to appear connected 

with 



of St Andrew* s, Lhanbryd. 



with each other, and all covered with corn or grafs, or 
with plantations of wood. The foil in general is fandy, 
yet fertile where it is low and damp. The air is healthful 
and dry ; not productive of any prevalent diftemper ; al- 
though the inhabitants are not diftinguiftied for longevity. 
There is one mineral fpring in the Teindland, of a lirong 
chalybeate kind, as yet of no celebrity ; though it has gi- 
ven relief to all who have made proper trial of its effects. 
There are three lakes on the confines of the parifti ; the 
larg-ft, that of Spynie from 4 to 6 feet of water on a deep 
rich mould, inviting its proprietors to drain off its fhallow 
water. Several years ago, one of them carried on this ope- 
ration at a confiderable expenfe, and with the moft encou- 
raging profpefts ; but when he had nearly completed the im- 
provement of the old canal, he was retarded by a litigation 
before the Court of Seffion, with his neighbour on the o- 
ther fide of the lake, who wiftied to retain all the water. 
This oppolition being at laft unfuccefsful, the undertaking 
was completed j by which, although not effectual, many 
acres were regained, where the courfe of ridges, the forma- 
tion of artificial roads, and every token of ancient and un- 
known cultivation, moft evidently and unexpededly appear- 
ed. T e neighbouring loch of Cots, originally a part of 
that of Spynie, at firft a ftrait of the ocean, defcribed in the 
chartulary of Moray as a bay, in the 13th century, is on 
the lame level, and offers equal encouragement to drain off 
its water, in proportion to its extent; and being fupported 
by two confiderable rivulets, the mouth of the caaal would 
afford a profitable falmon-fiihing. Lochnabee, in the S. E. 
corner of the p arifh, is about 3 miles in circumference, and 
has an xfland covered w :t h wood. There is a foreft round 
this lake planted by the Earl of Fife, fo extenfive and thri- 
ving, as to have ,lr,ady induced a fcore or two of red deer 
to make their refidence in its cover. Thcfe lakes abound 

with.

with trout, eel and pike, with a great variety of wild ducks, 
and at one feafon of the year with wild-geefe and fwans ; 
but neither the proprietors, nor their tenants, avail them- 
in any degree whatever of thefe advantages. The only ri- 
ver is Loffie, which, entering the parifh at the N. W. cor- 
ner, divides it there from the town of Elgin, and fhaping 
its courfe in the form of a parabola, leaves it near the fea 
at the north, including within the parabola about one third 
of what was the parifh of St Andrew's; having its church 
in the apex, at which there is a fubftantial timber bridge*. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers then were 690. The number of inhabitants was 
confiderably greater than now about 30 years ago. Seve- 
ral farms which were each pofTelTed by 10 or 16 families, 
are now let to one man ; and of late feveral are occupied 
by inhabitants of the town of Elgin, and by farmers of o- 
ther parifhes, fome of whom have no refident fervant, and 
others only one or two, where numerous families dwelt. At 
prefent, the number is 777, including the improvement of 
Teindland, making 140 families, of which 106 are wedded 
pairs; the number of males 345; females 412. The

* A great part of St Andrew's is expofed to land -floods, by the over- 
flow of Lofley on both fides. The higheft now remembered was in 1768 ; 
a very deftrudtive one in 1781 ; and much damage was done by two, du- 
ring the harveft of 1789. This calamity might be prevented at no great 
expenfe, by a little concert among the proprietors, and taking out the dam 
of a mill, which has no thirlage, and gives but a trifle of rent. The ex- 
tent of the fea-coaft is only" about one mile ; a low fandy fliore. pertaining 
to one farm ; upon which ordinary tides rife from 7 to 8 feet perpendi-

the inhabitants. The victual rents difpofed of by the pro- 
prietors to Highland counties of crop 1782, greatly over- 
balanced the fupply of meal granted to the poor that year 
by the State. Since the excife on tanning leather obliged 
the poorer families to give up making their own fhoes, 
no hemp has been cultivated ; but there is ftill flax raifed, 
though only for domeftic accommodation. There are 252

nhters of Elgin, who was prejudiced a'gainft tLe prefentee appointed for 
his colleague ; for the fupport of which, he bequeathed a capital of L. 100 
Sterling. They aflemble in an old edirke on the end -of the church, built 
for the week-day worlhip of the town's people, in compliance with their 
prejudice for holydays, on the abolition of Epifcopacy. The 'managers 
let fuch feats as have not been claimed ; but a fubfcrption by the hearers

» few pairs only being employed in the plough and wag- 
gon ; there are 1060 fheep, a fmal] number of which are 
accounted here of the Bakewell breed. They are without 
horns, and have long wool; the fleece weighs from - tc 
12 pounds; about a fifth-part are of the Linton breed, 
the reft are a white faced breed, that have always been in 
the country, much diminifhed in bulk by fcanty pafture ; 
as yet there is no idea of improving the quality of the 
wool. — Tenants of the rank of gentlemen have all their 
grafs of fown closers, rye and rib grafs ; the poor tenants 
■depend on natural ley grafs, with a patch of cluver in their 
gardens. The rent by the acre on moll farms is varied e- 
very year, by the difference of the price of grain, of which 
a portion of the rent of every farm has been in general 
paid. When grain fells at 14 s. cr 15 s. the boll, the a- 
verage rent by the acre is about 15s.; but a great propor- 
tion of almoft every farm can be only valued at 5 s. the 
•acre ; and a part of each, if let feparately, would bring a 
guinea the acre. There being little or no common pafture 
pertaining to any farm, the land, confidering the quantity 
of grain produced from the acre, muft be reckoned high 
rented. 

Mifcellaneous Oh few at ions. — The poffeffors of the landed 
property are 7. The Earl of Fife has the whole of what 
was the parifii of Lhanbryd, and the ancient barony of Kil- 
malemnock, in St Andrew's ; the Earl of Findlater holds 
Linkwood and Linksfield, in the weft ; the Hon. George 
Duff, Barmickity, in the middle of the parifh ; John Bran* 
ler, Efq; holds Pitgaveny, in the north ; William King, 
Efq; has Newmill, and the lands in the vicinity of Elgin ; 
and John Innes, Efq; writer to the Signet, has Dunkinty,

ration, given by Gordon of Cairnfield, for the fupport of

the Epifcopal chapel in Elgin.— The only language of the 
parifli is Scots. The names of the places, in general, are of 
that language ; fuch as Hornhead, Halftones, Hollow-wood, 
and Cockftown . Thefe are beauties peculiar to this lan- 
guage, in energy, brevity, and animation ; which would be 
more natural ornamentb in the Englilh tongue, than any of 
its exotic importations. Thefe, therefore, as well as the 
Scoticil'ms, might be alio collided and publimtd. — The peo- 
ple, over all this country, are mod ftrictly ceconomical, and 
as little expeniive or luxurious as poffible. They are dif- 
pofed to every kind of humane and generous aclion, as 
much as their circumftances will admit of. The lower 
rank of farmers and labourers, though not content perhaps 
with their fkuation, and though they do not enjoy all the 
comforts of life, yet do not complain more than their opu- 
lent neighbours. There are numbers of them, however, who 
are generally without fmall beer and milk, and almoft none 
of them have meat, butter, cheefe or fpirits, and all their 
poultry and eggs are fold in the Elgin market. Their 
drefs, furniture and habitations are ftill of the cheapeft kinds 
which can be procured. They ufe no candles ; and urine 
they fubftitute for foap. Funerals are conducted without 
expenfe ; there is no company or dancing on the occa- 
iion of a wedding ; nor at baptifms, in general, is there 
any kind of entertainment. Almoft the only pleafure 
they indulge in, is meeting occafionally, to the number of 
15 or 25, for the purpofe of converfing about fome of the 
abftrufeft doctrines of Calvinifm, in which they difplay 
their eloquence in the only kind of fpouting of which they 
have any notion, that of a theological oration and a prayer, 
varied by occafional reflections on the degeneracy and op- 
preflions of the age. It is probable, the aneeftors of the

tion of the times, the falaries of fchoolmafters can in no 
way fupport a family, that office has fallen altogether into 
the hands of mere fchool-boys, which they abandon as foon 
* as their own education is fuppofed to be completed, or into 
that of bankrupt tenants, 1 1 til lefs qualified for the duties of 
it. So that a thicker cloud of ignorance mutt be fettling 
over the lower ranks of people, than that which covered 
their fathers. And while the reputation for learning, which 
Scotland has ftj long fupported among the nations, mull in 
a ihort time be loft, thofe numbers, who, by means of that 
mediocrity of literature acquired in the parifli fchools, rofe 
from the loweft llations of life to merit, wealth, and rank, 
mutt be henceforth ch ined down, hopelefs and inglorious, 
to the mifeiable iphere of their humble birth. Paritti fchools 
are peculiar to Scotland. The idea of this inttitution was 
originally Cuggefted as proper for reconciling the minds of 
the people to the admin iftration of Charles I. And, in a 
fimilar view, they were eftablilhed in their prelent form by 
the firlt Parliament of King William. For feveral gene- 
rations, while the example of country gentlemen, and the 
ability of fchoolmalters, fupported the labours of minitters, 
the fchoolmafter's connexion in the pariih being equally 
permanent, and their learning in general on a reipe&amp;able 
par, the people were preferved loyal to Government, and 
fteady to the Church ; but after the gentlemen withdrew 
their countenance, and flighted the ordinances of their na- 
tional religion, and the office of fchoolmafter became inef- 
ficient, by the diminiihed value of its appointment, the mi- 
nifters were wholly unfupported, the people blind to the 
fignal advantages of their Government, and feeling the pref- 
fuie of its manifold exaclions; while their minds, relating 
both to Church and State, as much perverted now by 
v agrants in the character of diffenting preachers, as they were 
then by trafficking pnefts, are, in as great a degree, diipofed 



of St Andrew's, Lhanbryd. 179 



for innovation, if it fhould elfe where fpring up, as in any 
former age ; with this difference, that the band of religion 
which tied the people fo ftrongly to their fuperiors, being 
now broken, they would be very little controiled by their 
influence. Perhaps it would be wile, therelore, in the State, 
to augment the living of fchoolmafters to the lame value 
which it comparatively bore in the reign of William ; 
which would not at prefent require, in all, above L. 5000 
Sterling a- year, which might be tranfmitted to the SheriiFs, 
or paid by the Collectors of Excife. 

By thefe means the condition of the kingdom would be 
meliorated ; for while fome knowledge of writing and arith- 
metic is now indifpenfable to every mechanic, mafon, car- 
penter, weaver and tailor, nothing can be more abfurd 
than to allege, that a man makes a- better farmer, is more 
content with his fituation, or a more ufeful member of fo- 
ciety, becaufe he can neither read or write ; on the contra- 
ry, ignorance of itfelf occafions di 'content, and expofes thofe 
who are under its gloom to be more eafily milled bv the 
crafty, which the members of every mob, and the fmalleft 
obfervation of the fentimehts of that condition fufficiendy 
demonftrate. The parilh having no advantages nor difad- 
vantages peculiar to itfelf, the means by which its condi- 
tion might be meliorated, would alfo influence that of all 
the country. Granting long leafes, has, in general, been 
accounted among the means of meliorating the condition 
of tenants, and of improving the country ; yet their being 
no other advantage from this, but that the tenant is encou- 
raged to improve by the certainty of reaping its profit, it 
vv raid be eafy, by the conditions of the leafe, to give equal 
encouragement for temporary or permanent improvement, 
if the tenant fhould be removed in fuch circumtlances, as to 
give the landlord the profits of it. On moft forms there 
are corners inacceffible to the plough, the bank of a ditch,

or the winding margin of a brook, where trees would be 
ornamental, and promote the growth of grafs, by their made 
and their fhelter. The tenant at prefent has feldom any 
encouragement to plant fuch fpots, as, by act of Parliament, 
all the growing timber is the fole propeity of the landlord* 
But were fome arrangement made between the landlord 
and the tenant, to encourage the latter, either to plant fuch 
fpots himfelf, or to take care of the trees therein planted, 
every farm, in the courfe of the riling generation, would 
be provided with timber fufficient for its own accommoda- 
tion. — For many years paft the agricultural induftry of this 
part of the country has been confiderably difcouraged, by 
the difficulty of procuring and managing farm-fervants, 
occafioned by an emigration of many of that rank to the 
manufacturing and commercial places of the fouth ; while, 
by a pretty widely extended combination among them- 
felves, they have raifed their wages here, as high as in any 
part of the kingdom, it is certain there is lefs work accom- 
plished by equal numbers. They iniift on being regulated 
in all circumftances, by the faftiion or practice of other 
farms, which themfelves have by this means eftablilhed y 
and if any perfon contends any particular Avith them, he 
thereby incurs the imputation of being a bad matter, and 
mufl thereupon, at the next term, give an advance of wages, 
or fome conceffion ftill more humiliating. How far this 
tnay or does affect the land-rent, is not afcertained, nor 
have the gentlemen of the country yet felt the evil; an ad- 
ditional fervant or two is of little confequence to them, and 
their influence fecures in general a preference to the moft 
difcreet, fo th t they rather fofter than check the extrava- 
gance. It would, neverthelefs, be proper in them to ex- 
tend their care a little to the concerns, in this refpedt, of 
their poorer neighbours, and to the ftate of the country in 
general ; and it is yet practicable, by a little concert among

them, gradually and filently, to introduce practices more 
beneficial to all concerned. — This country fuiFers alfo fome- 
what from a fpirit of litigation, which the landholders feem 
rather to foment, than take any care to fupprefs ; for ha- 
ving univerfally relinquifhed their legal ancient privilege 
of warning out tenants by their own authority, great num- 
bers are yearly brought together in the {heriff-court, upon 
an aft only of the Court of Seflion, to fee themfelves de- 
cerned to remove, where they acquire notions concerning 
the rights of men, no way favourable to induftry, concord 
or thrift. Belides, the deprefling influence of the tax 
on water-born coal, which is above the fixth part of the 
price, this country moreover feels the partiality of the 
tax on Scots coal carried north of the Redhead, of which it 
now requires a confiderable importation, and belides the 
freight, Ihore-dues, and other unavoidable expence of con- 
veyance, this tax alone increafes the original price at the 
pit one-fourth part by the ton*. 

This country in particular, and the whole iiland, would 
be greatly benefited by a bridge on the river Spey, at the 
ferry of Fochabers. The improved fyflem of agriculture 
in fowing grafs and other green crops, inftead of the 
uninterrupted cultivation of corn, has naturally turned 
the attention of the people to the increafe of black cattle. 
The county of Banff, and the adjoining parts of Aberdeen- 
mire, where Banff is only 8 or 10 miles broad, are by cli-

* Numbers alfo in this country are mortified by another inconvenience. 
The ports of Findhorn, Lome, and Spey, belong to the diftricr. of the 
Cuftom-houle of Invernefs. Befides the trouble of obtaining the clear- 
ance, on the arrival of every veffel, an exprefs muft be difpatched thither, 
before they can begin to unload ; by which a delay of three days r befides 
much expenfe, is unneceflarily incurred. But no inconvenience^ could 
refult from a deputation to proper officers at Elgin ; yet the gentlemen of 
the country fubmit to this diftrefs, with a patience and felf-denial which 
at leaft does honour to their ChrUtiau rcfignation.

mate adapted to pafturage, therefore, during Cummer and 
autumn, cattle markets have been eltablifhed in fome place 
of that country every week ; crofling the cattle over this 
rapid and generally unfordable river, and bringing home 
under the night fuch as may not be fold, is attended by 
a moft forbidding inconvenience, which it is not neceffary 
here particularly to defcribe. The application of lime as 
a manure has of late been practifed in this country, and 
much greater quantities of it are now ufed in building than 
in any former age. Banff ihire abounding in lmieltone and 
fuel, furniihes the whole quantity required for both pur- 
pofes. Befides hard labour, and much time in loading and 
unloading the boat, the freight alone adds a fifth part to the 
price. How far Government may be interefted in this 
bridge, needs not be here Itated ; but it may be obferved, 
that experience hath now proved, that the opening of pro- 
per roads, has alone civilized and improved the rudell cor- 
ners of the Highlands, while the forts which were erect- 
ed there, and are fupported at fo great expenfe, have in 
this refpecl; been found entirely nugatory ; although they 
could not be intended for any other purpofe in a country 
which, nature having interdicted from being the theatre of 
war, can only at any period exhibit the fcene of a flight 
fkirmifh, or one fhort engagement. — The eafy practicabili- 
ty, and the advantages of making a canal through the loch 
of Spynie, and the N. VV. corner of the parifh from Loffie- 
mouth, to within a mile of Elgin, navigable without a lock 
for any vefTel that can get into the harbour, might be point- 
ed out. — But it only remains rather to fuggeft the advan- 
tage of eftablilhing a corn-market limilar to that of Had- 
dington. The county, at an average, difpofes of from 
10,000 to 16,000 bolls, by the agency only of 3 or 4 
perfons, who, in general, purchafe by commiflion from 
their correfpondents in the fouth, and they alone are often

able to fix the price for the year. Although the city ot 
Edin burgh, and the diltillers, may be fuppofed to purchafe 
the whole grain of the Haddington market, yet, iince the 
eftablilhment of fmall Hiils in the north, it is evident the 
fituation of this country would admit of fuch a weekly 
market on a fmall lcale at Elgin, and it would require no 
great exertion ot the ingenuity, or attention of the country 
gentlemen, to form and fupport an eftablimmentfoobvioufly 
patuotic — Although the people of Teindland are at liberty 
to choole any church molt convenient, they are bound to- 
a mill in their own pariih of Elgin, and befides it, there 
are 8 mills with wnich trie parifti is connected. — By the 
quantity of potato, and alterations in the mode of living, 
it is certain there is not fo much meal confumed in the 
country as was formerly. The people in general murmur 
greatly on account of mill exactions and fervices ; perhaps, 
therefore, it would be more advantageous for the proprie- 
tors of mills to apportion their preient rent on the lands of 
their thirlage, than it may be at any future period, when 
this meafure, according to the practice of more highly cul- 
tivated countries, may be univerfally adopted.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009938">NEW DEER</name>, 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery of 

Deer.) 

By the Rev. Mr Hugh Taylor.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

J^" E D e e r was once a part of the ancient parifh of 
Deer : from which it was disjoined in the beginning 
of laft century. It was fir ft called Auchreddy, from the 
field in which the church is fituated ; it had that name 
time immemorial ; and which, like that of mod places in 
the parifh, evidently feems to be of Gaelic extraction. 
Thefe parifhes are now denominated Old and New Deer. 
The etymology of Deer is unknown, or at leaft uncertain ; 
perhaps it may be a corruption from the Gaelic. This 
parifh is perhaps one of the largeft in the county. It is of 
an oblong form, extending from S. to N. 14 Englifh miles; 
and 7 at a medium from E. to W. The church is pretty 
centrical, and is 30 miles diftant from Aberdeen directly 
N. ; 48 miles by Peterhead directly W. and 17 miles from 

Banff 



of New Beer. 185 

Banff in a N. E. direction. There is one thing peculiar 
to its fituation, the fea is defcribed around it from S. E. 
to N. W. almoft with a radius of 18 miles : fo that it is 
nearly equidiftant from all the different ports, along a fea- 
coaft of more than 40 miles. 

Surface, Soil and Produce. — The furface here, as alfo 
through the whole of Buchan, is pretty flat. There is 
fcarcely a hill, or even a place that deferves to be called 
an eminence, in all the parifh. A piece of riling ground, 
indeed, is fituated about a mile N. from the church ; from 
which there is an extenfive, and, in fummer, a very plea- 
fant and variegated profpecf. Towards the N. E. E. and 
S. E. the appearance, for 7 or 8 miles, is almolt one conti- 
nued corn field, interlperfed with pieces of fown grafs and 
turnip, and terminated by a gentle rife of the ground, in 
form of an amphitheatre. Turning weftward, the furface 
is heath and moor, chequered with fome draggling farms. 
Here alfo there is a view of many of the Highland hills 
30 or 40 miles W. ; and, in a clear day, a fmall peep of 
the fea at Peterhead. ' The public road from Aberdeen by 
Udny and Tarves, pamng through this parifh to the N. 
nearly divides it, and alfo forms a line of diflinclion be- 
tween the different qualities of the foil. That part, which 
lies Weftward, is in general mallow, fandy and dry. A 
good deal of this is entirely barren, and inclines very much 
to heath. But, from the appearance of ridges in many- 
places upon its furface, even this feems to have once been 
moftly under tillage : and it might be eafily brought into 
cultivation again, by proper encouragement. On the eaft 
fide of the road, the ground being lower, the foil is gene- 
rally deeper, for the mofl part arable, in fome places wet, 
in others, (particularly about the middle,) very dry, rich 
and fertile. But though this diftinftion holds true in a 
VoL ' A a great 



i86 



Statijlical Account 



great meafure, yet. in fome places, the foil on one fide of 
the road is very little different from what it is on the o- 
ther. For mots abounds throughout the parilh : and, 
where this i3 the cafe, the adjacent foil is invariably wet, 
and the mould of a black or hazelly colour. The principal 
crops are oats and barley- big, with fome peafe. Every 
farmer has alfo a field of turnip, from l to 6 acres, accord- 
ing to the extent of his farm. Thefe are given to the cat- 
tle through the winter, and fometimes ufed in fattening 
them for the butcher. Potatoes and flax are alfo raifed, 
but only in fmall quantities, and for private ufe. More 
articles of provifion are produced, and manufactured in the 
parilh, than it annually confumes. A confiderable quanti- 
ty of oats is made into meal, and fold to traders, who 
tranfport it by lea to every place of Scotland, where they 
can find a market. Butter and cheefe are alfo in plenty 
here ; and of; great importance. Small fanners or fubte- 
nants, ufually pay their rent by what of thefe they can 
afford to fell, after fupplyng their own family. Every 
merchant in the parilh buy. thefe articles, and fends them 
to market ; generally at Leith and places adjoining to the 
Frith. Eg2,s too are purchafed by them in confiderable 
quantises, and fhipped for the London market. But the 
rearing and fale of black cattle is perhaps more advantage- 
ous to the farmer, than any thing that has been mention- 
ed. — Valued rent is L 5 159 : 6 : 10 Scots : real rent, in- 
cluding meal and money, aoout L. 3000 Sterling. 

Agriculture, \3c. — In point of improvement, this parifk 
has undergone as fenfible a change as moll: others. Roads, 
farms and houfes, and the implements of hufbandry, are fo 
much ameliorated, that thofe, who were acquainted with 
it 30 years ago, declare they would fcarcely know it to be 
the iamt place, had they been fo long abfent. When the

prefent incumbent was fettled in the year 1737, there was 
not a cart', but his own, in the parilh : nor were there 
roads which could be travelled in many places. Then, 
and for many years after, there was but one carrier, who 
went weekly to Aberdeen with a horfe and packets. 
Sometimes he even went with nothing but a back creel, 
and brought what merchandife and provitions were at the 
time neceffary. Now, there is fuffi .ient employment for 
3 or 4 carriers, who go each with a cart and two horfes. 
Burning, where the foil was fufceptible of it, was the prin- 
cipal manure for railing corn : and many places wear the 
impreflion to this day. A kind of black bearded fmall 
oats was then principally cultivated : now there is hardly 
fuch a kind of grain in the parifh. Liming was much ufed 
a few years ago ; and, when neceffary, can here be carried 
on at a moderate expenfe. But, although there is plenty 
of limeftone and fuel in the parilh, and a kiln for burning 
it on almoft every farm and croft ; yet the tenants are 
now obliged, in a great meafure, to difcontinue the prac- 
tice. For it is found that lime, when applied in great 
quantity, or foon repeated, reduces their foil to a mere 
caput mortuum, producing little but thirties and other no- 
xious weeds. Where barren ground is to be fertilized, or 
old ridges levelled and improved, the farmer ftill has re- 
courfe to it ; and, when judicioufly laid on, it is found to 
anfwer his mod fanguine expectations. When made inter 
a compoft with earth and dung, it alfo makes an excellent 
kind of manure for ley and turnip land. This is general- 
ly prepared in fummer on a piece of the field, for which 
it is defigned, or as near it as poflible. Moft of the farms 
are inclofed, either with turf or ftone fences. The farm, 
houfes are tolerably neat, and confift of one flory. For 
the moft part, they are built of ftone and mortar, and 
jhecked with lime. Stab-thatching is now become pretty

ment pervades every rank, and would probably lead on to 
a more perfect and general knowledge of agriculture, had 
they longer leafes ; but the bad efFe&amp;s of fhort leafes have 
been fo clearly ftated in other ftatiftical accounts, that it i? 
needlefs to enter upon a detail of them.

The above ftate comprehends the whole parifh, except 
the lands of Oldmaud and Afleft, which, lying in the low- 
er part of the parifh, may be confidered as equal to others 
of the like extent and rent ; and the neareft to them in both 

thefc 



of New Deer. 



thefe refpe&amp;s, are the lands of Culfli and Artamford. With 
refpecl to the inclofures, it is not pretended, that they are 
all fufficient fences ; perhaps no inclofure, properly fpeak- 
ing, is a fufficient fence on both fides, but what is built en- 
tirely of flone ; and tenants poffeffing only a 19 years 
leafe, cannot be fuppofed to be at the expenfe of ftone 
fences, when they have no allowance or encouragement 
for them. In the laft ftate there is no notice taken of hay 
crop, it being the opinion of the farmers who gave it in, 
that no true judgment could be formed of the ufual crops 
of hay from the produce of laft year, on account of the 
fupernumerary cattle on hand, till fummer was near over, 
which confumed a great deal of grafs, ufually made into 
hay. 

Air, Climate and Difetifes. — This parifh feems to have a 
considerable elevation above the level of the fea, and mod 
of the neighbouring parilhes, as will appear from a circum- 
ftance to be mentioned afterward. The air is confequent- 
ly {harp and pure ; and the feafons generally a week or 
fortnight later, than in many places in its vicinity. In 
winter the froft is fometimes fo intenfe, as to put a flop to 
the plough ; when nearer the coaft it meets with no ob- 
ftruclion. Laft winter, (1 791-2,) it occafioned a cefTation 
from tillage for 8 or 9 weeks. Snow lies very long upon 
the ground, and, in the higher part of the pariih, fometimes 
falls to a confiderable depth, when 1 or 3 miles eaftward 
the fields are clothed in their blafted verdure. Here, too, 
we have often what are called fummer-fhowers, which are 
very partial. A cloud is carried along a tracl: of ground, 
fometimes not more than 500 or 600 yards wide, pouring 
down a temporary deluge. In winter, again, a fhower of 
fnow, inftead of rain, frequently paffes over a like extent, 
and in the fame dire&amp;ion. The phyiical caufe feems to

be a frequent interchange of clouds between the fummite 
of 2 oppofite hills, Bennachie and Mormond. The former 
is diftant from us about 20 miles S. W. the latter about 
8 or 9 miles N. E. But this observation is not to be con- 
fined to this place alone ; for fuch phenomena, 1 believe, 
are common to almoft every part of Scotland—There are 
no difeafes peculiar to this parilh. Rheumatifm is the 
moft general complaint among the men, and nervous dis- 
orders among the women. To account for the prevalence 
of thefe diforders, I need only mention the employment of 
the former, which, after hard exercife in the morning, is to 
go out and Stir a damp field ; and the fedentary occupation 
of the latter, which is chiefly Spinning or knitting of Stock- 
ings. Scrofulous, confumptive, and afthmatic complaints 
are not fo common. In autumn 1791, a putrid kind of 
fore throat, which firft made its appearance about the coaft 
Side, Sound its way into this parifli. Since that, it has con- 
tinued to rage in different places, with great virulence, and 
little intermiSSion, and is peculiarly fatal to the young, and 
people of a full constitution. No effectual remedy has yet 
been discovered for this contagious diforder; and the only 
approved medicines are a vomit at SirSt, and then Jefuit's 
bark, continued Several times a-day, in a glaSs oS Port 
wine. A very malignant Sever, too, has prevailed this 
winter. Some were carried off by it in eight days illneSs, 
while others have been languishing as many weeks. 

Natural Hijlory, Antiquities, ifc. — There is neither 2 
wood, hill nor river in the parifli •, confequently no qua- 
drupeds, migratory or aquatic birds, but Such as are com- 
mon : nor are there any remarkable fofflls. There is, 
however, reafon to believe, that this parifli once abounded 
in wood ; for veftiges of oak, hazel, and other hard wood, 
(but no fir), are to be found in every mofs. Springs and 

jrivulets, 



of New Beer.

rivulets, Efficient for driving, mills and light machinery, 
are very plenty. There are alio lome chalybeate wells, 
but none of thefe have attained to any great repute. On 
a farm in the head of the panih there aie 3 contiguous 
fprin^s, which run in as many different directions. One of 
them runs ealtward, increaiing conliderably in its courfe, 
till it joins the water of btnehen. Thefe form the water 
of Ugie, which falls into the fea at Peterhead. Another 
of them runs fouthward into Ythan, and falls into the fea 
at Newburgh. The third runs ]N. W. into Doveran, and 
falls into the fea at Banff. This is the circumftance above 
alluded to, and from which we inferred the height of the 
parilh. — Remains of feveral Druidical temples are to be 
feen. The place where one of them ltood is about half a 
mile N. from the church, and ftill retains the name of 
" Handing Hones." In view of this, and about a mile trom 
the chinch, directly S. there was another. This is not yet 
all removed, and the former was but lately taken away, to 
lay the foundation of the preient manie. There are alfo 
feveral tumuli or fmall cairns, fome of which have been 
dug up, and found to contain urns inclofed in ftone coffins. 
The coffins wtre compofed of flags of ftone from 3 to 4 
feet long, and fo clofely laid together, that no dull could 
penetrate. The urns, which to the eye appeared quite 
found, but mouldered at a touch, were placed near one of 
the corners, and contained fragments of human bones and 
allies. About 2 miles north from the church ftands an 
old caftle, called Fedderatt, which appears to have been a 
place of confide rable ftrength. It is furrounded partly by 
a toffe, and partly by a morafs, fo that there could have 
been no accefs to it, but by a caufeway (which is ftill vi- 
fible) and a draw-bridge. Water, it feems, had been con- 
veyed to it by means of pipe? ; for pieces of them have, 
at different times, been torn up by the plough. Accord-

ing to tradition, it was built by one Crawford ; but at what 
time we cannot learn. It afterward came into the pof- 
feflion of the Irvines of Drum, and is now the property of 
Lord Aberdeen. It is alfo faid to have been one of the 
laft ftrong holds of James II. 's partifans, who, after the battle 
of Killycrankie, pollened themfelves of Fyvie caftle, and, 
being obliged to abandon it, took refuge in Fedderatt ; but 
were purfued, and expelled by King William's troops. In 
the weft fide of the parifti there is an extenfive piece of 
moor, called Brucehill. This is faid to have been fo named 
from Edward, brother to King Robert Bruce. Here he is 
reported to have encamped foon after the battle of Inveru- 
ry, and from this to have marched in purfuit of the Cum- 
mins, to a place near the village of Deer, called Aiky-hrae, 
or Oaky-brae. And this is partly corroborated by Joan 
Major, (de. geft. Scot. Fol. 83. lib. 5.) who relates, that 
Edward there engaged and routed the Cummins in the 
year 1308. In memory of this viftory, the market of 
Aiky fair is faid to have been eftablifhed, which Hands on 
the fpot where the battle was fought. 

Population, i$c. — From the return made to Dr Web- 
fter 40 or 50 years fince, the number of fouls then was 
2313. The amount of the prefent population is 2800 
fouls, of whom 1324 are males, and 1476 females. Thefe 
are all of the Eftablifhed Church, except . 156 Seceders, 
(there being a Seceding meeting^houfe in the parifh,) 40 
Epifcopalians, and 6 Roman Catholics.

There are 11 heritors, 4 of whom, at prefent, refide. 
Tradefmen and mechanics, excluding apprentices, are as 
follows : Merchants, 20 ; tailors, 28 ; weavers, 27 ; 
wrights, 25; fmiths, 19; fhoemakers, 17; mafons, 7 ; 
dyers, 2 ; and 1 phvfician. The annual average of bap- 
tifms for 7 years previous to 1783, is 50^; and for 9 years 
fince, ending 1791, it is but 33^. The only caufe that 
can be afligned for this decreafe, is the tax upon regiftra- 
tion ; for, fince this tax commenced, there are many chil- 
dren (particularly females) born and baptized in the pa- 
rifh, whofe names are not inferted in the regifter ; be- 
caufe their parents are unwilling to pay the duty. 
This indeed is not fo much the cafe in regard to males, for 
two very obvious reafons, the chance of emigrations, and 
the difficulty of getting an exemption from labour upon 
the public roads, without an attefted extra£l from the re- 
gifter to mow that they are fuperannuated. It was there- 
fore deemed proper to give the average of baptifms, pre- 
vious to the date of the acl:, becaufe no certain conclufion, 
with regard to population, can be drawn from them fince 
that period, and, even before, many of them were never 
defired to be regiftered; otherwife, inftead of 50, the 
average number would have amounted nearly to 70.— 
Marriages and burials only began to be regiftered in 1785; 
and the average of the former, for 7 years ending 1791, is 
i8|-, and 31^ burials. But neither of thefe can afford any 
certain data for calculation, for many ftrangers are buried

here, many parifhioners are carried to neighbouring burying 
grounds, and many are not regiftered at all, in confequence 
of the duty not being, paid •, and marriages are regiftered 
only when the bride refides in the parifli. The prefent 
number of inhabitants, at a moderate calculation, is one- 
third greater than it was 30 or 40 years ago. This increafe 
is to be afcribed to the parcelling out of large farms, and 
the abundance of mofs and lime. The number of ploughs 
is about 230, of old ploughgates 80, of horfes 712, of 
cattle 3200, and of Iheep there may be from 1300 to 1400. 
Small farms, rent from L. 5 to L. 10 ; middle-fized farms 
from L. 10 to L. 20; large farms from L. 30 to L. 40 : 
there is one at L. 50, and another about L. 80. A general 
meafurement of the parifti has never been made ; nor 
can it be precifely ftated what is the rent the acre. Where 
furveyors have been employed, they have ufually rated 
the outfield at 6 s. and the infield at 12 s.; but the infield 
now generally lets from 12 s. to 18 s. or 20 s. and the out- 
field nearly in proportion. 

Stipend, School, Poor, \3c. — The prefent flipend is 600 
merks Scots, 4 chalders of meal, and L. 5 Sterling for 
communion-elements. The glebe, including manfe and 
offices, &amp;x. is fcarcely 4 acres and a half. The Crown is 
patron. The age of the prefent incumbent is 86, and who 
has been minifter for 56 years.— There is a very good 
fchool-houfe ; the number of fcholars, at an average through 
the year, is between 3c and 40. The fchoolmafter's fala- 
ry is about L. 4 Sterling. This, with 30 s. as feffion -clerk, 
fchool-fees, and fome other fmall perquifites, may amount 
to L. 12 yearly, which is all his emolument.— The num- 
ber of poor on the roll is 60 and upwards. The annual 
amount of the funds for their relief, arifingfrom the week- 
ly collections, intereft of money, &amp;c, is about L. jo. This,

with the charitable aid of their neighbours, removes the 
neceffity of their becoming vagrants, and makes them live 
pretty comfortably. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatlons.— The people are remarkably 
fober and humane, and very diligent in their callings. 
There is but 1 licenfed public-houfe, and but little fre- 
quented, except by travellers. The induftry of thofe in the 
farming line here, as in moft places, is not always attend- 
ed with that fuccefs which might be wilhed. Seafons and 
circumftances, for fome years, have been much againft 
them. Since 1782 the harvefts have been very late and 
precarious. The price of meal (which, at an average, may 
be valued at 12 s. the boll) bears no proportion to the 
price of every article the farmer has to buy. But what is 
moft complained of at prefent, is the extravagant wages of 
their fervants, which, for fome years, have advanced at the 
rate of 10 s. the year *. For thefe reafons, the condition of 
mechanics and fubtenants (who depend more upon their 
trade than the produce of the ground, and do hot require 
fervants) is preferable to that of farmers. The condition of 
the farmers, as well as of the farms, might be meliorated by 
longer leafes ; and by converting, at a moderate rate, that 
part of their rent which is paid in kind into mo ey. i his 
would leave the farmer at more liberty to profecute that 
mode of farming which he found moft fuccefsful ; whereas, 
when a large proportion of his rent is paid in meal, he is 

tempted

ftone ; beef and mutton, from 2 d. to 3 d. the pound ; hens, from x s. to 
1 s. 4 d. a pair ; ducks a little higher ; and eggs from 3 d. to fid the do- 
zen. Wages of a man fervant are from L. 6 to L. 8 a-year; of a maid 
fervant, from L. 3 to L. 4 ; of day-labourers, 8 d. a-day, with victuals, or

tempted to overcrop, that he may make fure his rent. 
The moor and wafte ground might be improved by letting 
it, free of rent, for a certain number of years. This in- 
ducement would do more than counterbalance every ob- 
ftacle ; for the molt of it is dry, free of ftoies, of a fandy 
bottom, and the means of improvement at hand. Encou- 
ragement xor inclofmg, efpecially where theleafesare ibort, 
would be beneficial. The multures exafted at mills are 
conlidered as a grievance, and fome of the heritors are con- 
verting them into money. The diftance from any fea- 
port, or market place, is another difadvantage. This, how- 
ever, might in a great meafure be removed, by leading a 
canal from Peterhead to the neighbouring parilh of Deer ; 
which, by molt people, is thought not impracticable. If a 
fund fufficient for this purpole could not be raifed by contri- 
bution in the neighbourhood, application might be made to 
Government for fome affiftance, which is feldom made in 
vain, when public utility is the petitioner.

(Countt of Forfar, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Pkesbytery of Forfar.) 

By the Rev. Mr David Fernet.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, Air, %£c. 

THE name is of Gaelic derivation, and fignifies " out 
" from the bogg." This name applies with peculiar 
propriety to the old manfion-houfe of the eftate of Kin- 
nettles, which was built dole to a piece of marfhy ground, 
Hill called the Bogg *. The church being built within the 
boundaries of this eftate, that circumftance probablj gave 
the name of Kinnettles to the parilh. The form of the 
parifh is nearly a fquare, having about a Englilh miles 
for the length of each of its 4 fides. The fouth line or 
boundary feems, however, to be rather fhorter than any 
of the other three. The parilh is divided by a hill, one 
part of which is called Brigton, the other Kinnettles. 
The hill is arable, except a few acres of rocky land on 

that 



* The manfion-houfe is now removed about a furlong farther from the 
nurlh. 



198 Statijlical Account 



that divifion of it which belongs to Kinnettles, which arc 
planted. There are a few. acres of woodland on the Brig- 
ton lide. The hill continues to defcend to the S. within 
a fmall diftance from a rivulet which runs through the 
fouthern diftricfc of the parifh. The weftern* defcent con- 
tains 4 inclofures, and then dies away into flat land. 
The northern continues the length of 3 inclofures •, after- 
ward the land is rather level, comprehending 3 inclofures 
alfo. There is a like number on the eaftern defcent, 
which is divided into two parts. South of the rivulet a 
range of Hoping banks declines to the N. as far as the ri- 
vulet. The plantations and pleafure grounds of Brigton 
extend on both fides of the little river with a fweep about 
an Englifli mile in length. The houfes of Brigton, Kin- 
nettles, Inverighty, with the pleafure ground, have a good 
effect. — Our foil is various, confiding fome of it of brown 
clay, fome of loam, of loam with a mixture of clay, of 
loam with a mixture of fund ; fome of it is in quality al- 
moft mere fand. Of this laft kind there is but a fmall pro- 
portion. Our clay and black foil are deep and fertile; 
fome of the ftrong land yields from 8 to 12 bolls an acre, 
particularly in oats after ley, when it is well laid down. 
Even the light foil has produced good crops wpth marl and 
kindly treatment. — The air is not fo much infelled with 
fogs as in fome other dillri&amp;s in Scotland, being rather dry 
and healthful. We have no difeafes that can be faid to be 
local. Agues are fcarcely known ; fevers not epidemical ; 
melancholy habits are equally rare here as in moft other 
diftrifts. The moft epidemical fever in my remembrance, 
was about the beginning of fpring 1780. after an uncom- 
monly wet winter, in a village low and wet. Our air is 
fharp in winter, and frofty in proportion as the Grampians 
arc covered with fnow. We have feveral freeftone quar- 

riesj

ties, which are made ufe of for building houfes and fences; 
fom'e of them yield ftones well a-dapted for the purpofe of 
hewing. 1 

Animals.— Cattle and horfes are in confiderable num- 
bers, 607 of the former, 130 of the latter. No fheep, but 
a few (about 40) kept principally for the ufe of gentle- 
mens families *. The farmers in the parifli rarely follow 
the plan of rearing cattle on their beft farms ; they rather 
buy in and fatten. Were they, however, to adopt the 
plan of rearing, they have the means of fo doing up to 36 
and 80 ftone weight, when the cattle have attained the age 
of 4 or 5 years ; and fuch cattle would bring, if fat, from 
5 s. to 7 s. the ftone, according to the demand and the 
pitch to which they may happen to be fed. 

Population, &amp;c — According to the return made to Dr 
Webfter in 1755, the number of fouls was then 616. The 
ftate of population cannot be traced far back with any de- 
gree of exa£tnefs. The tafte for enlarging farms, and 
razing cottages, has contributed not a little to diminifh the 
number of inhabitants in this and moil country parifhes in 
Angus. This diminution, however, is not fo great as 
might be expected from the number of houfes demolifh- 
ed. Farmers and others, keep more female fervants than 
are neceflary, folely for the bufinefs of hulbandry, and the 
fervice of their families. When not engaged in domeftic 
and farming bufinefs, they can find employment for them 
in fpinning yarn for the green linen manufacturers. But

the number gained in this manner is not equal to the num- 
ber loft by the razing o*-' houfes. The amount of the prefent 
population is 621, comprehending all ages ; males 325 ; 
females 296. There i^jio town in the parifh, only 1 vil- 
lage, containing 78. The number of births for 10 yeari 
preceding April 1790, was 165, making i6-£ yearly. There 
is no regifter of deaths kept here. Since 1783, on account 
of the tax, there has been a regifter of burials, which con- 
tains all that have been buried here, whether parifhioners 
or ftrangers. This would have given certain information 
of the deaths in the parifh, had it not been cuftomary here 
not to confine the burying of their dead to the church- 
yard of the parifh. From October 1783 to October 1790, 
there have been 28 marriages. But this article may rea- 
dily occafion a miftake, and a return of many more mar- 
riages may poffibly be given than have actually taken place 
in it. When the bridegroom refides in one parifh, and the 
bride in another, there may be a report of the fame mar- 
riage from both thefe parifhes.

markable old age here. Exclufive of pendicle tackfmen, 
who depend not on farming alone for their fubfiftence, we 
have 16 farmers, befides 2 gentlemen who farm part of 
their own eftates. Their families in all contain 167 per-

ftance of non-reiidence on thefe farms diminifhes conucler- 
ably the number of this clafs. The number of heritors is 
5 , and 2 of them refide. The number of manufacturers 
is' 5 8 ; of handicraftfmen, 20 ; apprentices, 6. Houfehold 
fervants are 5 male, 16 female. There are 76 labouring 
fervants, 51 male, 25 female; here I have marked only 
hired fervants. With molt of our farmers, the Yons and 
daughters of the family fupply, in a confiderable degree, 
the place of fervants. There is 1 artift employed in con- 
ducing a flax-yarn mill. Labouring fervants often go 
from one parifli to another. We have 2 rending heritors, 
Mr Douglas of Brigton, and Mr Bower of Kinnettles,  • 
of Kincaldrum. Their families conlift of 25 perfons, exclu- 
live of domeftic fervants. Lord Strathmore is one of the 
heritors, but has no manfion-houfe here ; alio Mr Simfon 
of Inverighty, who has a manfion-houfe here, but refides 
in Edinburgh. There is 1 clergyman, 26 Epifcopalians, 5 
Roman Catholics, 1 Seceder, 589 of the Eftablilhed Church, 
93 married men, 45 bachelors at the age of 21, widowers,

as it was 25 years ago. Farmers were then accuftomed to 
have 1 or 2 houfes on their farms, with a fmall quantity of 
land, which were intended for the accommodation of one 
or two married fervants. Since the inclofmg and labour- 
ing of ground with attention have taken place, that ac- 
commodation for married fervants is withdrawn, and o- 
ther fervants are thereby difcouraged from marrying. The 
fervant finds, too, that when married, he cannot fo eafrly 
find a place with a farmer, whom, perhops, he would be 
moft willing to ferve ; nor are maflers, in general, fond of 
retaining married fervants. In fad, there is no clafs a- 
mong whom marriages are fo infrequent, as farmers fer- 
vants. 

Produclions, Agriculture, Ifc. — Almoft all the vegetables, 
plants and trees in Scotland are to be found here, and thrive 
in our foil and climate ; and we have fuch animals as are 
common to the low countries of Scotland. Rent of befl a- 
rable land is from 18 s. to L. 1, 5s. the acre. Size of farms 
is from 42 to 200 acres, and upwards. Farms, at an ave- 
rage, about L. 88 yearly. There is at leaft 4-5ths of the 
parilh inclofed. The number of acres under the different 
crops, at prefent, is nearly as follows : — 583 in oats, 335 in 
barley, 26 in wheat, 33 in peafe, 28 in lint, 84 in turnips, 
22 in potatoes, 174 in cutting grafs, and 777 in pafture ; a- 
mounting in all to nearly 20654 acres. There are 31 ploughs, 
drawn by 3 or 4 horfes ; 56 carts ; 1 coach ; 1 two-wheel- 
ed chaife. Excluiive of what fome heritors retain in their

own hands, the land-rent of the parifh may be about L. 1600 
Sterling. The parifh fupplies itfelf with pro virions. Be- 
fides what is fufficient for that purpofe, a confiderable quan- 
tity of oatmeal is fent to the neighbouring towns ; and 
perhaps of our barley is conveyed partly to the towns 
in the county, and partly to others at a greater diftance, to 
be manufactured there. The attention of our farmers has 
never been turned to the railing of hemp. We know not 
what it is in this country to turn land into grafs, without 
fowing it with grafs-feeds. All our hay- grafs, and pafture 
on land fit for tillage, are artificial graffes. We have fome 
pafture (about 120 acres) on mire and mofs ground, which 
is natural grafs ; fuch lands having not, as yet, been 
brought under culture. There are about 20 acres of moor, 
and 12 or 16 of plantations. The grafs-feeds fown here 
are red and white clover, about 19 or 20 lb. to the acre, 
2-3ds red, and i-3d white. We add 6 or 8 pecks of rye- 
grafs feed, which has frequently a mixture of rib-grafs or 
plantane. Commonly this artificial grafs is cut the two 
firft years for hay, and houfe- feeding for cows and horfes in 
fummer. I attempted once to introduce the tall yellow 
clover, and commiffioned a quantity of the feed of that 
grafs, as being of a lefs dangerous quality than the red clo- 
ver. I was diiappointed, having got only a dwarf, grovel- 
ling, unprofitable kind, inftead of that which I commif- 
fioned. I never attempted to introduce it again, nor has it 
as yet found its way into the parilh *.

be little ftraw, and altogether a deficient crop, if it be not fown confider- 
ably later. Englilh barley, which demands our beft foil, and in the high- 
eft condition, requires to be fown from the 20th of April to the 5th of 
May, in order to produce good and fufficiently early grain ; Scotch barley, 
from the beginning to the 15th of May; common Scotch bear, from the 
10th to the 25th of May. Our peafe are of the haftings kind, and do not 
require to be fown before the middle or 20th of April. Lint-feed, from 
the 20th to the end of April. It was earlier with fpme laft feafon, by 14 
or 20 days ; but where this was the cafe, the feed lay uncommonly long in 
the ground without fhooting ; fome of it was fickly during a good part of 
fummer ; nor could it be faid to be fooner ready for pulling, than that 
which had been fown about the ufual time. Smart nights and mornings 
are frequent about the end of April, rendering the lint crop very un- 
certain, if it get above ground before the lft of May. They plant pota- 
toes from the 2oth of April to the beginning of May ; and fow turnips 
from the loth to the 20th or 22d of June. The reaping time muft vary 
according to the nature of the fummer. Hay, which is not intended for 
feed, is cut from the ift to the loth of July ; what is intended for rye- 
grafs feed, 8 or 10 days later. Lint harveft is from the 12th to the 25th 
of Auguft, fometimes a few, days later. The earlieft and lateft com- 
mencement of baney harveft, which I remember, was the 15th of Auguft, 
and \hc laft day of September. In the years 1775, 1779, and 1 783, the 
barley harveft began from the 15th to the 1 8th of Auguft ; in the year 
1782, it began the laft day of September. The barley harveft ufually be- 
gins about the ift or 5th of September. Wheat is cut down about the 
fame time with barley. Our barley, for the moft part, begins to be cut 
down about 10 or 14 days before the beginning of oat harveft. In 1779, 
the corns on dry farms were all got in by the loth or 1 2th of September. 
In 1782, they were not got in with fome till the 22d of November; 
with others, fome days later.

is faici to have been a native of this parifh. — The people 
in general are of an equal degree of ftrength, compared 
with che inhabitants of other counties in Scotland. We 
have fome who may be accounted ftrong. One man, in 
particular, might ftand high in the lift of ftrong men in 
any county of Britain. The talleft man, within our 
bounds, wants, I think, about half an inch of 6 feet high. 
They are of different fiz.es, from about 6 feet down to 5 
feet 4 or 5 inches, perhaps a very few below that height. 
The ordinary ftature is about 5 feet 7 inches. Women, 
in general, are about 5 feet high. Exclulive of ftioes, we 
have ladies, whofe height is from 5 feet 4 to 5 feet 7 in- 
ches. The complexions of the people, are fome ruddy^ 
fome pale. They have all, however, a healthy appear- 
ance ; and are pretty remarkable for an acutenefs of ge- 
nius, which enables them to attain to dexterity in the dif- 
ferent occupations in which they employ their talents. — 
The people are very much difpofed to induftry. The on- 
ly manufacture is green linen, or ofnaburgh. There are 
58 hands employed in that branch of weaving. We have 
a fpinning mill for flax yarn. It is on a fmall fcale, in- 
tended to contain 120 pirns. A corn mill is converted to 
that purpofe. It is in contemplation of the Company to 
extend their plan, if the experiment now making mall an- 
fwer their expectations. In the mean time, they are bufy 
adjufting their apparatus, of which they have made trial 
and the yarn which it throws, looks well, and is thought 
to be of a very good quality. This work is carrying on 
by virtue of a leafe of patent privilege from a Company 
in England.— We have but very few inftances of fondnels 
for a feafaring life. Nor are the people much addicted 
to a military one : the army not having, at any period, in

here. The inhabitants in general are (Economical, and 
augment, rather than diminifh their flock. They are well 
clothed and fed. Superior indultry affords them a plenti- 
ful fupply of the neceffaries and comforts of life. Among 
one clafs, however, ceconomy does not feem to have been 
much regarded. — The whole landed property has been 
transferred by fale fince the year 1743. Price3 of land 
have been, I prefume, about 25 years purchafe, or perhaps 
a little more. — We have few calls for extraordinary exer- 
tions of humanity : in clamant cafes of diftrefs, I can eafi- 
ly believe our people capable of extraordinary beneficence. 
They enjoy, in a confiderable degree, the advantages and 
comforts of fociety : contented with their accommodation, 
few remove to diftant parts of the country, or emigrate to 
foreign countries. — The circumftances moft extenfively 
diftreffing, are thofe which affect the manufacturers of 
green linen. They depend on two countries, Ruffia for 
their raw materials, and the Weft Indies and part of A- 
merica for the fale of their manufacture. A bad crop of 
flax in Ruffia, or the jobbing fpirit of the merchants there', 
or extraordinary profits to the importers, of the flax, often 
reduce the profits of thefe manufacturers to a mere trifle. 
This evil, I think, might be removed, if flax raifing could 
be brought to a fyftem, which would render a flax crop 
equally certain with any other crop. Our foil is pretty 
much adapted to the raifing of flax, and the plan of farm- 
ing here is fuch, that the farmer could eafily employ a 
few acres in cultivating it. In this cafe, there would be 
only the chance of the fale market againft the manufactu- 
rers. But although grievances were redreffed as much as 
poflible, it is ftill a queftion, whether that is not the moft 
defirable manufacture which is fupplied with materials 
from the country itfelf, and has the benefit of a home 
market, founded on the natural demand of the inhabitants

* The pUblic road from Perth, through Strathmore, which paffes thro' 
this parifli, is repairing on a rfew plan, and will foon be finiflied within 
our bounds, unlefs it fhall be deemed neceflary to widen it. It was be- 
gun to be repaired in autumn 1789. Owing to the fpirited plan of fub- 
fcriptions from the gentlemen in the county, the road from Forfar to Dun- 
dee, part of which paffes through this parifli, is proceeding on the fame 
plan. All the county roads in Angus are to be repaired from the fub- 
fcription-fund. We are much indebted to the exertions of Mr Douglas 
ofBrigton, who tranfadls and fuperintends the bufmefs of the road from 
Forfar to Dundee, and' for feveral miles on the Strathmore road. To ren- 
der the road convenient, fteep banks are avoided, and on Mr Douglas's 
ground in this parifh, the road takes a new direction for ii miles through 
inclofures of land of very excellent quality. The rule is not to admit, if 
poffible, above 1 foot of rife in 20. Thefe roads have turnpikes, and all 
the county roads either have or are to have them. Our farmers are much 
reconciled to turnpikes, and imagine that the accommodation obtained in 
this way, is cheap. Statute- labour is not exacted in kind. Since the plan 
by fubfeription took place, the commutation-money is to be applied to the 
repairing of the private roads. We have two bridges in the parifli ; one 
on the road from Forfar to Glammis, was built by fubfeription, at leaft in 
part, about a 1 years fince, and is in good condition; the other, on the 
road from Forfar to Dundee, is intended to be taken down, and another 
built at fome fmall diftance.— In the year 1782, our driell lands were not 
fit for receiving feed till the 16th or 17th of April. There was not a blade 
of oats to be feen till about the 12th of May, in this neighbourhood, 
which is rather an early diftrict. The barley-feed time was very back- 
ward. About the 29th of May, we had rain for 50 hours, without in- 
termifllon. The fummer was cold and wet; and on the 16th of Auguft, 
we had an uncommon flood, which chilled the ground fo as to deprive it 
of the warmth neceflary for filling and ripening the corns. On the morn- 
ing of the 12th of September, we ha.d hoarfroft as thick as at Chriftmas. 
About 7 o'clock that morning, the fun was bright, and had influence fuf- 
ficient to melt the froft ; and, in a few minutes, peafe and potatoes had the 
look of having been dipped in boiling water. The effect of this froft 
made the farmer imagine that harveft was nigh. The corns affumed a 
v hitilh appearance, and the firft rain threw it in appearance feveral ftages

as at that period. Their drefs is more gay, and expenfive 5 
their living more plentiful. Though it is not the cafe in 
this pariih, to any confiderable degree, in fhow, expenfe, 
manner of living, and drefs, there is an imitation of fupe- 
riors creeping into the country. Perhaps 30 years ago, the 
boundaries between the ranks were more dittinttly marked, 
and more attentively obferved. Inferior ranks begin not to 
fcruple to invade the boundaries of thofe above them. The 
genius of the people leads them to induftry and enterprife 
belides, they are very communicative. This difpofition 
fuffers "no experiment to lie concealed, either as to the man- 
ner

green, according as froft or rain happened to prevail. Our lower, ableft, 
and beft lands, which will produce 8, 10, or n bolls of oats an acre in 
good years, yielding from 15 to 16, or perhaps 17 pecks of meal the boll, 
that year yielded 4 or 5 bolls an acre, and thefe yielding not above 8, io, 
Or 1 1 pecks of meal the boll. I heard of fome oats in the county, which 
yielded only mill daft, inftead of meal. Bailey of that crop, which was 
much ufed for meal, fell greatly fliort, both of its ufual quantity and qua- 
lity, he higher grounds, raifed above the region of the noxious hoar- 
frofts, had a more equal progrflfs towards ripening. And thefe high, weak, 
light grounds, not reaped till the month of November, produced oats, 
yielding about 1 5 pecks of meal the boll. Thefe grounds were lefs hurt 
by the froft and rain. Of that crop, farmers paying confiderable rents, 
could fcarcely procure as much oat-meal from their farms, as was fufrici- 
ent for their own families, and oats for fowing their ground. People, both 
in towns and the country, travelled the country, and particularly this pa- 
riih, where we had feveral mills, and thought themfelves lucky if they 
could obtain a peck or two of meal, to fupply the immediate and urgent 
demands of their families. They would gladly have given more than the 
high current price, to have been anured of finding it at any particular 
place. The fcarcity continued through fummer 1783 ; and had it not 
been for a fupply of Englifh oats from Leith, I doubt not but fome muft 
have perifhed for *«nt. Some farmers, forefeeing the diftreffed condition 
of the country, fowed fome barley early. Great quantities of potatoes 
were planted, and the harveft of 1783 was early. By thefe means, the 
country obtained a fpeedy and pretty plentiful fupply. Amidft the fcar- 
city of provifions, there was one comforting circumilance. The people, ift 
general, were not diftreffed for want of money.

ner of conducting it, or as to its fuccefs. Their fpirit of 
enterprife makes them eafily adopt a new plan, when fair- 
ly recommended by its fuccefs j and their induftry fecures 
their doing justice to any plan which they may adopt. 
Free from the fetters of prejudice, they follow, let the 
leader be whom he will, if they are warranted by fair, 
well tried, fuccefsful experiments. That fpirit has brought 
this country to be able to fupport double or triple the 
number of inhabitants, which it could have done 30 or 40 
years ago. A great deal of wafte ground has been brought 
under culture ; and lands which then would have yielded 
3 or 4 bolls an acre, now produce 8 or 10, and fometimes 
more. This is the cafe, more or lefs, with the country of 
Strathmore, and in the county of Angus : I know no part 
of the country where farming is carried on to greater per- 
fection than in this very parith — Befides a great increafe 
in the quantity of corn, there is a considerable addition of 
profit by the rearing and fattening of cattle. Instead of 
the dinted and famifhed breed, of which the farmer's store 
confided 40 years ago, cattle can now be reared to a con- 
siderable fiz.e, and fetch a decent price, to compenfate the 
trouble and expenfe \ fatted cattle generally fell well. Our 
farmers fatten through the winter, fome 10, fome 16, fome 
20, fome 30 cattle. Some of thefe are partly fed with tur- 
nips, draw and hay ; fome with turnips and hay. Such 
as are fed wholly on turnips and hay, can be brought to 
a degree of fatnefs, not exceeded in any part of Scotland. 
The greateft part of our pallure and hay foggage is em- 
ployed for the purpofe of fattening. Turnip crops keep 
the land clean, and the great proportion of pafture gives 
them vigour to produce good corn crops when broken up.

its influence ; I mean the pitiful living of fchoolmafters. 
In fact, there is no occupation among us, or in the country 
in general, from which greater profits may not be obtain- 
ed. What extent of learning and qualifications is to be 
demanded or expected from a perfon, whofe office yields 
him hardly the bare neceflaries of life ? I think we are 
juft on the verge of having fchools remaining vacant j the 
office being dripped of every thing that can induce a man 
of any capacity to accept of it. — Allow me to make ano- 
ther obfervation. In refpect to the poor, matters feem to 
be very improperly conducted. We are importuned by 
people from almoft every county in Scotland ; whofe {lo- 
ries may be true or falfe ; and whofe circumftances may 
therefore entitle them to charity, or may not. Much good 
would accrue to the public, if fuch vagrants were con- 
fined to their refpective parifhes. Their circumftances 
might then be exactly known ; temptations to falfehood 
would be taken away ; idlenefs would be prevented ; per- 
fons able to contribute in any refpecl: to their fubfiftence, 
would be obliged to exert their induftry, or would fuffer 
the reward due to their neglect. Here, however, an ob- 
jection occurs, namely, That fome parifhes, from the fcan- 
tinefs of their funds, and the great number of their poor^ 
are unable to fupply, in any comfortable manner, all the 
poor within their bounds. Where collections, dedicated 
to the fupport of the poor, are not fufficient for neceflary 
fupplies, let there be affeffments. This would oblige land- 
ed gentlemen, and others, on whom fuch aiTeflments might 
be chiefly laid, to exert themfelves, by introducing manu- 
factures, or other means of fubfiftence. The number of 
poor would thereby be diminiflied ; thofe who might ftill 
need parochial fupply, would be lefs indigent, and others 
become able to bear a part of the burden of the unavoidably 

poor.

poor. So long as mankind are fupported by ftrolling, the 
induftry and ingenuity of thoufands muft be loft to the 
community, and vice cherifhed to a confiderable degree. 
—The decreafe of population in country parifties, and the 
great refort of people to towns, is an evil much to be re- 
gretted. Though this mode mould continue, it is not im- 
probable that there may be ftill a gradual increafe of in- 
habitants over Scotland. But the queftion is, by which of 
thefe two plans may population be fuppofed to increafe 
moft ; whether, by a well peopled ftate of country parifti- 
es, or by extending and crowding the towns. In all infec- 
tious diitempers, fuch as fevers, fmall-pox, meafles, hoop- 
ing cough, the danger to children is greateft in towns. As 
to inoculated fmall pox, the diftemper may be introduced 
in towns at a favourable feafon, and, when introduced, it 
takes its range of infection, and before its courfe is finifli- 
ed, the hot unfavourable feafon arrives, and the diftemper 
generally becomes malignant and fatal. In the courifty, 
infection from this diftemper may be more eafily avoided, 
and I hope to fee whole pariihes taking fuch rational

houfe to go to decay, which is not conducive to the bene- 
fit of a farm ? Might not the building one or two neat 
villages in every country parifli, be the means of prevent- 
ing this great concourfe of inhabitants to the towns. They 
might be erected in a dry lituation, and calculated for con- 
venience as well as health. Suppofing thefe villages to be 
inhabited by mechanics, manufacturers, day -labourers, 
farmers fervants and widows, there might be one or two 
fmall farmers connected with the village, who might have 
leifure, and be induced to perform carriages to the villa- 
gers for hire *. 

* Perfonal fervices are ftill performed here. They are fpecified and 
limited. Occupiers of a houfe and garden, or of a houfe, garden, and one 
or two acres of land, perform fome days work occafionally, as the pro- 
prietor may happen to require them in the courfe of the year. Such te- 
nants as poflefs ground fufficient to enable them to keep a horfe, befides 
the above fervices, are bound to perform two horfeback carriages in the 
courfe of the year, as far as Dundee, which is about 12 miles, or to a fimi- 
lar diftance. Greater tenants are bound to bring a certain number of 
bolls of coals from Dundee to the proprietors houfe, which require 2 or 3 
days work of their carts Befides, they mult give a day's work of all their 
reapers, for cutting down the proprietors corns. Thefe go by the gene- 
ral name of fervices, in place of the old arrhage and carriage, which were 
very comprehenfive. Arrhage, I take to be from the J.atin, arc, to till ; 
and implied the driving out of the manure for the proprietor's farm, 
ploughing and harrowing his ground, reaping in harveft, and bringing 
home his hay and corns. The old fervice of carriage was very unlimited, 
and very tyrannically exacted.— From 16 to 30 years back, from the pre- 
fent time, about 37 cottages were razed, or became ruinous. From 10 to 
1 7 years back, 10 or 11 new cottages have been ere&amp;ed; an increafe of 
fmall houfes has begun to take place; a mill, for fpinning flax-yarn, is 
building ; and a village is begun, for accommodating the hands to be em- 
ployed, which will require a confiderable number of houfes. The em- 
ploying of cottagers in agriculture, increafes population. A houfe for ac- 
commodating a family, is a confiderable inducement for a fervant to mar. 
ry • and, from having a houfe and an acre or two of land, a fervant is 
more inclined to remain in his matter's fervice. Hired fervants are apt to 
be teuchy and petulant, by being lefs dependent, as having it more eafily

however, has the chance of obtaining more extenfive knowledge, by lbme- 
times changing his place. — There is no poll-town nearer than Forfar, a-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1987199">BALMERINO</name>, 

(County and Synod of Fife, Presbytery of 

Cupar.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Thomson.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Climate, &amp;c. 

r I "HIS parifti takes its name from a fmall village upon 
the banks of the river Tay, anciently fpelt Balmure- 
nach, fignifying, as would appear from the Gaelic, " Sailors 
" Town and the old abbey of that name is called by 
Leflie Balmurceum, and by Fordun, Habitaculum ad Mare. 
This parifti ftretches along the banks of the Tay in % 
ranges of hills. The medium length from E. to W. by a 
pretty exact meafurement, about 34 miles, and its breadth 
from N. to S. nearly 2^ miles. It is almoft a femicircle, 
with the church in the centre, and the northern half of the 
circle cut off by the Tay. From the above meafurement, 
it mult exceed 3000 Scots acres ; about 2-3ds of it is ara- 
ble, and fupports more than 700 people old and young. 
There are no difeafes peculiar to the parifti ; on the con- 
trary, 



of Balmerino. 



tr?.ry, the people may be faid to be healthy. There were 
4 perfons who died within thefe 10 years upwar of 90; 
and there are feveral now alive above 80 years of age. 
The wholefomenefs of the climate appears alio from the 
fruitfulnefs of the females. The prefent incumbent has 
often, in the courfe of 10 years, had an opportunity of 
baptizing twins ; and there are 2 families in it at pieient, 
1 of whom has had thrice twins, and the other has five 
fens, now alive, at 2 births : The twins are youngeft, and 
Were baptized in the 1789. 

Soil and Culture. — As the lands lie on riling banks, they 
are for the m'oft part dry. The foil in general is thin and 
fharp, but very productive, lies on a gravel, or what is 
called here a rachelly bottom, except in fome places where 
it is tilly, or upon rock, and confeqnently wettifh ; and 
even this is much improved by draining, (which is now 
begun to be better underftood), though indeed it is to 
be wifhed that the Highland, or fome other fociety, would 
pay attention to that great improvement in agriculture, by 
offering a premium for the belt eflay on the moft effectual 
mode of draining lands. The method of culture and crop- 
ping varies even in this fmall parifh. The ploughing is 
now generally carried on by two horfes, managed by one 
fervant with a pair of long reins, and oxen are feidom 
yoked ; yet fome keep and work them both in the plough, 
hy themfelves, and in carriages. In cropping, fome adopt 
the following rotation : Four years in grafs, kept the 2 
firft years for hay, and the 2 lafl laid out into pafture, oats, 
barley, green crop, or fummer fallow, with a top dreffing 
Of lime, wheat, barley, and grafs-feeds, and fo on, having 
always 5-9ths in green crop and fummer fallow, 4 9tha 
in white crop, and never mote than 2 white crops in fuc- 
ceflion. Others, with what they call infield iand, take 2

years grafs, i year in hay, and the other in pafture, oats,, 
barley, oats, green crop, or fummtr fallow, wheat, and ; 
barley, with grafs feeds •, outfield, 2 years grafs paftured, 
oats, barley, oats and grafs-feeds. Thofe that adopt this 
mode of hufbandry, generally lime on the grafs from 
30 to 40 bolls of (hells an acre, and which, they think, 
will not admit of more lime for 20 or 30 years afterward. 
At the fame time, it mult be obferved, that molt of the 
outfield is now coming to be infield, from the fuperior 
mode of management adopted by the farmers. Some pre- 
pare with green crop, fuch as turnips, potatoes, or peafe 
for barley, with grafs feeds, 3 years grafs cut for hay 2 
years, and pafture the 3d •, oats, barley, green crop, and fo- 
on in rotation ; and lb me grafs and oats alternately. 

Produce. — The foil here is remarkably fitted for barley, 
and frequently produces large returns from the acre. The 
wheat, though of a good quality, feldom produces fo much. 
The oats are good, and have often been known to give 8 
ftone of meal the boll, Linlithgow meafure. The turnips 
feldom fail to produce a heavy crop. Peafe and beans are 
precarious, and cultivated chiefly with a view of preparing 
the foil for the after crop. Potatoes are good in quality, 
and often give large returns from the acre. Flax, efpecial- 
ly in new- drained lands, a weighty crop. The lands pro- 
duce more of every fort of grain than is fumcient for the- 
inhabitants. Moft of the wheat and barley is fent by the 
Tay to the Forth and Canal, and the oats are fold in the 
neighbourhood. This parifh, till within thefe 30 years, 
did not produce fo much grafs as to afFord pafture for the 
cattle neceffary for labouring the foil. At that time the 
farmers were forced to graze out a part, and depended 
chiefly upon their marfhy grounds for the fubfiftence of 
the remainder through the fummer. Now the bogs are 

almoft 



of Bahnerino. 



tlmoft all drained, and by the means of artificial graffes, the 
farmers are become remarkable for their fine breed of cat- 
tle, which are generally fold off at high prices, from 3 to 4 
years old ; and what are kept till they are full growth, are 
not to be excelled by any of the Fife breed. One farmer 
fold his 3 year old black cattle laft fummer, for fattening, 
at L. 9, 12 s. and the ftock on hand this year is eftetmed to 
be much ftronger and more valuable. There is a gentle- 
man who refides in the parilh, who fold laft feafon in Cupar 
fair, the 2 beft oxen, both for weight and beauty, that were 
in it. 

It is impoflible to fay what are the real rents of the pa- 
rilh, as they are paid part in viclual, part in money ; and 
hence rife and fall with the price of grain. Befides there 
are fome 100 acres occupied by feveral of the proprietors 
themfelves, the rents of which cannot be afcertained. The 
valued rent is L. 3944 : 9 : 2 Scots ; and the lands let as 
high as any in the neighbourhood. 

Population. — According to the return made to Dr Web- 
fter, the population was then 565. The number of fouls, 
when taken laft fummer, was, males 334 \ females 369 ; in . 
all 703. The parifh contains 162 houfts, 28 of which are 
occupied by widows and unmarried women. There are 
12 heritors, 3 great ones, and pofleffed of fmall property. 
Two of the principal heritors have their conftant refinance 
in it, and like wife 3 of the lefTer ones. There are 50 wea- 
vers, 4 wrights, 2 blackfmiths, 2 mafons, 7 tailors, 9 ihoe- 
makers, 1 miller, and 2 boatmen •, about 20 Seceders ; the 
remainder are farmers and labourers. There has been no 
•regular regifter of burials for a great number of years. 
The regifter of baptiima and marriages for the 10 years 
preceding 1782, is as follows :

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;.c. — The ftipend is 8 chalders of 
vi&amp;ual, and 200 merks Scots, (out of which the minifter 
has to furnifh the communionrelements) •, a glebe of about 
9 acres, with a manfe, garden, and office-houfes. — School- 
mafter's falary is 1 00 merks Scots; and the pariih-dues, which 
m^y amount to L. 3 Sterling, with a houfe and garden. — ■ 
There are no beggars ; fuch as are infirm by diftrefs or old

twice a-week to Dundee, and it is within two miles of 
Woodhaven, a public ferry, where boats conftantly ply ; 
thus cheefe-, butter, poultry, eggs, &amp;c. are eafily conveyed 
to a good market. By means of the Tay likewife, coal 
and lime are brought to Balmerino in fuch quantities, as to 
ferve all the purpofes of fuel and agriculture. And what 
is of the greateft importance, the harbour of Balmerino, a 
creek belonging to the cuftom houfe of Dundee, is the chief 
place on the fouth fide of the Tay for Ihipping wheat and 
barley for the Forth and Canal. The quay was at firft 
defigned for fhippiog lime from the Fife hills to Dundee ; 
now there is not a boll that comes from thence, but, on the 
contrary, fome thoufands from Charleftown on the Forth, 
and from South Sunderland, are delivered annually to the 
parifh and neighbourhood. This trade has been much on 
the increafe of late. The trade of fhipping wheat and bar- 
ley at this port began about 30 years ago ; at firft, only 
fome farm-bolls were fhipped, and afterward the mer- 
chants began to buy from the farmers at the weekly mar- 
ket in Cupar, and received their grain at Balmerino. Be- 
fore that period, the farmers carried their victual either 
to Dundee, where the merchants fhipped the furplus, or 
tranfported it upon horfeback to the fouth coaft. The 
number of bolls fhipped here laft year muft, from the near- 
eft calculation, have exceeded 7000. The harbour is but 
tri8ing, and may, no doubt, be improved •, but, as the bot- 
tom is good, fhips lie to and take in and deliver with eaft:. 
2d, This being in the neighbourhood of Dundee, a great 
manufacturing town, the weavers find plenty of work, and 
the fa&amp;ory-work finds conftant employment for all the 
women, who generally fpin with both hands, and are at 
prefent receiving at the rate of 17 d. the fpindle. 3 d y 
There are eight falmon-fifhings in the parifh, upon the 
ipanks of the Tay. Thefe fifhings are carried, on by means

of yairs or fcaffolds with poke-nets, and in fummer with 
fweep and toot nets. The firft are hauled when the fiffe 
rftrike the nets in their way up with the flowing tide. The 
fecond are payed off" and drawn in at a certain time of the 
tide, without knowing whether there are falmon or not-; 
and the laft are fet in the water, and never drawn tili the 
watchman, or tootf??ian, as he is called here, obferves the 
fifh to have got within the net. Thefe fiJhings are become 
very valuable of late, and bring in money to the country 
from our neighbours in England. There is likewife a l'pir- 
ling filhing carried on here through the winter, and as 
they catch great numbers of Ipirlings, garvies, herrings, 
flounders, See. they are fold at low prices, and are ealily 
come at by the pooreft in the parjfh. The Ipirlings are 
taken with poke-nets tied between two poles, and anchor- 
ed at the back end. The ebbing tide forces the fiih into 
them, and they are fhaken out at low water *, The rim- 
ers, who are extremely induftrious, likewife catch feals, in 
the fummer months, with long nets, for which, befides the 
value oi the oil and Ikins, they draw a fmall premium 
from the falmon -dealers in Perth. 

Antiquities. — The firft thing that deferves our notice 
here, is the ruins of the Abbey of Balmerino. Some pil- 
lars of excellent workmanlhip, and moft durable ftone, e- 
very one ornamented in a different manner, and covered 
in by a beautiful arch, are ftill to be feen. There are alfo 
fome femicircular vaults, one of which feems to have been 
a place of worlhip, as there is a row of ftone-benches all 
round it, and nigh the entrance two bafons cut out in the 
ftone, probably for holding holy water, as the bufl of the 

Virgin,

Virgin, with the Holy Child in her arms, flood in a niche 
above them. This butt was dug out of the ruins feme 
years ago, and given to Mr David Aiartin, painter and an- 
tiquarian. There are alfo the ruans of the' church, and 
what appears to have been a imall chapel upon the end of 
a houfe, within the preempts of the Abbey, where Lord 
Bahnerino fomedmes refided. This Abbey was begun by 
Alexander II. and his mother Emergarda, daughter to the 
Earl of Baumont, and widow of William, iirnamed the 
Lion, in the year 1229 This lady in the year 12,5, pur- 
chafed the lands of Balmurenach, Cultrach, and Balin- 
dean, from Richard de Rule, for icoo merks Sterling, 
upon which ground they founded the monaftry near the 
more, about 8 Englifh miles above where the Lay emp- 
ties itfelf into the bay of St Andrew's. It is pleafantly 
fituated upon the banks of the Tay, noted for their roman- 
tic {helving and perpetual verdure, and commands a beau- 
tiful view of the river, with Dundee, and the rich vale of 
the Carle of Gowry on the oppofite more. It has a fmall 
running water to the eaft of it, which turns a mill, and 
runs through a den or glen, well ftocked with venerable 
trees, coniifting of aih, beech, elm, &amp;c. In the old garden 
there is a chefnut-tree, the bole of which meafures 15 feet 
in the girth, and not above 5 feet to the fetting out of the 
branches, two of which run horizontally the whole length 
of the chapel, formerly mentioned, Handing at the end of 
the houfe. A beech- tree was meafured to 12 feet 7 inch- 
es in the girth ; and an elm to 7 feet 9 inches, their height 
from 30 to 40 feet. It is well flickered from the north- 
eaft wind by the Scurr hill, which rifes to a great height 
above the river, has Naughton on the eaft, and Birkhill on 
the weft, both of them modern houfes, with rifing pleafure 
grounds of confiderable extent. At this laft place there is,

able coppice wood, extending above a mile along tne 
banks of the Tay, confiding mottly of oak, and in which 
there are feveral groves of beech and oak, which may now 
be reckoned tolerable timber *. 

* The abbey-church, wherein Queen Emergarda is faid to be buried, 
* te magnum altert, ferved as the parilh-church till the year 1595, wnen 
it was removed to the ealt fide of the Den ; it ftands upon a little emi- 
nence. The manfe was likewife in or near the abbey, till foine time af- 
ter die year 16 IS, when a houfe, built of that date by T. and J. Chrich- 
ton, whofe names and arms are ftill to be feen on ftones that flood on the 
ftorm-windows, was given in lieu of it. This abbey belonged to the Ci- 
ftertian or Bernardine Monks, was dedicated to St Edward, and, as all 
the other houfes of this order were, to the Virgin Mary alfo. It feems to 
have been well endowed. David de Lindfay gave to it an annuity out of 
his mill in Kirkbuet, in the year 1233 ; Simon de Kinnear gave to it Lit- 
tle or Wefter Kinnear, in the ^^A year of Alexander's reign; and Cor- 
beck, fignifying a den with birks, or Birk-hill, as it is now called, was gi- 
ven to it by Laurentius de Abernethy. The prcceptory of Gadvan, in 
the parifh of Dunbog, alfo belonged to it. — After the Reformation, King 
James VI. erected Balmerino into a temporal lord: 1 ip, in favour of Sir 
James Elphinfton of Barnton, then Principal Secretary of State, on the 
z3th of April 1604. — There are alfo two places in the parilh, one of them 
called the Battle- law to this day, where the Scots are fuppofed to have 
given battle to the Danes, after their retreat from Luncarty, where they 
again defeated, and forced them to fly with precipitation on board their 
fliips, then lying in the mouth of the Tay. One of the places was dug 
up a few years ago, at the defire of two gentlemen, where they found 
fome ftone coffins and arms, or pieces of broken fwords ; but no further 
recoveries have fi.ice been made. — The dates of the abbev. and the gifts 
made to it, are taken from Sibbal l's Hiftoiy of Fife, and Hope's Minor 
Practics.

breadth is about 4 miles from N. E. to S. W. ; and it is

Name and Language. — The Englifli language has made 
confiderable progrefs here among the better fort of people, 
lince the Union of the Scottifh and Englifli crowns ; but 
the vulgar ftill continue to fpeak the Scotch, a dialed of 
of the Dano-Saxon, which was brought from the other fide 
of the German Ocean, by the Danifli invaders of the ninth 
and eleventh centuries. Some of the people who border on 
the Highlands, have a fmattering of, and retain a predilec- 
tion for the Gaelic or Celtic, which feems to have been the 
original language of the whole ifland. Of this language 
there are many traces here, particularly in the names of 
places ; which names either mark the local lituation, or 
refer to fome tranfa&amp;ion that has taken place there in di- 
ftant times. For example, Clunie, which has time imme- 
morial been the name of the parifh, is the modern ortho- 
graphy of the old Celtic word Cluaine, which fignifies, 
" plain green paflure between woods :" A plain, green 
paflure, called the Meadow, lies a little to the north of the 
church ; on the north fide of this plain, there is {till natural 
wood growing, and on the fouth fide of the plain, we find 
veftiges of old trees in a fmall mofs or mire, which makes 
a part of the glebe *.

* Stron, fituated at the entrance of the hill of Clunie, fignifies the 
" nofe, promontory, or heel of the hill." DuUalir, (in Gaelic, Dui- 
lea-tire, the " black, bleak half fide of the country,") lies in the heath, 
on a high, cold, northern expofure, perfectly correfponding to its name.

Surface, Soil, Climate, Difeafes. — The fuperficial area of 
the parifh has not been meafured, nor has any particular 
map of it been yet attempted. It contains probably up. 
wards of 8000 acres of mountain, mofs, heath, wood, wa- 
ter, arable and pafture. The arable parts, which have of 
late been confiderably extended by induftry, comprehend- 
ed, in fummer 1791, about 2555 acres. The furface of 
the ground is uneven, and not difagreeably diverfified. 
The loweft parts are perhaps not more than 150 feet, and 
the higheft are perhaps not lefs than 1800 feet above the 
level of the fea : Accordingly the foil and climate are va- 
rious. The mountainous parts are cold, rocky and heathy, 
fit only for fheep and goats ; the latter of which are entire- 
ly banifhed, and the former reduced, comparatively, to a 
very fmall number. Contiguous to the mountains, are 
large tra£ls of black, bleak barren moors, where the heath 
is in fome places interfperfed with bent, affording fubfift- 
ence to about 200 fmall Scotch cattle, and about 1000 fmall 
Scotch fheep. Thefe tradfs are in general too rough and 
wild to admit of the plough ; it appears, however, that 
fome fpots of them have been cultivated by the Caledoni- 
ans of old, when the lower parts of the parifh were cover- 
ed with wood. Many of thefe barren heaths may, in fu- 
ture times, be crowned with beautiful plantations of the

fir kind, particularly the larix, which, if not planted in wa- 
ter, will thrive in almoft any elevation or expofure. In 
many parts, efpecially about the middle of the parifli, the 
foil is light, fandy and ftony ; here, where it is not cultivated, 
it is covered either with fliort he^th, furze, broom or brufli- 
Wood; but, where it is properly improved, being natural- 
ly dry and warm, it yields early and good crops. In the 
vallies and lower declivities of the diftricT:, the foil is, for 
the moll part, an excellent well pulverized mixture •, pro- 
ducing, either with lime or marl, or even with a compe- 
tency of common manure, as good barley, oats, peafe, tur- 
nip and potatoes, as any part of this neighbourhood. The 
oat-feed time begins about the end of March, and the bear- 
feed is finiflied about the ioth of June ; harveft commences 
about the 10 h of September, and terminates about 
the aoth of October, in ordinary feafons. In the hil- 
\j parts, both feed-time and harveft are a fortnight later. 
-The air is good, and the inhabitants are generally healthy, 
and live to a confiderable age feveral perfons exceed 80, 
fome exceed 90, and a few have reached near ico years. 
In winter, the hoarfroft often fits heavy on the lower 
grouuds, where the degree of cold is then greater than on 
the tops of the mountains. The E. and N. E. winds of 
that feafon frequently bring fnow or rain, or mift from the 
German ocean ; and it is here obferved, that thefe winds 
occafion fome dullnefs or depreffion of the animal fpirits ; 
whereas, on the contrary, it is remarked, that the W. and 
N. W. winds, which blow hither through a pure, uncloud- 
ed atmofphere, and over a boundlefs extent of high, heathy 
mountains, feldom fail to bring along with them good 
health and good fpirits. The truth of this laft obfervation 
is ofttimes experienced by the ftranger from the low 
country, who goes to the highlands for air and exercife, 
particularly in the fummer months, w en th he h s in 
fcloom. He refpires with unufual eafe, his fpirits rife, and

he defcends to the plain not without fome relu&amp;ance. The 
W. and N. W. winds are peculiarly agreeable and advan- 
tageous here in autumn. In that chearful laborious feafon, 
our anxious hulbandman throws a wiihful look to the N. 
W. and pointing to fome well known fummit of the Gram- 
pian mountains, raifes his heart and his hand to heaven, and 
prays that the wind may never fhift from that particulai' 
quarter, till his own and his neighbour's fields are cleared. 
There are here no local difeafes. Colds and fore throats 
are pretty frequent in winter. The ague is unknown, and 
the gout and rheumatifm occur very rarely. The meafles 
prove fometimes deftru£tive, and alfo the fmall-pox, taken 
in the natural way. Numbers have, of late years, been 
inoculated, and of thefe only one died. Happily for the 
looks as well as for the conftitutions of the riling genera- 
tions, the practice of inoculation is becoming more general, 
the prejudices againft it are every day giving way, and the 
more rational part of the people begin to feel a becoming 
gratitude to heaven for having been pleafed to communi- 
cate to mankind fuch an important difcovery. When a fe- 
ver comes here, it generally attacks numbers. This is ow- 
ing in a great meafure to the temerity of thofe, who, from 
friendly intentions, vifit the patient ; but who, without ob- 
ferving the proper caution, rum upon his breath, imbibe 
the contagion, and communicate it from houfe to houfe, 
and from village to village. This conduct is to be afcribed 
partly to ignorance, and partly to religious prejudice, both 
of which are happily giving place to more fenfible and en- 
lightened views of things.

fee on the S. W. the W. the N. W. the N. and N. E. the 
higher Grampians towards Argyleftiire, Badenach and Mar; 
on the E. the S. E. and S. you have a view of the whole 
extent of Strathmore, from the neighbourhood of Stone- 
hive to that of Stirling, and this great Strath, bordered on 
the oppofite fide by the Sidla and Ochi] hills ; beyond the 
latter, you perceive the Pentlands, a little to the S. W. of 
Edinburgh; and, thence directing your eye eaftward to 
the fide of the Lomond hill at Falkland, you may defcry 
pretty diftinctly the eaftern termination of the Soutra hills, 
in the neighbourhood of Haddington, rifing like fmall blue 
clouds in the verge of the horizon. The height of Ben- 
achally has not been afcertained, and the elevation of its 
bafe detracts much from its apparent altitude. Birnam, 
celebrated in the tragedy of Macbeth, Hands about 5 miles 
S. by W. of Ben-achally, and the height of Birnam has been 
taken, 1580 feet above the level of the fea. Suppofing 
this meafurement to be accurate, Ben-achally fhould not 
be overrated at 1800 feet above the fame level, fince, to 
the naked eye, it appears confiderably higher than Birnam. 

At the foot of Ben-achally, on its north fide, in the fo- 
reft of Clunie, (faid to have been once a royal foreft, and 
now the property of the Duke of Atholl), lies the loch of 
Ben-achally, extending about a mile from W. to E. and a- 
bout half a mile from N. to S. at its weft end. Its great - 
eft depth 11 — 12 fathoms, is towards the foot of the moun- 
tain ; and if we compute the height of the mountain as a- 
bove, the furface of the loch may be fuppofed not lefs than 
900 feet above the level of the fea. In the loch are fome 
eels ; and it abounds with trouts, which in general are 
fmall. We have feen fome of them 1—2 lb. weight; 
fometimes they are caught of a large fize. In a calm fum- 
mer evening, they fpring in fuch numbers to the flies, that 
the whole furface of the water appears to be dancing. 

Here, 



of Clunie.

Here, as on the other Highland lochs in its neighbourhood, 
the beft time of taking the trout, is a dark windy day, in 
June, July, or Auguft, or, which is equally proper, any 
calm warm night in that feafon ; and for the night-filhing, 
you muft ufe an artificial fly, of a white or very bright 
grey colour. There is here no angling of any confequence, 
owing prinipally to the want of a boat. About 30 years 
ago, Mr Patrick Simpfon, then minifter of Clunie, who 
was a very expert angler, as well as a very refpeftable 
clergyman, caufed make and carry up hither, at his own 
expenfe, a fmall fifhing-boat, which, however, foon after 
his death, fell to pieces, having no flied to fcreen it from 
the winter ftorms. A mile to the weftward of Loch-Ben- 
achally, and ftill nearer the tops of the mountains, is Loch- 
nachat, a fmall loch, full of fine trouts. 

About 4 miles S. E. of Loch-Ben-achally, and on a level, 
perhaps 700 feet lower, lies the loch of Clunie, a beautiful 
piece of water, fomewhat of the form of a blunted equila- 
teral triangle, about i\ miles in circumference. Its fur- 
face is probably not more than 80 feet above the conflu- 
ence of the Tay and Ila, which laft is only 93 feet above 
the level of the fea. Its greateft depth is about 84 feet, 
and lies on the N. fide towards the higheft bank. The 
ground rifes from the loch all around, with a bold flope, 
and is in a tolerable ftate of cultivation. The W. and 
N. W. banks are pretty much decorated with verdure and 
plantation ; and had the oppofite banks a little more of the 
aid of ornament, which in all probability they will foon 
have, this loch would be one of the firft natural beauties of 
the country. About 200 yards from its weftern fhore, there 
is a fmall but pleafant ifland, near the centre of which 
ftands an old caftle, in good repair, an occafional fummer 
refidence of the Earl of Airly, who is fuperior of the loch, 
proprietor of the barony of Clunie, and firft heritor of the

parifh. Around the verge of this ifland are old alhes and 
planes, that have withftood the florms of fome hundred 
years, yet ftill continue to vegetate. Thefe trees have fome- 
thing venerably grotefque in their appearance. The trunk 
of fome of the planes feparates and unites again, (forming 
a large diftincl: aperture), as do alfo fome of the larger 
branches. The trees, in fome places, diverge confiderably 
from the land, leaning acrofs the water, over which their 
aged arms embrace, and the roots of the planes are incor- 
porated with thofe of the allies, in fuch a manner, as if 
they were determined to {land and fall together. In the 
fultry heats of fummer, thefe trees throw a cool refrefliing 
umbrage over the ifland, intercepting the rays of the fun, 
which other wife, being ftrongly reflected from the water, 
would prove hurtful to the tender eye. The ifland itfelf is 
a plain carpet of green, interfperfed with a few flowering 
fhrubs, where the fairies, in the times of fuperftition, were 
wont to hold their moonlight affemblies. 

In the loch of Clunie there is plenty of pike, perch, trout, 
and eel. The eels are fometimes caught here of a confi- 
derable fize, but they are generally a troublefome capture, 
as they are apt to knot and warp the line in an inextri- 
cable manner. In bright funny days, when they come out 
near the lhore, and are diftin&amp;ly feen at the bottom of the 
fhallow water, they are fometimes ftruck with the eel- 
fpear, which affords an agreeable amufement. The trouts 
here grow from 4 lb. to 12 lb. weight, but are feldom taken 
except on the fet line, or in the net. Vafl numbers of the 
young fry, both of the trout and perch, are devoured by the 
pike. The perches here are numerous, but generally fmall, 
and they are caught in the ufual manner with the rod. 
Their bell bait is the common red worm, or a fmall min- 
now, and they take very well here in June, July and Au- 
guft. The pike-fiihing begins about the end of March,

end though the pikes are fuppofed to be in beft feafon in 
March, April and May, during which time they bite moft 
greedily, yet they are in very good feafon in autumn, and 
even in winter, provided they could be then taken with equal 
eafe. Their bell fpring bait is a Ikinned frog, or rather a 
frefli burn trout about 6 or 7 inches long ; and their com- 
mon fummer bait is a cutting of a ikinned eel, or a fkinned 
perch. Pikes have been killed in the loch of Clunie from 
12 lb. to 241b. or even 301b. weight, but the ordinary fize 
is from 2 lb. to 61b. They are commonly taken either 
with the fet line, or by trotvling, that is, with the rod and 
wheel, dragging a confiderable length of line with a large 
artificial fly or baited hook at the farther end of it ; and 
in order to troxvl with fuccefs, it is neceffavy that the fur- 
face of the water lhould be curled by a gentle breeze, and 
that the boat mould be kept all the while in a pretty brifk 
motion, rather in opposition to the wind than otherwife *.

* Here are no rivers, but fome confiderable burns or brooks, the 
Lornty, the Droothy, the Buckny, and the Lunan. The Lornty flows 
from the Loch of Ben-achally, runs about 6 miles E. S. E. through the hil- 
ly parts of the parifhes of Clunie, Kinloch, and Blairgowrie, and, having 
turned five mills in its courfe, falls into the river Eright, a little above 
the Caith, a curious fall of the river, a little above the village of Blair- 
gowrie. The burn of Droothy riles from the mofs of Ben-achally, fepa- 
rates the barony of Laighwood from the foreft of Clunie, and the barony 
■of Forneth, and, after a rapid courfe of about 3 miles to the S. E l empties 
itfelf into the Lunan. The Buckny takes its rife from Loch-na-chat, and 
falling to the S. IL. between the mountains of Ben-achally and Deuchara, 
forms the Dooloch ; thence, increafed by the fprings of the Doo-loch. it 
thunders down a deep, narrow, rocky den, covered with wild wood, (call- 
ed the Den of Ilichip), and, feparating the parifties of Caputh and Clu- 
nie, it enters the latter in the park of Laighwood, where it unites with 
■the Lunan The Lunan itfelf is by far the moft confiderable ftream in 
the parifh. Collected from different fources in the Grampians, a little to 
sthe nortli of Dunkeld, it proceeds ealtward, and forms the lochs of Craig- 
flafli, of Lows, of Butterftone, of Clunie, and of Drumclly. From this

logue of which is unneceiTary. Birds of prey are frequent, 
fuch as the fparrow-havvk, the grey-hawk or hen-han ier, 
the kite, and the large buzzard : The eagle has been feen, 
though feldom, in the neighbourhood of Ben-achally. The 
iinging birds are numerous ; the linnet, the bullfinch, the 
blackbird, the ftarling, and the thrufh, &amp;c. The hollow 
moaning of the ftock-dove gives a folemnity to the concert 
of the groves. The notes of the wood-lark are heard, de- 
lightful, along the banks of the Lunan in fpring and autumn; 
its nodlurnal fong has a dying cadence peculiarly melodious,

ment near Meiklour, it increafes the river Ila, about half a mile M. E. of 
the Praitorium, and nearly a miles N. E. of the junction of the 11a and 
the Tay. The courfe of the Lunan is about 12 miles long, and fomewhat 
refembling a bended bow ; and, in this courfe, it forms the five beautiful 
flieets of water above mentioned, paffibs under five ftone bridges, turns one 
cloth-mill. 3 flax-mills, and 10 corn-mills ; and divides the Stormont in- 
to two parts-, nearly equal. The trouts of the Lunan are excellent, and, 
both in point of fize, form, and flavour, much fuperior to thofe of the 
hill-brooks defcribed above. This is owing to its waters being deeper, 
warmer, and better flickered ; and to its paffing over rich, clayey, and 
marly bottoms. It is difficult to angle upon the Lunan in many places, 
particularly above the loch of Clunie, on account of the natural wood 
overhanging the ftreain. At fome of the falls of the l.unan, are placed 
arks or perforated chefts, for the purpofe of catching the eels. Thefe fifli 
run down from loch to loch, in vaft numbers, especially with the wefter- 
ly wind, in the dark nights of October, and are taken by hundreds in 
thefe arks. The eels are beft in that feafon of the year, and their fidns 
are then valuable to the fanner for making whangs or bindings to his 
flails. Some of the common people here, on fpraining an ankle or a 
wrift, apply to the wound'the flun of an eel. to which they afcribe a pt- 
cujiar virtue. In this parifh, there is no filh caught for fale.

ter,the cuckoo and tit-lark, the fieldfare and fnow-flight, and 
fometimes, as in November 1791, the Bohemian chatterer 
and butcher-bird. The fandy-lark haunts our lochs in fum- 
iner, and great number of fea mews, pitarnies and gulls, 
come up in the fpring. The aquatic fowls of the country 
abound here ; we have the wild-duck, the widgeon, the 
fmaller and larger teal, and the water- rail. The wild- 
geefe reft here, though rarely, on their paffage ; and like- 
wife the wild fwans, (perhaps 12 or 18 of them together), 
in their way to or from Loch Spynie near Elgin, their great 
place of rendezvous ; a few of them generally remain on 
the Stormont lochs all the fummer. The cormorant, here 
called the fcart, frequents the ifland in the loch of Clunie, 
and fometimes the ofprey, but neither has been known to 
build there. The herons ufed to hatch in numbers on the 
trees of the ifland, but not fince the late reparation of the 
caftle. Of the fucker-birds, the fnipe neftles here, the 
woodcock comes in October, and departs in February or 
March; and the curlew vifits us in fpring and autumn. 
We have plenty of the grey plover, and common groufe in 
our moors, and the black-cock begins to make his appear- 
ance among our plantations. The partridge neftles in al- 
moft every clover field, where, fometimes the poor dam, 
while lhe fits on 18 or perhaps 24 eggs, has her head cut 
off by the fcythe; a difafter the more to be regretted, as it 
cannot be prevented unlefs her neft be difcovered and mark- 
• ed before the hay-cutting begins. The pheafant was com- 
mon here fome years ago, being introduced at Dunkeld by 
the Athole family. It became fo tame, as frequently to 
join the domeftic fowls in the barn-yard, stnd often there its 
tamenefs proved fatal to it. It was alfo a good mark, and 
an eafy prey to the poacher, and in fpring its eggs being 
depofited rather carelefsly, were, before hatching, eaten

We have the urchin or hedge-hog, the weazel, the pole-cat, 
the wild-cat, the badger, the fox, the rabbit, the hare, the 
otter, &amp;c. The common brown fquirrel begins to breed 
in the woods ; it was alfo introduced at Dunkeld by the 
late Duke of Athole,and has unfortunately done much harm 
to the ringing birds. A. few roes haunt the park of Laigh- 
wood ; and, in diftreffing winters, the red deer appear in 
the foreft of Clunie, and in the higher parts of the diftrift.

have that general view of our Flora, which the time and 
fpace prefcribed to this memoir will not allow its author 
to particularize. 

The eriophorum vaginatum and eriophorum polyftachium, 
(cotton-grafs), whitens our mofTes. The iheep are faid to 
be very fond of it in the fpring before it flowers, when it 
is believed to be very good for them : This is the " down 
of Cana," of Oilian, and forms a beautiful firmly in his 
juftly -celebrated poems. It carries a large filamentous 
flower, whiter and fofter than cotton, and its filament makes 
an admirable objedr. for microfcopical observation. The 
menyanthes trifoliata, (marfh-trifoil), abounds on the Ikirts 
of our lochs and mires ; early in the fpring, it throws up a 
beautiful flower with five fringed petals: This plant is ufed 
in decoftion and infufion, and is reckoned a good antifcor- 
butic. The athamanta meum, (fpignel), here called moi- 
ken or muilcionn, grows in the higher parts of the barony 
ofLaighwood, and in the foreft of Clunie. The High- 
landers chew the root of it like liquorice or tobacco. It is 
belt in winter and fpring, before its radical leaves appear. 
It flowers in June and July, and grows in great plenty in 
fome of the glens to the northward of this, particularly in 
Glenfhee, Glenbeg, and Glencluny, by the fides of the 
Mar-road. The root of this plant, when dried and roafli- 
cated, throws out ftrong effluvia, which are thought a 
powerful antidote againft contagious air, and it is recom- 
mended by fome in goutilh and gravellifh complaints. The 
vaccinium myrtillus, (blae-berry), of which excellent jam 
may be made, and the fragaria, (wild ftraw-berry), grow

talis Europaa, and the polygonum viviparum, &amp;c. 

Shrubs and Trees. — The juniperus communis was men- 
tioned under the article of plants, a good deal of it grows 
here, and to the weft ward, on the bafe of the hills. Some 
times the poor people gather the fruit of it in confiderable 
quantities, and carry it to Dundee, where they fell it at 
about 1 s. the peck. When it is ripe, they fpread a cloth 
under the branch, and beat down the berries with a ftick. 
A little of this fruit taken in the morning before breakfaft, 
is faid to be as good as a dram; probably it is much better, 
being an excellent ftomachic. The fmoke of the juniper 
is thought to be deftru&amp;ive to moths and bugs, none of the 
latter of which are ever found in this part of the country. 
Some of the common people here make an infufion of the 
juniper-berry, which they ufe for tea *, perhaps it might be, 
in many cafes, a good fubftitute for Bohea, and fully as 
conducive both to health and to ftrength. Being in every 
form a powerful diuretic, it is highly proper to be ufed in 
every cafe where there are any indications of a calcareous 
diathehs. The broom abounds here : It blooms in June ; 
and at that time, the butter, made from the milk of the 
cows that feed upon its bloffoms, parcakes in a high de- 
gree of their beautiful tin&amp;ure. The furze is alfo frequent, 
of which horfes are exceedingly fond in winter ; and while 
they fee*d on it, it is obferved, that they never catch 
cold. On the banks of the Lunan, there is a flirub, here 
called the hack berry, (prunus padus) that carries beauti- 
ful flowers, which are fucceeded by a clufler of fine black- 
berries •, they are fweet and lufcious to the tafte, but their 
particular qualities are not known. In the parifh of Laigh- 
wood we meet with plenty of the black floe, which ripens

it plentifully, (fwallowing the ftone along with the pulp,) ' 
efteeming it a good peroral, and ufeful in pulmonary and 
afthmatic complaints. The park of Laighwood produces 
alfo the viburnum opulus, or water elder, the hawthorn, 
the hipthorn, the wild rafp, and the bramble in varieties. 
In fome places the fweet-brier is found, ihe park of 
Laighwood was famous for hazel-nuts, iuperior in taite, 
.though not in fize, to the bpanilh nuts. There alfo we find 
the foreft crab in varieties ; in fome places it bears pretty 
large and beautiful apples, nearly of the fize of oflins : 
Some of thefe plants appear to have fprung from the feed 
of grafted apples, ftolen from the garden or orchard by the 
wild birds. We have like wife the myrica *, (gale), and 
varieties of the falix or willow-tribe. — The larger indige- 
nous trees of the dillrict are the alder, along the wet 
grounds ; the bark of it is ufeful in dying purple ; and 
were this wood thinned in proper time, and permit- 
ted to grow to a proper fize, it would make beautiful 
and durable flooring for rooms, being previoufly fawed out 
to a due thicknefs, laid under mofs-water for about fix 
weeks, and then dried in the made. We have alfo the 
holly, fo valuable in veneering ; of the bark of which the 
beft bird-lime is made : In the park of Laighwood it rifes 
in large copies, owing to its branches fpreading along the 
wet ground, and ftriking root at the joints. Thefe copfes 
form agreeable objects in the winter mow, and are very care- 
fully prelerved by the noble proprietor, the Duke of 
Athole. The birch is a native here, and alfo the narrow 
leaved fcrvice, the aih, the plane, and the oak, of which laii 
the bark is fo ufeful in the tanning of leather. The oak 
wood of this country is cut down once every 20 or 24 
years, by the wood cutting companies, who purchafe it,

with certain refervations, from the proprietors, and fend 
the bark to a great diffance, to Dundee, Forfar, Brechin, 
Sec. where the tanners receive it generally at the rate of 
io d. or i s. the ifone weight. The wood-cutters do not 
draw fuch profits from this bufinefs now, as they did for- 
merly, owing partly to the proprietors of the oak beco- 
ming of late more fenfible of its value, partly to different 
companies fetting up in oppofition to one another, and 
partly to fome of the members of the fame company not 
paying due attention to their particular departments ; by 
which means the company at large fometimes fuftains very 
material loffes. It is therefore probable, that this trade 
will foon fall into the hands of the proprietors themfelves ; 
and that the wood cutters, who have generally farms, 
from which this bufinefs draws off their attention in the 
fummer months, will find their account in abandoning it, 
and in betaking themfelves to the lefs precarious occupa- 
tion of cultivating and improving their poffeilions *. 

Vol. IX. H h Seats, 

* The natural wood of this parifh is much decayed. In many banks, 
and angles of fields, it has very properly given way to the plough The 
cattle are generally permitted to browfe the infant moots, and thereby to 
retard their growth. The Hinted Items having, after a ftruggle of feve- 
ral years, got above the reach of the cattle, are fuffered to rife in too 
great numbers on one (lock; which greatly hurts the quality, as well as 
diminilhes the quantity of the bark. The wood being fo frequently cut, 
and the flocks laid bare, the rife of the natural juices is thereby lefiened 
or prevented. Belides, it may be fuppofed that, independent of the na- 
tural duration of the particukr fpecies of wood, according to the nature 
of the foil that bears it, the ground that produces trees, like the ground 
that fuccefiivcly produces any other exhaufting crop, mull, in a certain 
number of years, become wafted and fatigued, and confequently muft re- 
quire a certain period of repofe, before it be able to produce fuch crops 
again. To fome fuch caufes as thefe, it muft be owing, that this country 
does not produce one half of the natural Wood flow, that it appears to 
have produced fome hundred years ago.

Seats, Gardens and Plantations. — Of the firft, there are 
three that merit defcription. Forneth, the feat of Thomas 
Elder, Efq; tb whofe beneficence and public fpirit his 
friends and his country are much indebted, ftands on the 
N. W. bank of the loch of Clunie, on a fine elevation, 
commanding a fmall, but beautiful, profpeft of the ifland, 
the loch, and the adjacent grounds. The Lunan, warning, 
in gentle meanders, the foot of the bank, deals foftly into 
the loch, a little below the houfe. The bank itfelf, co- 
vered with verdure, and interfperfed with trees, has an 
eafy and elegant flope from the houfe to the furface of the 
water, which, expanding itfelf into a large tranflucent 
plain, gives the inverted landfcape a mild and pi&amp;urefque 
appearance. A beautiful new garden, promifing abun- 
dance of good fruit, lies warm and low at the foot of the 
bank, about 200 yards S. W. from the houfe. This gar- 
den is deftined to receive within its bofom a fmall ftreamlet 
from the Lunan •, which, after winding {lowly along, and 
forming ponds in its courfe, is to have its outlet near the 
S. E. angle of the garden, where it will again unite with 
its- parent ftream. The houfe is new, elegant and commo- 
dious, fhekered with trees, and well dreffed fields, that 
fwell above one another to a confiderable height. Thefe 
fields have been all taken in from a rude ftate of nature, by 
the prefent proprietor, and his father, who was the firft 
man that began to clear rough grounds in the higher parts 
of this parifh. Here, about 50 years ago, little elfe was 
to be feen but broom, furze, briers, thorns and ftones. — 
Clunie caftle, on the ifland of the loch of Clunie, was men- 
tioned above, as being an occafional fummer refidence of 
the Earl of Airly. It was built about the beginning of 
the 1 6th century, by George Brown, Bilhop of Dunkeld, 
and was one of his favourite feats or palaces. It feldom 
fails to attraft the attention of the ftranger, who generally 

flops

flops here to fee it. The mod remarkable circumftances 
about it are, its infular fituation, the thicknefs of its wall, 
(about 9 feet at the furface of the ground), and its beings 
reckoned the birth place of the * admirable Crichton. 
From the windows of the dining room, the fpeftator has a 
pleafant view of the loch, with the houfe and grounds of 
Forneth, which are here feen to great advantage ; and a 
wild romantic glen, ftretching N. W. towards the High- 
lands, and terminating in a bold range of the Grampian 
mountains. Lord Airly fometimes refides here a few 
weeks during the fiflnng feafon, and has a net here, which 
is never ufed but when the family are on the ifland. The 
neighbouring gentlemen are permitted the privilege of rod- 
fiihing and pleafure boats. On the weftern more of the loch, 
hisLordfhip has a good kitchen-garden and nurfery, together 
with an orchard, lately inclofed, and planted with a variety 
of fruit-trees, all in a profperous condition. — On the other 
fide of the hill, and about a mile and a half S. S. E. of 
Clunie caftle, on a fouthern declivity, and well ftzeltered 
from every cold and ftormy blaft, is Gourdie, the feat of 
David Kinloch, Efq; It is a large, convenient and fubftantial 
h»ufe, beautifully fituated ; the profpec~t it enjoys is de- 
lightful. Immediately under your eye you fee the level, 
rich, and well cultivated eflate of Delvin, with the magni- 
ficent houfe of that name, rifing on a woody bank about 
ii mile to the S. From the foot of the bank of Delvin, 
you behold the river Tay winding eaftward in ftately me- 
anders towards Meiklour, and there receiving the Ila at 
the old caftle of Kinclaven. In the middle fcene you have 
a diftinft view of the broadefl part of Strathmore, from 
Birnam on your right-hand to Dunfinnan on your leftj 

and 

* This will be more particularly taken notice of under the article of 
Eminent men,

and in the back ground you perceive the green fummits of 
the Ochills, ftretching weftward from the neighbourhood 
of Perth, to where they decline at the fcene of the battle 
of Sheriffmuir near Dunblane. Mr Kinloch, too, has done 
much in the way of improvement ; his grounds are well 
laid out; his lawn has a rich appearance, and feeds excel- 
lent mutton ; his garden, at the foot of the lawn, is one 
of the warmeft and earliefi in the county ; and the amphi- 
theatre of wood, that embraces the houfe and the lawn, is 
highly diversified, and produces a very agreeable effect. 
Thefe gentlemen have contri'buted much to the melioration 
and embellifhment of this parifh. Many of its eminencies, 
fit for nothing elfe, are already planted with trees adapted 
to the foil •, and thefe plantations, projected from the 
Grampians on the border of the Great Strath, will, in a 
few. years hence, become grand and confpicuous objects. 
For the plantation on the top of the hill of Gourdy, we are 
indebted to the late Mr Mackenzie of Delvin, who was, 
without exception, the firfl: improver of this country. Lord 
Airly h^is lately extended a broad belt of black firs, mixed 
wirh the birch and the larix, along the whole fummit of 
the Craig of Clunie. Not many years ago, Mr Elder of 
Forneth inclofed and planted nearly 100 acres ot the fore- 
hill ; and this plantation, though one of the moft elevated 
in the county, is thriving very well. From the vicinity 
of Perth, 16 miles to the fouthward, it appears a large, 
dark-green fquare, affording, in the winter fnow, an agree- 
able relief to the eye even at that diftance. Mr Elder 
intends to continue it along the whole extent of the hill 
weftward, till it join the Duke of Athole's march, at the 
barony of Laighwood. This large wood, lined longitudi- 
nally along its fummit with larixes, and croffed here and 
there with flrips of the fame, fo* as to fhelter the Com-

znon firs, &amp;c. from the inclemencies of the N. and E. 
wouid exhibit, in a very ihort time, one of the moft ftri- 
king objects on the whofe bafis of the Grampian mountains. 
Such improvements as thefe, for which this parifh (and 
many other fuch places in Scotland) affords abundance of 
room, are at once a proof of the good tafte and liberal fpi- 
rit of the landholders. While they beautify the country, 
and add warmth to the climate, they promife to contribute 
greatly to the comfort and conveniency of the inhabitants, 
by the fuel they will furnifli when the peat mofles are ex- 
haufted, as well as by the wood they will fupply for build- 
ing and repairing their houfes. At the fame time, that 
many of our bleak and barren moors might eafily be co- 
vered with pines, &amp;c. attention might be paid to many 
little fteep banks on the lower grounds by the fide of 
brooks and rivulets, where neither the plough nor the 
cattle can reach, but where the foil is rich, and warm, and 
deep : Thefe fpots might be all planted with the beech, 
the elm, the plane, the am, &amp;.c. which are fo ufeful and ne- 
ceffary to the country in general, and to the hufbandman 
in particular. 

State of Hujbandry — It is only of late years that the 
•knowledge of agriculture, and the fpirit of improvement, 
began to difplay themfelves in this parifli. The people 
in general having no profpecl of emolument to roufe their 
attention, and no example of induftry fet them by their fu- 
periors, fquandered away their time, either in doing no- 
thing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpofe. Their 
grounds fcratched over once a-year, without receiving half 
the neceffary manure, and perpetually croffed with oats 
and barley alternately, were reduced to a caput mortuum. 
The lands were no where fubdivided nor inclofed. The 
farmer, if he may be called fo, had his crooked ridges eve- 
ry 



Statijtical Account 



ry where warped through the crooked ridges of his neigh- 
bour ; and the country being open in winter as well as in 
fummer, all things were common, and men and beafts were 
at liberty to prey upon one another. Happily for the 
place, the pleafure, and the advantage of the people, the 
fcene has now affumed another and a better appearance. 
Commonties and runrigs are done away ; the farms begin 
to be reduced to fome form, and the marches to be ftreight- 
ed. Each man begins to know his own, and to have it in 
his power to improve it. Wet grounds are drained ; rough 
grounds are cleared ; ftone-fences are built, and hedges are 
planted. Marl is brought from the neighbouring parifhes of 
Kinloch and Caputh j lime from the more of Perth ; rich 
clays are applied to fand, and a good permanent foil form - 
ed, where there was no foil before ; green crops begin to 
be railed, and a regular rotation of crops begins in fome 
places to be underftood. Many new implements of huf- 
bandry, common in the low country, are now introduced 
here ; many old prejudices, that had long retarded the pro- 
grefs of improvement, are laid alide ; and here, as in other 
places, the farmer begins to find his account, in following 
the good example of thofe who are wifer and more expe- 
rienced than himfelf.— In the courfe of the laft 40 years, 
(during which time there has been a considerable revolu- 
tion of the property), the rents are in moft places doubled, 
and in fome places tripled, and, which was not the cafe be- 
fore, regularly paid on a certain day. The farmers are more 
independent of their landlords on that account ; and though 
in every refpea the expenfe of living has more than kept 
pace with the rife of the rents, it is a faft, that both them- 
felves and their families are better lodged, better drolled, 
and better fed than ever. Thefe remarks are applicable to 
the tenants in general, and they are particularly applicable 
to a few, leading, adive, and fcnfible men, who are happi- 
ly diftributed in different departments of the diftnft, and 
J who

who have both the inclination and the power to fet an ex- 
ample of judicious induftry to their more indolent and lefs 
intelligent neighbours. Such men as thefe are of great confe- 
quence,efpeciallyin a corner of the country, where the farm- 
ing, notwithftanding what has been faid in its behalf, is 
ftill to be confidered as only in a Hate of infancy. They 
have a claim to protection and encouragement from their 
landlords in particular, with whom they co-operate in eve- 
ry liberal plan of improvement, and they acquire a title to 
the gratitude of the community at large, by making corn 
and grafs grow, where neither grafs nor corn ever grew be- 
fore. The valued rent of the parifh is about L. 4000 Scots 
money. The real rent is not fo eafily afcertained, as a 
good deal of it is paid in victual, &amp;c. Computing the 
victual, however, at about 15 s. the boll, which is nearly 
the medium price here for the laft 7 years, the whole rent 
of the parifh amounts to upwards of L. 2000 Sterling. 
We obferved, that in the year 1791, the arable part of the 
diftrict comprehended 2555 acres, which were then cropped 
as follows : 

Acres. 

In oats and barley, each nearly in an equal 

quantity, - - - 1554 

In peafe, potatoes, and turnip, - 205 

In flax, - - 44 

In artificial grafies, - - 375 

In inland pafture, - - - ^ 77 

2 555 

The farms in general are fmall : None of them rent a- 
bove 100 Sterling, and the greater part of them are under 
L. 50. Each plough, at an average, turns annually about 

27 



2 4 y Statijiical Account 

27 acres ; and the rent of the infield acre varies according 
to the quality of the foil, &amp;c. from 10 s. to 20 s. The pa- 
rilh, befides fupplying * itfelf, exports a quantity of visual 
to Dunkeld and the Highlands. The ftaple grain is oats 
and barley, (about a boll of feed to the acre), each of 
which yields, at a medium, 4—5 returns. More green 
crops would be raifed were there more inclofures, of 
which laft, the great advantage is every day felt and ac- 
knowledged. The turnips are but lately introduced here, 
and none of them are fown in the broad caft. The farm- 
ers are not yet fuffkiently apprized of the great propriety of 
thinning them out in due feafon to proper diftances in the 
drills, by which negled they are prevented from fwelling 
to their proper fize. Potatoes are becoming a favourite 
crop, and they afford food to the people during a great part 
of the winter. In a few places yams f begin to be raifed, 
of which both the horfes and cows are remarkably fond. 
The cows, when fed with yams, give better milk than 
when they are fed on clover or turnips, and the yam-milk 
has no foreign tafte. Summer-fallowing is little pra&amp;ifed, 
and, by confequence, the ground is in many places foul. The 
couch-grafs extracts the fubftance from the manure, and chokes 
the crop. Were more of the grounds inclofed, that rotation 
of crops, which now begins to be known and approved 
of, would become more general ; and till this be the cafe, 
fanning cannot be carried to any high degree of perfection. 
The following rotation, which is well known in England, 
and in many parts of the lowlands, has been lately tried 
here, on a fmall fcale, with very confiderable fuccefs. The 

farm, 

* Here we do not include the confumpt of four fmall {tills, of 30 gal- 
Jons each. 

f The Surinam potato is here called by that namr , 



1 



of Clunie. 



farm is inclofed and divided into 4 parts, nearly equal ; 
and the hiftory of i-4th explains the hiftory of the whole. 
Firft year, fummer fallow, if the ground be foul ; or, if 
clean, peafe, potatoes, and turnip. Second year, all the 
dung of the farm, with barley and grafs-feeds. Third 
year, grafs. Fourth year, oats. Then recommence. By 
adhering to this plan, the oats have already yielded the 
ritfi, -and the barley the 16th return; and as no two white 
crops immediately fucceed one another, the ground can ne- 
ver be exhaufted. — In the higher parts of the parifh, the 
old Scots plough is ftill ufed, with 4 horfes a-breaft, and 
the driver going backwards between the 2 middle horfes. 
In the lower and fmoother grounds, the low-country 
plough, with the ^ call-iron mould board, is becoming fa- 
ihionable, drawn by 2 horfes without a driver. About 30 
years ago, it was not uncommon here to fee 8 or 10 oxen, 
and 2 horfes, all yoked to one plough ; but there is at pre- 
fent no cattle-plough in the parifh. The horfes are of a 
middle fize ; and the fingle horfe carts are found by expe- 
rience to be preferable to the double ones. The cattle, ex- 
cepting a few of a larger fize that are fed in gentlemens in- 
clofures, are the fmall black Scots cattle, weighing from 16 
to 24 ftone. A good many of thefe are fold every year 
from the parilh ; but neither the cattle nor Iheep trade are 
carried on to any extent. There are in the parilh about 
1018 fheep, and of thefe a few are of the Cheviot breed. 
The number of the cattle amounts nearly to i2cc; but 
fome of the fmaller farms appear to be rather overftotked. 
There are in all about 337 horfes ; and attention begins to 
be paid to the improving of the breed of both the Iheep, 
horfes and cattle. The number of ploughs is 79, of which 
the greater part are the old Scotch ploughs, and the hum-

ber of the carts is 243, chiefly 1 horfe carts, the wheel 
from 48 to 52 inches diameter*. 

Population. — According to the return made to Dr Web- 
fler, the number of fouls was then 905. — From the late ex- 
tenfion of agriculture, and from the number of new houfes, 
which are more than an overbalance to the number of old 
ones thrown down, the inhabitants have been for fome time

The inhabitants, excepting one born in England, are all 
natives of Scotland, and mofily of the parifh. With regard 
to their religious perfuafions, they are all of the Eftablifhed 
Church, except 2 old Scotch Epifcopalians, and 4 of the 
Church of England. There are a few Seceders, principal- 
ly women, who are natives of other parifhes, and who en- 
deavour to train up their children, particularly their daugh- 
ters, in the principles of their own perfuafion ; thefe Sece- 
ders, old and young, may be reckoned about 20 *. 

Charatler of the People. — The generality of the parishion- 
ers are difpofed to honeft induftry and good neighbourhood. 

They 

* Numbers of the people refide in paltry villages, containing each from 
20 to 50 inhabitants. Mr Elder has begun, in the neighbourhood of his 
houfe, a new village, on a decent plan. A few of the houfes are finilhed, 
and fome tradefmen are already eftablilhed there. To each of the families 
will be allotted fome portion of the adjoining ground, for the purpofe of 
raifing greens, potatoes, &amp;c. By which means the wild bank, where the 
village is fituatcd, may be foon brought into a ftate of high cultivation ; 
and the village itfelf may, in a fliort time, become a place of fome confe- 
rence. At any rate, fuch attempts to improve the country, are highly 
commendable. 



2 5 2 Statijlical Account 

They are obliging and bofpitable, cbearful, contented, and 
charitable. There is no diffenting meeting-houfe in the pa- 
rifh. Excepting a very few, who feem to be toffed about 
with every wind of doclrine, the people are united and fet- 
tled in their religious opinions. They feem to have lefs of the 
form than of the power of godlinefs, and to entertain pret- 
ty liberal and enlightened ideas with refpeft to both natu- 
ral and revealed religion. Seldom are any of them guilty 
of enormous outrages againft the rules of morality. Mur- 
der and filicide are unknown among them. None of them 
natives of this parifh, has been hanged or banifhed thefe 60 
years ; and no perfon was ever known to perifh here for 
want of bread. Few of the young men join the army or 
the navy. The martial fpirit of their forefathers has fub- 
fided, and the target and the broad fword have given place 
to the plough (hare and the fickle. They are of a middle 
feature, and tolerably handfome figure. Whether it be 
owing to thofe more laborious exertions to which they are 
accuftomed in their younger days, or to fome other caufe, 
their fize is faid to be comparatively diminiihed, and their 
bodily ftrength impaired. We have this on the authority 
of old perfons ftill alive ; but fuch perfons are apt to be 
partial to the times that are part ; and allowing age all the 
credit and refpecT: to which it is entitled, we can no more 
believe that our worthy great-grandfathers were all giants, 
than that their degenerate pofterity are all pigmies. — - 
Both the men and the women have of late years improved 
greatly in drefs and cleanlinefs. In their manners and cu- 
ftoms, which on the whole are neither rude nor refined, 
they refemble their neighbours, the lowlanders on the one 
hand, and ihe highlanders on the other ; and, like the lat- 
ter, they are generally fond of the agreeable and innocent 
diverfions of mufic and dancing. Their convivial enter- 
tainments, terminate fometimes, though rarely, in intoxica- 
tion 



of Clunie. 



*S3 



tion and uproar but, except 2 or 3 individuals, who have 
unfortunately abufed themfelves with the fpirit of whilky, 
they may be regarded as a temperate and fober people. 
They are not, as formerly, the dupes of fuperftitious ere- 
dulity. Many old ufelefs rites and ceremonies are laid a- 
fide. Little attention is paid to bug-bear tales : Superftitions, 
charms, and incantations, have loll their power. Cats, 
hares, magpies, and old women, ceafe to aflume any other 
appearance than what nature has given them ; and ghofts, 
gobblins, witches, and fairies have relinquilhed the land. 

Church, Manfe, Stipend. — It would be a credit to thi3 
country, if all the old crazy kirks and manfes in it were 
razed to the foundation, and new ones built in a workman- 
like manner, on a decent and convenient plan, and of the 
moft fubftantial and permanent materials. This would oc- 
casion fome cxpenfe to the prefent proprietors of the coun- 
try, who in general are opulent and liberal ; but what it 
would take out of their pockets, it would put into thofe of 
their pofterity and fucceflbrs to the 13th and 14th genera- 
tion. The kirk of Clunie, though one of the beft in the 
neighbourhood, has neither comelinefs nor proportion. It 
appears to have been built about the time of the Reforma- 
tion, has been fince repeatedly patched, and was laft repaired

in 1788. The ftipend, including 50 merks for communion-

School, Poor.— The parochial fchool houfe was renewed 
in 1788, upon a large and liberal plan, at an expenfe of 
nearly L. 100 Sterling, built of good ftone and lime, cover- 
ed with blue flate, and nnilhed with the belt Memel wood. 
A' fountain of good water rifes hard by, contributing much 
to the health of the fcholars, who have alfo a piece of 
ground allotted them for air and exercife. About 60 in 
winter, and 30 in fummer, are here inftructed in the prin- 
ciples of reading Englilh, writing, and arithmetic, at the 
low rate of 6 d. the month at an average. Some time ago 
it was the practice of the better fort of farmers here, to 
lend their fons to the fchool a few years to learn Latin ; but 
very little Latin is now taught in this part of the country; 
and fuch as deftine their fons for the learned profeffions, 
generally fend them to towns and grammar-fchools. The 
fchoolmafter's falary is L. 8 : 17 : 9 Sterling, his fchool- 
fees amount to about L. 7, he receives L. 1 for officiating 
as feffion-clerk, and about L. 1 more for proclamations, 6cc. 
fo that his yearly income may be reckoned nearly L. 18 
Sterling. — The poor here are all mpported in their own 
houfes, and give no trouble to the country. The number now 
on die poors lilt is from 8 to 10 old or infirm objects, to whom 
money is diftributed monthly, in proportion to their exi- 
gencies. This money arifes from the ufe of the mort- 
cloth, from the occaiional donations of fome of the more 
wealthy and generous of the parifliioners, from the interelt 
of a principal of L. 70 Sterling, but chiefly from the Sun- 
day's collections at the church door, which amount to a- 
bout L. 5 each at an average. The management of the 
poors-money is in the hands of the kirk-feflion. Each 
elder has the infpection of the poor in his own department, 
and, being intimately acquainted with their fituation and 
circumitances, cannot be fuppofed liable to any mifappli- 
cation of the public charity. This parilh not only ftipports

its own poor in a decent manner, but alfo difpenfes much 
to indigent people from the Highlands ; and efpecially to 
a number of importunate vagrants from Perth, Dundee, 
Aberdeen, Glafgow, &amp;c. who crowd hither at all feafons 
when the weather permits them to travel. There is rea- 
fon to fufpecl, that many of thofe laft mentioned are not 
.real objects of charity, but idle, profligate impoftors, that 
ought to be confined within the walls of a bridewell. This 
grievance calls for redrefs, as no perfon mould beg, or be 
permitted to beg, while Providence bleffes him with the 
life of his reafon and of his limbs. 

Mineral Springs, Minerals and Foffils. — There is one mi- 
neral ipring near the Milton of Clunie, the waters of which 
are fometimes ufed by the people of the neighbourhood as an 
antifcorbutic. There is another, of ftronger powers, on the 
foreft, on the fouth bank of the burn of Lornty, a little to 
the eaflward of Bogmill. Its tafte refembles that of the 
well at the South Inch of Perth, and its qualities are fome- 
what fimilar to thofe of the waters of Pitcaithly ; but as nei- 
ther of thefe fprings has yet undergone any chymical ana- 
Jyfis, their peculiar medicinal virtues are not fully afcer- 
tained. 

The internal mineral ftrata have not been much invefti- 
gated. On the furface of the ground there are maffes of 
the quartz, the whinftone, the moor-ftone or grey granite, 
the red filex with which the Caledonians pointed their 
arrows, and the terra ponderofa. In the grounds of Gour- 
die, there is a fpecies of hard red grit, quarried in different 
places for the ufe of the proprietors. The houfes of Gourdie 
and Delvin are built of it. It is of a very durable quality, 
being proof againft the acid of the air, and the influence of 
fire. There is good limeftone on the hill of Gourdie ; 
but being of a very hard nature, it is difficult to be burned.

In one place, on the north fide of the hill, it appears to have 
been dug out formerly, in confiderable quantities, when 
% there was plenty of wood in the neighbourhood ; but at 
prefent, in confequence of the want of proper fuel, parti- 
cularly coal, it cannot be turned to any material account. 
A large vein of fine blue ilate extends from S. W. to N. E. 
along the foot of the Grampians, interfering the parilhes 
of Aughtergavin, Little Dunkeld, Caputh, and Clunie, in 
which lad parilh it feems to terminate. It is wrought here 
to fome account, and fold at 18 s. to 20s. the thoufand. The 
Clunie flate does not fplit fo fmoothly as that of Efdale 
and Laroch, but is thought little inferior in point of colour 
and durability. In fome places on the bank of the burn of 
Droothy, its laminae are found interfperfed with fmall 
mafles of the pyrites. The flate quarries here, though open- 
ed four fcore years ago, have not been carried on with 
much fpirit or dexterity, and have contributed but little to 
the emolument either of the proprietor or of the tackfman. 
The vein in fome places is merely fcratched ; and where it 
has been ftruck deeper, the falling in of a little rubbifli has 
fometimes put a flop to the operations of half a feafon. It 
may be here remarked, that the ltrata of the fchiftus feem in 
general to run parallel to Strathmore and the Grampians ; 
that is, from S. W. to N. E. and to incline towards the 
Strath, 7. e. towards S. E. in angles of 50 to 80 degrees *. 

Curiq/ttiei 

* In the hilly parts, there is plenty of good peat ; though, in fome of 
the moffes, the uppermost ftratum is rather foft and fpongy. Peat is alfo 
found in fome of the lower parts pf the diftriel ; but here it is often im- 
pregnated with fulphur or bitumen, and, when burned, throws out ef- 
fluvia difagreeable to thofe who have been accuftomed to other fuel. In 
' moft of our mofies, there are veftiges of oak, birch, and hazel. Foffil 
horns are fometimes found at a great depth in the mofs. The head of the 
Urus has been dug up in this neighbourhood, as alfo the palmated horns 
of the elk, together with the horns and Ikeletons of large deer, fuppofed

Curiqfities and Antiquities. — Among the firft, may be 
ranked a deep peat mofs, of an excellent quality, on the 
very fummit of Ben-achally, but fuch phenomena are com- 
mon in the Highlands : In the face of that mountain, which 
looks towards the eaft, there is a cave of confiderable mag- 
nitude, appearing at fome diftance like a giant dreffed in 
Ihort bkck cloaths : This cave is called the Drap, or Drop, 
from the water oozing through the crannies, and perpetual- 
ly dropping from the roof of the cave. Below the Drop, 
and near the foot of the mountain, is a cove, called Henry's 
hole, from its having been in former times the hiding-place 
of fome robbers or plunderers of that name. There is, in 
the high grounds of the park of Laighwood, another cove 
that has obtained the name of the 'Tod' 1 's -chair, (Fox's-chair), 
from its frequently affording a fafe afylum to reinard : 
Here large fragments have been fevered from the impend- 
ing rock, probably by a thunder-bolt, and ftill fhow, by their 
correfponding angles, the places from which they have been 
detached. One of thefe fragments forms a fort of table at 
the entrance of the cave, and a feat, where the fpeclator en- 
joys a wild and romantic view of the neighbourhood. The 
old wall or dike of the park of Laighwood may, not im- 
properly, be claffed among the antiquities of this parilh. 
It Was built upwards of 4 centuries ago, of dry ftone ; is in 
fome places 6 or 7 feet high, and 4 feet broad a-top, and 
notwithftanding it great age, does not appear to have un-

cauld -We have mortar of a very ftrong adhefive nature* forming an ex- 
cellent cement; and rich clay, which, when applied to a light fandy 
fell, has proved an excellent manure. Pipe-clay is found in the loch of 
Uume, and l&amp;ewife fome marl, which it would be impracticable to 
drag, on account of the depth of the water. Marl, more acceffible, may 
probably be ^covered in fome other parts of the parilh, when they /hall

dergone any material reparation. It inclofes an area of a- 
bout a fquare mile, which, with the barony of Laighwood, 
is faid to have been given by Robert II. to the then Earl of 
Athole, for quelling an infurreftion of Donald of the Ifles. 
This park, has ever fince continued the property of the A- 
thole family ; and, previous to the building of Dunkeld- 
houfe, it was defigned to be one of the places of their resi- 
dence •, feme materials for that purpofe were brought here, 
and depofited, in a fine fituation near the centre of the 
park, at a place called Stanley know, in honour of the Der- 
by family. A little to the north of Stanley-know, there 
is a rifing ground ftyled the Gallow-drum, and about 300 
yardo S W. of the minifter's glebe is another eminence, 
named the Gibbet-know, both which were places of execu- 
tion in the times of the baronial jurifdiftion. On the eafl 
fide of the mofs at the foot of Ben-achally, we find a fepul- 
chral cairn, which has never been opened; and a few fur- 
longs to the fouthward of this cairn, there is a great num- 
ber of fmall cairns, which the people here call the Pechs 
cairns, i. e. the Picls cairns •, but whether thefe cairns 
mark the fcene of a battle between the Caledonians and the 
Pitts, or whether they are veftiges of the huts of the old 
inhabitants ; or whether they have been collected merely 
for the purpofe of clearing the adjacent grounds in paftoral 
times, it is uncertain. There are two immenfe collections 
of (tones, one on the S. W. and the other on the N. E. ex- 
tremity of the parifh. Thefe are faid to have marked the 
boundary here between the Caledonian and Pi£lifli king- 
doms ; it is not unlikely, however, that they ha e been 
formed to commemorate the death of fome illuftrious chief- 
tains or heroes. At the eaft end of the hill of Gourdie, in 
the middle of a cultivated field, may be feen a curious 
piece of antiquity, called the Steeds-Jlalls. It confifts of 8 
mounds, with 8 correfponding trenches ; perhaps fome more 

have

have been obliterated by the plough. The mounds and 
trenches are of equal length, alternate and parallel. At 
the fouth end of each trench or fofle, there is a circular 
concave, the centre of which lies in the line of the fofle, and 
to this circular concavity the fofle feems to have formed the 
entrance. It is faid, that an advanced guard of the Caledo- 
nian army was polled here, to watch the motions of the 
Romans, when they lay encamped at Inchtuthill, about 2 
miles to the fouthward in the plain below. The place of 
the Steeds flails feems to be well calculated for fuch a pur- 
pofe. It lies on the north fide of the fummit of a riling 
ground that feparates the Highlands from the Low Coun- 
try, and it looks directly northwards on thofe declivities of 
the hills, which the Caledonians are fuppofed to have then 
occupied. By ftepping a few yards forward to the fummit of 
the ground, that covered the redoubt, the Caledonian guard 
could diftin&amp;ly mark, the enemy, without the poflibility of 
being perceived ; and the intelligence could be conveyed in 
a few minutes to their friends on the north lide of the Lu- 
nan. The Steeds-flails is about 2 miles north of the Ro- 
man camp at Inchtuthill*, about a£ miles W. N. W. of 
that at Meiklour* about 7 miles W. N. W. of that at 
Cupar Angus \ and about 2\ miles fouth of the Hecr- 
cairns f, or the cairns of the battle.

* Mr Playfair, minifter of Bendochy, the ingenious antiquary above 
mentioned, who has been at great pains to inveftigate the antiquities of 
the Stormont, is of opinion, that when Agricola fought the great battle 
with Galgacus, the Roman legions were probably ftatio'nid at Meiklour. 

f The old Saxon word beef, fignifies army. Thefe cairns lie near the 
N. E. boundary of this parifli, but within the limits of the parifli of Kin- 
ioch ; and confequently the particular defcription of them belongs to the 
hiftory of that parifli. They have long attracted the attention of the an- 
tiquary. Oral tradition affirms them to be the fpot where a great battle 
was fought in old times 5 and their appearance indicates them to be the

There are different veftiges of chapels and cemeteries in 
this parifh : One at Gourdie, (called the chapel of the Ho- 
ly Ghoft) •, another at Chapelton ; another at the Chapel- 
hill, a little to the north of the prefent church ; a 4th in 

the 

fcene of fome very remote and important tranfadtion. — However natural it 
may be for every Caledonian to wifli to know the fcene of the decifive en- 
gagement between Galgacusand Agricola, it is highly probable that that 
fcene will never be precifely afcertained. Our only information on that 
fubjecl, is derived from Tacitus, who, though he gives us a moft animated 
defcription of the engagement itfelf, leaves us very much in the dark as to 
the fcene of it. From him we learn only, that it mull be fomewhere at 
the foot of the Mons Grarnpius ; but every one knows that the Grampian 
Mountains ti'averfe the whole extent of Scotland, from the vicinity of A- 
berdeen to the diftridl of Cowal in Argylefhire. In this extenfive range, 
there have been four different places, and thefe confiderably diftant from 
one another, fuppofcd to be each of them the field of this battle. — The 
firjf of thefe is at Fortingale, at the foot of Glenlyon, in the very centre 
of the Grampians, where the veftiges of a camp, apparently Roman, are 
£1111 vifible. But it is not likely that fuch an experienced General as A- 
gricola would have ventured to draw off his legions fo far from the fleet, 
through the defiles of the mountains, where they would be every moment 
in danger of being furprifed, and cut off by a bold and refolute enemy, 
who knew that country too well, not to take advantage of it ; and, ail 
any rate, the fcene at Fortingale is too much hemmed in by high moun- 
tains, and every way too limited, to admit of fuch an extenfive engage- 
ment as that defcribed by Tacitus. — The fecond fpot is at Comrie, near the 
head of Strathern, where there is likewife the appearance of a Roman 
camp, and where the fcene, indeed, is lefs circumfci ibed than the former ; 
but here alfo objections occur. The ftrath is narrow below and above, 
and the mountains rife boldly from the vale. The general face of the 
country does not feem to accord with many of the exprefiions of Tacitus; 
nor does it appear well calculated for bringing into action the troops of 
horfe, (turmce e quit um,') and the currus or eovinr, the hook-armed 
chariots or cars of the Caledonians, which they then ufed in common with 
the other Britons. We do not recollect, at Comrie, any remarkable ap- 
pearance of tumuli, indicating the fcene of fuch a battle. And here alfo 
the Roman army would have been too diftant from the fleet, which is 
fuppofed, with great probability, to have been then riding at anchor in 
the mouth of the Tay.— The third place alleged to be the fcene of the

the park of Laighwood ; and a 5th on the ifland of the 
Loch of Clunie, where a place of worfhip, dedicated to St 
Catharine, flood on the fpot now occupied by Lord Air- 
ley's kitchen. Before the late reparation of the cattle, 

one 



battle, is near fettercairn, in the county of the Mearns. Here, indeed, 
the army of the Romans would not have been at fuch a diftance from 
their fleet, fuppofing (with fome) that the fleet had pafled the Red-head, 
and was hovering fomewhere off the adjacent coaft. But this fuppofition 
is not fo readily admiflible ; as the coaft of Angus and Mearns, from the 
Red-head to Stonehive, is, in general, bold, rocky, and dangerous ; and 
confequently rather to be fhunned than courted by the Roman fleet, e- 
fpecially at that feafon of the year, which feems to have been about the 
autumnal equinox, when the winds might have dallied them againft the 
rocks, or blown them out into the German Ocean. Befldes, we do not 
find in the Mearns any piece of antiquity fo likely to have been a ftatioit 
for the Roman legion3, as the long vallum at Meiklour, now known by 
the name of Cleven-dike. But there feems to be one infuperable objec- 
tion to the fcene in the Mearns : Tacitus exprefsly tells us, that, iuna-- 
diately after the engagement, Agricola marched off his army into the 
country of the Horefti ; " in fines Horcjlorum exercitwn deducit /" and. 
as the Horefti were the inhabitants of Angus and Mearns, it is not at all 
probable that fuch an accurate hiftorian as Tacitus would have uled fuch 
an expreflion, if the battle had been fought any where within the limits 
of their country.— The Lift fpot prefumed to have been the fcene of this 
engagement, is the Heer.-cairns, with the grounds in their neighbour- 
hood. This, on an attentive inveftigation, appears to be at leaft as pro- 
bable a fcene as any of the four. Agricola could not, perhaps, in all ' 
Strathmore, have pitched upon a more favourable ftation for his legions, 
than that large elevated plain comprehended between the Cleven-dike 
and the confluence of the Tay and the Ila. It is at no great diftance from 
the mouth of the Tay, where the Roman army, in cafe of a defeat, might 
have had a more eafy accefs to their mips. On the W. it is defended by 
the fteep bank of the Tay, and on the S. E. and N. E. by the banks of the 
Ila, and of the Lunan. It commands a diftindl view of the higher 
grounds of the Stormont, to the N. and N. W. and it looks dircclly weft- 
ward, on the entrance into the Highlands, by Dunkeld, which was then 
the : capital of the Caledonians, and in the vicinity of which we may fup- 
pofe it would be natural for them to hold their general rendezvous on 
tins occafion. This fuppofed ftation of the Romans is about 3 or 4 miles

one could eafily perceive where the chapel had joined to 
it ; and a few years ago, when the gardener was trench- 
ing the ground there, he dug up human bones in feveral 
places. 

The 

S. S. E. from that of the Caledonians at the Bu&amp;z,ari-dtkes, And it feems 
that the Roman generals, in ancient times, (limilar to the practice of the 
moderns), frequently fat down at fuch a diftance from the enemy, pre- 
vious to a general engagement. — The ground which the Caledonians are 
thought to have then aflumed as the fcene of their martial atchievements, 
lies about 7 or 8 miles N. E. from Dunkeld, on the open declivities of 
the hills, facing the fouth, and commanding a full profpect of the lower 
Stormont and Strathmore. In feveral parts of this neighbourhood, the 
furface of the ground exhibits a lingular appearance of long hilly ridges 
(or drums, anfwering very well to the " colles" of Tacitus), running pa- 
rallel from W. to E. and rifing above one another, like the feats of a 
theatre. This appearance is remarkably exemplified at the guard-drums, 
which are partly inclofed by the Buzzard-dike or Vallum, which is Hill, 
in many places, 8 or io feet high. This inclofure, through which the 
burn of Lornty paffes, might be defigned by the Caledonians principally 
as a place of fecurity for their cattle and provifions, as well as for their 
wives and children. Thefe "colles," or long extended eminencies, rifing 
gradually one above another, were well fitted for dilplaying the Caledo- 
nian army to the beft advantage. And, from the fplendid account given 
of it by Tacitus, one is led to conceive a magnificent idea of its appear- 
ance : " Jamque fuper triginta millia armatorum confpiciebantur, et ad- 
" hue affluebat omnis juventus, et quibus cruda ac viridis fene&amp;us, clari 
*' bello, acfua qui/que decora geft antes." And again, " Britannorum acies 
" in fpeciem fimul at terrorem editioribus ldcis conftiterant ; ita ut pri- 
«« mum agmen sequo c«teri per acclive jugum connexi velut infurgerent." 
That the auxiliary troops, who fought the battle on the part of the Ro- 
mans, were at fome diftance from the legionary ftation, before they began 
the attack, appears plainly from this exprefiion of Tacitus : " Arceffendas 
plerique legiones admonebant." " Moll of them gave it as their advice, 
that the legions ought to be fent for." Mr Playfair is of opinion, that 
the two armies might have met, and the line of battle might have been 
formed, fomewhere on the lower grounds of Balleii or Balcaim. If fo, 
then Agricola's right wing might extend to the neighbourhood of that 
hill (above Mar lei) which ftill retains the name of Craig-Romati ; 
where, as we are credibly informed, feveral Roman urns and Roman 1pm ? 

were 



of Clunie. 16$ 

The ifland itfelf may be ranked among the antiquities of 
the parifh. It is moftly artificial, if not altogether fo. It 
mult have been formed with great labour, and in fome ve- 
ry diftant period too, as there is neither record nor tradi- 
tion 

were dug up, about.40 or 50 years ago, by the proprietor of the ground. 
The circumftance of Roman Jpurs being found there, gives the more pro- 
bability to our conjecture ; becaufe the wings of the Roman army con- 
futed of the 3000 cavalry who, as Tacitus expreffes it, " cornibus affun- 
derentur," were widely extended on the wings, in order to prevent the 
Romans from being attacked in flank. — The grounds here would afford 
full fcope for both armies to extend their lines in the manner defcribed by 
Tacitus ; and it is manifeft from his defcription, that the fpaces of ground 
they then occupied, and over which they muft have paffed through the 
different ftages of the engagement, were, in all probability, very confi- 
derable. — After the Batavian and Tungrian cohorts had begun, " erigere 
in colles aciem," the Caledonians would fall back towards their entrench- 
ments above the Heer-cairns. It is poffible, therefore, that thefe cairns 
(according to Mr Playfair's idea) may be the very fpot, where, as Taci- 
tus obferves " Britanni, qui adhuc pugnas expertes, fumrria collium infe- 
deiant, et paucitatem noftrorum vacui fpernebant, degredi paullatim et 
eircum in terga vincentium casperant," when Agricola, by a mafterly 
manoeuvre, turned the ttratagem of the Caledonians againft themfelves, 
and brought on the general rout. Then commenced that dreadful car- 
nage of which the words of Tacitus are fo wonderfully defcriptive : 
" Paffim arma, et corpora, et laceri artus, et cruenta humus,'' and of 
which the Heer-cairns may at this day be an affecting memorial. — The 
Caledonians, in their retreat northwards ovei The Guard Drums, feem to 
have faced about on the fummit of each Drum, and there to have made 
a rcfolute and bloody Hand againft their purfuers. This appears pre- 
fumable from the number and pofition of the tumuli on each of thefe 
Drums, and it brings to the mind of the fpectator that ftrong expreflion 
of Tacitus, in which he pays an indirect compliment to the bravery of the 
yanquiflied, " Aliquando etiam victis ira virtul'que." It likewife appears 
from the difpofition of the tumuli along the neighbouring hills, that the 
flight of the Caledonians, previous to their general difperfion, was princi- 
pally by two different routs; the one N. W. towards the woods of Stra- 
thardheil, and the other N. E. towards thofe of Maus, where there is alfo 
a number of cairns, feemingly coeval with the others. In fome of thefe 
Ih Phyfair has lately dug up cinders and fome little bits of human 

bones.

tion with refpeft to its formation. In papers dated 300 
years ago, the oldeft we have feen on the fubjeft, it is 
termed the ifland of the ]och of Clunie. The people here 
affirm, that it was once joined on the S. E. fide to the con- 
tinent ; but this is not at all probable, as the land there lies 
at a veryconfiderable diftance, with deep water intervening. 
Its furface is a circular plain, of about half- an acre, raifed a 
few feet above the ordinary level of the loch, and fur- 
rounded with a ftrong barrier of ftones, thrown carelefsly 
together, and {loping into deep water all around, like the 
fruftum of a cone. On the N. E. quarter, the wave, which 
from that point has a pretty long courfe, has made via- 
ble encroachments on the ifland, and laid bare the roots of 
fome of the old trees, which, by confequence, have of late 
years fuffered very material decay. But Lord Airly is 
now taking fteps to prevent fuch devaflations in future ; 
and pity it were indeed, that fuch a curiofity fliould perifli 
merely through neglecl. That this ifland has been form- 
ed principally by human art feems demonftrable from 
this, that the ground of which it is compofed is evidently 
factitious ; and in lately digging to the depth of 7 feet, near 
the centre of the ifland, nothing like a natural ftratum of 

earth 

bones. And here, fome have thought it probable, that Aulus Aniens, 
and fome of the 33 Romans who fell with him in the battle, were burnt 
together in one funeral pile, at the great cairn, which is about So or 90 
yards in circumference, and in the centre of which we had occafion to 
fee cinders turned up laft fummer, 1792. 

Such, on the whole, are the conjectures we have been led to form o« 
this fubjecl, from our having examined the different fcenes with fome de- 
gree of attention. We offer them to the public, however, only as con- 
jectures. And it is by no means our intention to enter into any contro- 
verfy on a fubjedt, which, in all likelihood, will ever remain involved in 
ebfeurity ; and which muft be confidered as at bed rather a matter of 
curiofity to the antiquary, than of real utility to mankind.

of one of the fragments of the ruins, where, if a {tone 
was thrown in, it was heard for fome time, as if rolling 
•down a ftair-cafe. From this it feems probable, that were 
a fe£lion of the hill to be made, fome curious difcoveries 
might be the confequence. The caftle-hill is of an ellipti- 
cal form, extending in length from N. to S. about 190 
yards at its bafe, and riling about 50 feet above the level 
of the loch . A green terrace furrounds the hill ; and on 
the N. fide one terrace rifes above another. The area of 
the fummit approaches to an elliptical plain, a little incli- 
ned towards the eaft •, of this plain, the longitudinal diame- 
ter, from N. to S. is about 90 yards, and the tranfverfe a- 
bout 40. The old caftle has flood on the fouth end of the 
fummit, commanding a diftinct view of the neighbour- 
hood, fo as not to have been eafily taken by fur- 
prife. Some veftiges of it ftill remain ; but neither its 
form nor dimenfions can be traced with any degree of pre- 
cifion. The principal fortifications feem to have run a- 
long the land fide, and the loch and the declivity of the hill 
appear to have defended it on the eaft, where it is proba- 
ble there has been an eafy communication with the ifland 
by means of boats ; fo that, in cafe of the caftle being ta- 
ken, the ifland might afford a refuge to the befieged. 
Concerning this piece of antiquity no written record can . 
be found. According to the tradition of the neighbour- 
hood, it was a fummer palace or hunting-feat of Kenneth

Macalpin who conquered the Pids, and united the Scot- 
ch and Milh kingdoms ; and if we fuppofe this tradition 
to be .well founded, it is not unlikely that it was he who 
firft formed the ifland in the loch, as a place of retreat in 
time of dangi r. 

In the flat grounds of the park of Laighwood, on the 
north fide of the burn of Lunan, are the ruins of another old 
caftle, which appears to have been fortified on all fides by 
ditches filled with water. On the north fide was the prin- 
cipal draw bridge, with an avenue of very old trees lead- 
ing to it, fome of the laft of which were cut down in the 
memory of the prefent generation. A chapel and burying 
ground are faid to have adjoined to the caftle, on the fouth 
fide, where human bones have been found. On the W. 
and S. W. fides are the remains of later buildings ; but no- 
thing of the original caftle is now to be feen, except two 
vaults, and a fmall part of an under gallery, with two loop- 
holes, pointing towards the draw-bridge, which are vifible 
within, but without are blinded by the rubbilh. With re- 
gard to this ruin, alfo, record is filent. Probably it was 
likewife a hunting-feat of fome of our old Scottiih kings. 
The fadition concerning it is, that William Sinclair, bi- 
fliop of Dunkeld, afterward to be taken notice of, was the 
laft perfon who refided here, and hence it is called Sin- 
clair's caftle to this day. 

Eminent Men. — The people here fpeak much of the 
prodigious bodily ftrength of one William Gordon, who 
was a fon of one of the laft Epifcopalian minifters of this 
parilh, and who fell at the battle of SherifFmuir, in the 
year 17 15, fighting on the fide of the Earl of Mar. The 
above mentioned William Sinclair makes a figure in the 
Hiflory of Scotland. He was diftinguiflied by the appella- 
tions of the military billiop, and the champion of the king- 
dom ; 



of Clunie.

dom ; and that he was as much formed for wielding the 
fvvord, as for wearing the furplice, appears from the follow- 
part of his hiftory : " When he refided at his palace of 
Aughtertool in Fife, the Iheriff of that county went with a 
body of 500 men, to make head againft the Englifh, who 
had landed in that neighbourhood ; but obferving that the 
country was laid walte, and that the enemy kept a good 
countenance, the fheriff fell back as fall as he could. On 
hearing this, the bilhop armed himfelf, took horie with a- 
bout 60 of his' people, who were well difciplined, foon 
meets the Iheriff, cries aloud, " What madnefs is it in you 
to run away at this rate ?" The iheriff replied, " Becaufe 
the Englilh are more numerous and better foldiers than 
we are." " If you got your due, fays the bilhop, the king- 
would caufe chop off your golden fpurs ; but follow me, 
and with the affiftance of St Columbus, whofe lands they 
lay wade, w.e (hall have our revenge." With thefe words 
he throws away his bifhop's ftaff, grafps his fword, turns 
himfelf to the Iheriff, with this expreffion, " Do follow 
me." They did follow him, came up with the enemy, 
and happily obtained a complete victory. There fell that 
day more than 500 Ehglifh, befides a number, who, by 
crowding into their boat, overfet it and were all drown- 
ed." Sinclair was a great favourite of the king, (Da- 
vid II.), who always in converfation called him " My own 
bifhop ;" and the letters he wrote to him were addreffed, 
" To our bilhop." Sinclair died 27th June 1337, having 
filled the fee of Dunkeld 25 years. He was buried in the 
quire of Dunkeld, which he built from the foundation 5 
and in memorial of this work, he caufed to be erected on 
the top of the eaft gable of the quire, (the prefent church 
of Dunkeld), a fluted crofs, (part of the armorial hearings 
of his family), which is (till Handing there. — Bilhop tJeoi ge

died in the cattle on the ifland of the loch of Clunie, the 14* 
January 1514, in the 2d year of the reign of James V. 
He was of the family of Midmar. He ftudied grammar at 
Dundee, and philofophy at St Andrew's ; and was after- 
ward promoted to be chancellor of Aberdeen. Being 
fent to Rome by the King, on a menage relative to the fee 
of Glafgow, he became acquainted with the college of car- 
dinals, and particularly with the vice-chancellor Roderigo 
Borja, who, by his infereft with Pope Sextus IV. got 
Brown raifed to the fee of Dunkeld. Being in his old age 
much afflicted with the gravel, he retired to his caftle on the 
ifland of Clunie, for which he had a peculiar predile&amp;ion, 
and which he built from the foundation, all but the vault 
of the great tower. He is represented as a man of fome 
learning and public fpirit, but of much ambition and ra- 
pacity. By influence and dexterity, not altogether juftifi- 
able, he found means to enlarge confiderably the bounds 
of his diocefe. He could ride by 4 different ways from 
Dunkeld to Clunie, all on his own ground. It was he 
who began the ftone bridge acrofs the Tay 'at Dunkeld, 
I arch of which he lived to fee completed in fummer 
1513 ; but this bridge was never finiflied. In the fee of 
Dunkeld, he was the immediate predeceflor of Galvin 
Douglas, the elegant tranflator of Virgil. 

James Crichton, known by the name of the admirable 
Cricbton, who makes fuch a diftinguiflied figure in the li- 
terary annals of Europe, is faid to have been born on the 
ifland of Clunie. This was confidently aflerted by the 
oldeft people of this parifli who have died in the memory 
of the prefent incumbent •, they were educated in this creed, 
and unwilling to hear of any thing advanced to the contra- 
ry. We have, however, feen no records that afcertain 
the place of his birth. We know for certain, that he was

cate of Scotland, who was proprietor of the whole barony 
of Clunie, and who was- fucceeded in that property by his

eaft wall of the caftle. Without entering into any difqui- 
fition with refpeft to the wonderful abilities of James Crich- 
ton, which we believe his eulogifts have greatly exaggera- 
ted, we beg leave to refer for particulars to the new Edin- 
burgh Encyclopaedia, which contains perhaps the moft un- 
exceptionable account of him. His fucceffive adventures at 
Paris, Rome, Venice, Padua, and Mantua, are recorded at 
large in the 3d vol. of Dr M'Kenzie's Scotch lives ; in the 
8iftNo. of the Adventurer ; in the ift vol. of Pennant's 
firft Tour through Scotland and in the Edinburgh Maga- 
zine and Review for June 1774, in which laft, there is a 
fmali portrait of Crichton, taken from the original paint- 
ings of him, which are faid to be ftill extant in many col- 
lections on the continent. He was reprefented on horfe- 
back, with a fword in the one hand, and a book in the 0- 
ther, as emblems of his having excelled equally in the ma- 
nual and literary exercifes. At Venice he contracted an 
intimate friendfhip with the younger Manutius, a man of 
great learning, and of an honeft and refpectable character, 
who relates many things of him on his own perfonal know- 
ledge. He was an eye-witnefs to Crichton's behaviour, 
both in the prefence of the Doge and Senate of Venice, 
and at the difputation at Padua ; and may therefore be re- 
garded as an indubitable teftimony to the truth of both. 
The caufe and manner of Crichton's premature and unhap- 
py death, will perhaps ftill remain in fome degree of obfcu- 
rity ; but we have the authority of Manutius for believing 

that 



270 



Statijlical Account 



that the Court of Mantua ordered a general mourning for 
him ; and this circumftance alone, independent of every o- 
ther panegyric, throws an indelible Iuftre on his memory. 
A mong the many epitaphs that lamented his death, it may 
not be improper, in a repofitory of this kind, to infert the 
following one by Johnfon in his infcriptions on Scottim he- 



roes : 



Jacobus Critonius Clunius* 

Mufarum pariter ac Martis alumnus, omnibus in fhidiis,

Remarkable 



* For the fake of thofe who feem to be of opinion that the wonderful 
Crichton was not a cadet of the Clunie family of that name, but of the 
family of Elliock, we here beg leave to quote the following intelligence, 
collected from the chartulary of the Earl of Airly, and obligingly com- 
municated to us by Mr Thomas Mitchell at Craig, prefent factor on the 
Airly eftate : " The loch, ifland, and chapel of St Catharine, within die 
loch, together with other parts of the barony of Clunie, and teinds of the 
whole, anciently belonged to the Bilhop of Dunkeld, the reft of the ba- 
rony to the Herons of Glafclune. About the commencement of the Re- 
formation, that part which pertained to Heron was apprifed from him by 
Robert (afterwards Sir Robert) Crichton of Elliock, King's Advocate of 
Scotland ; and at the fame time George Crichton, Bilhop of Dunkeld, 
who was a brother of Sir Robert's, difponed to him his whole property 
in the barony, with this remarkable refervation, that it fliould be in the 
BihVp's power, at any time he pleafcd, to refume it, and incumbent on 
the difponee to yield it, and all title thereto, and to remove therefrom,

Remarkable Seafons and Occurrences. — In the dry feafon of 
I7 23, the crop here, though very rich, owing probably to 
the fertilizing dews that fell in the night time, wasfo fhort, 
that a boll of corn, with all its ftraw, could eafily be con- 
tained within the four corners of an ordinary Iheet or can- 
vafs ; there was, however, no fcarcity of fodder, the fub- 
fequent winter being lb exceedingly mild, that the cattle 
were never houfed from the one end of it to the other. — In 
June 1724, a tremenduous water-fpout broke upon the high- 
er parts of this parilh, and engulphed the declivities, in 
fuch a manner, that the -marks of it are in many places 
dill vifible. — The long and fevere frofl: of 1740 was fol- 
lowed 

upon 40 days warning. The reafon for this is very obvious : The two 
"brothers had confidered, that if the alteration in religion fhould take ef- 
fect, the church would be plundered of its patrimony ; and it would be 
as well that Sir Robert fhould get a part of that which belonged to the 
fee of Dunkeld, as another ; and, if the' old eftablifhment fhould again 
prevail, the Bifhop would have been reftored to his own. Upon the 
rights I have mentioned, Sir Robert Crichton procured afterwards a char- 
ter of confirmation and novodamus from King James VI of the whole 
barony of Clunie, loch, ifland, &amp;c. with the advocation, donation, and 
right of patronage of the parifh and parifh-kirk of Clunie, and chapel of 
St Catharine, within the loch. And the fame were enjoyed by him, and 
his fon and fucceflbr, Sec. There is nothing in this that contradicts the 
opinion which my Lord Buchan has formed, that, the mirabilis Crichton 
was a fon of Sir Robert Crichton of Elliock, as Sir Robert might be at 
one time defigned of Elliock, and at another of Clunie." 

From Mylne's manufcript hiftory of the Bifhops of Dunkeld. we find 
that George Crichton filled that fee from the year 1522 to 1559. His dif- 
pofitiod of the lands of Clunie to his brother, muft have happened fome 
time in the intermediate fpace. On the rights difponed to him by the Bi- 
fhop. Sir Robert would naturally take pofieffion not only of the property, 
but probably of the palace of Clunie too, efpecially as it muft have been 
then in high accommodation, having been lately built and inhabited by 
Bifhop Brown, and eftcemed at that time one of the principal houfes of 
this country. The fuppofition, therefore, that his fon, the admirable 
Crichton, who died a young man, in the year 1581, was born on the 
ifhnd of Clunie, fsems to poflefs the higheft degree of probability.

lowed by a very bad crop, owing, in part, perhaps, to the 
ground being ploughed in the fpring before the froft was 
thoroughly loofened at the bottom of the furrow ; a fcar- 
city enfued ; and fome of the inhabitants of this parifti 
were obliged in the winter to travel as far as Murraylhire 
for meal, which they brought acrofs the mountains with 
confiderable labour and expenfe — The drought of fummer 
1766 parched the crop here to fuch a degree, that in the 
autumn many of the corn-fields, inftead of being cut down 
with the fickle, were paftured by the horfes and cows ; 
but the mildnefs of the enfuing winter prevented any hard 
confequences. — In Auguft 1769, another water-fpout, ac- 
companied with dreadful thunder and lightning, fell here 
of an afternoon, from the S. E. ; and in a few minutes 
fwelled the torrents to an amazing height, fwept off feve- 
ral of the bridges, and did confiderable damage to the 
ftanding corns. — In 1782 no great hardlhip was fuffered 
here, as fome of the moft lubftantial farmers had meal in 
referve, which, when a mob was threatened, they fold off 
at the rate of 20 s. the boll. — The great meteor of the 18th 
Auguft 1783, exhibited no phenomena here different from 
thofe obferved in other parts of this country, and de- 
fcribed in the tranfactions of that year. Its paffage from N. 
W. to S. E. was marked here about 18 minutes after 9 
o'clock P. M.— On the 22d of July 1786, about noon-day, 
a hurricane, refembling a tornado, preceded by a deceitful 
calm, burlt fuddenly, with a noife like thunder, from the 
weft; and, being collected into a current by the high 
grounds on each fide of the Lunan, raged herewith prodigious 
violence, till about a quarter after 12 o'clock noon ; during 
which time it unroofed feveral houfes, and difmantled or 
overturned fome of the oldeft and ftouteft trees in the dif- 
tria. A ftately beech, that ftood on the lawn before the

inanimate beauty of the place, was rooted up ; 4 old planes 
fell on the adjoining bank, and, at the fame time, on the 
ifland of Clunie, 5 venerable trees, that had withftood the 
blafts of centuries, and fheltered the ifland on the N. W. 
were laid flat on the ground. The waters of the loch un- 
derwent an unufual agitation, and the fpray was whirled 
in fhowers over the neighbouring grounds to a confiderable 
diftance. This hurricane, by far the moll dreadful we 
ever had bccalion to witnefs, was termed by the people 
here an earth wind, and fuppofed to have been accompa- 
nied with fome degree of earthquake. — About the end of 
February 1788, there was here a very deep fall of fnow, 
fuddenly followed by a fmart thaw and heavy rain, which 
occafioned fuch an inundation of the loch of Clunie, as has 
not been feen during the prefent century. The whole 
ifland was immerfed for upwards of two hours, and its trees 
and caftle feemed to float on the furface of the water. 
The meadow of Clunie lay under water 4 feet deep, 
and two men failed acrofs it, in a flraight line, all the 
way from the cafUe-hill, to the wall of the new garden 
of Forneth, without meeting with the fmallefl obilruftion, 
— On the 19th of November 1791, at half pafl 7 o'clock 
P. M. a fire-ball of uncommon magnitude", apparently as 

0 f 

large, or very nearly as large as the difk of the 
moon, was obferved here in its paflage from S. S. W. 
to N. N. E. Its elevation feemed considerable, and its 
motion rapid. For a few feconds, it illuminated the coun- 
try all around . very diftin&amp;ly. It emitted fparks, and left 
a train behind it ; and, a little to the northward of our ze- 
nith, it divided into two lefler balls, which alfo emitted 
fparks, and moved with equal velocity, their diftance' in- 
creafing as they proceeded in their courfe to N. N. E. 
Before they reached the verge of our horizon, they both 
difappeared at the fame inftant, a little below the great flar

their difappearance, we heard from that quarter of the hea- 
vens a loud explofion, fimilar to that from the difcharge cf 
a piece of ordnance. The meteor was obferved, and the 
explofion was heard at Dunkeld-houfe, and the time there 
correfponded with the obfervation here. A few days 
afterward, a fevere froft fet in here, with fome lnow, and 
continued, with a few momentary intervals of thaw, till 
the end of January 1792, during all which time the fur- 
face of the ground was one fheet of ice : The people were 
obliged to carry in water to their cattle ; and neither man 
nor horfe could venture abroad without having their feet 
fecured with iron. A remarkable rainy feafon followed ; 
the moll luxuriant part of the crop was lodged in the begin- 
ning of Auguft, and never ripened ; harveft was not got home 
till near the middle of November, and even then in very 
poor condition ; fuch of the crop as has been already threfh- 
ed out is by no means productive : The barley is found ve- 
ry unfit for malting, and in many places, it requires two 
bolls of oats to yield one boll of meal. The meal is in ge- 
neral very indifferent in its quality. The people are natu- 
rally apprehenfive of bad conlequences. But their greateft 
fuffering at prefent arifes fr om their want of fuel. The 
peats that were caft laft fummer, could neither be got dried, 
nor carried home, on account of the inceffant rains. A boll 
of coals, i.e. 42 ftone weight, coffs juft now (Chriftmas 
1792), 8 s. Sterling at the fhore of Perth, and on account 
of the extreme badnefs of the roads, it cofts 4 s. more for 
the carriage of it to Dunkeld. 

Advantages and Di [advantages.— The farmers, in general, 
enjoy the great advantage of a perennial fountain of good 
water in their immediate neighbourhood. We obferved, 
that in the higher parts of the parifh there is plenty of 
Food peat, and, in the lower parts, broom, furze and brufh- 

wood, 



of Clunle. 



-wood, all ferving as the common fuel of the inhabitants. 
Good ftones every where abound, for building fences and 
homes. Marl of an excellent quality lies at no great di- 
ftance, and the ground is well calculated for mail ; beiides, 
it has almoft every where a flope, favourable for draining ; 
and though in many places it is difficult to be cleared, yet 
in ordinary feafons, and under due management, it never 
fails to repay the labour and expenfe bellowed upon it. 
The farmers begin to be lcnlible of thefe advantages, and to 
make a proper ufe of them. But, on the other hand, they 
labour under feveral inconveniencies, which, it is hoped, 
will in a fhort time be removed. Servants wages are ex- 
orbitant. The want of day labourers is a great hindrance 
to agricultural improvement. The tenants cannot be re- 
conciled to the idea of meliorating their climate and foil, 
by railing belts of feathered wood on the N. E. and W. 
fides of inclofures. The burn of Lunan is fuffered to in- 
undate and render half ufelefs many valuable acres of 
ground in the park, of Laighwood, and barony of Clunie, 
a devaftation that might be prevented in both places by 
ftraighting and banking the burn, which, it is thought, 
could be done in a fubftantial manner, at an expenfe not 
exceeding L. 200 Sterling. The materials for building 
good houfes abound in the parilh ; many of the people live 
-in miferable fmoky cribs, more like fties for hogs than 
habitations for men. Several of the farmers have too fhort 
leafes, and fome of them no leafes at all ; and confe- 
quently, are difcouraged from carrying on improvements 
to any extent. The old oppreffive cuftoms of bonnage, 
thirlage, and fervitudes, (difgraceful to the country, and to 
humanity), are not yet quite abolifhed. The public ro;'.ds, 
though lately fomewhat improved, are (till, during one 
half of the year at leaft, extremely indifferent ; though 
there is fome reafon to expe£t, that the commutation of 

the. 



2 76 Statijlical Account 

the ftatute-labour, which begins to take place, and the 
committing the reparation of thefe roads to active hands, 
will be productive of good effefts. The peat mofles are 
diftant, and high in the hills •, and the roads that lead to 
them, are fit only for killing the horfes, and dafhing the 
carts in pieces. The tenants here, as in many other parts, 
are obliged to fpend too much of their time in providing 
the necefTary fuel for the winter. There is no coal nearer 
us than the more of Perth ; the river Tay, broad and deep, 
runs between •, and there is not a bridge acrofs it, in its 
whole courfe, from Aberfeldy to Perth, i. e. in a courfe of 
upwards of 40 miles. There is, however, a certain pro- 
fpect. of much benefit accruing to this part of the country, 
from the new road marked out from Perth to the river 
Ila, and from the bridge that is about to be built acrofs 
that river at Meiklour, which will greatly facilitate the 
carriage of coal and lime, and other necefTary articles from, 
Perth.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24197254">CRANSTON</name>, 

(County of Edinburgh, Synod of Lothian anb 

TWEEDDALE, PRESBYTERY OF DaLKETTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr Walter Fisher.</head> 



<p>, Extent, Climate, Surface, l£c. 

ITS extent is about 5 miles in length, and 3 in breadth. 
The climate, though fubjeft to the variable weather of 
the ifland, is mild and healthful. If any diftemper, more 
frequent than another, attack the inhabitants, it is the 
ague, a complaint which chiefly prevails in the fpring, 
when the eafterly wind often becomes a trade wind, is 
loaded with cold vapour, and felt in all its feverity on the 
eaftern parts of the ifland. The face of the parifh is un- 
equal, but the fine feats, the gentle fwellings of the ground, 
the intermixture of inclofures and plantations, render it ex- 
tremely beautiful. The profpe&amp;s from the higher grounds 
are at once rich and extenfive. The river Tyne runs 
through the parifh from S. to N. and though here but a 
rivulet, yet it widens in its progrefs, before it falls into 

the 



Statiflical Account 



the Forth at Tynningham. Its banks are decorated with 
handfome and noble feats. In this parifh, the magnificent 
ftriiftureg of Oxenford caffle and Prefton hall, planted on 
oppofite banks of the river, the piclurefque but natural 
formation of grounds, the fields chequered with trees, and 
crowned with corns ; all thefe arreft the eye of the travel- 
ler, and prefent to his view a landfcape equal to fome of 
the moft cultivated fpots in England. 

ManufaBures, is'c. — The ftaple commodity of the parifti 
is corn. Oats are carried to Dalkeith, where there is a 
weekly market, the beft in Scotland for that fpecies of 
grain, and fold to meal makers at a ready money price. 
Peafe and beans are carried to the fame market. Wheat 
is fold to bakers or ftarch makers ; and barley to brewers, 
diftillers, or barky makers. Quarries of freeftone, lime- 
Hone, and pitcoal, are wrought in feveral places, and make 
a good return to the proprietors. The price of a boll of 
fhells is 10 d. and I s. ; and of a load of coals, equal to 2 
cwt. 5 d. Near to Coufland are a brick work and a pot- 
tery. At Upper Cranfton, works have been lately erected 
for extracting tar from pitcoal ; an ingenious procefs, which 
reflects much honour on the Earl of Dundonald, who made 
the difcovery, and enjoys by patent an exclufive privilege 
for the manufacture. The coals are put into ovens, and 
after being kindled, are flowly decompofed ; while the vo- 
latile parts fly off into feparate refervoirs, where they are 
condenfed. Each condenfer has two ovens appropriated 
to it, and between the ovens and condenfers is placed a 
long leaden cittern filled with water, in order to hailen the 
procefs. The condenfel fluid is then conveyed from the 
condenfers, by a cock into wooden pipes, which lead it in- 
to a pit ; from whence it is pumped into the ftill. By the 
act of diftillation, or boiling, the fteam flies off into another 

large

, ra ge wooden vefiel, where it is condenfed into an oil and 
volatile fpirit. The diitillation continues for the fpace of 
4-* days, when the refiduum in the dill makes excellent 
tar. "The oil and fpirit are then drawn ofF into a fmaller 
veflel, and as the oil fwims on the top, a feparation is ea- 
fily made, by drawing off the fpirit. If the tar is boiled 
in the ftill for $1 days, the fluff remaining in the ftill is 
then called half pitch ; and mould the procefs be continued 
a day longer, it would become as brittle as glafs. The 
volatile fpirit is diitilled a fecond time before it is expofed 
to file, and afterwards made into hart/horn by the chyrnifh 
A bright varni/h is produced, by mixing one gallon of the 
forefaid oil with fix lb. rofin, and then boiling them toge- 
ther ; and a black varni/h, by mixing and boiling together 
4 lb. rofin, 1 gallon of the above oil, and 1 Scotch pint o£ 
the half pitch. The Britim tar is of a blacker colour, and 
has a finer Ikin than common tar. It contains no water 
like the latter, and its quality is injured by any mixture 
of lamp black, red and white lead, oil or tallow. Vege- 
table tar, containing an acid that corrodes iron, does not 
anfwer as a prefervative from ruft ; but this tar, poffeffing 
no fuch corrofive quality, is found to be an eftedhial co- 
vering for guns, mot, bolts, and all iron work. Its prin- 
cipal recommendation however is, that it is excellently a- 
dapted for paying the bottoms of fhips, and preferving 
wooden work, that is expofed to the weather, or liable to 
be worm-eaten. If the half pitch cannot be readily pro- 
cured, when required, the tar may be brought to that con- 
fidence, by boiling it a fufHcient time ; to be afcertained 
by dipping into it a chip of wood, which on cooling, will 
mow when the tar has acquired the proper degree. The 
tar and pitch muft always be heated before they are ap- 
plied. On wooden work, firft lay on the tar quite hot, 
and then a coat of warm pitch. Piles that are to be dri- 
ven

*en into the ground, mould be well heated, before they 
fcre dipped into the half pitch. Nails are lackered, by 
heating them in a wire balket over a ftove, and haftily 
dipping them, while hot, into the tar. As they cool, the 
tar dries on them, and when thus prepared, they are not 
apt to ruft, or render the wood what is called iron-fick. 
Worms do not penetrate into wood that has been proper- 
ly impregnated with the tar ; if the bottom of a veffel 
therefore be of fir, all that is neceffary is to fire her well, 
and while the plank is hot, to lay on a coat of the tar heat- 
ed in a pot. When the feams are chaulked, fimfh the 
whole with a coat of half pitch prepared in the fame man- 
ner. But as oak, from its clofe texture, will not imbibe 
a fufficient quantity of tar, to preferve it againft the worm 
for any length of time, it is neceffary to fheath oak bot* 
tomed veffels with white fir wood, impregnated with the 
tar, to lacker the fheathing nails, and lay over all a coat 
of half pitch to firiilh it off. Britilh varniih is preferable 
to turpentine varniih, becaufe the oil of which it is made, 
is of a more penetrating nature than that of turpentine. 
The effect it has, when laid on wood, is to clofe its pores, 
by filling them with the rofin it contains, and thus to ren- 
der white, or fap wood, equal in quality to red. The 
bright or clear varniih is ufed in the fame- manner as tur- 
pentine varniih, and anfwers as a fublKtute for lintfeed oil, 
in painting all colours, except with red and white lead 
•when dry ; but if thefe be ground with oil, it is then equal 
to turpentine varniih, and comes much cheaper. The 
black varniih is defigned for all parts of a veffel expofed 
to the weather, where paint or pitch is not ufed. It dries 
fall:, and gives a fine glofs to the wood. The tar, before it 
is boiled, is fold for greafing carts at 6 d. a Scotch pint.

Antiquities, i$c. — Coufland was burnt by Somerfet, 
when he invaded Scotland with a powerful army, to en- 
force the marriage of the beautiful Mary with the young 
King of England. Though the Union of the two king- 
doms was an important and defirable object, yet this was 
certainly a rough mode of making love to a Queen. — On 
the fouth fide of this village, are to be feen the ruins of 
fome buildings, with two inclofuves furrounded by high 
walls. No authentic account of them, after much refearch, 
can be found; but if we may credit tradition, they an :he 
remains of a nunnery. The higheft wall, commonly call- 
ed the White Dike, at prefent meafures 24 feet, and the 
reft vary in height from 5 to 11. The inclofures were un- 
doubtedly orchards, fince cherry trees and goofeberry 
bufhes were frill growing a few years ago. That there 
was a church yard here, and a bell to be feen hanging in 
the end of the chapel, till it was carried off by fome tin- 
kers, are fa&amp;s fupported by the teftimouy of perfons Mill 
alive. Hence it is probable, that it was a religious foun- 
dation, and perhaps dedicated to St Bartholomew, fince 
there are fome acres of ground to the fouthward, which re- 
tain the name of Bartholomew's Firlot. 'The old manfe 
which flood near to Preftonhall, is faid to have been a reft, 
ing place for the religious in their way to Melrofe. No 
date could be difcovered on the building, but over one of

ftyle, 1 Diverforium infra, Habitaculum fupra.' At Upper 
Cranfton ftands a venerable green holly, perhaps the lar- 
geft in the ifland, with too evident marks of old age and de- 
cay. It meafures 7^ feet in circumference, or 2 feet 4.64 
inches in diameter, and where it divides into branches, 
the trunk is no more than 7 feet high. At Caickmoor, 
there is a thriving beech 16 feet round, or 5 feet 1.11 in- 
ches in diameter, and at Preftonhall, another 15 feet round, 
or 4 feet 9.29 inches in diameter. Thefe trees, from 
their near fituation to the maniion houfes, feem to have 
been planted at firft in the garden ground, to which cir- 
cumftance we muft in fome meafure afcribe the great fize 
they now exhibit. 

Hujbandry, ifc. — Tt was in this parifh that the firft ex- 
ample of the drill husbandry was given. Sir John Dal- 
rymple of Coufland, grandfather to the prefent Baronet, 
was the firft perfon who introduced into Scotland the fow- 
ing of turnip, and the planting of cabbages in the open 
field. lie alfo greatly improved the breed of horfes and 
black cattle, and was among the firft who fowed clover 
and rye grafs. Mr Cockburn of Ormifton, and he, both 
of them diftinguifhed by zeal for their country, and a paf- 
fion for agriculture, eftablifhed at Ormifton a fociety, 
which had for its object the improvement of hufbandry. 
Befides actual farmers, perfons of the firft rank in the coun- 
try, were proud of being inrolled as members of that club. 
The Duke of Perth, and John Earl of Stair, regularly at- 
tended its monthly meetings. The foil of this parifh con- 
fifts partly of clay or ftiff lands, and partly of thofe that are 
light. The whole is arable, in general fertile, and well a- 
dapted for producing all kinds of grain. The ftate of e- 
griculture is much the fame as in other parifhes of Mid-

Lothian. Two-horfe ploughs are univerfally employed, 
and the plough held in higheft eftimation is that made by 
J. Small at Rofebank, which is defervedly confidered as 
the greateft improvement agriculture has received for ma- 
ny years. Mr Small publifhed forae time ago an account 
of his plough in a particular treatife, and fince that publi- 
cation, he has made a farther improvement, by fubftituting, 
in place of the wooden head, one of call metal. Laft year, 
(179 1,) the firft experiment was made with a plough fo 
mounted in this parifh, and before proper judges. Though 
the field pitched on was very rough, and lix horfes were 
yoked and driven on at a great rate, yet the caft metal 
head was not in the leaft damaged. Since that time prac- 
tice proves, that no force ever neceffary to be applied to 
the plough can injure it. The value of this improved 
plough appears from its being univerfally adopted, and 
the great commifnons the inventor receives. The advan- 
tage of alternate green and white crops is fufficiently un- 
derstood ; but though the turnip hulbandry was lirft prac- 
tifed here, and the nature of the foil in many parts is very 
favourable to that fyftem, yet turnips are fcarcely cultiva^ 
ted at prefent. The turnip hulbandry requires fo accurate 
a lkill in the buying and felling of cattle, that every perfon 
is not qualified for conducting it.' It is a curious fad, that, 
when turnips were firft cultivated in the parilh, during 
thofe early experiments, no manure, it was imagined, would 
anfwer for railing them, but the belt which Edinburgh pro- 
duced. The principal productions are wheat, barley, oats, 
peafe, beans, hay j and the beft rotation that is obferved is 
fallow, wheat, peafe, barley, grafs and oats. Some of the 
farmers drive manure, from the dillance of 4 or 5 miles, 
and up hill, to improve their ftiff lands, every cubic yard 
of which, when laid on the land, colts them about 5 s. 
The farms are laid out from 100 to 500 acres. The rent

of land runs from 5 s. to 30 s. an acre, and a few fields of 
^ good quality are let fo high as L. 2 the acre. A mildew 
infects the banks of the Tyne from Cranfton to Pencait- 
land, and fome times does material damage to wheat and 
oats. The lands about Ormifton generally fuffer more 
than any other part of the tract where it prevails. The 
rent of the panfh is about L. 2800 Sterling, and the va- 
lued rent is L. 6208 : 1 : 4 Scots. The rent of the fmalleft 
farm is L. 35, and of the greateft L. 300 *. 

Population^ &amp;c. — The population, according to Dr 
Webfter's report, was 725.' From an exact furvey made 
in the 1792, the number of fouls amounted to 839 ; males, 
376, females, 463. After extracting 3 different periods 
from the pariih regifter, the number of births flood as fol- 
lows : from 1715 to 1726, the males were 112, and the 
females 144, total 256; from 1739 to 1750, the males 
were 106, and the females m, total 217 and from 1779 
to 1790, the males were 90, and the females 95, total 185. 
The average of male births, therefore, for the fpace of 30 
years, is fomewhat more than 10, of female more than 11, 
and of both, nearly 22 yearly. From this extract, how- 
ever, it would not be a juft conclufion to infer, that the 
number of births, and confequently the population, has 
been on the decreafe ; becaufe every year, on account of 
the feceffion, the neglect or poverty of parents, feveral 
births are omitted to be inferted in the parifli regifter. 
The average ot marriages, for the fpace of 10 years, a- 
mounted to 8, but the regifter where they are inferted has 
not been kept with any exadtnefs. There are 3 villages

The rent of a houfe is from 12 s. to 20 s. There is no 
charatteriftical difference between the inhabitants of this and 
the other parifties of Mid-Lothian. If there be any ground 
for animadverfion, the abufe of fpiritous liquors among the 
lower ranks affords it. Where fuch a habit prevails, the 
health fuffers, bufinefs is neglected, and poverty follows 
of courfe. Thefe pernicious effects were not fo common, 
when ale and beer were more generally drunk. It would, 
certainly then be an effential fervice to the community, to 
impofe fuch a duty on fpiritous liquors, or to transfer it 
from ale and beer to them, as would diminifh the number 
of low tippling houfes, and bring back the people to the 
fafer ufe of malt liquor.

the weekly colle&amp;ions, and the intereft of money left by-

therto anfwered every demand, and confequently there has 
been no afTeflment. The number of poor is from 14 to

fupport of its diftreffed members and indigent widows.

fimilar focieties of a long ftanding, feem well calculated to 
anfwer the ends of the inftitution. Such aflbciations merit 
the countenance of the landed intereft, becaufe they tend 
to leffen the number of the poor, and retard a general af- 
feflment.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3815177">KILCONQUHAR</name>, 

(County and Synod of Fife, Presbytery of St 

Andrew's.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Small.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

J£1l.con3vkar is derived probably either from Cella, the 
cell or chapel of a faint or monk, called Conachar ; 
or from the Gaelic Kil, a place of worfhip or interment, 
and Conachar. From S. to N. that is, from the fea to the 
borders of the parifh of Ceres, it is about 8 Englifh miles 
in length ; and, in ' general, about 2 in breadth. It is Situa- 
ted in that part of the county of Fife, which, on account 
of the narrownefs of the land, jutting out into the German 
Sea, and warned by the friths of the Forth and the Tay, is 
called the Eaft Nook of Fife. Its furface is fomewhat ir- 
regular, being flat in the fouth for i-§ miles from the fea ; 
rifing gently towards the north for about 2 miles •, then, 
after a fmall declivity, afcending again towards the north 
for more than f of a mile, on the north of which the ground 

is

is partly flat, but, for the moft part, declining towards the 
north. The foil in the fouthern part is light and fandy, 
but by proper culture, bears rich crops ; in the higher 
ground of the very beautiful and fertile bank that faces the 
lea, it is deep^ black loam ; in fome places, very rich clay. 
In the northern parts, though it is in fome places abundant- 
ly rich, the climate is lefs favourable ; the foil too, in many 
places, being a clay bottom mixed with fand, is of inferior 
quality, and lefs productive ; it is now arable in general ; 
not long fince, a great part of it was taken from moors •, in 
dry feafons, however, it yields good crops ; much wheat 
and barley of excellent quality is raifed in the fouthern 
parts j peafe and beans alfo, and every kind of grain that is 
ufual in this country, fucceed well here. 

Agriculture, ifc. — Though the farmers are not attached 
to any particular mode of farming, the following is a rota- 
tion of crops frequently obferved here, wheat, turnip, or 
any green crop, barley, and clover *. There are few oats 
raifed in the lower part of the parim, but they are much 
ufed in the higher grounds. Sometimes we ftand in need 
of importation of oats and oat-meal ; while we export 
confiderable quantities of wheat, barley, peafe and beans, and 
fome potatoes. The late Earl of Balcarras, about 40 years 
ago, introduced field turnip into his plan of farming, and 
fed oxen with them to a great extent ; the ufe of that va- 
luable root was not perhaps fooner known in this part of 
the country ; his Lordfhip's example was but little follow- 

* Wheat is fown in September, Oftober, November, fome even in 
January and February ) which laft is fometimes found to anfwer well : 
It is reaped commonly in Auguft and September. Peafe and beans are 
fown in February, Maich, and beginning of April; barley generally in 
May : And reaped in Auguft, September, or fometimes beginning ot 
October.

ed if at all, till within thefe 25 years ; the pra&amp;ice is now 
become very general, to the great benefit of the country. 

When the turnip appears above ground, it is often much 

hurt from a caufe that feems not to be well underftood, fome 
imputing it to a fly that eats the tender leaves ; an ingeni- 
ous gentleman in this neighbourhood, who has bellowed 
much attention on this fubjedt, imputes it to froft, and is con- 
fident the turnip fufFers nothing from the fly. The Ruta bagct 
or Swedifh turnip, was introduced into this parifh about 4 
years ago. Its leaves refemble the rib kail plants, the root 
refembles field turnip, not fo large in general, but heavier 
in proportion to its fize, and of much firmer texture. It is 
believed, that as great weight of this root may be raifed on 
an acre, as of field turnip ; this plant feems to be gaining 
ground here ; it is proof againft the moft intenfe froft ; the 
feafon for fowing it is from the ift to the 20th May ; it 
may either be tranfplanted as cabbage, or managed as field 
turnip. Potatoes were fcarcely known in this country 40 
years ago ; they now afford the poor half their fuftenance, 
and generally appear at the tables of the rich ; they are 
well known to be very proper food for horfes and other a- 
nimals, and are fometimes diftilled into whifky. Peafe and 
beans are much ufed, and generally fown in drills ; thev 
are hoed with the plough, and afterwards with hand hoes, 
which renders them meliorating crops. The number of 
horfes in the parifh is about 239 ; of cattle, 624 5 of alles, 
22 ; of wheel-carriages, 3. The plough generally ufed is 
that of Small's conftru&amp;ion, with a broad fock and mold 
board of Carron metal. Twenty or 30 years ago, the al- 
moft univerfal pra&amp;ice of the farmers of this parifli was, to 
yoke 2 horfes and 4 oxen in a plough 5 now, ploughs are 
generally drawn by 2 horfes, one ploughman managing 
them •, fcarcely are any oxen feen in a plough.— There are 
between 70 and 80 ploughs, and about the fame number of

earts; about 40 years ago, few carts were ufed in this coun- 
try ; coals, vi&amp;ual and other articles, were at that period, 
and perhaps later, carried on horfeback •, corn, hay, manure, 
&amp;c. were driven with wains, drawn by 2 horfes and 2 c-xen. 
The parifh contains 63^ ploughgates, confifting of between 
40 and 50 acres each, fo that the whole parifh may be com- 
puted at upwards of 3000 acres arable, befides 280 acres of 
links or fandy plains, the haunts of rabbits, a fpecies of a- 
nimals, which, though deftru&amp;ive to corn, bring no fmall 
profit to the proprietors ; they are extremely prolific, being 
faid to have young 5 or 6 times in the year, 3 or 4 of the 
firft litter, 5, 6, or 7, of the following ones. Property in 
land has changed much in this parifh of late years. The 
value of land is rapidly inerealing ; farms let for 19 or more 
years, are generally raifed one third, and the rents of 
fome are doubled within thefe few years ; a farm of good 
land uninclofed, fit for the highefl culture, is let from 40 s. 
to 50 s. a-acre ; the belt paflure, inclofures, &amp;c. from 
L. a to L. 3 the acre. Thirty or 40 years ago, there was 
fcarce a large farm in this country that had not a flock of 
fheep ; now there are very few flieep in the country, ex- 
cepting thofe in gentlemens inclofures, for famiiy ufe ; fince 
fummer fallow, for the culture of wheat, and the clover 
and turnip fyftem for feeding cattle, were introduced, the 
farmers difcontinued keeping flocks of fheep *. The va- 
lued rent of the parifh is L. 9509 Scots. — The real rent is 

increafed 

* Servants wages are gradually increafing in this parifh. The wages 
of a common labourer 6 or 7 years ago, were from 7 d. to 10 d. a-day ; 
now they are from 10 d. to 15 d. The wages of men-fervants hired for 
the year at the above period, were from L. 4 to L. 5 ; now they are 
from L. 6 to L. 8, and their victuals. The wages of maid-fervants at 
the fame period, were from L. I, 10 s. to L. a Sterling, for the year; 
now they are in general from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3. The wages of wrights 
or carpenters a-day, are is. 6 d, in fummer, and is, 3 » n wintc *

increafed in proportion to that of other parifhes in the 
neighbourhood. The air is wholefome in general, though 
damp in fome places ; the people live to a good age ; there 
are many who live beyond 80, and fome beyond 90 years- 
There is a poor woman in this parifti, who avers, that me is 
more than 100 years old. This, however, is not authenticated 
by our records. 

Population.— At the time of Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls was 2 131 ; the number of the inhabitants 
at prefent is about 2013* . There are 4 villages or fmall 
towns. Colinlburgh contains about 357 inhabitants; Earlf- 
ferry, about 350; Kilconquhar, about 258; Barnyards, 
about 198 ; the country part of the parifti, about 850. 
There are 2 clergymen, one of the Eftabliftied Church, the 
other of the Relief Congregation. There are between 
600 and 700 feftaries, adhering chiefly to the Prefbytery 
of Relief, with fome Burgher-feceders and ^Independents ; 
few of the Epifcopal profeffion, and no Roman Catholics. 
There are 13 proprietors of land, 5 rending, and 8 non- 
refident ; 1 writer, 11 merchants, 20 farmers above L. 50 
rent, 10 innkeepers and brewers, 8 fmiths, 89 weavers, 
23 tailors, 18 mafons, 21 failors, 3 butchers, 12 gardeners, 
46 ftioemakers, 8 bakers including apprentices, 4 flax-dref- 
fers, 2 coopers, 5 millers, 2 tanners, with 1 clerk, and a 
currier, 6 faddlers, who are employed occafionally in fhoe- 
making. The apprentices and journeymen are included in 
the numbers of the refpeftive trades.

it appears, its erection into a royal borough, is of very an- 
cient date. The original charter is loft, having been de- 
firoyed by a fire of the borough of Edinburgh, as fpecified 
in the copy above mentioned. In this borough there are 3irta- 
giftrates, 15 councillors and a treafurer, the oldeft magiftrate 
acting as provoft. The election is annual and by poll. They 
forfeited their right of voting in the election of members of 
Parliament, in common with fome other towns in this coun- 
try, through their inability to pay their proportion of the 
fums neceflary for defraying the expenfes of a commiffion- 
er in Parliament fome centuries ago ; when 4 the anxiety 

of 

rying him over the frith, at the hazard of their lives and liberties, while 
[ he wai efcaping from the cruelty of Macbeth, the Earl obtained from 
King Malcolm the following privilege in their favour, viz. That the per- 
fons of all who pafs the frith from Earl's Ferry in a veffel belonging to 
the town, were declared inviolable, or fafe from their purfuers, till they 
were half lea over. This, it would appear, is the origin of the name of 
Earl's Ferry. There is one (loop, and a few fmall fifhiiig-boats, belong- 
ing to Earl's Feiry. Formerly there were 18 fifhennen; but fince the 
year 1766, when 7 of them were loft in a ftorm in one boat, only a very 
few are employed in fifhiag occafionall) . — There is in our records a copy 
of the infcription on Macduff's crofs, written in a language unknown 
in this part of the country, as follows : 

Maldraradrum dragos, maleria largia largos, 
Spalando Ipados, five nig fig guippite ^naros,

Part of the above infcription has been tranflated as follows : 

* I King Malcolm Kenmore, grant to thee Macduff Earl of Fife, free

of our anceftors to obtain an exemption, was almoft equal 
to the eagernefs with which our contemporaries folicic ad- 
miflion into Parliament *.' 

Rods, Caves and Lakes — On the weft of the Earl's Ferry 
is Kincraig-rock, remarkable for caves, which, though fome 
of them refemble the works of art, are probably excava- 
tions caufed by the influx of the fea. In one of them, Mac- 
duff's cave, are fome remains of a wall, which tradition 
fays, was built by Macduff, Earl of Fife, to defend him 
from Macbeth, who, having murdered his coufiu King Dun- 
can, afcended the throne of Scotland, and treated his fub- 
jeffcs with the cruelty of a tyrant. Macduff afterward fled 
into England, and encouraged Malcolm, fon to the late 
king, to return to Scotland and recover the throne of his 
anceftors. — Macduff's cave penetrates into the rock about 
icq feet, and the roof, being the fummit of the rock, is 
fuppofed to be at leaft 160 feet high, forming a grarid al- 
cove, projecting over the cave and the fea at full tide. — 
The ftone of this rock is of excellent quality, fufceptible of 
line polifh, refembling granite, or perhaps a fpecies of it. Mr 
Gourlay, the late proprietor, had high offers made him, for 
liberty to quarry in it fome years ago, when the ftreets of 
London were paving •, but apprehenfive of the fall of fome 
parts of the rock, and the lofs of fome of the rich foil behind, 
which he fufpe&amp;ed might be the confequence, he declined 
the offers. Coal is found in this rock too, which cannot 
be worked, as the fea comes fo clofe upon it. There is a 
fpecies of ftone in this rock, which is fuppofed to be marble 
of the bafaltic kind ; a fpecimen of which is to be feen in 
Mrs Gourlay of Kinciaig's cuftody ; its colour is white, va- 
riegated with blue, and it is finely polifhed. There is a 
beautiful piece of water on the fouth of the village of 

Kilconquhar.

Kilconquhar, commonly called Kilconquhar Loch, almoit 
£ of a mile in length, and about ^ of a mile in breadth. 
This loch was originally called Redmire, from which much 
fuel was got, as peat and turf. It had a drain weftward to 
the fea. There is a tradition here, that in the year 1624 or 
1625, the drain was filled up with fand driven by a violent 
guft of wind from the fea, and that the water, thus flopped in 
its courfe, became a lake. Between 60 and 70 fwans ufed 
greatly to enliven and adorn this loch ; but they deferted 
it about 20 years ago. There are 9 at prefent. In the 
loch are feveral fmall iflands planted with fhrubs, formed 
for the ufe of the fwans : they hatch in the month of May*. 

Country Seats. — There is a variety of beautiful country 
feats in this parim, among which Balcarras is confpicous, 
fituated on an eminence, with a gentle declivity to the 

fouth,. 

* A fpecies of birds called bald coots, are alfo on the loch in great 
tiumbers, refembling crows, but have longer legs ; they make their nefts 
on the flags, and hatch in May; and feed upon vermin in the mud. 
They left the loch, it is reported, about 40 years ago, and did not return 
again for ten years. Here are wild ducks; herald ducks, as they are call- 
ed here, (perhaps heron ducks), fmaller than wild ducks, with a fhorter 
wing, red head, and gray variegated feathers ; a fpecies of duck called 
widgeon, fomewhat lefs than the herald duck ; and teals, fmaller than 
thcfe ducks. Thefe ducks appear on the loch in great abundance in 
fummer, but leave it in winter. In the evening, they fly oft' in a body 
to the fea, as is fuppofed, and return through the night. The only fifties 
in the loch are pikes and eels; of the former fome weigh 141b. fome 
16 lb. and are, fome 36, fome 58 inches long. There is 'a drain in the 
loch to the fouth, where the eels are taken in an ark ; they go to die fea 
in autumn. Perches have been feen in the loch, but they are deflroyed, 
it is thought, by the pikes. — The gray plover and fieldfare come hither 
in October, and leave us the beginning of March ; the green plover, as 
it were by concert, comes to us in March, and leaves us in October. 
The lark, blackbird, thrufh, with birds of almoft every note and every 
feather, haunt a pleafant wood of Sir John Anftruther's on the fouth of 
Kilconquhar loch, where there arc charming walks, adorned with flowers 
and fhrubs, and lovely bowels.

Advantages and Difadvantages, Is'c. — There is a conii- 
derable number of coal fields in this parifh, which have, in 
great meafure, fcrved the adjacent country for fome cen- 
turies paft, and afford coal of various kinds, as hard, fplent, 
parret, and foft, known here by the name of cherry •, and 
of a mixed nature, in many places ; all generally good of 
their kinds : The ftrata are fubje£t to many interruptions, 
as is the cafe with moft of the coal in the inland parts of 
Fife, being often broken off, or thrown into different di- 
rections, by hitches as they are called, which are of very 
different tbickneffes, compofed varioufly of heterogeneous 
materials ; the coal flrata themfelves alfo differing in thick- 
nefs, quality, ftricking, and declivity ; feldom found to go 
much deeper thin 30 fathoms from the furface ; whereas 
the coal ftrata, clofe by the fea, both here, and in many o- 
ther parts of our ifland, are faid to run for miles, almoft in 
the fame direction, and of the fame dimenfions. The 
coal fields in this parifh that have been worked are Bal- 
carres coal. — Kilbrackmont coal, the property of Mifs Scott 
of Scotftarvet. — South Falfield coal, the property of Mr 
Bethuneof Blebo. The above mentioned coals are not work- 
ed at ^vefent, but might afford more coal, were engines 
erected, or mines driven deeper than formerly to carry off 
the water. — Reres coal, the property of Mr Bayne of 
Reres, worked by a mine, employs 6 men, a grieve, and 
overfman. The price of a cart load, 75 ftone weight, is 
2 s. 6d. — Lathallan coal, the property of Major Lumfdaine 
of Lathallan, worked by a mine, affords both hard and foft 
coal, frequently of good quality ; employs at prefent 8 col- 
liers, 2 windlace-men, and a fuperintendent. The price of 
a cart load 75 ftone weight, is as. 2d. — Largo-Ward coal,

2 grieves, and one overfman. — North Falfield coal, the pro- 
perty of the above defigned Mr Durham, worked by a 
fleam engine, erected in 1784, which drains two diftinct 
coal fields, each confifting of 2 flrata, one of a mixed na- 
ture, about 5 feet thick, the other fine parret, in great re- 
queft for the clear light it affords, and other properties : of 
thefe ftrata the one is 9 feet thick for 60 yards, then gra- 
dually diminifhing for about 60 yards, till it comes to ■ 
5 feet thick, where fplent becomes perceptible, united to 
the parret on the pavement, the fplent increafing in an uni- 
form progreflive manner, and the parret diminifhing in the 
fame proportion, till its thicknefs becomes 4 feet, where 
the coal is cut off by a hitch of confiderable thicknefs, and 
leaves the parifh. The other flratum is excellent parret, in 
fome places 9 feet thick, but not uniform ; the coal is always 
beft where it is thickeft This colliery employs feldom lefs 
than 40, fometimes more than 50 men, with one as grieve

kinds are in great plenty on the coaft in all the feafons. Be. 
fides the great quantities fold here, many are fent to the 
Edinburgh market ; haddocks, for which our coaft is fa- 
mous, have deferted us for fome years paft. Whales and 
grampufes are fometimes feen here. The length of coaft 
•waftied by the fea, belonging to this pariih, is about 2 miles, 
all rock and fand. The farmers next the coaft have accefs 
to fea-ware, which is excellent manure for railing barley, 
and to fome kelp. The fcarcity of growing timber for 
farming utenftls, is a difadvantage to the farmers. 

Mariners. — The gentlemen who relide on their eftates, 
contribute not a little to the good order and happinefs of 
their tenants, and the other inhabitants of the pariih ; being 
affable, humane, and hofpitable to all around them, they fe- 
cure the affection, efteem, and attachment of their depen- 
dents, and by employing a variety of tradefmen and labour- 
ers in the field, a they are benefactors to many. They are. 
abundantly active, and public fpirited likewife with refpecl 
to the improvement of roads. The farmers are intelligent 
fenfible men in general, who, by means of their knowledge 
and induftry, live comfortably, and feveral of them genteelly* 
notwithstanding the high rents. The manufacturers and 
tradefmen are generally induftrious and regular. The peo- 
ple of this parifli are much improved in point of fobriety ■ 
they are feldom feen in clubs in public houfes, and inftauces 
of drunkennefs are very rare ; 30 or 40 years ago, public 
houfes were much frequented here by people of all ranks ; 
in thefe days they drank much brandy, and other fpiritous* 

liquors.

in the country: Perfect order, decorum, and loyalty, ate

and of their country, to obferve the inhabitants of this 
parifli in general, fenfible of the unparalleled happinefs we

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46224">MUCKART</name>, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stir- 
ling, Presbytery of Auchterarder.) 

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Gibson.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Soil, Climate, &amp;c. 

1i A Uckart, was anciently written Mucard, and is faid 
XVjL to be compounded of two Gaelic words, Muc and 
Ard, the firft fignifying " a wild boar," the laft " high," or a 
height. It is probable, that it derives its name in confe- 
rence of that part of the Ochil hills which is fituated in 
the parifh, having been formerly infefted by the wild boar, 
an animal which for this century paft has been unknown 
in Scotland. The parifli is of a triangular form. It is about 
5 miles in length, from E. to W. and between 2 and 3 in 
breadth, from N. to S. containing about 4500 acres of land, 
3000 of which are arable, and 1500 hill ground, fit only 
for pafture. The foil is moftly of a light and gravellifh na- 
ture, and a fmall part of clay. The weft part of the parifh, 
adjoining to Dollar, the loweft lying of which is upwards 



3°4 



Statiftical Account 



of 60 feet above the level of the fea, produces very good 
oats, barley, and peafe. The middle and eaft part, which 
is between 500 and 600 feet above the level of the fca, 
produces the fame kinds of grain, but of a much inferior 
quality. There have been of late feveral trials made of 
fowing wheat in the parifli, which have fucceeded indiffe- 
rently well in the weft part of it ; but in the eaft part, the 
ground is too high, light and filly for it. Almoft the 
whole foil, being fandy and dry, is well adopted for the cul- 
ture of potatoes and turnip, though hitherto few of the laft 
have been in ufe to be fown. They now begin to be fome- 
what more frequently raifed than formerly. The climate, 
in general, is fliarp and cold, owing to the highnefs of the 
fituation ; but it is more mild and temperate in the weft 
part of the parifli, where the ground lies low, than in the 
eaft part of it, where it is high. The difference is percep- 
tible at all feafons of the year, but efpecially in winter, in 
times of froft and fnow. — As the parifh lies along the foot 
of the Ochils, it is frequently covered with fogs and mifts, 
owing to its vicinity to thefe hills ; and to the fame caufe, 
it is perhaps more fubjecl to rains, than places at a greater 
diftance from the hills. The inhabitants, however, are re- 
markably healthy, and a confiderable proportion of them 
live to an advanced age. There is at prefent one woman, 
aged 88 ; and there were lately living in one houfe, at the 
fame time, a hufband, his wife, and his lifter, all above 84. 
No local diftempers are prevalent. Rheumatifm feems to 
be more common than any other. 

Hills, River, Wc. — Befides the Blairhill and Lawhill, 
there is a part of the ridge of the Ochils in the parifli. 
The one at the back of the kirk called Sea male, is about 
1350 feet above the level of the fea ; but it does not feem 
to be of fo great a height, owing to its arifing from an ele- 
vated,

vated bafe. Thefe hills are beautiful and green, and are ex- 
cellent pafture for fheep. The tops of them are moiily 
covered with bent, and fome of them with heath.. The 
river Dovan runs S. E. along the N. E. part of the parifh 
to the Crook, where it turns round a fmall point of land, 
changes its courfe from E. to W. and runs W. along the 
fouth fide of the parifh, interfe&amp;ing it near the weft end, in 
one place, and cutting off to the fouth fide one farm or 
plough of land. The Dovan abounds with burn trout of 
an excellent flavour, of a darkifh colour, with red fpots ; 
and there is alfo falmon that come from the Forth, as far 
up as the Cauldron lin, but they have not been able to get: 
above it. There is no town, and only one fmall village in 
the parifh. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers then were 535. — There are at prefent 140 families 
and 526 perfons in the parifh. — Of thefe there are

number of thefe have from L. 5 to L. 50 Sterling a-year ; 
a few have from L. 50 to L. 80 ; and only two are worth 
•above L. 100. Of thefe, the one was eftimated in the ren- 
tal before mentioned at L. 11 5, and the other at L. 120 a- 
year. The lands belonging to the non-rending heritors are 
farmed moftly by tenants, but the greateft part of the re- 
jidirtg heritors occupy their own lands, which they labour 
chiefly themfelves, with the affiftance of their children, a 
few of them having, befides what they poffefs themfelves, 
fome fmall pendicles let to tenants. The ground that is 
inclofed is commonly let yearly by public roup fome time 
in the month of April, for that feafon, in feparate inclo- 
fures, for the purpofe of grazing •, which generally brings 
a better rent to the proprietor than could be made by til- 
lage. A conliderable part of the lands in the parifli is in- 
clofed, but the greateft part is ftill open, and in a natural 
Jtate. Some of the proprietors are not fufRciently fenfible 
of the advantages of inclofing, and do not feem to afpire 

at

my thing farther than to trade in the footfleps of their 
predeceflbrs ; if they can attain this, their ambition carrie s 
them no higher. Befides, though they had a proper fenfe 
of the advantages of inclofing, the fmallnefs of the poffei- 
fions of many of them, and their being in the cuftom of 
maintaining families upon them, however fmall, renders 
it difficult for them to fpare money for this ufeful purpofe. 
To this may be added, that the whole lands in the parifh 
are thirled to Muckart mill, and liable to pay a heavy 
multure. All which may be confidered as hindrances to 
improvements in agriculture. The number of horfes, black 
cattle, and iheep, cannot be afcertained with precifion. As 
the incjofed farms are annually let for the purpofe of gra- 
zing, the numbers are conftantly varying ; but it is com- 
puted, that there are ufually about 140 horfes, 620 black 
cattle, and 320 fheep in the parifh. The reafon why there 
•are fo few fheep, is, that a gfeat part of the hill ground is 
inclofed with flone fences that are furlicient for black cattle, 
but not for fheep, and therefore black cattle are mollly 
paftured on the hills. 

Stipend, School, Poor, i$c— The archbifhop of St An- 
drew's was originally patron of the parifh, and titular of 
the tithes. The King is now patron. The ftipend is 
L. 44 : 8 : off Sterling, with a manfe and a glebe of about 
10 acres. A procefs of augmentation is now depending. 
Befides the Eftablifhed Church, there is an Antiburgher meet- 
ing-houfe. There is one eftablifhed idioolmafter, who has 
L. 100 Scots of falary, and about L. 16 Sterling of Intereft 
of money, mortified by different perfons for 'Jie behoof of 
the fchoolmafter. Befides this, he has a right to a fchool 
fchool-houfe, and garden, by another mortification, which 
the heritors are obliged to keep in repair, othenviie they 
forfeit the benefit of it. The whole, with the profits of 

the 



3°8 Statijlical Account 

the fchool and other emoluments, may be eftimated about 
L. 36 Sterling. The average of the fcholars is about 36.— 
As there are few opulent, fo there are not many poor in the 
parifli, who are under "the neceffity of living upon charity. 
They do not, at an average, exceed 6, and th© intereft of 
the funds mortified for the behoof of the poor, with the 
collections at the church door^ are fufficient to maintain 
them. Thefe added together, make about L. 18 Sterling 
a-year *. 

Natural Curiofities. — The Rumbling Bridge is built in a 
hollow over the river Dovan, between the parifhes of Muc- 
kart and Foflaway. It confifts of one arch of 22 feet in fpan 
and 1 2 in breadth. At this place there was originally a bridge 
of wood. The prefent ftone one was built about the year 
1 7 13, by one William Gray, a native of the parifli of Sa- 
line. It is over a narrow chafm that feems to have been 
worn through the rock *by the river, about 86 feet deep. 
To look over the bridge down to the river is awful. In 
fome places the waters are fcarcely vilible, when there is 
no flood in them, having a concealed conrfe below the 
rocks, through which they have worn a paflage. In o- 
thers, they are feen gufhing among the ftones with great ra- 
pidity. The rocks on the fides m many places project over 
one another. At both ends of the bridge, and at various 
parts on the face of the rocks, are trees and bui'hes, where 
daws and hawks have their nefts, and from which they 
are often flying forth. The whole furnilhes a moft ro- 
mantic? 



* Public houfes. — There are 3 public houfes, wliofe employment arifes 
chiefly from ftranger travellers, and from the driven of coals from Blairn- 
gone and Dollar to Strathern. As the greateft part of their bufinefs, 
flows from peTrfons of the above defcriptions flopping to refrefli thcmfelves 
and their horfes, and not from the inhabitants of the place, they have not 
:nuch influence upon the morals of the people^ 



of Muckart. 



man tic fcene. — A little higher up is the De'il's Mill, a 
name taken from the fimilarity there is between the place 
and a grinding mill. Here the river, after running by a 
quick defcent, between rocks in a narrow courfe for fome 
time comes into a kind of bafon formed in the rock ; out 
of which the water falls about 14 or 15 feet among the 
ftones, making a dreadful noife, refembling the noife of the 
happer and clap of a mill. There are fevtral conjec- 
tures about wflat is the caufe of the clap that is heard. 
Some think it is occafioned by the river's falling on a large 
ftone fufpended between the rocks, and ftriking againft 
them by means of the force of the waters ; others, that it 
is owing to the air's being carried down by the falling of 
the water into a vacuity below the rocks, and caufing a 
clap, by regularly burfting out as it is condenfed. — 
The Cauldron Linn, which is about a mile below the 
Rumbling Bridge, exhibits a uill more romantic fcene. 
At a diftance is heard the noife of the falls of wafer, and 
of the river running by a quick defcent among the ftones 
■with great rapidity, in a confined courfe, through which it 
has to force its paffage. The noife increafes as you come 
nearer to the place, which you do not fee till you are upon 
it. The firft thing that ftrikes the eye, are the high rocks 
on the fides of the river, through which it appears to have 
worn its way. Thefe rocks are fome of them perpendicu- 
lar, and others project over the river and almoft meet. 
They are on both fides nearly of an equal height, and on a 
level •, but as there are two cafcades, they are much higher 
from the furface cf the water below the fecond cafcade, 
and even above it, than they are from the furface of the 
water above the firft. At the fir ft cafcade, the river, after 
a ftiort fall, lights on rock hollowed in a curious wonderful 
manner, into deep cavities of different forms and fizes ; 
inoft of which are of a cylindric form, open on one fide, 

or 



3 IC ^ Statijlical Account 

or of a circular form like cauldrons. One of thefe is 
much larger than the reft, over a Inch the rock on the fouth 
iide of the river is a little projected. In this cavity or 
cauldron, the water feem. as if it were always boiling 
round, having a thick brown or yellow fcum on the top, 
owing to its great agitation, bearing a ftriking refemblance 
to the working of malt liquor in a large brewing veffel. 
From this the name of Cauldron Linn is taken. A little 
farther down is the fecond and great cafeade, where the ri- 
ver hath worn its way through the rock, and when there is 
no flood in the water, it runs below a beautiful arch of fo- 
lid rock but this arch mull in time be carried away by 
the violence of the current, or be undermined by the wear- 
ing of the water. The height of this fall to the furface of 
the water, where it drops, is about 44 feet ; and the height 
from the top of the fall to the top of the rocks is about 44 
feet ; fo that the whole height of the rocks from the top 
to the furface of the water below the fall, is about 88 feet. 
Below this cafeade the rocks widen confiderably, and in 
the clifts on the face of them, the daws and hawks build 
their nefts. Beneath the rocks there is a fteep brae on. 
both fides, covered with trees and bufties, through which 
there is a foot-path to the edge of the river, from which 
there is an excellent view of the great cafeade. 

Coal and Lime. — There are both coal and lime in diffe- 
rent parts of the parifh j but for fome time paft, neither of 
thefe hath been wrought to great extent. The whole coal 
in the parifh belongs to the Duke of Argyle, who, as fu- 
perior, has a privilege of working coal in any part of the 
feuars lands, upon his paying furface damages. This pri- 
vilege, and alfo the lime rock in the lands of Muckart- 
mill, belonging to his Grace, are let to a Company, who 
are only working the lime at prefent, for which they have 
much greater demands than they are able to anfwer. The 

inhabitants 



of Muckart, 311 

inhabitants are fupplied with coal from the coal pits in the 
peighbourhood at Blairngone and Dollar, 

Roads and Bridges. — Two roads run through the parifh ; 
the one from Kinrofs to Stirling ; the other from Queen's 
Ferry to Strathern, by Blairngone ; and there are, befides 
the Rumbling Bridge formerly mentioned, other three 
bridges over the Dovan, between the parilhes of Muckart 
and Foffaway -, one on the road near the old manfe of Fof. 
faway ; one on the road from Kinrofs to Stirling ; and one 
on the road from Queen's Ferry to Strathern, a little north 
from Blairngone. As this laft is a very public road, it is 
of great importance that it be made as eafy for travellers 
and carriages as pollible. Accordingly, an act of Parlia- 
ment hath lately been obtained for making it a turnpike 
road, that it may be put and kept in proprr repair, which, 
when done, mult be of great advantage to the public.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12071228">TON GLAND</name>, 

(County of Kirkcudbright, Synod of Galloway, 
. Presbytery of Kircudbright). 

By the Rev. Mr William Robb.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, and Climate. 

TN ancient writings, the name of this parifh is fpelled 
Tujigland, and in modern, Tongueland and Tongland. I 
know of no derivation from which it hath received this name. 
Probably it may have got the appellation from its external 
fhape, refembling a human tongue, as it lies bounded by the 
river Dee and the water of Taril; but this derivation is gi- 
ven as a probable conjecture only. It is from N. to S. be? 
tween 7 or 8 miles long, and in breadth from 3 to 4 miles 
from E. to W. In the fouth end of the parilh it is only 
about 2 miles, or \\ miles in breadth. The furface, in the 
fouth end of the parim, confifts of a long ridge of high 
ground, running from S. to N. with a gradual declivity to 
the river Dee on the E. and the water of TarfF on the W. 

Ir 



of Tongland. 



3*3 



In the north end it is rocky and moorifli, interfperfed with 
riling ground, fmall hills, mofs, and valley land, and fpots 
of natural meadow ground. In the weft fide of the parifh, 
and upon each fide of the water of Tarff, there is a conn- 
derable quantity of fine natural meadow ground, which 
yields large crops of hay, but in wet feafons is much dama- 
ged by floods. The foil of the pariih is good in general, 
and confifts of a confiderable variety. In the fouth tnd of 
the parifli it confifts of a fine red mould, upon a rocky and 
tilly bottom, but of a fertile nature, and agrees remarkably 
well with gentle rains in fummer. In the middle of the 
pariih, in iome places, it is a mixture of fand upon a peb- 
bly bottom, which agrees ill with dry feafons. In the 
north end it confifts of mofly foil, upon a ftony bottom, 
and is naturally barren, and more fuited for pafture than 
agriculture. There are, however, a number of arable fpots 
interfperfed, which yield luxuriant crops, when manured 
with lime. The moorifli foil, covered with heath and bent- 
ifh grafs, affords good pafture for flieep and black cattle. 
The fouth end, and middle of the pariih, in general, is of a 
fertile foil, and excellently fuited either for the purpofes of 
agriculture, or breeding and rearing of black cattle and 
fheep. In many parts of the north end, the foil is moorifli 
and unfruitful, being interfperfed with rocky ground. — 
The air is pure, dry, and very wholefome. There are no 
ftagnating lakes, and little low or marfhy ground. The 
rivers produce a conftant and free circulation of air. 
The inhabitants are healthful, and fubjedt to no local dif- 
eafes peculiar to the place. The inoculation of the fmall- 
pox has made rapid progrefsof late years, among all ranks, 
and is attended with its ufual fuccefs.

Prefent State of Agriculture and Improvement. — The im- 
provement and cultivation of land have made a rapid pro- 
grefs in this parifli of late years. The induftry of the huf- 
bandman, which lay long buried in a ftate of indolence, is 
now roufed from its profound lethargy, and awakened to 
the molt active exertions. Ancient prejudices are remo- 
ved, and the face of this parifh is aim oft totally changed of 
late, with refpecl to the mode of the management and culti- 
vation of the foil. The lands are now inclofed with Hone 
fences, and the fe veral farms fubdi vided by ftone fences, ditches, 
or hedges, fuited to the nature of the different foils. The 
farmers are now convinced of the great benefit of different 
kinds of manure ; and in proportion to their different abi- 
lities, are adtive in the improvement^ their farms. The 
indulgent fpirit of the proprietors in giving the farmers 
fuitable encouragement, would foon bring agriculture to a 
high degree of improvement. The farmers have lately al- 
moft altogether changed that wretched mode of manage- 
ment, in which their anceftors had obftinately perfevered 
for many centuries. This will appear in the cleareft man- 
ner, from a ftate of this parifli, and the mode of managing 
the land about 6c or 70 years ago, different from the pre- 
fent, as afterward will be pointed out. The firft openings of 
the great advantage of inclofing, fubdividing, and improving 
land here, took their rife from the example and active exer- 
tions of the late John Dalyell, Efq; of Barncrofh, and a 
proprietor of land in this parifh. He was the firft who dif- 
covered and made ufe of marl. By this manure, he raifed, 
upon the pooreft land, the moll luxuriant crops of different 
kinds of grain, to the aftonifhment of all the country a- 
round. He meliorated the foil, and raifed the fineft crops 
of natural and artificial graffes of different kinds. He gave 
the firft example of amending the breed of horfcs, black 
cattle, and fheep. The pafture being improved, he was 

enabled 



of ToTigland. 



3*5 



enabled to breed the bed cattle, and fatten them in the 
higheft degree for the butcher. His example and fuccefs, 
roufed the gentlemen and farmers to begin and purfue his 
mode, and raifed an uncommon fpirit of improvement in 
this place. The farmers having exhaufted the marl, im- 
prove the land now with lime from England, imported at 
the harbour of Tongland, at the rate of 1 s. and is. id. the 
Carlifle bufhel, which is equal to about 3 Winchefter bufhels. 
They make ufe of fea-fhells as a manure, which they im- 
port at the fame harbour, at the rate of is. 6d. and is. 8d. 
the ton. They ufe light ploughs of the Englifli form, and 
plough their land with 2 horfes, without a driver. They 
ufe 3 horfes, with a driver, in ploughing the ill furrow, 
and in {tiff and four land. They lay out their land by fow- 
ing rye-grafs and clover, which produce good crops of hay, 
and form a rich pafture for feeding their cattle. They are 
coming gradually into the cuftom of uling green crops. 
The greateft obftacle to the prefent fpirited exertion of the 
hufbandman, is the very high rent of land in its natural 
ftate, and the great expenfe of procuring manure. In the 
prefent feafon therefore of induftry, and fpirited exertion, 
nothing can be more hurtful and impolitic to the improve- 
ment of agriculture, than the proprietors of land railing it 
upon the tenants to a racked rent in its natural ftate. This 
damps the fpirit of induftrious tenants, throws them in- 
to a ftate of defpair, and deprives them of all the means of 
induftry and improvement. It is to be hoped, that the 
good fenfe, and benevolent fpirit of the gentlemen in this 
corner, will prevent them from falling into an error fo fatal 
to the fuccefs of agriculture, and to the general good of the 
country. The induftrious farmer, in the fcale of fociety, 
merits due encouragement from the proprietors of land in 
every well regulated ftate. It is to be hoped, that their

intereft in this refpecr. will never be loft view of by their 
fupeiiors. 

Produce of Land in Agriculture and Pajlurage, &amp;c. The 

land in this parifh is well fuited for both. The farmers 
raife excellent crops of oats, barley and bear, from the im- 
proved land. There is little wheat, peafe or rye fown, as 
they are not deemed fo fuitable for the foil. As the foil is 
thin, they find wheat is a great impoverifher. They plant 
great quantities of potatoes, in the drill form, which thrive, 
well, and make ample returns to them for their labour. 
Excellent crops of barley and bear are raifed from the po- 
tato ground the enfuing feafon. Good crops of rye-grafs 
and clover are raifed, when the improved land is laid out 
for pafture. There is no fixed rotation of crops obferved 
by the farmers, but every one varies his praftice, according 
to his particular tafte, and the nature of the foil. There 
are confiderable quantities of natural meadow ground in 
different places, particularly on each fide of the water of 
TarfF, and great quantities of meadow hay are produced 
from them every year. The hay on the Tarff is reckoned 
of an inferior quality, from being much fanded by fre- 
quent inundation . in rainy fummers. When it is cut, 
great quantities of it are carried down the water by iudden 
falls of rain. There is little flax produced, except what 
the farmers make ufe of for their families ; many parts, 
however, are well fuited for this article. The farmers 
breed a confiderable number of young cattle every year. 
The late improvement of the land has greatly improved 
their pafture grounds, which enables them to keep more 
cows, and to feed them better. Their young cattle thrive 
well in general, and numbers keep them out in the fields 
in winter before they are a-year old, and feed them with 
jlraw and hay. Their cattle are of the Galloway kind, 



of Tongland.

and are much coveted in England by the graziers, from 
their fhape, and being eafily fattened. They in general 
have no horns, and for that reafon are the more coveted 
by the cattle-dealers. Their beef is reckoned uncommon- 
ly tender, delicate and juicy, and is much prized in the 
Norfolk and London markets. They have paid great at- 
tention of late, in the choice of their cows and bulls, to 
have them of the moll approved make and fhape. There 
are fome of the Bakewell breed of cattle introduced here 
of late years. They breed excellent horfes for the draught, 
which are reckoned hardy in enduring labour, both in 
ploughing and carting. The north end of the parifh being 
moorifh, anfwers well for fheep-palture. The fheep are of 
the black faced kind, are hardy, and endure the winter- 
fforms. The farmers in the fouth end, and middle of the 
parifh, keep only a few fheep of the Bakewell and Cully 
fpecies for the ufe of their families, and a few of them for 
fale. The pafture being good, they thrive well. There 
are none of the Spanifh breed here ; but fome of them are 
introduced into the neighbourhood by Lord Daer, a young 
nobleman, who pays uncommon attention to every fpecies 
of improvement that can be ufeful to the country, both in 
agriculture, manufactures and roads. Some hogs are pro- 
duced, both for fale and for home confumption. There are 
nearly about 1200 black cattle, of which are about 220 
milk cows, and the remainder, cattle of different ages, from 
one to 4 years old. The yell cattle * vary in numbers ac- 
cording to the feafons of the year. In fummer they keep 
more, and in winter fewer. Their yell cattle are fed out 
of doors in the winter feafon with flraw and hay. The 
milk cows are houfed. There are in whole about 129 
horfes of different ages, and about 790 fheep of the differ- 
ent kinds, and between 80 and 90 hogs of different ages. 
There are 35 ploughs, and 58 carts employed for the pur-

pofes of agriculture, leading manure, bringing home fuel, 
and exporting the produce in grain and potatoes *. 

Rental, hc. — The valued rent in the cefs-books o f die 
county is L. 2815 : 6 : 8 Scots. Therealrent now paid is 
nearly about L. 2680, 7 s. Sterling, and is ftill rifing, upon 
the giving new leafes to the tenants. The land is let at 
various rates the acre, according to its richnefs and fertility, 
from 5s. to 10 s. 12s. 15s. and fome rich fpots at L. 1 the 
acre, without any allowance for manure. Some of the 
land is thought to be very dear, and other parts moderate, 
as is the general cafe in every parifh. It requires great in.- 
duftry and good management in the tenants to be able to 
pay the prefent rents in general. The farms for the moft 
part axe large, paying from L. 60 to L. 150 and L. 190 
Sterling of yearly rent; fome few at L. 15, L. 2c and L. 30 
Sterling. There was a ftagnation in the nr.M of land about 
the middle of the American war ; but fince its conclulion, 
land has rifen rapidly, both in its price and yearly value. 
The farms are large, and what was let about 40 or 50 years 
ago in rwirig, to 4, 5, and 8 tenants, is now let to one te- 
nant in cumulo\. 

Population. — 

* Seed-time and Har-vc/t. — This parifh confifb of dry and thin land, 
which produces an early feed-time and harveft. In dry fprings, the feed- 
time begins about the middle of March, and the fowing of corn is fmilhed 
by the middle of April. Parley and bear are fown about the latter end of 
April, and beginning of May. Potatoes are planted in the month of 
May. Bear and barley harveft begins about the middle of Auguft. Corn 
harveft begins, in general, the beginning of September, and is finiflied a- 
bout the end of that month. The harveft is a little later in fome moorilh 
places, in the north end of the parifli. 

f Price of Labour and Provisions. — The price of labour has increafed 
greatly of late. An able-bodied fervant man, fuited for the labour of a 
farmer, receives L. 9 and L. 10 Sterling a-year, with his victuals. Ser- 
vant 



of Tongland. 



Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation was then 537. By a careful furvey in 1792, 
the number of the inhabitants, old and young, amounts 
to j 20. It is generally believed that population has 
decreafed within thefe 40 or 50 years paft. Of the 
above number, there are 249 males and 271 females. 
The record of baptifms before the 1769 had received 
no kind of attention. The average of baptifms and 
marriages, hath been 13 baptifms, and 8 or 9 marriages 
yearly, fince the 1769. There has never been a record of 
burials kept. The letting of large farms to one tenant, 
which were formerly let to 4, 6, and 8 tenants, muft be an 
obvious caufe of depopulation, joined with the late eredtion 

of 

vant women receive L. 3 and L. 4 Sterling a-year, witli their victuals. 
The men receive L. 1, 5 s. and L. I, 10 s. Sterling, and fome more, for the 
labour of the harveft, with victuals. "Women receive L. 1 and L. 1, S s. 
Sterling, for the harveft, with victuals. . In fummer, common labourers, 
I s. and 1 s. 2 d. a-day, without victuals ; and S d. 9 d. and 10 d. with 
victuals; in winter, iod. without, and 7 d. with victuals. Good mow- 
ers of hay, 1 s. 6 d. and 1 s. 8 d. without, and 1 s. and 1 s. 1 d. with vic- 
tuals. Mafons and carpenters, 1 s. 8 d. and 1 s. 9 d. without, and 1 SL 
and I s.. 2 d. with victuals. Tailors, 8 d. and 9 d. a-day, with victuals. 
The farmers, of late years, find much difficulty in finding labourers at 
the above high wages, which bears hard upon them, and renders the la- 
bour of agriculture very expenfive. This is owing of late to the intro- 
duction of the cotton manufacture, which occupies great numbers, who 
formerly were engaged in the labour of agriculture. — The price of oat- 
meal is generally, in fruitful feafons, about 1 s. 6d. and 1 s. 9 d- the 
ftone, which is equal to 2 pecks of Linlithgow meafure. Potatoes are l s. 
and 1 s. 4 d. the peck. In the years of fcarcity, 1782 and 1783, the price 
of meal was high, but there was ftill plenty of it in this corner; owing, 
in a great meafure, to the early feafon of the harveft in this and fome of 
the neighbouring parifhes. The price of beef is generally 3 d. and 3-£d. 
the pound, Englifh weight ; and mutton and lamb, id. 2-^ it. and 3d. 
the pound, ditto weight ; pork, at 2 d. and 2A d. the pound, ditto weight. 
Frefh beef and mutton is generally high priced in the fpring. Butter is 
6 d. and 7 d. the pound, Englifh ; and cheefe, 2-j. d. and 3 d. the pound, 
ditto weight. Thefe prices may all of them be reckoned rcafonable, con . 
fidering the high rent of land, and the- high wages paid by the fhrmet 
for every article of labour, in the management of his farm.

of villages, and the introduaion of the cotton-manufaaure

are only arguments for a local, not a general depopulation

Rivers, and Salmon-Fi/hing. — The water of TarfF runs 
in a direaion from N. to S. through the weft fide of the 
parifh, and forms a junaion with the river Dee at the 
fartheft S. point of it. It takes its rife from a lake called 
Lochwhinnock, in the pariih of Girthon. It abounds with 
trout and pike, and in the fummer and harveft there are 
fea-trouts, called herlings, and grilfe and falmon, which 
run up into it from the fea. in floods it affords good fport 
for the angler. Its banks, in fome parts, are adorned with 
natural wood, and fine natural meadow-ground. There 
are two bridges upon it, one about the middle of the pa- 
rifh, where the military road from Carlifle to Port Patrick 
croffes it, and another farther S. near its extremity, where 
it joins with the river Dee, and where there is a harbour 
for fhipping. Here there is a great quantity of lime and 
fea-lhells imported every year for manure, during the fum- 
mer feafon. The river Dee runs on the eaftern and fouth- 
ern fides of the pariih. It is a large and rapid river. Op- 
pofite to this parifh its bottom is rocky, and its banks are 
fteep and rugged, and adorned with natural wood of vari- 
ous kinds : This gives it a bold and romantic appearance. 
It abounds with falmon in the filhing feafon, which begins 
generally in the month of February, and ends the 26th of 
AugufL But few of them get above the works, termed 
Doachs, ereaed acrofs the river, nearly oppofite to the corn- 
mills and church of Tongland, excepting in very high 
floods. Above and below the church and manfe, the bot-

i 0 m of the river is rocky. This, in large floods, forms 
the moft beautiful cafcades of broken water. There is a 
bridge of two arches built acrofs the river, a little fouth of 
the church and manfe, where the river is narrow, upon a 
rocky foundation. The falls of the river to a perfon (land- 
ing upon this bridge in a large flood produce a grand and 
awful fenfation. Here we behold a train of the moft 
beautiful cafcades of broken water, tearing and roarings 
over the rugged rocks, with the moft tremenduous noife. 
About 20 yards below the bridge, • there is one of the 
grandeft falls of water to be feen in the fouth of Scotland. 
Indeed, travellers who have feen it in a great flood, have 
averred, that it is equal, if not fuperior, to marty of the 
remarkable falls of water in the Highlands. Here the 
river runs over a ridge of rock acrofs the bottom, and 
falls into a deep lin. It is fo remarkable an objedt, in na- 
ture, that it has called forth the attention of the Scottifti 
Mufe, in the ancient poem of the Cherry and the Slae, com- 
pofed by Captain Montgomery, who lived in the neigh- 
bourhood, at Cranfton caftle, and naturally defcribes this 
fall in the 6th ftanza of that poem, as follows : 
" To pen the pleafures of that Park, 
How every bloflbm branch and bark 

Againft the fun did Ihyne, 
I pafs to Poetis to compyle 
In high heroic ftatlie ftyle 

Quuhais Mufe furmathes myne , 
But as I lukit myne alane,' 

I faw a river rin, 
Out'wore a fteepie rock of ftane 

Syne lichtit in a lin, 
With tumbling, and rumbling 

Amang the rockis round, 
Devalling and falling, 
Into a pit profound."

The above is a juft and natural defcription of this trc 
menduous fall of water, and perfe&amp;ly agreeable to the ap- 
pearance in nature. The found and the fenfe are admi* 
rably imitated by the poet. Perhaps our favourite and 
defcripdve poet, Mr Thomfon, could not have exceeded it,, 
had he feen the object with his own eyes. — At a confider- 
able dillance above the bridge, the doachs or cruives for 
taking the falmon, are erected acrofs the river. In gentle 
rifes of the water, the falmon run into the cruives, and are 
taken out fometimes alive, and fometimes dead, according 
to the length of time they have been in the cruives. Be- 
low the bridge there is a place called the Sand-bed, into 
which the tide flows at high water ; here they take great 
numbers by a boat and a very long draught-net, when the 
tide flows. A little above this, there is a deep and large 
bafon of water, called the Lin-pool, into which the falt- 
water flows in ipring-tides. Here they take the falmon by 
a boat with drag-nets; but, in general, by far the greateft 
number of falmon, grilfe and fea trouts, are caught in the 
night time, by what they term the fiihing with the Ihould- 
er-nets. This mode of fiihing is both curious and ingeni- 
ous, and merits a minute defcription. There is a fmall net 
fixed to a femicircular bow of iron, and this is fixed to a' 
pole of about 18 feet in length. The fifhermau ties a 
fmall piece of bended wood, with a groove in it, upon his 
left fhoulder, for the pole of the net to Aide upon. Thus 
equipped, he takes his ftation in the night, upon a rock at 
the lide of a pool, where he knows the falmon lie, and 
throws his net ftraight before him into the water, into 
which it links, and draws it ftraight to him on the bottom, 
Aiding the pole upon the groove of wood upon his left flioul- 
der, and when he has it near him, he gives the net a quick 
turn over by the pole, and brings out the filh ; and there

.j another man (landing clofe by with a club, ready to take 
hold of the fifh and kill them, and take them out to a lafe 
place. In certain places of the river, great numbers of 
nlh are taken in the night time by this mode of hilling. 
For this purpofe there are two moulder- net men, and one 
man to kill, generally employed through the falling lea- 
fon. The principal markets for the falmon are Manche- 
ster, Liverpool, and Whitehaven. £any in the fealon 
fome few are fent to London by land-tan iage. The 
price in the fpring is 6d. the lb. Englilh weight ; but when 
the feafon is farther advanced, it is fold for 4 d. and 3d. 
the lb. The falmon taken at Tongland are much .admired 
for their richnefs, and delicate tafte ; but thofe caught far- 
ther down the river, in the fifhing yairs at Kirkcudbright, 
^re ftill more admired by connoifleurs for the richnefs and 
delicacy of their curd. The filhing at Tongland, which 
does not reach to - mile upon the fide of the river, is 
let in. tack, with a fmall piece of ground annexed to it, 
at the yearly rent of L. 305 Sterling, befides paying the 
public burdens. The land is valued at L. 42 Sterling a- 
year, and the filhing is L. 263 Sterling. About 68 years 
ago it was let, with the fame piece of ground, at L. 8 Ster- 
ling, and the tenant could not pay that rent, but gave it up*.

dirt, if he prefumed to fet his foot within the verge of it. 
They hear L hat the King and the Royal Family g 0 con- 
itantly to church on the Sabbath day, and hate Tom 
Paine for abufing fo good a Prince. Numbers of them are 
terrified that the French-Revolution Government mould 
be introduced among them, for every one ehoofes to keep 
what he has lawfully got, and not make an equal divifion 
of it among his neighbours. They are induftrious and 
careful about their fecular affairs, in their different lines of 
life, and do not interfere with matters of State ; decent in 
their drefs, and good oeconomiits in their mode of living. 
None of them have been hanged or banimed in modern 
times. In general they are fober and temperate, notwith- 
ftanding that whiiky is both cheap and plenty of late 
years, there being only a few who are votaries of that per- 
nicious beverage. They have made great progrefs in ci- 
vilization and good manners, and have made remarkable 
improvement of late in their houfes, drefs, and manner of 
living, as will appear evident from the following authen- 
tic fketch of the Statistical ftate of this parifh about 60 or 
70 years ago. 

At the above period, there was not a hat to be feen in 
tbe whole congregation upon a Sunday. They wore 
Kilmarnock bonnets or caps of different colours. In 
church they kept on their bonnets and caps during the 
leclure and fermon, and took them off only during the 
prayer, the hnging of pfalms, and the pronouncing the 
blefhng. Few or none of the common people could read, 
and the precentor read the fcriptures to them in church be- 
fore the minifler made his appearance. They had no 
buckles in fcheir. fhoes. but tied them with fmall leather 
thongs; had no metal buttons on their clothes, but large 
dumfy buttons of wood moulds, covered over with the

fame cloth as the coat. The men wore kelt coats, made 
of a mixture of black and white wool, as it came off the 
fheep, in its natural ftate. Neither men nor women, in 
general, wore any Hurts, and when they did, they were 
made of coarfe woollen ; in general, they changed their 
plaiding fliirts twice in the year, at Whitfunday and Mar- 
tinmas. It was long before linen Ihirts came into ufe a- 
mong the vulgar. They wore no fhoes in fummer, nor 
winter, but in the time of fevere frolt and fnow. Their 
children got no fhoes till they were able to go to the kirk. 
The women wore coarfe plaiding or drugget gowns, made 
of the coarfeft wool, and fpun in the coarfeft manner. The 
tenants wives wore toys of linen of the coarfeft kind, upon 
their heads, when they, went to church, fairs or market. 
At home, in their own houfes, they wore toys of coarfe 
plaiding. The young girls, linen mutches, with a few 
plaits in them above their foreheads, when they went a- 
broad to the church, or to fairs, or market. At home 
they went bareheaded, with their hair fnooded back on 
the crown of their head, with a woollen firing in the form 
of a garter. Their houfes were the moll miferable hovels, 
built of ftone and turf, without mortar, and Hopped with 
fog or flraw, to keep the wind from blowing in upon them. 
They had a window on each fide of the houfe, which they 
opened or fhut as the wind blew, to give them light. 
Thefe windows they flopped with flraw or fern. In fuch 
houfes, when they kindled a fire, they lived in a conftant 
cloud of fmoke, enough to fuffocate them, had they not 
been habituated to it from their infancy. They had manv 
of them no ftanding beds, but flept on heath and flraw, 
covered with the coarfeft blankets, upon the floor. They 
kept their cattle in the fame houfe with themfelves, tied 
to flakes in one end of the houfe. There was no divifion 
to fcparate the cattle from themfelves. Their furniture 

confifted

:onfifted of flools, pots, wooden cogs and bikkers. A* 
their meals, they ate and flipped altogether out of one 
difli. They lived in a coarfe and dirty manner, and ate of 
the meaneft and coarfeft food. In general, their food 
confirled of brofe, pottage, oat-meal flummery, and 
greens boiled in water with a Uttle fait. The 
difhes out of which they fed were feldom wafhed af- 
ter meals, and of courfe, were often thick, with dirt. Each 
perfon in the family had afhort hatted fpoon made of horn, 
which they called a munn, wiih which they fupped, and 
carried it in their pocket, or hung it by their fide. They 
had no knives and forks, but lifted the butcher meat they 
ate with their fingers. They ate little meat at that time 
excepting the off-falls of their flocks, which died ei- 
ther by poverty or difeafe. At Martinmas they killed an 
old ewe or two, as their winter provifion, and ufed the 
fheep that died of the braxy in the latter end of autumn. 
At this time their farms had no march fences to feparate 
them from their neighbours. A fingle farm was let in 
runrig among a number of tenants, which caufed them to 
live in a conftant ftate of warfare and animofity. The 
dividing the produce of the farm, according to each tenant's 
fhare, became a ufual fource of quarrels and fighting. 

Their mode of agriculture was uncommonly flupid in 
«very fiage of the operation. They yoked 6 oxen and 
2 horfes in one plough, and fometimes 8 oxen and 2 horfes. 
They yoked 4 horfes a-breadth in a plough without oxen, 
and had always one to hold the plough, and another to 
drive the cattle. They ufed a heavy clumfy Scots plough, 
that murdered the weak and half ftarved animals to drag it 
after them. Their harrows were heavy and clumfy, with 
the teeth made of wood inflead of iron. In the fpring fea- 
fon their horfes and oxen fell down in the draught through 
perfed poverty and weaknefs. They ploughed great quan- 
tities of the land, and had poor returns for their labour.

They took 4 or 5 crops, without putting on any manure. 
In dry feafons, they could fcarely gather their corn in har- 
veft, upon account of its ftiortnefs. They fowed nothing 
but poor grey Scots oats ; their poor land would bear no o- 
ther fpecies of grain. This kind of oats yielded little meal, 
and of a dark colour. When their corn came above the 
ground in the fpring, they had conftant herding of their 
cattle day and night, till the harveft was finimed, and the 
corn gathered into their corn yards. They built turf folds 
in fummer in the fields, into which they put their cattle in 
the middle of the day, when annoyed with the heat ; and 
alfo at night, to preferve them from deftroying their grain. 
In the night they put all their cattle into thefe turf folds, 
and one or two perfons watched them every night in fum- 
mer and harveft, till their corns were got in. By over- 
ftocking their farms, the poor animals were ftarved for 
wantofgrafs. In the fpring, their cattle were fo weak, 
that when they lay down, they could not rife of themfelves 
till they lifted them up. They fell into moffes and quag- 
mires through weaknefs, and were drowned. Ia the fpring 
feafon, it was a conftant cuftom to gather their neighbours 
together, to affift in lifting their cows and horfes, and to 
drag them out of mofs holes. At that time, and for long 
after, there was not a cart in the parifh. They led home 
their corn and hay in cars, and in trades on the backs of 
their horfes, and their peats in creels and facks. They led 
out their dung on cars, or creels coupled and hung over 
the horfes backs. The women carried out dung in creels 
on their backs, and the men filled the creels at the dunghill, 
and lifted it upon their moulders. This refembled the fa- 
vage ftate of fociety, where all the drudgery of the domeftic.- 
labour fell to the department of the female fex. At that time 
there were no faddles nor bridles, and they rode to church 
and market upon brechams aad pillions placed on the 

horfes.

horfes, and halters on the horfes heads made of hair. They 
fhod their horfes fore feet, but put no fhoes upon their hind 
feet The women had no little wheels, but fpan with the 
rock and fpindle. Their yarn was uncommonly coarfe. 
They had no candles to give them light in the winter 
nights. When the goodman* of the houfe made family 
worfhip, they lighted a ruffy, to enable him to read the 
pfaim, and the portion of fcripture, before he prayed. The 
men had no razors, but clipped their beards every Satur- 
day night with fciffars, to appear more decent upon the 
Sunday. The lower clafs in general were tainted ftrongly 
with fuperftitious fentiments and opinions, which had been 
transmitted down from one generation to another by tradi- 
tion. They firmly believed in ghofls, hobgoblins, fairies, 
elves, witches and wizards. Thefe ghofts and fpirits often 
appeared to them at night. They ufed many charms and 
incantations to prelerve themfelves, their cattle and houfes, 
from the malevolence of witches, wizards, and evil fpirits, 
and believed in the beneficial effects of thefe charms. They 
believed in lucky and unlucky days and feafons, in marry ^ 
ing, or undertaking any important buiinefs. They fre- 
quently faw the Devil, who made wicked attacks upon 
them when they were engaged in their religious exercifcs, 
and afts of devotion. They believed in benevolent fpirits; 
which they termed brownies, who went about in the night 
time, and performed for them fome parts of their domeflic 
labour, fuch as threihing and winnowing their corn, Spin- 
ning and churning. They fixed branches of mountain afh, 
or narrow leaved fervice-tree above the ftakes of their 
cattle, to preferve them from the evil efFefts of elves and 
witches. All thefe fuperftitious opinions and obfervations, 
which they firmly believed, and powerfully influenced their 

actions/

actions, are of late years almoft obliterated among the pre- 
fent generation. Both men and women about 60 years a- 
go, were robuft and healthy, and lubjecT; to few difeafes. 
They were ftrangers to every complaint of a nervous na- 
ture. This arofe from the hardy manner in which they 
were brought up from their infancy, and being accuftomed 
to watch their cattle without doors in the night during the 
whole fummer and harveft feafon. From the above au- 
thentic Statiftical Account of this parilh about 60 or 70 
years ago, compared with its prefent ft ate of improvement, 
in agriculture, the manners, drefs, and mode of living a- 
mong its inhabitants, and their prefent fentiments in reli- 
gion, the great improvement they have made in agricul- 
ture and civilization will appear in the molt ftrikiug point 
view; and as they are flill in a gradual train of improve- 
ment at prefent, it gives the moft nattering profpt&amp;s of 
their future progrefs in the courfe of time. The greateft 
danger to their prefent progrefs is the rai fii g the land to a 
tacked rent, which induftrious tenants may be unable to 
pay. 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c— The church and 
manfe are placed near the fouth extremity of the parifli. 
This renders the church inconvenient, with refpedt to its 
fituation, both to the miirifter and people. The htuation 
of the church and manfe on the fide of the river Dee is re- 
markably pleafant. The church is old, but in tolerable 
good repair. Some of its north wall is a part of the priory, 
now in ruins. The manfe is old, and in bad repair, being

The fchool wages are, in general, for reading, i s. 6 d. ; 
writing, 2 s. ; arithmetic, i s. 6 d. ; and Latin, 3 s. the quar- 
ter, and 10 s. 6 d. for a courfe of book-keeping. There

at the church, at the time of the facrament, and what is re- 
ceived for the ufe of the mortcloth, which, at an average, 
may amount to about nearly L. 10 Sterling yearly. This 
is divided among them quarterly, in proportion to their 
different degrees of neceffity. They are allowed to beg 
through the parifh, but none of them without its bounda- 
ries. We have no mortified funds for the fupport of the 
poor., There is a fmall mm lent out at interelt, which was 
faved in favourable times, which makes an additional 
help. Should the number of the poor increafe, there will 
be an indifpenfable neceflity of applying to the heritors, in 
terms of law, for their maintenance. This parilh is pefter- 
ed with Irifli vagrants and (turdy beggars, through all the 
feafons of the year. The charity given thefe is extremely 
detrimental to the native poor of the parilh. The clamour- 
ous vagrants impofe upon the humane and charitable fpiritof 
the people, by their fictitious and tragical tales of mifery ;

Antiquities. — Contiguous to the church are the ruins of 
the priory of Tongland. It was founded in the latter end 
of the 1 2th century, by Fergus Lord of Galloway. The 
monks were of the Praemonftratentian order, formed by St 
Norbert in 1120 in France, and received their name from 
Praemontre in Champaigne, the name of their lit abbey. 
Fergus brought them from Cockeriand in JLanca(hire to 
this priory. Alexander, abbot of Tongland, twears fealty 
to Edward I. in the 1296. James Herries, prior of 
Tongland, in the 1430, repaired the monaltery of Tong- 
land, which was greatly decayed, and inclofed the precincts 
with a high wall. He was a Doctor of the Sorbonne, and 
much famed for his learning, and wrote upon the validity 
of indulgences*.

* Bifliop Lefly tells a ftqry of an abbot of this place, w! o„ in the 1507, 
undertook to fly through the air to France, from tiiecaftle of Stirling, 
and to be there before the King's Ambaffadors, who were juft fetting off. 
He took his flight from the walls of the caftle, but foon met with the re- 
ward of fuch a foolifh attempt, by falling, and breaking Uis thigh bones. 
.Lord Maxwell was heritable bailie of this abbey, and had the L,. 5 land of 
Cargane, of old extent, in the parifli of Troquier, near Dumfries), given 
him as his bailie fee. William Melvill was commendator if this .abbacy 
in 1598. Afterwards this abbacy was annexed to the bi i.oprick of Gal- 
loway, upon the bifliop of that fee complaining of the fmallnefs of its re- 
venue. The ruins (how that it had been an abbey of conliderable extent.

Advantages and Difadvantages. — By the 2 harbours ia 
the foutii end of the pariih, upon the river Dee and Tarff, 
the inhabitants have a great advantage for exporting their 
grain and meal, and of importing manure in lime and fea- 
fliells. They in. general have an early feed time and har- 
vefl, from the drynefs of the foil. They have fine places 
for e reeling water-machinery. There is a paper mill and 
corn mill, near the church, on the river Dee, that have 
plenty of water in the greatett droughts ; many fine filia- 
tions for creeling cotton -mills. Their greateft difadvan- 
tage is fcarcity of fuel. The peat moffes are all exhaufted ; 
and the neareft mofs is 6 miles diftant, and is almoft ex- 
haufled. Coals from England and the weft of Scotland, 
from the heavy duty, are very dear, and quite beyond the 
reach of the common people. The coals this winter have 
been L. 1, 12s. the ton ; and they are feldom below L. i, 
8 s. Sterling. Unlefs the duty is taken off' the coals by Go- 
vernment, both manufactures and agriculture will in the 
iffue go to ruin. The principal fuel in the fouthern parts 
of this county is coal ; and this article is become fo high of 
late, that it rifes to an enormous expenfe, and is quite be- 
yond the reach of th. j poor It is the united wifh of all 
ranks, to have the duty taken off, and laid upon fome other 
article. Could Miniftry know the real diftrefs for fuel, 
which many poor and fhivering wretches fuffer in this 
Corner, their humanity would inftantly excite them to re- 
move

Dundrenan, where me lodged, and from thence crofied the Solway*Frith

ments; but of what kind i= uncertain. In the moor of Kirkconnel, is a

part of the country. 

Mifcellaneous Observations. — In the lands of Kirkconnel 
there is a fine natural wood, in a very thriving condition. 
Some of the refiding heritors have planted a great number 
of trees of different kinds of late years. On the top of a 
hill called Knockmuir, a little to the north of the kirk, 
there is a moll beautiful landfcape, and molt eitenfive pro- 
fpecl:. It is efteemed the moft beautilul in the fouth of 
Scotland. In a clear and ferene day, many perfons of tafte, 
and lovers of nature, flock to this fpot, to delight them- 
felves with the varied beauties of the fcene. Little fnow 
lies here, but quickly melts, from the natural warmth of 
the foil. — We have all the natural wild animals that are com- 
mon to this corner of the country. All the migratory birds 
appear here very early in their feafons, and fome of them 
continue longer than in fome other parts of the county. — 
There have been no remarkable inftances of longevity of 
late years; but there are a number of perfons who are a- 
bove 80 or 90 years of age. Very few perfons have emi- 
grated to America. There are no villages. The cotton 
manufacture is not as yet introduced here. The crofs- 
fpads in the parifh are in pretty good repair.

NUMBER. XXII. 

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011963">St MONANCE</name>, 

(County and Synod of Fife, Presbytery of St 

Andrew's.) 

By the Rev. Mr Archibald Gillies.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, Wr. 

jP Efore the year 1646, the name of the parifli was 
Abercrombie *. With regard to the name St Monance, 
it has undergone very little variation. In the oldeft writs 

I 

* From which period it has improperly acquired that of St Monance ; 
the reafon for which, follows : The lands of Newark (which at prefent 
give a title to a Lord of that name) were formerly a part of the parifli of 
•Kilconquhar ; the tithes of which are it £11 paid to the incumbent of 
that charge. But in the year 1646, when the lands of Newark and Aber- 
crombie belonged to two near relations of the name of Sandilands, the 
one bearing the title of Lord Abercrombie, now extinct, and the other 
Sir James Sandilands of Newark ; they, for their conveniency, ire . having 
previoufly agreed with Mr Robert Wilkie, then minifter of Abercrombie, 
and a parifli by itfelf, applied to the prelbytery of St Andrew's, to have 
the lands of Newark disjoined from Kilconquhar, without prejudice to 
the incumbent, and annexed to Abercrombie : Parties being agreed, the 

preibytery 



of St Monance.-

I have feen, being fometimes called St Menin, fometimes 
St JVIonan, and in modern times, and at prefent, St Monance. 
— As to the derivation, amidfr. the many reports, what to 
me feems moft probable, is, That it originated from the 
hermit who ferved at the chapel, and which gave name to 
the town. And as it became the place of public worlhip 
for the parifh, and the town the moll populous part of it, 
through time the parifh came to be called St Monance a- 
lone. For before the period of annexation, the "illage of 
Abercrombie was pretty populous, but fince has very much 
diminifhed. At prefent, it coniifb only of one farm-houfe 
and offices, the houfes of two other fmall tenants, and a few 
cottages. The manfe and glebe are ftill in it. The parifh 
is of fmall extent, and forms nearly a parallelogram, ex*- 
tending from the S. £. where it is warned by the frith of 
Forth* to the N. W. The breadth from W. to E. is about 
a fhort Englifh mile, and from S. to N. mile. The 
land rifes fuddenly from the lea, but of no extraordinary 
height ; after which it is flat, with a very gentle and eafy 
afcent upwards to Abercrombie, about a mile, and then de- 
clines in the fame manner towards the N. the furface af- 
fording a very beautiful appearance. The foil in general 
is a light loam, and friable, very little clay, all quite free 
of ftones, and very fertile and manageable. The whole is 
arable, excepting a trifle in a natural ftate, and which is ca- 
pable of cultivation, The fea coalt is flat and rocky. The 
rocks confift of free and lime ftone, and a great quantity of 

ironftone 

prelbytery granted their requeft quoad facra. But whether any applica- 
tion was afterward made to the Lords of plantation, and the fame con- 
firmed by them or not. does not appear. After which the name of the 
parifh in the records of prelbytery, flood thus : The parifh of Abercrombie- 
with St Monance.'— At that period, the church (or chapel, as then called) 
of Abercrombie was fuffcred to go into ruin, and an old Gothic chapel at 

St Monance (of which, more afterward) became the place of public wor-t 
fliip.

ironftone lying fcattered upon the furface. It yields a gooc 
deal of fea-weed for kelp, which is ufually cut every third 
year, and alter gales of wind from the N. E. E. and S. E. 
a good quantity for manure. 

Climate, Wf. — The climate is mild and temperate, the 
air dry and falubi ious. But when it blows from the E. and 
S E. it is (harp and cold, moift, and full of fait par- 
ticles ; for the land is much expoied to the fea on thefe 
quarrers, and not covered with trees ; which if it were, the 
air would not only be more mild, the furface greatly beau- 
tified, but the ground more early in its productions, which 
are much checked in the fpring by the winds from thefe 
points, and which commonly blow for a long time at that 
feafon. Yet upon the whole, the inhabitants in general are 
Very healthy. There have been no inflances of unufual 
longevity during the incumbency of the prefent minifter. 
But there are many now living of 70, 76, and 80 years, and 
fome oied a few ytars ago, at the age of 90 and 91. The 
fmall-pox ufed to make great ravages among the children, 
efpecially in the town of St Monance. If the contagion 
got in during the heat of fuii'mer, when the air is much 
tainted with the refute of the riming, it was then peculiarly 
fatal, fweeping off from 2c to 30 children at a time. But 
its deftrudtive progrefs has for feveral years pad been in fome 
degree mitigated, by that happy invention, inoculation ; and 
to which the people in general are now becoming more and 
more reconciled. 

Rivers There are no rivers, but one fmall brook, which 

bounds the parifh on the W. runs S. interfering part of ihe 
lands of Newark, and empties itfelf, between the church 
and town of St Monance, into the frith of Forth. There 
is another in the lands of Abercrombie, which bounds the 

parifh 



of St^Manance. 



337 



jarifh on the eaft fide, runs S. E. between it and the lands 
bf Balcafkie, and difembogues itfelf between the two An- 
ftruthers. Both are in a manner dry one half of the year. 
Such is the cafe with all the rivulets in this part of the 
county, and which is a great lofs to it, where there are fo 
many fea-port towns; there being no river, or running 
water of any conference, eafl fide of the river of Leven. 

Mines. — There is abundance of coal in th'e lands of 
Newark, confifting of fplint, cherry, and culm, at piefent 
working. It is hot level free, but wrought by a fire-engine. 
Likewife one of the neateft and beit contrived falt-works 
upon the coaft, called St Philip's ; both are the property of 
Sir John Anftruther, BarOnet. The coal and fait, befides 
what is fold to the country, are exported at Pittenweem. 
In the lands of Abercrombie there are ,feveral feams of 
coal, but as yet untouched, and which belong to Sir Robert 
Anftruther, Baronet. Coal abounds in this country, both in 
the coatt and interior parts, and that nectffary article for 
the comfort of lire might be obtained at an eafy rate. But 
fince of late, coal working has become a trade, by opening 
only a few at a time, and thus monopolizing them, the 
price is kept up ; and there is no other fuel ufed, or to be 
had in this place. This winter the inhabitants have been 
greatly diftreffed for want of this article, by the difficulty 
of obtaining it, and the high price. 

Fijliery, &amp;c. — Formerly there was a very plentiful fifh- 
ing upon the coaft here, confifting of cod, ling, haddock, 
rowan or turbot, fkait, &amp;c. and St Monance ufed to be one 
of the principal fifh- towns Upon the coaft. But within theft 
4 or 5 years paft, the fifh have in a manner quite defei ted 
thefe places, (particularly the haddock) and none are now 
caught but a few cod, rowan, and fkait. Before, iilh of all

kinds were in great abundance, and at an eafy rate, but now 
are very fcarce, and high priced ; not one haddock being 
taken in a whole year. There has been no fufficient caufe 
as yet afiigned for this remarkable change. The flioals of 
herrings which ufed with great certainty to frequent the 
coaft, particularly in the autumnal feafon, and likewifc in 
the fpring, are now become v*ry precarious, and of no con- 
fequence. This great decreafe of the fiftiing is a vail lofe 
to this part of the country. For as fifti was a principal part 
of the fupport of the inhabitants, other provifions have 
greatly advanced in price ; and as great quantities of her- 
rings, over and above the home confumpt, were cured and 
exported, trade has fuffered much. Befides, the fifhers are 
threatening an emigration to other places ; though as yet 
only one man and family have left the parifh this fpring, 

and gone to the town of Ayr, on the weft coaft *. 

Migratory^ 

* The common market Tor the fifh is Edinburgh. They are bought up- 
Sy the fifhers of 'Fifherrow. who attend with their boats, purchafe at fea, 
and carry them off Formerly the practice was, that out of the fleet of 
boats belonging to the town, two were obliged in their turn to come in- 
to the harbour, and offer market for two hours, for the fupply of the in- 
habitants But that good regulation being now overlooked, the fifhers 
have wholly laid it afide Tins' has enhanced the price of fifli here, that 
it is but little below the market at Edinburgh, and they are difficult to 
be obtained. The lobfters are commonly taken in contract from the- 
fifhers by a Company, and carried alive in fmacks to the London market, 
and other places in England. The boats ufed in the fifhing confift of a 
larger and fmaller kind ; of the former there are about 14, and of the 
latter ahout 20. The final 1 are ufed both in fumrrier and winter, in what 
they term the white fifhing. Each of thefe require four men for the oars, 
and one fteerfman. With them, they fifh with great and finall ling, for 
cod, rowan, haddock, &amp;c. and with nets for fkate. The larger are ufed 
only in the herring fifhing ; and their complements of men are fome fix, 
ibme eight, according 10 their fize, with a itecrfman. But befides thefe, 
there are a numb&amp;r of yawls, with which, through fummer, they fifh with 



of St Monance. 



339 



Migratory Birds, &amp;c. — There are the (wallow and mar- 
gin, the plover both green r.nd gray, the cuckoo, and but 
few woodcock. Through the whole of the year, the fea 
gulls, (called by the vulgar fea maws,) frequently come 
upon land ; but when they do fo, it afluredly prognosticates 
high winds, with falls of rain from the E and S. E. and as 
foon as the ltorm abates, they return again to the frith, their 
natural element. I faw fome time ago, a golden crefted 
wren, and the only one that hath appeared to me in this 
country. Its fize was much about that of the common 
wren, and nearly the fame in the colour of the body. The 
crown of the head was ornamented with a circle of feathers 
of a fiery orange, or golden colour, with a beautiful bright 
fpot of yellow in the centre. Hares and partridges abound ; 
a few quails, and fome foxes and rabbits in the light 
.grounds. / 

Town of Si Alonance, i#c. — The town is fituated upon a 
fpot of a triangular form ; one fide of which verges upon, 
and is waftied by the frith of Forth, the other two iides are 
covered by the riling grounds. And as it enjoys a S. and 
S. E. expofure, it is defended againil the cold bleak winds, 
from the N. E. N. and N. W. Its fituation is thereby 
mild and kindly even in winter, when blowing from thefe 
points •, but quite the reverfe, when the wind blows u; on 
the flioie. There is a harbour belonging to the town : the 

build, ng 

the hand- tine for the tanny cod, (or red ware cod, as they call it,) among 
the rocks and fea weed The hands ufed in thefe, are commonly a man 
and boy, and fometimes only one man. Of the number of hands ufed in 
•the fifhing here, only fuch as are advanced in life hold clofe by it. The 
young men engage to the fliips employed in the whale fifliing; return 
when the herring fifhing comes on in autumn ; and, when t'lat is over, 
engage themfelvcs in voyages in private fhips, in different places, during 
ithe winter fealon. By this mians St Monance becomes a good nurfery 
/or /camen.

building of which is of no great confequence. But what 
merits obfervation, is the great 'depth of water. At 
ftream tides when full water, it is from 1 8 to 20 feet deep 
at the entrance; and in ordinary floods, from 13 to 15, 
though the building extends but a very fhort way out to 
fea. But though by this depth of water it is capable to 
admit vends of burden, yet none frequent it but in the 
fummer feafon ; and then but very feldom, and when 
freighted to the place : For the entrance is narrow be- 
tween two ridges of rocks, the bottom rough, and thereby 
difficult and dangerous. 

Dfaijion and Rent of Lands, £iV. — The whole of the 
lands of Newark are inclofed with hedge and ditch, except 
a fmall part by {tone fences. There is no real farmer, who 
makes farming his fole bufinefs, but one, and his farm is of 
no great extent. The remainder is let off in fmall parcels 
to the inhabitants of the town. Thefe take it not fo much 
for the profit arifing from farming, as to enable them to 
keep their horfes, which, by their being employed in dri- 
ving of coal, fifh, and otherwife, thereby procure their own 
fupport, and enable them to pay the rent. Likewife, a good 
number of cows are kept, fur the fale of milk to the other 
inhabitants. The lands of Newark contain about 266 acres, 
and they are generally let from L. 2, 2 s. up to L. 3 the 
acre. The valued rent of this part of the parifh is L. 1207, 
13 s. 4d. Scots ; but the real rent I cannot afcertain. For, 
befides the rent of land, there are the feus in the town, 
tithes upon the riming, &amp;cc. There are already large two 
thirds of the lands of Abercrombie inclofed, and the people 
are at prefent' engaged in that work, decorating the inclo- 
fures with clumps of trees here and there. The whole is 
done with hedge and ditch, for there is no freeftone in the 
grounds, but what lies very deep. The farmers are fuffi- 

ciently 



of St Monance.

ciently convinced of the advantage of inclofing," which thej 
fhow, bj giving higher' rents for inclofed than uninclofed 
grounds. The whole of the lands of Abercrombie are di- 
vided into farms, containing from 40 to 60, 80, and 117 
acres, and but a trifle in fmall parcels. The rent 
varies, fome being 15 s. L. t, L. 1, 10 s. L, I, 15 s. and 
fome up to L. 2 the acre. The whole acres are 600, and 
upwards. The : valued rent is L. i486 Scots, but the real 
rent I cannot determine. The whole number of acres, 
therefore, in the parifli is about 866, and the valued rent 
L. 2693 113:4 Scots. There is a mill in the lands of 
Abercrombie, to which all the tenants are thirled, for fuch 
grains as are mealed for the ufe of their families, and pay 
multure. 

Agriculture, ifc. — About 15 years ago, the only plough 
ufed here was the old Scots plough, of a very heavy and 
clumfy conftruftion. It was drawn fometimes by 2 oxen, 
and 2 horfes ; and fometimes by 4 oxen and 1 horfe. But 
what is now generally ufed is the fmall Engliih plough 
with iron mould-board ; and the Scots plough, of a lhotter 
and lighter conftruction than formerly ; and a plough, com- 
pofed of partly Engliih and partly Scots, having an iron 
mould-board and head. The Engliih plough makes the 
neatell work, but does not anfwer in ftony ground ; where- 
as the Scots anfwers all grounds. All thefe ploughs are 
now commonly drawn by 2 ftrong horfes except when 
breaking up ftifF land from graft, that has been down for - 
fome years, then 3 or 4 horfes are ufed. One man both 
holds the plough, and manages the horfes by a pair of long 
reins, except when more than 2 horfes are ufed. The rol- 
ler is frequently ufed here, as the ground is friable, in the 
fprin r upon the wiie it crop, to fhut up the furface, and 
thereby to prevent the fatal effect of tue frofl at that feafon ;

.and upon the fown barley grounds to preferve the mcdfture 

from the violent exhalation. Ail curved and broad ridges 
are now done away, and the ridges are made ftraigl.t and 
narrow ; the furface is by far more neatly dreffed than for- 
merly, and gives pleafure to the beholder. It is only with- 
in thefe few years, that wheat or barley were fown in the 
parilh to any extent ; but now a conliderable quantity of 
both. The wheat is generally fown after potatoes, fallow, 
and beans or peafe, and the time of fo wing, from the middle 
of September even till the end of November ; but the 
greater portion in Oitober. Beans, peafe, and oats,, from 
the beginning of March to the m'dd^ of April. ! he 
greateft part of the beans are in drills, whi. h are dreffed 
with the hand-hoe, and furrowed up with a light plough, 
constructed for that purpofe, with a mould-bonrd on both 
fides, in fummer. There ufed to be a great quantify oi flax- 
feed fown by the inhabitants, who hired the giound from 
the tenants. But of late, the price of the feed and rent of 
land have rifen to fo great a height, that but a fmall quan- 
tity is now fown in comparifon of what ufed to be, and the 
return not compenfating their expenfe. The time of fo wr- 
ing is from the middle of March to the end of April. 
Potatoes the whole of April; and bear and barley from 
the beginning to the end of May, among the latter, grafs- 
feeds are fown, and rolled down. Turnips, of which there 
are now large fields, are fown from the middle of June tq 
the middle of July. The farmers ufe turnip to fatten 
cattle with for fale, and which are bought in for having 
little or no natural pafturc, they raife few or none. To 
the fame purpofe their crops of hay are applied, and by 
this means increafe the fulzie for their grounds. The har- 
veft generally begins about the laft week of Auguft and 
jft of September, and by the firft and fecond week of Oc- 
tober the crop is wholly got into the barn-yards. Of wheat,

barley, bear and fometimes of beans, a greater quantity is 
raifed in this parifh than what is necefTary for the fupport 
of the inhabitants. Thefe are generally fold to the bakers 
and brewers in the towns upon the coaft fide, or to perfons 
refiding there, who are commiflioned by fuch, in Edin- 
burgh, Leith, and other places, to buy up for them. The 
fatted cattle are commonly bought by the butchers from 
Edinburgh, Perth, &amp;x. For Fife of a long time paft has 
been famous for fatted cattle. Since the price of land has 
increafed, the farmers fow little more oats than to fervc 
their own confumpt ; it being a low priced grain, and e- 
fteemed a fcourging crop to the land. The difference be- 
tween the prices of grain in the market at Edinburgh and 
this place, being fomewhat conliderable, together with the 
eafe of water-carriage in tranfporting it, occafions the de- 
mand upon this quarter. 

Population. — The return made to Dr Webfter in the 
1775 of the population of the parifh of St Monance was 
780 fouls ; the number in 1790 turned out to be 832, 
which is an increafe only of 52 fince that period. But as 
there is no evidence in the regifters of any particular enu- 
meration being taken of the inhabitants at that time, there 
is ground to fufpeft that it has been either fuperficially tav 
ken or exaggerated, for the following reafons : ift, 
Bccaufe houfes in the town of St Monance have of 
late increafed in number above what they then were, 
and all are poffeiTed. id, Since that period, the 
cod-work has been fet a-going, about which feveraJ 
houfes have been raifed, and the fult-works built, in 
which are a number of houfes for falters, &amp;c. Both of 
which have brought a number of .perfons, and their families 
into the parifh, from other parts of the country. Laftfy 
The 1 inhabitants of Abercrombie, and country parts of the 
panfh, are much the fame they were at that period. From

then made was not juft ; and that had it been fo, the in- 
creafe now, above what the number then was, mull have

The great increafe of deaths in 1783, 1784, and 1786,' 
was owing to the fmall-pox getting into the town of St 
Monance in the height of fummer, when the air is tainted 
by the refufe of the fifhing, (as before obferved,) which, 
when it happened, never failed to fweep off a great number 
of children. It is to be obferved, that the great excefs of 
births beyond the deaths, in the above fpace of 7 years, is 
owing to many of the prefent inhabitants continuing frill 
to bury in the parifhes from whence they came, and the 
cuftoin of paying the tax upon deaths in the place where 
the dead are interred. The whole parifh belongs to two 

proprietors, 

* The reafon why the calculation begins at the ctd of October, is, be- 
caufc the tax upon births, bV. did take place then, and the regifter com- 
menced.

proprietors, Sir Robert Anftruther, Baronet, proprietor of 
Abercrombie, and Sir John Anftruther, Baronet, of the 
lands of Newark ; but none of them refide in the parilh. 
In the lands of Abercrombie, all the inhabitants are farm- 
ers, and cottagers employed by them ; except in the village 
of Abercrombie, there are i wright, i fmith, and 3 wea- 
vers.- — It was obferved before, that the lands of Newark 
were let in fmall parcels to perfons who refided in the town 
of St Monance. Befides thefe, in that place, there are 4 
bakers, 3 brewers, 2 fmiths, 4 merchants, 1 wright, and 1 
boat-builder ; 2 mafons, 2 lieve-makers, 2 flax drefiers, 1 
(hoemaker, 5 tailors, 6 weavers, and 1 gardener. The reft 
of the inhabitants are compofed of filhers and failors, land- 
labourers and day labourers, and fuch as are employed about 
the coal and fait works. And it merits obfervation, that 
there are no lefs than 12 fpirit and ale houfes, the unhappy 
efFe&amp;s of the keepers of which, by their craft to decoy, are 
with regret feen upon both the health and morals of the 
young and inconfiderate. 

Church, Stipend, 13 c. — What is at prefent ufed for the 
church of the parilh is part of an old convent, on the weft 
of the town of St Monance ; which is lituated upon a rock, 
advancing into the frith of Forth. It had been a very 
ftately and beautiful Gothic pile of hewn ftone, in the form 
of a crofs, with a fquare fteeple in the centre *. The walls 
of the fouth and north branches are Hill Handing, but want

It was founded by King David If. of Scotland, in the 40th year of hi, 
reign, and was ferved by a hermit. By his charter, dated " at Edin- 
bragh," he grants thereto, the lands of Eafter-birney in Fife, and Come 
lands in the flieriffdom of Edinburgh. It was given by King James III. 
to the Black-friar*. To it was annexed the convent founded by the 
Macduffs Earls of Fife, at the foot of the Caftlehill of Cupar of Fife. Af-

the roof ; of the weft branch no veftige remains, and the 
call branch, with the fteeple, ferves at prefent for the place 
of public worflvip. This part of the building has a very- 
beautiful vaulted roof, with veins jutting out from the fide- 
walls, and meeting in the centre of the roof, where it is 
decorated with rofes, and other ornaments. Over the vault, 
there is a flate roof, to preferve it from the weather. The 
burden of upholding this fabric, was laid by the proprietor 
of the lands of Newark upon the feuars of St Monance, 
when he let off the ground on which the town Hands, ha- 
ving the annexation in view. But the building feems to 
have been in a manner totally neglected by them. In the 
1772, it was in fuch a ruinous Hate, that the incumbent 
raifed a procefs for reparation before the prefbytery, and 
obtained a decree for that end againft the heritors. But 
the feuars were reluciant, pretending they were not obliged 
to uphold it. This brought on a procefs between the Heri- 
tors and them, before the Lords of Seffion, in which they 
were cart, and found liable to uphold the fabric. During 
the procefs, it received a partial reparation, but nothing e- 
qual to what was granted by prefbytery ; and nothing more 
has yet been done, either by the heritors, to enforce the 
decree of the Lords upon the feuars, or by them, to teftify 
their compliance with it ; and if they continue long fo to 
do, this venerable pile muft fink into ruins. What a pity 
is it, that fuch a beautiful monument of antiquity, and 
which perhaps has not its fellow in Scotland, fhonid be fuf-

ritors allow the intereft of the money appointed by law, 
for building a fchool and houfe, to the matter, to hire one.

fent incumbent has never realifed more than L. 2 : 19 : 2%, 
though he has often applied to the heritors concerning it. 
The amount of the whole, (taking the vi&amp;ual at the com. 
mon converfion,) is L. 64 : 1 : 5^ Sterling, exclufive of the

State of the Poor, &amp;c. — The funds for the poor, are the 
weekly collections at the church door. Thefe of late have 
greatly diminifhed, owing to the increafe of the different 
feels of Seceders in this part of the county, the Relief, 
Burghers, and Antiburghers, &amp;x. The teachers and mana- 
gers of each of' which focieties, artfully draw off the igno- 
rant and unwary from the Eftablilhed Church, by this 
means to make up a falary for their teachers ; and pride 
themfelves to have it not only eqnal to, but above that of 
the minifters of the church. They give no charity to their 
poor ; but the whole of what is collected at the door of their 
meeting-houfes, and what arifes from the rent of feats is 
applied to this purpofe. When any of their fociety are un- 
fit for labour, by ficknefs or old age, and reduced in cir- 
cumflances, being unable to pay the heavy affeffments they 
lay upon them, and Handing in need of charity ; finding 
they can reap no more pecuniary benefit from .them, they 
fend them to the church-feflion for relief. Thus their prac- 
tice has laid the church -feffions under the difagreeable ne- 
ceffity of acquainting them, that upon thei leaving the 
church, they will be deprived of the benefit of that fund. 

And

And did they not take this method, the whole would be 
confumed upon fuch as contribute nothing to it * Befides 
the above, there are others, fuch as feamen, and of other 
profeffions, who enter into focieties, and pay into what they 
call their box, and publicly colleft from others, and though 
they attend the church, give nothing to the poor. Thus 
the public fund is much injured, and the whole collection 
which comes from a few perfons, is but fmall ; which, with 
the rent of four acres of land, and two houfes, cannot be 
calculated at more than about L. 9 a-year. There are now 
upon the poors lift three perfons and two orphans. None 
are allowed to beg publicly. The parifh, however, is much 
infefted with beggars from towns at a diftance. 

* It may be proper to obferve, that the above fedtaries are always 
ready to break the public peace. A flagrant inftance of which they 
lately gave in this corner. By forming focieties, which confifted, if not 
wholly, yet moftly of perfpns of thefe feels, for circulating feditious 
pamphlets, and difieminating difaffection to King and Government, by 
thefe meetings, and private converfations. 

Mifcellaueorts Obfervatious .—lx\ the 1782, the 'harvclt was very late, 
owing to the rains through the fummer, and heayy falls of fnow and in- 
tenfe frofts in the end of September, and the whole of October. This did 
not only greatly injure the crop, but made the harveft uncommonly late 
in this parifh. And as this weather was fimilar over all Scotland, the 
country was threatened with a general fcarcity. The meal quickly rofe 
to I s. 3 d. the peck, which rendered it very dilrrefiing to the poor ; the 
induftrious labourer and artificer, having a family of children, being a- 
bove what they could procure by their labour. The feflion, moved with 
companion, and fearing the fa^l effects of the fcarcity, came to a refolu- 
{ion to lend their aid for prcferving the lives of the inhabitants. For this 
purpofe, as oats or meal were very difficult to be obtained, they thought 
it proper to have recourfe to Sir Robert Anftruther, Bart, for his farm- 
oats to be converted into meal, and to be applied to the fupport of the 
parifh; and agreed to give him for every boll of meal the price current, 
and to give it 3 d. the peck to the inhabitants below the market price. 
Their requeft he was fo good and humane as to grant. Having thus fe- 
curcd meal, the feffion, to prevent impofitions, made a fur.vey of the pa- 
rifh,

rifli, to find out the mod neceffitous families, without distinction of fcdb 
or parties. They appointed two days in the week for distribution, 
Tuefday and Friday ; when each perfon, upon receiving a ticket, and 
giving the fame to the perfon appointed to diftribute the meal, were to 
receive the quantity therein Specified, at 3 d. the peck below the market 
price. By this means, they not only had it at this eafy rate, but were 
fure of having it. For, at that time, meal often could not be procured for 
money. This the feflion continued to do, from the ift of February to the 
end of May 17 S3, when the Shipping, in the courfe of Providence, arrived 
more early than ufual from the Baltic, with a Supply for the relief of the 
country. By this method the feflion became the happy instruments of 
Supporting no lefs than 40 families, befides individuals, and preferving the 
lives of their fellow parishioners from the general calamity.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q205448">KILMAURS</name>, 

(County of Ayr, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Irvine.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Millar.</head> 



<p>Name and Extent. 

r X^lME, the great deftroyer of men and things, has blot- 
ted out the memory of thofe circumftances which 
firft gave rife to the name by which this parifli is now di- 
ftinguilhed; and, therefore, as in moft cafes of the kind, 
conjecture alone muft fupply the place of certain know- 
ledge. In fome ancient records of feffion, the name is 
fpelled Kilmares, which appears to be a fmall variation of 
the word Marie, and if fo, it is probable that the Kil was 
dedicated to the Mother of our Lord, or to fome perfon 
of the family who endowed it, bearing that name. But at 
this day, it is moft commonly written Kilmaurs, by which 
fome are difpofed to think that the church, from which 
the parifh has its defignation, was originally dedicated to a 
St Maurs. In fupport of this derivation, the fubjoined fact

has fome ftrength *. The length of this parifli from E. to 
W. is 6, and the greateft breadth from N.. to S. 3 miles. 

Rivulets, t^fc. — A rivulet, which rifes in Fenwick, and 
running the whole length of the parim from E. to W. 
divides it nearly into two equal parts. This rivulet has 
feveral names given to it, taken from the mod remark- 
able places through which it paiTes. Here it is known 
by the name of Kilmaurs water. A little lower it is call- 
ed Carmel, which it retains, till it lofes itfelf in the Irvine. 
In its courfe, two mills belonging to the parifh are fup- 
plied, but in the drought of fummer, and froft of winter, 
it becomes aim oft dry ; a circumftance which deprives this 
part of the country of the advantages from machinery, ap- 
plied to the fpinning of cotton by water. The inhabitants 
of Kilmaurs town might find in it a fufficient quantity to 
anfwer the purpofes of bleaching thread, and it is furpri- 
fing, that fome of them have not turned their attention to 
this article. It produces fome trout and eel. The Irvine

figure is in a fitting pofture, drefied in a robe or oarlock, which is'tucked 

up before as far as the knees, leaving the legs and feet naked. The hands 

appear from under the folds of the robe, holding fomething like a mace

on the S. and S. W. glides along the fkirts of this pariih 
for nearly two miles. Salmon, trout, and eel, are found in 
it, but none of them remarkable either for quantity or 
quality. There might be a cotton mill ere&amp;ed at Miln- 
ton in our bounds, where there is at prei'ent an excellent 
corn and barley mill ; fufficient water for both may at all 
times be here found. On the N. and N. W. a burn fe- 
parates us from Dreghorn *. 

Surface, lie. — The furface confifts of large flat fields, 
with many gentle rifings and declivities interfperfed. 
The fummits of thefe are covered with trees, planted in 
circles, which, with others of the fame kind, fpread all o- 
ver Cunninghame, give a beautiful appearance to the 
•whole of this country, as well as profit to the owners, by 
affording timber for houfes. The profpeft from thefe 
fummits, which are in every farm, is extenfive and de- 
lightful ; for many miles all round, the whole country ap- 
pears as one well cultivated garden. Towns, villages, and 
gentlemen's houfes, meet the eye on every quarter. The 
hills of Arran, and the frith of Clyde, terminate our view 
on the W. the hills of Kilbirny on the N. the high 
grounds of Fenwick and Galfton on the E. and S. E. and

* Tts name is Gawreer, and may be thus derived. Caw is that flit 
or opening made by a plough or fpade in the fide of a pond, loch, or ftag- 
nated water, by which it is drained oft'; reer may be a corruption of 
ruigh or righ, which, in Gaelic, fignifies " to run or move quickly." 
In the fenfe given of thefe words, they can be applied, with propriety, as 
defcriptive of the peculiarities which diftinguifli this ftream. It is drawn 
from a loch in the pariih of Stewarton, by a gaw, in which it runs at 
fome diftance, and then feeks a courfe for itfelf. Gnvrrer, or rather 
Gawrigh, exprefles the idea of a water-coiirfe, not made by the natural 
exertions of that element, but by the accidental application of it to fome 
purpofes of art.

make our horizon to the S. About 20 or 30 years ago, 
there was no fuch thing to be feen as trees or hedges in 
this parifti; all was naked and open; every farm-houfe, old, 
paltry, inconvenient, and unpleafantly fituated ; not a 
fingle made road, either to kirk or market. Now, all is 
completely inclofed, and fubdivided by ditches and' thorn 
hedges. New houfes, on a regular convenient plan, and 
pleafantly fituated, every where gladden the eye, and fug- 
ged the ideas of aflivity, neatnei's and wealth, of which 
every liberal minded man wi flies to be pofleffed, and de- 
lights to fee in the poffeffion of others. 

Roads. — An eafy communication is now opened up to all 
the market towns, whether far or near. From Kilmaurs 
town, as a centre, the following lines of road go out ; S. to 
Kilmarnock, N. N. W. by Cunninghamehead and Peice- 
ton to Irvine, E. to Fenwick, where it joins the Glafgow 
road, W. by Bufhby and Fairlie Bridge to Ayr. The 
road from Kilmarnock to Irvine runs acrofs this la if line 
at Crofs-houie, and the road between Kilmarnock and 
Stewarton cuts the eaft line at Shaw- bridge, half a mile 
from Kilmaurs. Thefe roads fo divide and quarter this 
parifli, that no farmer is diltant from one or other of them 
more than the fourth of a mile, feverals not fo much. 
The expenfe of making and repairing roads here is de- 
frayed by toll-duties, together with a certain yearly fum 
levied from the tenants, according to the proportion of 
valued rent which they hold, and from each houfcholder, 
in terms of the ftatute ; or money is borrowed from indi- 
viduals, who have it to fpare, upon the fecurity of one or 
more truftees, whofe intereft is molt promoted by the roads 
in this or the other direction, and the toll duties, with the 
other affelTments already mentioned, are applied to the 
payment of the intereft, and the gradual extinction of the

original debt. Senfible that no progrefs in agricultural 
improvements can be made, without the advantages of 
good and convenient roads, the gentlemen in every diftrict 
of this county have paid an unwearied and fuccefsful at- 
tention to this object:. What an undertaking mult it have 
been to travel but a few miles in thofe days, when no road 
was any where to be feen, and where the foil, as in a 
great many parts of this parim. is a deep clay, though in 
many other parts it is a rich loam, and every inch arable 1 

Climate, — The operations of the hufbandmnn are 
now incomparably more eafy, that good roads are brought 
to their doors : But dill they have fome inconveniences to 
ftruggle with, which cannot be remedied. They are fre- 
quently interrupted by inconflancy of weather, which o- 
bliges them to plough lefs, or more untimoufly, and to 
reap with more riik than they could wifh. It is probably 
owing to onr being fituated in the vicinity of the Atlan- 
tic, and the high hills of Arran, that we have much rain, 
and many fevere blafts. To the fame caufe may be afcri- 
bed the ablence of froft and blow, or the mildnefs of the 
one, and the Ihort continuance of the other on the ground. 
Thefe N. W. and b. W blafts, however troublei'ome in 
many refpects, ferve to preferve us from fogs, which fel- 
dom or never appear in our atmofphere. The inhabitants 
are generally healthy ; not remarkable for longevity, 
though fome reach from 70 to 80. One or two are now 
at 90. Several inttances of .fcrofula and confumption have 
occurred, but not lufficient to mark thcfe as the moft pre- 
valent difeafes. Rheumatifm is the complaint of many, 
especially of thofe who are on the decline of life. Sud- 
den colds attack the young and middle aged. Fevers 
fometi.nes make their appearance, and leldom depart 
without death in their train j but thefe are generally

brought into' the parifh by fervants from grent towns, 
whofe parents or relations refide here. Many epidem ical 
difeafes might be warded off from a whole country, if li- 
beral contributions were made for building, and maintain- 
ing infirmaries, in which the lick and difeafed among the 
poor would find a comfortable retreat, and the nea ffary 
advantages of medical aid. Donations for this purpofe 
are the very effence of charity, which affimilates men to 
the Supreme Being, whofe providential care extends to all 
his cieatures *. 

Population, — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
numbers were then 1094. At prefent they amount to 
1 147. The inhabitants may be claffed as refiding in the 
country part of the parifh, and in the town of Kilmaurs* 
Of men, women and children in the country, excepting 
farmers, the number is 384, of thefe - 174 are males, 210

* The encouragement given to men, women, and children, by manu- 
facturers, hath drawn fo many people from the country to them, that the 
few remaining avail themfelves of the fcarcity of hands, for obtaining an 
augmentation of wages. A labourer, in fummer, earns a-day, accord- 
ing to his ability for work, his known diligence and difpatch in working, 
from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 4 d. and i s. 6 d. ; from the nth of November to the 
iath of February, i s. or i s. 2 d. ; in autumn, thofe who are engaged 
for the whole harveft, whether men or women, receive from L. i, 5 s. to 
L. 1, 10 s. with their victuals; thofe hired by the day, during that fea- 
fon, 1 s. 6 d. ; of late more has been given, and their diet alfo furnifheu. 
Hay-cutters, if paid by the day, receive from 1 s 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d ; if by 
the acre, from 1 s. 6 d. to 1 s. 3 d. fomerimes 2 s. 6 d. according to the 
cafe or difficulty which evidently attends the work to be performed. The 
wages of a carpenter, the day, are 1 s. 6 d. : of a mafon, r s. 8 d. ; both of 
late 2 s. Of a tailor, 1 s. ; but a deduction of 4 d. is always made from 
the above, when the employer furnifhes provifions. Many kinds of work 
are contracted for by the piece, and care is taken by the worker, that no 
engagement of this fort fliall afford lefs to him, upon the whole, than 
fome, if not the higheft, of the above mentioned wages, the day. Every 
mdefman eftimates his work, one day with another, at 1 s. 6 d. and 2 s.

The ordinary and moil productive crops are oats, a little 
barley or bear, and but a little of thefe is cultivated, being 
lound not to anfwer the ioil and climate. Early oats are 
much in ufe, and thrive well where the land is rich. Beans 
and peafe are fown in fmall quantities, and wheat in a ftill 
fmaller proportion. Potatoes and flax are raifed only for 
private ufe, and turnips never fown as a crop. The return 
of oats is from 5 to 10 bolls of 8 Winchefter bufhels the 
acre, which, for the moft part, renders in meal about 18 or 
19 pecks from the boll, each peck weighing 8 lb. Of 
bear the produce is from 4 to 8 bolls the acre ; barley ra-

derable quantity of oats and oat- meal is carried to the ad-

Farmers in times that are now pad were allowed to 
choofe for themielves what kind and what portion of land 
they would lay under fome of thefe crops ; for it was only 
foine that they could raile, during which time they could 
not produce plenty, confequently paid a very fmall rent. 
They neither knew the full force of lime, nor had it in 
their power, for want of roads, to apply it. In the early 
dawning of agricultural knowledge, they were taught to 
confine themielves to croft and outfield ; the former was 
ploughed 3 and refted one year j and when laid down for

this fhort reft, it got a little dreffing/with what dung could 
be fpared from garden and potatoes. The outfield lay in 
grafs fo many years, and was ploughed fo many as was a- 
greed upon, without any manure whatever, during which 
time there were bad crops, and as bad pafture ; therefore 
poor tenants, and fmall ill paid rents. When fuch leafes 
came to an er«d, and when the land was completely inclofed, 
the diftinftion of outfield and infield was taken away, and 
a method of farming, very fimple, yet well adapted to the 
nature of the foil, was introduced, particularly in the ma- 
nagement of Lord Eglinton's eftate. The great objett was 
to lift the land for tillage, and to lay it down again in good 
heart. Reft and lime were fufficient for the firft, and a re- 
ftriction in ploughing, with the application of dung to the 
laft or two laft crops in that reftri&amp;ion for the latter. To 
promote thefe ends effectually 3 divifions were made of 
each farm, 1 of which was limed at the proprietor's ex- 
pense with the quantity of 100 or 150 bolls the acre, 
which is burnt by the farmers themfelves, and fpread upon 
the field to be ploughed, fometimes 12 months, and fome- 
times only 2 before tilling. This one divifion and no more 
is allowed at a time to be in tillage. The other 2 remain 
under grafs. After ploughing the one divifion mentioned 
for 3 years fucceffively, it was committed to reft on the 
laft of thefe, with grafs-feeds fown among thofe for the 3d 
crop. Then another divifion, limed at the tenant's expenfe, 
was broken up, and fo in rotation. The tenant is always 
permitted to cut the grafs for the ift year of that divifion 
which was laft laid down. This method is ftill in practice ; 
but where the farm is large, another mode has been adopt- 
ed -, 4 divifions are preferred to 3 ; and each divifion is 
ploughed 3 years, then refts 9; or 2 grain crops are ta- 
ken from it, and then is turned into pafture, in which ftate

low as 4s. or 5s. Then the tenants were poorer than now, 
when it, upon an average, is fo high as L. 1, 2s. or L. 1, 3 s. 
Where leafes have been granted within thefe 5 years paft, 
the rent is from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 1, 12 s. In a particular 
farm 74 acres of pafture laud was let about a month ago, 
for 2 years after Whitfunday 1794, at L. 124 Sterling, and 
a number of acres in the fame farm, for ploughing, 3 years, 
at L. 5 and L. 5, ics. the acre ; nor is there reafon for 
complaints, for that land yielded, on each acre, 10 or 12 
bolls of corn ; yet this very land, between 20 and 30 years 
ago, was rented fo low as 4 s. or 5 s. an acre, and after all 
the tenant went a bankrupt out of it. Little reafon, then, 
have our farmers to upbraid thofe gentlemen who have rai- 
fed their rents, feeing they have alfo taught them how to 
acquire even more than thefe rents. There have been, and 
there will always be fome men in fociety, fo ftupid as not 
to be fenfible of their own intereft, or fo wicked as not 
to be grateful when it is promoted ; but the good and wife 
will be open to convicfion, ready to fubmit to in {traction,

* Some attribute the introduction of this laft mode to Mr Fairlie of 
Fairlie, in the management of his own and the Earl of Eglinton's eftates. 
Some fay the alteration originated from Mr Snodgrafs of Cuningham- 
head; others affirm, that Mr Ralfton, factor for Lord Eglinton, is the 
author of it, and that he firft practifed it in the culture of a large farm 
which he pofleffes. Any, nay all of thefe gentlemen, are well qualified 
for making ufeful and important difcoveries in the province of agricul- 
turc. Whoever of them has the merit of this, it is abundantly evident, 
that the land by it muftbe ftill preferved in ftrength and vigour, Specially 
when tins circumltance is cqnfidered, that the tenants are llrialy proh.br-

* Captain Cuninghame of Thornton, who, though (till a young man, 
and when ftill much younger, was bred up to a military life, in which, 
the lefs that is thought of mother earth the better, has, in the courfe of a 
few years, by unwearied application, attained a very uncommon degree of 
knowledge, both in the theory and, practice of agriculture, as is evident 
from the prefent ftate of his lands^ compared with that in which he found 
them, and the eafe and affluence of his prefent circumftances, which, in a 
great meafure, is owing to his owU careful management. Mich an ex- 
ample of induftry followed by fuccefs, affords an excellent leflbn, and it 
would be injuftice to the publice to with-hold it.— Mr John AJorrice, 
who having followed a feafaring life, in which, by knowing when to lay 
hold of the opportunities that Providence puts in every man's power one 
time or other, of bettering his condition, made an handfome fortune, with 
which he retired, and purchafed the eftate of Craig in this pariih. His 
full operation there was that of repairing the manfion-houfe and offices ; 
but before thefe were fhufhed, the houfe, either by accident or defign, 
was fet on fire and conmmed. Report fays, that a fervant, in abfence of 
his mailer, having found accefs to the cellar, or place where the liquors- 
were kept, embezzled them fo much, that becoming afraid of a detection 
at his mailer's return, took this horrid method of concealing his crime. 
Be this true or falfe, the very furmife fliould make all fervants beWaffe of 
indulging any one evil, however trivial it may appear ; becaufe one 
wicked deed leads on to another, till at laft all fenfe of character is loft, 
and life itfelf falls in the iflue a victim to depraved appetites. On the o-

thought, mould not pry into. Be it fo, tie futor ultra cre- 
pidam; but there can be 'no harm, furely, in figuring it a- 
way. If then it be true, that the real rent comes nearly 

in 

ther hand, too much caution cannot be ufed in keeping temptation at a 
diftance from that clafs of people whofe minds are feldom, at the proper 
age, tutored to the love of virtue. Mr Morrice, though he no doubt fuf- 
fered a great lofs in this event, did immediately begin the building of 
another houfe, the plan and fituation of which he entirely made new; 
but had not the pleafure of feeing it fully completed, before death re- 
moved him to a better habitation. The character which he left behind 
him, is that of an honeft, fenfible and benevolent man. Mr Robert Mor- 
rice, his only brother, fucceeded to the whole of his landed eftate, and 
the greateft part of his money. This gentleman, for feveral years, was 
engaged in the affairs of trade and commerce at Glafgow; from which, 
with an excellent character, he hath drawn considerable gains ; thefe add- 
ed to his inheritance, are more than fufficient for all the purpofes of 
genteel living, which he enjoys in eafe and elegance, to the great plea- 
fure of all who know him, being endeared to them by his amiable man- 
ners, integrity, candour, humanity, benevolence, and the warmeft friend- 
fliip. His early engagements in bufinefs eftranged him to the affairs of 
the country; but his habits of application, and aptnefs to learn, have qua- 
lified him for directing the cultivation of his own eftate, and for contri- 
buting his example to the benefit of thofe who need to be guided by the 
good conduct of them, whofe advantages of education and improvement 
are fuch as do not fall to the lot of the many. He has finiihed and fitted 
up in an elegant manner the houfe which his brother had bsgun, drefled 
the land about it in good tafte, made a pleafant approach, feveral gravel 
walks, with other ornaments, added fome convemencies to the offices, 
and drained fome fields, that were fpouty and four. The houfe of Craig is 
delightfully fituated on the banks of the Irvine, which, after falling in 
a beautiful cafcade, from a mill-dam on the fouth of the garden, appears 
again under the windows, in a furface fmooth as glafs. The Frith of 
Clyde, the Rock of Ailfa, and the Hills of Arran, terminate the view on 
another quarter.

formerly it was called the Mote. There is a tumulus ftill remaining, 
near the Carmel-bank, which is certainly that Mote ; whether it fer- 
ved in days of old as a fanttuary, an obfervatory for communicating 
alarm, or was a place where courts of juftice were held, no intelligence 
can now be had. The fofle, by which it had been furrounded, is ftill di- 
ftinguiihable, but no veftiges of building appear. Mr Cuninghame's lands 
of Mote or Carmel-bank are in excellent order, and difcover the true 
fpirit of agriculture in the proprietor. The friends of improvements have 
reafon to Willi that his territorial fubjccl: were more extenfive. Befides 
the example he affords of good management, he is likevvife veiy ufeful 
to fociety, by preventing law-fuits among the peafantry, to whom he rea- 
dily communicates his beft advice ; and which they receive with confi- 
dence, becaufe he for fome years made law his ftudy. 

Bufby-caftle ftands a little beyond the laft mentioned place, is now un- 
 roofed and falling into ruins. A family of Barklays pofiJfled it long. The late 
Lord Glencairn fold it, with the lands belonging to it, to Mifs Scott. 
Coal was wrought in thefe lands, and may ftill be had at no great cx- 
penfe. Concerning the Barklays of Bufby, it is faid, they had fomchow 
incumbered the eftate fo much that they were obliged to wadfct a great 
part of it. One of them, among the laft heirs, being in fuch a ftraitened 
condition that he could not find as much money as would buy a new 
coat, made offer to renew a wadfet which was about to expire, and 
which had every appearance of. giving the perfon to whom the former 
one had been granted, all poffible chance of becoming the real proprietor^ 

if he would furniih Barklay with money to buy a coat. But the 

man imagined, that iince the laird was become fo poor, there was no rea- 
fon to believe that he could prevent the term of redemption from expiring. 
He was grievoufly miftaken, for Mr Barklay not only found from another 
quarter a new coat, but alfo as much money as redeemed the wadfet. 

Mr William Ralfton, factor to the Earl of Eglinton, lives in this parilh,

better ferved than Lord Eglinton's is by him ; and with fuch eafe does he

quotient of 4391 5 7 T acres ; the 3d of which being in tillage, 
leaves 2928 of pafture. Two acres to each cow, makes 
them in number 1464. The butter and cheefe from each 
cow is valued at L. 4 a-year. The value then of the paf- 
ture land in the parifli, by this calculation, is L. 5856, be- 
lides profits upon young cattle, and fwine fed upon the whey. 
1463 acres, which is i-3d of 4391, producing 7 bolls the 
acre, will yield 10,241 bolls of oats, which, at is. the peck, 
comes to L.8192, 16s. added to L. 5856, is L. 14, .-48, 
from which, if the grofs rent, the expenfe of feed, ma- 
nure, labour, the intereft of ftock, tear and wear of utenfils, 
&amp;c &amp;c. be deduced, there will remain a fum equal at leaft 
to the rent ; and it is evident, that the intention of proprie- 
tors is to allow their tenants to make one good rent for the 
ufe of the foil, one for defraying the expenfe of labour, &amp;c. 
and one for the maintenance of their families, &amp;c. While 
this is the cafe, mafter and tenant have reafon to be plea- 
fed with one another. It is not affirmed that the above 
ftatement is exa&amp;ly the truth. It cannot, however, be far 
from it ; and it ferves to eftablifh this fad, that while pro- 
prietors wifli to have a reafonable rent for their lands, they 
wilh alfo to avoid oppreffion towards their tenants. At 
prefent the value of land is greatly on the increafe, and 
the reafon is, that every thing it produces is alfo increafed 
in value. Butter is here fold for 1 1 d. the lb. ; cheefe for

Latin, and figned by the faid Cuthbert Earl of Glencairn,

1577, it appears, that the five-pound land of Kilmaurs, con- 
filling of 24c acres, was difponed to 40 different perfons 
in feu-farm and free burgage, and to be held in equal pro- 
portions by them, their heirs and fucceffors, upon the 
yearly payment of 80 merks of the ufual- money of the

vious, that the great defign of the Noble family : this 
erection, was to bring together into one place i many 
trades people as poffible, and that the feuing of thefe lands 
was meant as an encouragement and help to fuch ; but it 
has all along produced a contrary efFea. Six acres of land 
was the mare which fell to each of thefe 40 feuars or tene- 
menters, as they are called, the cultivation of which is no 
more than proper exercife and amufement for a man 
whofe employment is fedentary, and which, with his la- 
bour otherwife, would enable him to live in fome degree 
of comfort. But it is the misfortune of molt men, to have 
a greater liking for employments that are foreign to them, 
than for thofe which they have been bred up to follow; 
hence, the tenementers of Kilmaurs did abandon their 
principal bufinefs, and content themfelves with the pro- 
duce of their fmall bit of ground. This burgh land is fa- 
mous for having ferved Galloway, Nithfdale, Clydefdale, 
and all Ayrfhire, with kail plants •, and it was the demand 
for them that turned the attention of the proprietors fo 
much to the cultivation of their little fpots ; but that de- 
mand has long ceafed, other countries having learnt to raife 
this article for themfelves. There is not in the county 
better land, but it labours under this difadvantage of being 
runridge. In this cafe inclofures are impracticable, except 
where good fenfe has prevailed irt bringing about an exchange 
of property, and it is hoped, that the beneficial coi fecraencoS 
of the few inftances of this that have happened, will open 
the eyes of thofe who are blinded by prejudice and cultom. 
The number of portioners is now lefs than when the char- 
ter was granted, feveral of the fortieth parts having been 
fold and laid together by one purchafer, and it is probable, 
that they will all in time become an united property ; a 
circumftance not to be regreted, feeing, that under fuch a

object of attention. The town is pleafantly fituated on a 
gentle afcent, looking towards the fouth. It con fills of one

the entries to which are through thofe in the front. A 
fmall town-houfe Hands in the middle, having a fteeple and 
good clock. In ths, the courts of Juilice are held, and the 
meetings of Council for electing Magiftrates, and other 
affairs of the town. No man can be elefted a Magiftrate 
unlefs he be alfo a portioner, and none but thofe who are 
portioners can vote in fuch elections *. Many of the for- 
tieth parts being now the property of one perfon, there 
are by thefe means houfes to fpare for tradefmen, and more 
might Hill be had by fubfeuing. There is every induce- 
ment for fuch people to choofe an habitation hei*e. The t 
town is diltant from coal, wrought in the lands of Mr Rit- 
chie of Bulby, only one mile or a little more. Each 
houfe has a garden belonging to it, fufficient to fupply any 
family with plenty of potatoes, and every ordinary vege- 
table. The market of Kilmarnock, which is but 2 Eng- 
lilh miles from this, can afford every thing elfe that may 
be needed. There was a time when 30 cutlers, and a good 
many tinkers, refided in Kilmaurs. The cutlers made ex-

is apt to be intoxicated by profperity, and the conduct to 
be thereby tinctured with levity, yet, in circumftances of 
this kind, the heart is more eafily trained to virtue, and 
the good lefs liable to hypocrify. Some have complained 
in the Statiftical Account of their parifb.es, that thefe 
works of art, which bring fo many people of different fex, 
age and tempers together are unfriendly to the intereft of 
morality. But an attentive obferver muft be convinced, 
that the vices which are moft hurtful to fociety, do not 
prevail fo much where an open and unreftrained intercourfe 
takes place, as where fecrecy and the tempora mollia fundi 
are frequently enjoyed. Befides, that virtue which pro- 
ceeds from the abfence of temptation, is merely negative ;

* No unufual cuftoms prevail among the inhabitants of this parifli. 
There is one indeed common to the whole country, that of gathering ma- 
ny people together, and entertaining them at confiderable expenfe when 
they bury their dead. However ill it can be afforded, nothing muft be 
Ipared that cuftom has fandlioned. By exploding this in a great meafure, 
many would have it in their power to do more effential acts of kindnefs to 
their friends and relations when living. There is little merit in helping 
to bury thofe whom we help to ftarve. Nor do the deceafed feel or enjoy 
any of the gratifications of vanity or mifplaced veneration, which prompt 
t» this cuftom.

The people are in general indubious, and where their 
intereft is concerned, they have addrefs fufficient for ob- 
taining or preferving it. Sufpicion among themfelves in 
tranfafting bufiaefs, and defign covered by an afleded fim- 
plicity towards fuperiors are perhaps fometimes difcernible. 
Compared with the times which are honoured with the 
character of pure, the vices which now appear are fewer 
and lefs attrocious. Like every other community, ours 
^onfifls of a mixture of characters. Juftice requires it to be 
told, that much civility, kindnefs, integrity, and candour, 
are praftifed by many. 

NOTE. 

the kirk of Kilmaurs was founded a college by Sir William Cuning- 
iarae of Kilmaurs the 1 3th of May 1403, and endowed by him with cer- 
I tain lands, for thefupport of a provoll, feven prebendaries, and two finging- 
boys. It is difficult to determine where thefe lands lay ; part of them, 
it is probable, are now the property of James Watfon, Efq; merchant, 
Greenock. The tower, of which this gentleman is the proprietor, has been 
an high ftrdng built houfe, confiding of feveral apartments, and is feparated 
from the church by a garden, laid out with excellent tafte, efpecially of 
the land which is favourable to retirement and meditation. This, of all 
other places in the parifli, is beft fuited to the convenience of the clergy. 
It is therefore raoft likely they had this for their refidence. The lands 
contiguous, confifting of 80 acres nearly, lefs or more, pay no teind either . 
to the titular or minifter ; and no reafon can be aligned fpr this, unlefs 
that they are church-lands, belonging originally to the Ciflertian order. 
There was a mill, called the prebendary mill, immediately in the neigh- 
bourhood of die lands now mentioned, to which a di drier, of the parilh 
was thirled, and the multures were paid for behoof of the prebendaries. 
The religiouB houfe of Kilmaurs, it is faid, was annexed to the abbey 
of Selkirk, afterward Roxburgh, now Kelfo. The church itfelf mull 
have undergone many alterations, if it is not altogether new fince its 
Jir(t erection. There is nothing magnificent either in its fize or ftructure. 
The only remarkable thing about it, is a burying place and monument 
belonging to the family of Glencairn. The monument has been executed 
at very confulerable expenfe, but it is now in a date of fbameful difce- 
yair. It is open to every idle and thoughtlefs vifitor, who takes plea- 
fure in demolifliing the carved work: It is the only intereft whkb

the reprefentatives of that noble family now have in the parifu, where 
tlieir influence was once great, and their property extenfive ; with fub- 
miffion, therefore, it may be obferved, that fome attention is due to 
the memorials of ancient greatnefs. We regret that the moll beautiful 
ftructures of art cannot be preferved from the ravages of time, but 
when they are fuffered by neglect to fall into ruins, we cannot refrain 
from cenfuring thofe to whom that neglect, with its confluences, are 
to be attributed. 

A difpofition to fecede from the eftabliflied church bath long fubfift- 
ed among the inhabitants of Kilmaurs : and this difpofition was firft ex- 
cited by the following circumftance : About the 1712, Mr Hugh Thom- 
fom, then minuter of this parifli, demitted, upon the expectation of 
being called to Stewarton, but was fomehow difappointed ; and either 
his pride would not permit him to folicit a re-admiflion, or a majority 
of the people, difobliged with his giving them up, refufed it. He re- 
tired to a fmall property of his own in the parifli, and on Sabbaths 
preached fometimes at his own fire-fide, and fometimes from a tent in 
the fields, to as many of his friends as would hear him. Five or" fix years 
elapfed before another minifter was elected ; ' during which time Mr 
Thomfon had frequent opportunities of reconciling himfelf to many of 
his former congregation. After Mr Miller was chofen and ordained, Mr 
Thomfon ftill continued to preach in his own barn, or in the fields, 
to as many as were willing to hear him. Inconltancy, which always at- 
tends the multitude, difpofed fome to go one way and fome another; 
directed by humour, local convenience, or by the influence of one upon 
another, they attended fometimes Mr Miller, at other times Mr Thom- 
fon. While they were in this fluctuating ftate, which continued long 
after Mr Thomfon and Mr Miller's death-; Mr Smyton a young Anti- 
burger Minifter, made his appearance amongft them. This clergyman 
by the exercife of popular talents, or by the novelty of his declamations 
againft the real or fuppofed defections of the church, drew crowds 
after him. A congregation was foon formed for him, and a meeting- 
houfe built. He married a daughter of Mr Thomfon's, and by her fuc- 
ceeded to the property of a very good farm which is ftill in the pollefllon 
of his heirs. As nothing that is violent can be of long duration, Co the 
extreme ardour with which this man was followed, gradually abated, 
and he funk at laft into the climate of cool eftimation. A difpute took 
place between htm and his aflbciate brethren about lifting the bread in 
the facranient and holding it during the prayer of conlecration. Mr 
Smyton infifted, that it is of religious obligation to obfervc this mode of 
difpenfing our Lord's Supper, and pofitively enjoined by the words of the 
inftitution itfelf. By Jiis brethren, this action was confidered as uot

binding the confcience, hut that it might, or might not be performed 
without incurring guilt. The argument was keen'y agitated. At length 
it iflued in a rupture. Mr Smyton refufed to hold communion with 
thole who did not punctually conform to his opinion, and the fynod 
paSTed a fentence of expulfion againft him for his obftinacy. He was 
formally depofed, but he defpifed the authority by which this was done, 
and continued to preach. Part of his congregation now feparated from 
him, and part remained It then became a qucftion. who had the right 
to the meeting-houfe Whether thole who remained, 01 thofe who went 
off. The Court of Seffion determined it in favour of Mr Smyion, on this 
principle, that the majority or the Elderfhip, if not of the Congregation, 
remained with him. The fwarm that wtnt off foon found for themfelves 
a new houfe. They are difmiguifhed by the appellation of Lifters and 
Antilifters, or new and old light. Of the former, including young people 
and children, who generally follow their parents, but have made n» 
choice for themfelves, going- fometimes to one, and fomefimes to another 
place of worfhip, the number is 151, of the other 114, of Burghers, 60, 
Relief 7. Would to God, that as much of the po ver as of the form of 
religion were appearing among us I ' But while one iays I am of Paul,

which is from above, and is pure, peceable, gentle, eafy to be entreated, 
full of mercy, and good fruits, is too much overlooked.

THE origin of its riame is uncertain. But it is faid td 
have taken its rife from fome of the Stewart race of 
Scottifh kings having a refidence in it, and the remains of 
thofe houfes are ftill to be feen near the town. — It is above 
10 miles in length; and in fome places about 4 in breadth. 
From many places in this parilh, there are extenfive views 
of the Weftern Ocean, the ifland of Arran, and Craig of 
Ailfa. The appearance of the country is flat : But there 
is a gradual defcent from the head of the parifh to the fea. 
There are no mountains, but fmall hills in different places, 
and fo ne of them are called Law hills, either becaufe that 
in old times courts of juftice were held upon them, or from 
the low or flame raifed on them, as a iignal of the abroach

of an enemy*. The air is rather moift, and in fome feafonr 
of the year there are heavy rains for a continued time, ow- 
ing probably to the nearnefs of the Weftern Ocean, and 
Arran hills. 

Minerals, Agriculture, Soil, Ifc. — There are fome free- 
ftone, and feveral lime quarries. But there is no coal 
wrought in the parifti, which is a great lofs to the inhabi- 
tants, who are at a considerable diftance from it. Several 
attempts have been made for it in diiferent parts of the pa- 
rifti. but they have hitherto proved ineffectual. This parifti 
and neighbourhood isremarkable for large good milk cows, 
of which feveral perfons have from to to 20. They make fine 
fweet milk cheefe, for which there is a great demand, and 
which gives a very high price. A tenant of Sir William 
Cunningham of Livingfton, who was then proprietor of 
Robertland eftate in this parifti, got a premium feveral 
years at Edinburgh for the beft cheefe in Scotland. • This 
eftate is now the property of Sir John Hunter Blair. A- 
bout 30 years ago there were few or no inclofures in the 
parifti, but now it is moftly inclofed and fubdivided, and 
pays from 20 s. to 30s. the acre, and fome of it more, which 
muft make the real rent very great, efpecially as the ground 
is moftly arable. The valued rent is about L. 7000 Scots, 
and I fuppofe the real rent may be about L. 7000 Sterling. 
But as many of the fmall heritors have their farms in their 
own hands, it is difficult, for this and fome other reafons, to 
be exactly afcertained. The foil is various in different parts 
of the parifti. At the head of it, which borders with the 
Mearns moor, it is not fo good, but in the lower part it is 
moftly a ftrong clay foil. There are upwards of 90 ploughs 
employed. The method of improving land here is the

.mentioned in former volumes, and not infilled on here, 
with a view to avoid repetition. There are extenfive belts 
ef plantations in different parts of the parifh. 

Heritors, Town, Schools, Poor, fcrV.— There are 8 larger, 
and above 100 fmalier heritors, who are called portioners, 
and who moftly refide in the parilh. Mr Cunningham of 
Lainlhaw is patron. The roof of the church was taken off 
in 1.772, and the walls heightened ; it is now well feated, and 
holds a great number. The manfe was built fo far back as 
1642, and though it has got fome fmall repairs at different 
times, is ftill in a bad condition. The town of Stewartown 
may vie with any of i s fize in the weft of Scotland, for 
beauty, regularity, and cleannefs. It confifts of one long 
and broad flreet, with a crofs one. It has increafed fome 
hundreds, lince the prefent minifter was fettled, and a great 
number of new houfes have lately been built in it. The 
water of A.nnoch, which takes its rife in the Mearns moor, 
runs paft this town in the form of a femicircle, and empties 
itfelf into the fea a little below Irvine. There are 3 bridges 
over this water, at equal diftances from one another, be- 
tween the head of the town and the foot of it. There are 
2 tolls in the parifh, one on the road to Kilmarnock, the 
other on the road to Irvine, but none on the road to Glaf- 
gow, which was made more than 30 years ago. — There are 
2 fchools in the country part of the parifh, and 3 in the 
town, in fome of which, (befides Englifh), Latin, Greek, 
French, and book-keeping, are taught. The falary of the pa- 
rifh fchoolmafter is only L. 100 Scots, out of which he gives 
20 merks yearly to the 2 country fchools. But it is ex- 
pefted, as the parifh is fo numerous and- wealthy, it will 
,foon be augmented.— The number of weekly penfioners is 
6. l.hey get 1 s. And there are 2c quarterly, who get

according to their neceflities. The yearly colle&amp;ion a- 
mounts to L. 4-. None of the poor in the parifh are allowed 
to be^ out of it. But as the road from Glafgow to Ayr, 
Irvine, &amp;.c. paries through this town, the inhabitants are 
oppreffed with great numbers of ftrolling poor from Glaf- 
gow and the other neighbouring towns. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation then amounted to 2819. There are belonging to 
the Church about 2300 fouls. Befides, there are fome 
Burghers and Antiburgher Seceders, and a few old Came- 
ronians ; but all thefe feels live in good harmony with the 
minifter and people of the Eftablifhed Church. The precife 
number of the whole cannot be exactly afcertained. There 
is 1 furgeon and 1 writer in the town, alfo from 100 to 130 
weavers ; but the chief trade in this place, and has been, it 
js faid, for above 100 years, is bonnet making, which em- 
ploys a great number of hands. They make alfo what are 
called French or Quebec caps. Befides fupplying the coun- 
try and the Highlands with thefe articles, large quantities 
are exported, which turn out to good account ; fo that it is 
faid they draw L. 50 weekly in return. The births, deaths*

general a fober intelligent people, hofpitable to ftrangers, 
and charitable to the poor, of which feveral inftances could 
be mentioned. There have been fome inftances of longe- 
vity in the pari£h. A man died fome years ago, who was 
about 103, a lady above 97, and a worthy heritor and elder 
died lately, who was above 90. This is a poft-town, and has 
been fo for a long time paft. There is a regular arrival and 
difpatch at and from this every day, for all towns in Britain, 
and letters come fafely here, without having any other poft- 
office written on them. — David Dale, Efq; late one of the- 
magiftrates of Glafgow, was born and educated in this place. 
He is well known in the commercial world, for the many ma- 
nufactures he has introduced, and carries on with iuccefs. His

<p>Situation, Extent, Rivers, Minerals &amp;c. 

THE parifh and barony of Avendale is fituated in the 
middle ward of the county of Lanark. It is \% 
miles in length, and from 5 to 6 broad. The face of the 
•country, as the name imports, is open, riling gradually 
from both fides of the Aven, and on the fouth fide termi- 
nating in hills. The foil and climate are various. In the 
hilly part, and towards the W. and N. W. boundaries, the 
fail is generally black, and covered with heath and bent, 
and the climate is very different from what it is on the 
banks of Aven. In the lower grounds, the foil is in many 
places light and gravelly, in fome clay and loam, and in 
others deep mofs, or a wet fpungy fubftance made up of 
different foils. The air, though moift, is not unwholefome, 
She inhabitants being feldom vifited with any epidemical

!rtemper. Great numbers arrive at the age of 80 years 
and upwards. There are at prefent two people above 90. 
The Aven *, which rifes on the confines of the parifhes of 
Sorn and Galfton, runs from S. W. to N. E. the whole 
length of this pariih, dividing it nearly into two equal parts. 
In its courfe, it is augmented firft by a cut from Lochgate, 
which is the boundary between this and the pariih of Gal- 
fton, and afterward by the waters of Givel, Calder, Lock- 
hart, Kype, Pomilion, and a great number of fmaller 
ftreams. There is trout in all thefe ftreams, and a few fat- 
mon in the Aven •, befides an immenfe number of fmali 
fifh, refembling falmon fry, called parrs. There is abun- 
dance of lime in different parts of the parifh, and fome coal # 
but very little freeftone. The coal which has hitherto 
been found is not of the belt quality, but does very well 
for burning lime. There is a miner from the county of 
Durham, juft now employed in finking for coal, about % 
miles from the town of Strathaven. He has found a feam 
between 2 and 3 feet thick, but expects to find a larger, by 
going down a little farther. There are appearances of coal 
elfewhere in the parifh, and fome ironflone. As coal ia 
the only fuel ufed in the lower part of the parifh, and as 
the price of that neceffary article has been doubled in the 
courfe of a few years, it is hoped that no expenfe will be 
fpared in fearching for it, where there is any probability of 
fuccefs. Moft of the coal confumed in the town of Strath-

pronounced Auon, the firft fyllable like the Greek diphthong ou. From, 
the circumftance of its being written with an o, and from fevcral rivers 
in this ifland being called Avon, it is probable that the proper name of 
this parifh is /\vondale, though in old charters it is written either Aven- 
dale or Evandale. The church ftands in the lower end of the parifli, at 
the town of Strathaven, which gives occafion to the parifli being fre- 
quently fo called; but Dale is more defcriptive of the face of the coun, 
try than Strath ; and the former feerns to be the moft ancient name.

aven, is at prefent brought from the parifties of Hamilton 
and Dalferf, at the diftance of 5 and 6 miles. 

Crops, Cattle, ifc. — The crops raifed here are oats, bear, a 
few peafe, confiderable quantities of potatoes, fome rye-grafs, 
and almoft every farmer fows a peck or two of lint-feed 
for houfehold ufes. The low grounds, when ploughed after 
being fufficiently relied, yield good grain, which in an or- 
dinary feafon is cut down fully ripe ; but on the borders of 
the moors, the crops are very precarious, and feldorn ripen. 
In the neighbourhood of the town of Strathaveri, where 
land rents at from 20 s. to 40 s. the acre, the rotation is a 
crop of oats, potatoes, oats, bear with grafs-feeds, and after 
the grafs has been cut for two years, it is paftured till the 
land is again fit for cropping. Potatoes are no where cultiva- 
ted with more care. Almoft every tradefman plants a few 
falls of ground in potatoes, for the ufe of his family. Thefe 
he labours at his leifure hours, from which he derives health 
and amufement, and a wholefome part of food for five or 
iix months in the year, at a very moderate expenfe. But 
this diftric't, excepting a few farms in the lower end of the 
parifh, is better adapted for pafture than tillage ; and the 
tents are moftly made up from the fale of cheefe, butter, 
and veal. The cheefe made here fells at from 6 s. to 7 s. 
the ftone, and calves have fometimes been fold at L. 4 Ster- 
ling ; but the average price is from L. 1 to L. 3. The 
pra&amp;ice of bleeding calves, fo common in England, is hard- 
ly known here. The only arts ufed to make them fatten 
faft, are bringing them on gradually to take a great deal of 
milk, keeping them in a dark place, and amidft plenty of 
dry litter. Unlefs they are fed moderately at firft, they are 
apt to loathe the milk in a ftiort time j and, like moil other 
young animals, they are fportive, and apt to take too much 
exercife, which is beft prevented by flmtting them up from 
the light. A calf of two months old, well fed, often fells 

at 



of Avendale or Strathaven. 385 

at from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3. The demand for veal is fo great, • 
that the farmers never think of rearing more calves than 
what is neceffary to keep up their ftock of cows. The 
number of cows kept is about 18 upon the ploughgate of 
land. They are of fmall fize, but well made, and are 
found to be more hardy, ealier fed, and to yield more milk 
in proportion to their fize than cattle of a larger breed. 
The value of milk is now fo well underftood, that even 
the whey is turned to account by feeding young fwine with 
it. During the fummer months, thefe animals fwell upon 
it amazingly, and by being fed upon potatoes and oats, or 
oat-meal, for a month or fix weeks in harveft, are lit for 
flaughter in the month of November, when they are com- 
monly 8 months old, and weigh from 3 to 9 (tone. This 
cleanly fort of feeding has reconciled the people here to the 
ufe of fwine's flefli, which was once held in abomination.. 
The old Scots plough is the only one in ufe here. It is 
fometimes drawn by 3, but oftener by 4 horfes. The num- 
ber of horfes in the parifli has been gradually diminiflnng 
of late years, owing to there being lefs land in tillage, and 
a great deal of the wet grounds being laboured with the 
fpade. Befides, it is now becoming cuftomary to buy hor- 
fes about the end of January, and to fell them again" about 
the end of May, when the labour is over ; fo that a farmer 
who occupies a ploughgate of land, feldom keeps more 
than two work horfes for 8 months in the year. There 
are a few horfes reared, and the breed is improving. A 
pan- of draught horfes, bred here, was fold a while asp at 
Mo Sterling. Although every farmer has more or In- 
land in tillage, yet the country part of the parilb, i„ an or _

brought from the eaft country in carts, which carry butter, 
cheefe and veal, to the Edinburgh market. The inclofirig 
of the low grounds, which was begun about 30 years ago, 
has banifhed all the fheep, excepting a few pets, entirely 
to the moor farms. The number kept upon thefe is about 
7500, all of the old Scots breed ; and the only improve- 
ment which has hitherto been made in this fort of farming, 
is that of keeping fewer upon the ground. The wool, like 
the pafture, is coarfe, and takes about 8 fleeces to the ftone, 
which fells at from 5 to 6 s. In wet feafons the Iheep are 
very liable to the rot. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls at that time was 3551. Mr Charles Rofs, 
in h;s map of Lanarklhire, publifhed in 1773, makes the 
population of this parifh to be 3770 fouls. But he has 
certainly over-rated it ; for it does not contain that number 
at prefant, though it has been on the increafe fince that pe- 
riod. By an enumeration made in the years 1780 and 
1 781, the population was as follows : 

In the country, 336 families, 1748 perfons; 60 more 
women than men. 

In the town, 439 families, 1444 perfons; 138 more 
women than men. 

In the whole parifh, 775 families, 3192 perfons. 

Population in 1791 and 1792. 

In the country, 315 families, 1733 perfons; only 9 more 
women than men. 

In the town, 469 families, 1610 perfons ; 28 more wo- 
men than men. 

In the whole parifh, 784 families, 3343 perfons. 

The diminution of inhabitants in the country is owing 
to the moor farms having gone into fewer hands, and there 

being

being now almoft no cottagers in the parifh. The propor- 
tion between males and females in the years 1780 and 
178 r, and at prefent, mows the advantages of peace, and 
the flourilhing ftate of our manufactures. At the former 
period, in confequence of the American war, trade was 
dull, and many young men enliited in the army, or left the 
country in queft of employment ; but there is now more 
work at home than hands. The number of births and 
deaths cannot be exactly afcertained, as they are not all re- 
giftered. The births, it is believed, are about 100 annual- 
ly. In the year 1788, more than 40 children died of the 
fmall pox. Inoculation is practifed here, but not general- 
ly, owing to its having proved fatal in one or two inftanccs. 
The average number of marriages for 8 years part, has 
been between 32 and 33. There have been 9 irregular 
marriages during the laft 6 years.. 

Manufa&amp;ures, &amp;c. — The fpinning and manufacturing of 
Dutch flax was once a confiderable article of trade in the 
town of Strathaven, but has been on the decline ever fince 
the introduction of the cotton manufacture. About 15 
years ago, from 12 to 15 hands were conftantly employed 
in drelung flax •, now there are not more than 2 or 3 em- 
ployed in it The principal employment of the women 
then was fpinning, and they were famous for making fine 
yarn. A confiderable part of the yarn was manufactured 
for the behoof ot people in the place, and the remainder was 
carried to the great manufacturing towns. Now the weavers 
are almoft wholly employed by the Glafgow and Paifley 
manufacturers, and cotton yarn is the principal material. 
Great numbers of young women too are employed, by the 
fame people, in flowering muflin. There are upw^i ds of 300 
looms in the town of Strathaven, and about 30 acre in the 
country part of the parifli, and yet it is with great difficulty 

that

that the inhabitants can get their home-fpun yarn manufac- 
tured into cloth. The great wages made by weaving, induces 
many parents to put their boys too early to that bufinefs, 
which flints their growth, occafions fwellings about their 
legs, and hurts their morals, by rendering them too foon in- 
dependent of their parents. The fame temptation is pre- 
fented to the girls by the flowering of muflin, which, by 
confining them too foon to a fedentary life, makes them 
pale and fickly, and is likely to fubjecl: them to nervous 
complaint all their lives. There is a cotton mill erecting 
at the town of Strathaven, which, it is faid, will employ 
from 60 to 70 hands. There are other two in contempla- 
tion. About 30 years ago, there was only 1 baker in the 
town. There are now 3, and all well employed. The 
number of butchers too has been doubled within the fame 
period. There are 22 public houfes in the parifh, 20 of 
which are in the town, and about the fame number of deal- 
ers in tea and tobacco. Some accidents have happened of 
late years, from the retailing of bad whifky. — There are 
commonly 2, fometimes 3 lurgeons in the town, and the 
fame number of writers*. 

Rent, Divijion of Property, ifc. — The valued rent of the 
parifh is L. 7650 Scots, the real rent is about L. 6000 Ster- 
ling, exclufive of the rents of the houfes in the town. Thefc

* Prircs of Labour an l ProvlftoHS. — The price of labour has advan- 
ced almoft a third in the courfe of the laft three or four years. The wa- 
ges of a man-fervant, who lives in the houfe, are from L. 9 to L. 10 a- 
year ; and of a woman-fervant, from L. 3, 10 s. to L. 5. A labourer by 
the day earns 1 s. and his victuals, and in biarVeft, r s. 6. d. or is. 8. d. 
Mafons wages are now a s. and as. 2d. a-day. In the neighbourhood 
of the town there is a good deal of labour in the fields done by the piece, 
efpecially digging. This place being only 16 miles diftant from Glaf- 
gow, and having a number of carriers who go there weekly, the price of 
all kinds ofjprovifions is only a trifle linver than in that market.

let at from 10 s. to L. x 4 a-year. The Duke of Hamilton 
is fuperior of all the lands in the parilh, excepting a very 
fmall portion of temple land, which is held of Lord 1 or- 
phichen The Duke is alfo proprietor of between a third 
and a fourth part of the parifli. The reft is divided a- 
mong a great number of heritors. Thirteen are poffeffed 
of L. 100 Scots, and upwards, of valued rent ; of thefe four 
do not refide in the parifh. There is a confiderable num- 
ber of fmaller heritors, pofTefTed of fmgle farms, or plough- 
gates of land, and a great many portioners. Several good 
houfes have been built by different heritors within thefe 20 
years. The whole parifli is divided into 101 ploughgates. 
Thefe are very unequal, both in value and extent. No he- 
ritor or tenant occupies more arable land than he can labour 
eafily with 1 plough. There is 1 moor farm, or rather a 
or 3 united, which is very extenfive, and rents at L. 130 a- 
year. A few farms are rented at from L. 50 to L. 70, but 
the parifli is generally parcelled into much fmaller farms. 

Ecclefiajlical State, Stipend, lie. — There are 3 houfes for 
public worftiip in the parifli, all of them fituated at the 
town of Strathaven, which is far from being centrical. In 
the year 1772, the parifli-church was removed from a fine 
elevated fituation in the church-yard, and rebuilt in a low 
damp place, contrary to the minds of the great body of the 
people. The veneration which they had for the ancient 
fabric, the place where their fathers had long worfliipped, 
the incommodioufnefs of the new houfe, without feats, and 
the inhabitants of the town being refufed their proper pro- 
portion of it, determined them to fet on foot a fubfeription 
for a chapel of cafe. A decent houfe was accordingly built, 
and conveniently fitted up in 1776. While the houfe was 
building, feveral minifters of the prefbytery of Relief came 
and preached at a tent, with whofe eloquence the people 

were

were fo charmed, that they no longer thought of a chape! 
of eafe, but of a Relief meeting-houfe. Befides this, there 
is an Antiburgher meeting-houfe, which was built about 
the year 1766*. About the one half of the inhabitants of 
the town, and almoft two-thirds of the country part of the 
pariih, ftill adhere to the Eftablifhed Church. The reft 
are either diffenters of different denominations, or make no 
religious profeffion of any kind. The Relief congregation 
is numerous, but it is partly made up from the neighbour- 
ing pariflies of Glasford, Stonehoufe, and Kilbride. The 
Antiburgher congregation is made up in the fame way ; but 
though of longer Handing than the other, is much fmaller. 
There are ftill a few of the old Cameronians in the pariih- 
Inftead of worftiipping in the fields, as formerly, they now 
have a meeting-houfe in the neighbouring parifh of Loudon, 
to which they occafionally refort. The obfervations of a 
worthy clergyman of this church are fully verified here. 
" Divifions which were formed in anger redound to the in- 
creafe of knowlege and forbearance ; time moderates the 
fiercenefs of wrath ; the multitude of feels abates their 
animonty ; principle is refpe&amp;ed, miftakes are pardoned, 
and they are drawn together again by the bonds of hu- 
manity." — The Duke of Hamilton is patron. — The ftipend

* To counteract feceding principles, and to accomodate the remote 
parts of the pariih with a houfe for public worlhip, Mr William Gilmour, 
preacher of the gofpel, who had long been catechift in the pariih, began 
about the year 1777, to build a chapel in a convenient place, between 
four and five miles diftant from the parifh-church. He died about the 
beginning of the year 1780, fhortly after the intended chapel manie, and 
ichoolmalter's houfe were roofed in, leaving his whole eftate, wh ch was 
confiderable, for endowing the chapel, and other pious ufes with in the 
pariih. But his will, or rather wills, (for there were fix of them, and all 
holograph,) were found to be fo perplexed, that the heir at law thought 
fit to feize upon the ettate, and the validity of the wills has never yet been 
brought to a trial. Thus, the good man's purpoles have been defeated, 
by not employing a man of bufinefi to write his will.

Js 6 chalders of vidual, L. 6oo Scots in money, and 90 
merks for communion-elements ; all of which has hitherto 
been paid by one hand. The glebe was originally 4 acres, 
but has been twice cut up with turnipike roads in the courfe 
of the laft 7 years ; ib that it is now rendered of little va- 
lue to poffefs, but might be turned to account by feuing it 
for houfe fteadin gs and gardens. The manfe is large and 
commodious, but having been ill built at firft, is frequently 
Handing in need of repairs. Befides the minifter, there is a 
catechifl or alMant preacher, who enjoys a benefice of 5C0 
merks a-year, mortified by Ann Duchefs of Hamilton in 
1 710. The late Mr William Gilmour, above mentioned, 
left money for raifmg it to L. 40 Sterling ; but, like his 
other benefa&amp;ions, it has not yet taken efFe£t. 

Schools, Poor, 13 c. — The parilh fchoolmafler has a falary 
of 2co merks, a fchool-room, a dwelling-houfe, and a fmall 
garden. He teaches Englifti, Latin, Greek, arithmetic, 
and writing. The wages are, for Englifh 1 s. 2 d. a-quarter, 
and for the other branches of education, 1 s. 8 d. The 
average number of fcholars for the whole year is 60. 
There is a private fchool in the town equally numerous. 
The parilh fchoolmafler is commonly precentor, feffion- 
clerk, and clerk to the parilh meetings. There are always 
2, fometimes 3 fchools in remote parts of the parilh. — Moll 
of the poverty to be found here may be traced to the ufe 
of tea, tobacco, and whilky. Thefe luxuries are not only 
too expenfive for people in narrow circumftances, but the 
conftant ufe of them begets habits very unfavourable to 
health and induftry. In this part of the country, the price 
of labour always bear fuch a proportion to the neceffaries of 
life, as that the fober and indullrious may not only earn 
prefent fubfiftence, but may lay up fomething againft the 
evil day. There are fome indeed born in poverty, with 
fuch weak and fickly conftitutions as to be unable to work,

and others, whom age, or difeafe, or calamity, has reduced 
to want ; thefe no doubt are peculiarly entitled to relief. 
But the provifion for luch as become poor through Moth, or 
drunkennefs or fenfuality, or vain expenfe, ought to be very 
fcanty. The average number of poor upon the pariih roll, 
for the laft 10 years, has been from 50 to 60. The funds 
for their fupport, are the interett of L. 500 Sterling of flock, 
at 4v per cent, the mortcloth money, which ufually amounts 
to about L. 14 a-year, a fmall fum ariling from the pro- 
clamation of marriages, and ringing of the church bell at 
funerals, and an affeilment upon the parifh. The heritors 
and kirk-feffion meet half-yearly, at Candlemas and Lam- 
mas, and proportion the affeiTment. It is laid the one half 
upon the heritors, according to their valued rent, 2nd the 
other half upon houfeholders, according to their fuppofed 
circumflances. For fome years paft it has amounted to 
L. 100 Sterling a-year. The penfioners are paid monthly 
by the collector, who has a fmall falary for his trouble *.

and they are fold after their death. — The collections made in the parifli 
church are allowed for exigencies. — There are two fmall mortifications 
for paying fchool-wages, and ptirchafing Bibles and catcchifms, for the

which there are four in the town,) have each of them a box as it is called, 
out of which they make diflribtttions among their indigent and dillreflld

Strarhaven was once a confiderable thoroughfare. But 
owing to the injudicious manner in which the road from 
Hamilton has been conducted, it is now almoft deferted, and 
the toll levied upon it is fcarcelj fufficient to keep it in re- 
pair. The rage for ilraight lines which prevailed about 30 
years ago, made the truftees carry it over all the heights, 
though it might have been (hortened confiderably by car- 
rying it in a more level direction. A new turnpike road 
between Glafgow and Dumfries, by Muirkirk and San- 
quhar, which was begun in 1 790, and is now almoft com- 
pleted, like wife pafles through this parifh, and crofTes the 
other at the town of Strathaven. But this road does ftill 
lefs credit to the conductors of it than the former. A rage 
for crooked lines, for carrying it through fwamps and 
morafles, for cutting down heights, and making mound 
bridges acrofs vallies, has made them almoft uniformly de- 
viate from the fhorteft and moft ltvel line of direction be- 
tween the points fpecified in the act of Parliament. Thefe 
follies muft be attended with very ferious confequences to 
travellers, if ever this road comes to be much frequented. 
By ftraying off the metalled part of the road in a dark 
night, or when the ground happens to be covered with 
mow, a rider may lofe his horfe in a fwamp ; and the 
mound bridges are no lefs dangerous, if not ftrongly railed 
in. It was impoflible, indeed, to avoid fwampy ground be- 
tween this parifh and Muirkirk ; but to go round in queft 
of a morafs between Glafgow and Strathaven is altogether 
unaccountable. In confequence of deviating fo much from 
the proper line of direction, this road has coft three times 
the fum at which it was eftimated, when application was 
made for the aft of Parliament to carry it into execution : 
And only a f ew miles of it were made, when the truftees 
were under the neceflity of applying for another act to en- 
able them to borrow more money, and impofe heavier toll-

chaife 3 s. % d. a heavier duty than is paid in any part of 
Scotland, for travelling the fame length of road * There are 
three bridges over the Avon in this parifli. The firft was 
built by Ann Duchefs of Hamilton about the beginning of 
this century, and is now on the line of the Muirkirk. road. 
The other two have been built fince, partly by the county, 
and partly by the parifli. The ftatute labour is commuted 
at the rate of 12 s. upon the plough gate of land, and from 
I s. to 2 s. upon houfeholders. This fund will foon put the 
parifli roads, and the bridges over the fmaller ftreams, in 
excellent repair, as materials are every where eafy to be 
found.

* To remedy fuch abufes, no road-bill ought to be allowed to be 
brought into Parliament till it has been printed and circulated, for fix 
months at leaft, in the county or counties through which the propofed 
road is to pafs, — Purveyors invited by advertifement in the newfpapers, 
to afcertain by menfuration the fhortefl and molt level line between the 
points fixed upon in the bill, — and contractors to give in eftimates, ac- 
cording to which they are ready to undertake the making of the road. 
Had thefe regulations been adopted long ago, a deal of private jobbing 
had been prevented, in this neighbourhood at leaft, much money laved 
to the public, and individuals fecured againft having their properties cut 
up more than once on account of the fame road. But it is hoped, that 
Government will foon take the management of the turnpikes into their 
hands. They would produce a great revenue; and by employing the 
military upon the roads in time of peace, the price of labour would be 
kept moderate, the rapid rife of which, in this part of the country, is en- 
tirely owing to the making of roads. The foldiery too, by fuch labori- 
ous employment, would become more hardy ar.d lefs debauched, and 
confequently lefs hurtful to the morals of their fellow citizens.

bf the Avon. On the fame fide of the river, there are 3 
chapels named after different faints, which were probably 
places of worlhip, where the clergy belonging to the neigh- 
bouring abbey of Lefmahagoe, officiated at times for the 
benefit of the people, before this diftrift was ere&amp;ed into 
a pariih. An honed man, who happened to dig up fome 
human bones near one of thefe chapels a while ago, remark- 
ed, that the people in old times had been much about the 
fame fize as at prefent. — The town of Strathaven was e- 
recled into a burgh of barony in the year 145c, with the 
ufiial privileges, and had an extenlive commonty; all of 
which has long ago become private property. It has a 
weekly market, and a number of annual fairs ; but having 
no public funds, has no other magiftracy than a baron bailie 
appointed by the Duke of Hamilton. This parifh was 
anciently a part of the eftate of Douglas, which being for- 
feited in the reign of James I. continued in the hands of 
the Crown till the year 1456, when it was erefted into a 
barony in favour of Andrew Stuart, grandfon of Murdoch 
Duke of Albany, who was at that time created Lord 
Avendale, and made warden of the eaft marches to- 
wards England. He built the caftle of Avendale ; 
and upon the accemon of James 111. was made Chan- 
cellor of Scotland. Andrew fecond Lord Avendale, ha- 
ving a feud with fome of the neighbouring barons, and 
wifhing to live at a diltance from them, exchanged the ba- 
rony of Avendale with Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, 
for the barony of Ochiltree in Ayrfhire, in the year 1534, 
which is ratified by an act of Parliament in 1543 ; and 
Andrew Stuart allowed the flyle of Ochiltree, with the 
precedency of Avendale. It would appear, that Lord 
Caftleftuart, of the kingdom of Ireland, confiders himfelf 
the reprefentative of this family, as he is now claiming the 
title of Lord Ochiltree. By the imprudence of Sir James 
Hamilton, the barony of Avendale foon came into '.he 
hands of hia brother, the Earl of Arran, and has continued

in the family of Hamilton ever fince. The caflle of Aven- 
dale lhmds upon a rocky eminence at the town of Strath- 
aven, near a fmall water called Pomilion, which falls into 
the A von ahout a mile below. It was furrounded by a 
ltrong wall, with turrets at certain diftances, and the en- 
trance was fecuted by a draw-bridge t This, and the caftle 
of Arrm, were alternately the refidence of Ann Duchefs 
of Hamilton, during the uiurpation of Oliver Cromwell. 
This worthy Lady always remembered the attachment 
fhown by her tenants and vaffals in the days of her adver- 
lity, and paid an annual vifit to this place at the celebration 
of the Lord's Supper, till flie was prevented by the infir- 
mities of old age. She died in the year 1716, after which 
the caftle of Avendale was no longer kept in repair. — The 
names of fome places, fuch as Kirk wood, Hawkwood, feem to 
indicate, that this diftricf was once adorned with woods ; of 
"which there are no longer any veftiges, but what are com- 
mon every where, large trunks of oak and birch buried in 
deep moraffes. The names of places are all Englifli, with 
a very few exceptions, fuch as Kype, Carnduff, Drumclog. 
This laft place is famous for a rencounter between the Cove- 
nanters and a party of dragoons, in which the latter were de- 
feated. On Sunday the iff of June 1 679, the Covenanters had 
afTembled for divine fervice at Drumclog, to the number of 
about 300 armed men. That they might not be furprifed 
by a hidden attack, they had placed a watch on Loudon- 
hill, a remarkable eminence about a mile diftant, com- 
manding a view of the whole country. Captain Graham*

prized of the meeting, marched, the morning of the fame 
day, from Hamilton with his cavalry. They were fpied 
by the watch Ihortly after they paiTed Strathaven *, who 
ran and informed their brethren of the approach of the e- 
nemy. After prayer, by their minifter Mr William Ha- 
milton, who a&amp;ed likewife as commanding officer, they 
drew up in order, took their ftation, and gave the foldiers 
a reception very different from what they expedled. 
Thirty of them were killed : Captain Graham had his 
horfe fhot under him, and made a very narrow efcape. 
The Covenanters loft only a few men. Their horfes were 
a great incumbrance to the dragoons, the place of adlion 
being almoft .furrounded with fwampy ground. Had the 
Covenanters purfued their advantage, it is believed that 
they might have cut the whole party to pieces. The fuc- 
cefs of the Covenanters, on this occalion, encouraged them to 
mufter an army of 8oco men, about three weeks afterward, 
at Bothwell bridge, and difpute that paffage with the King's 
forces, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth. Here, 
however, they were defeated with great {laughter, and 
1200 of them taken prifoners. After the battle, the Duke 
marched his army into this parifli, with the view, as was 
apprehended, of revenging the affair of Drumclog. But 
after remaining for a few days, during which the cavalry 
ate up rooft of the grain in the country, the army retired 
without doing any mifchief. The men were under good 
difcipline, and the Duke behaved, in every refpedt, with a 
generofity becoming his high rank.

lent grazing country. Mod of the low grounds have in- 
deed been inclofed with hedge and ditch, but there are 
very few fences in the parifh. The grafly foil is inimical 
to young thorns, and few people can be at the pains to 
weed them often enough. Perhaps it would be better to 
plant hedges of beech or laryx. Till the lands are inclo- 
fed with fufficient fences, the farmers cannot well turn 
their attention to green crops, a thing much to be wifhed. 
For want of thefe, their cattle are fed on oat ftraw and 
coarfe hay for almoft fix months in the year. The confe- 
quence is, that they are quite dried up and emaciated be- 
fore they get upon the grafs in the month of May ; and 
every body knows that cattle mult be in good plight, be- 
fore they can yield milk either of good quality, or in any 
confiderable quantity. Shelter is alfo much wanted here. 
The Duke of Hamilton's eftate in the parifh confifts of 
upwards of 11,400 acres : Were two or three hundred of 
thefe laid out in belts of plantation, as has been done in the 
parifh of Hamilton, it would both beautify the fcenery 
and mend the climate. The fmall plantations which have 
been made by fome refiding heritors, and the few trees 
which are about almoft every farm-houfe, fhow that planta- 
tions will thrive here. Confiderable improvements have 
been made of late years, by draining the wet grounds, and 
fowing them with Polilh oats. A deep morafs in the 
neighbourhood of Strathaven, which was not worth a {hil- 
ling the acre, has thus been brought to let at a guinea. 
The grievance which the farmers here moft complain of 
is the tax upon faddle-horfes Few of them can afford to 
keep a horfe for the purpofe of riding ; yet if they mount 
a labouring horfe 611 Sunday to go to church, they are 
charged. The rigorous execution of this aft has done 
more towards fouring their minds againft Government, 
than all the feditious pamphlets that have been publi (lied.

PARISH of <name ref="NA">MARYTON</name>, 

(County of Forfar, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Brechin.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Wilson.</head> 



<p>Boundaries, EJlates, Extent, Air, ifc. 

THIS parifh is bounded on the N. by the river of 
Southefk and the bafon or back fands of Montrofe ; 
on the S. by the fea and the parifh of Lunan. There are 
only now two eftates here, Old Montrofe and Dyfart. 
Old Montroje was the property of the great family of 
Montrofe, till the reign of Charles II. We then find it in 
the pofTeffion of the famous Earl of Middlcton. Since that 
time it has paffed through the hands of a great many, and 
is now the property of Sir David Carnegie, Baronet, of 
Southefk. From its name, one might be apt to imagine, 
that there had been a town here before the prefent tovn of 
Montrofe was built ; but of this there remains no tradition. 
Bonnyton, which is now joined to Old Motitrple, was 
the feat of the family of Wood. It is only within thefe

few years paft that the remains of the old caftle fell down. 
It had been regularly fortified, with a complete ditch a- 
round it, which ftill remains entire. Dyfart belongs to 
Thomas Carnegie, Efq; of Craigo, and was purchafed not 
many years ago by his family. None of the heritors re- 
fide. — This parifh contains altogether from 2500 to 3000 
acres of land. The valued rent is L. 3000 Scots, and the 
real rent about L. 1700 or L. 1800 Sterling. The lands 
in general are not high rented- In the greateft part of this 
parifh the lands lie very low, almofi on a level with the 
fea ; this, together with the fogs that rife from the bafon of 
Montrofe, makes the air damp. This parifh often, efpe- 
cially in the fpring months, when the eafterly winds pre- 
vail is involved in a cloud, when it is bright fun-fhine a 
mile or two to the weftward. Agues were very common 
here before the low grounds were drained ; out fince that 
event took place, the people are in general healthy, and 
many of them live to a good old age. It were to be wifh- 
ed that the lower claries could be prevailed upon to inocu- 
late their children for the fm all- pox ; but no arguments 
will perfuade them to lay afide their abfurd prejudices. If 
this mode were adopted, the lives of manj children might 
be faved to the community. 

Populatiori, l#c. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls was ihen 633. This parifh is not very 
populous, their being no villages in it, nor manufactures of 
any kind. The whole parifh is divided into large farms ; 
and thefe requiring only a ftated number of people for their 
cultivation, any increafe that may arife muft go to other 
places for employment. Being fo near the port of Mon- 
trofe, a great many of the young men go to fea. There 
are no records of the number of inhabitants before the pre- 
sent incumbent was fettled in 1778. In 1779, the number

The increafe fince 1786 is 20; and the caufe of it is, 
■ibme of the principal tenants having fubfet part of their 
lands. The average of the number of baptifms, as nearly 
as can be afcertained for 14 years paft, is annually 18 ; 
marriages 5 ; and burials 12 ; but it is to be obferved, that 
* the regifler of baptifms, burials and marriages, is not fo re- 
gularly kept as formerly, owing to the tax upon the regi- 
ftration, trifling as it is. The common people, not being 
compelled to pay it, rather choofe to fave 3 d. than to 
have either a baptifm, burial or marriage, inlerted in the 
regifter. 

Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c. — The foil in this parifh is various, 
according to the fituation. Upon the low grounds of Old 
Montrofe it is a ftrong deep clay, commonly called in 
Scotland Carfe land, admirably adapted for wheat. There 
-is a fmall ridge of hills that runs through the parilh from

E. to W. and divides Old Montrofe from Dyfart. Tha 
foil upon thefe rifing grounds is in general a very fine loam, 
which bears excellent crops of barley, turnips and grafs. 
Upon the lands of Dyfart, as they lie higher, the foil is of 
a lighter quality than Old Montrofe. — Thib parifh is in a 
pretty high Mate of cultivation , and would have been much 
more fo, were it not for the pernicious effects of long leafes 
and low rents, leafes let many years ago, and many years 
of them dill to run. Impi ovement of land on a large fcale, 
and to extent, did not take place in this part of the 
country till of late jears, when the old leafes were at an 
end, and the rents were railed. Farmers, like men of o- 
ther profeflions, mufl be I purred on to induftry by neceffi- 
ty. Thofe who pofTeffed the old leafes found that they 
could live as their fathers had done before them, and were 
fatisfied with the day of fmall things. If they got a live- 
lihood with eafe, they were not anxious for wealth, when 
accompanied with exertion. It would be injustice, howe- 
ver, not to acknowledge, that fome of the tenants who pof- 
fefs the old leafes are now beginning to go on with fpirit 
and induftry : but that was not the cafe, till they were 
Ihown a good example ; and perhaps, but from neceflity, 
that example would never have been mown them. There 
is much fine land in this parifh let at 10 s. the acre, and 
even under that ; and yet the tenants are not more wealthy 
than their neighbours, who pay 30 s. the acre for land of 
no better quality. What can be the reafon ot this, but 
that the former are not fo induftrious as the latter, owing 
to lono- leafes and low rents. Great as the improvements 
are, which have been made in this part of Scotland, within 
thefe few years paft, yet the land is by no means ar- 
rived at that value to which it is capable of being raifed. 

Ther.? ;ire two modes followed in cropping the ftrong 

clay land in this pariirt. The one is firfl a fallow, with 50

tolls of lime {hells to the acre, and well dunged the land 
is then fown with wheat. The next crop is peafe or 
beans; after that barley and grafs feeds, generally red clo- 
ver ; i year in grafs, which is cut and given to the horfes 
in the houfe. After the grafs, oats ; then a fallow again, 
and fo on. The other mode is firft a fallow, then wheat ; 
peafe or beans after the wheat ; then barley ; then oats. 
After the oacs, a fallow, and fo on. There are likewife 
two modes followed in cropping the lighter foils. One is, 
the . land is made free of weeds, and the foil reduced ; it 
is then limed and dunged, and fown with turnips in the 
drill ; after the turnips, bailey and grafs feeds ; two years 
in grafs, the firft cut for hay, the fecond for pafture ; then 
a crop of oats ; after this turnips, &amp;c. according 10 the a- 
bove rotation. The other mode is, the land having been 
4 or 5 years in grafs is limed, and broken up for oats ; af fer- 
tile oats barley, then a green crop ; after that barley and 
grafs-feeds, when it is laid down for pafture, and remains 
in that ftate 4. or 5 years. The average returns of an acre 
are, wheat 10 bolls, barley 8 bolls, oats 8, beans from 8 to 
14, peafe from 4 to 10. The grain in general is of a very 
fine quality. An acre of turnips is worth from L. 4 to 
L. 5 Sterling. A good deal of flax was formerly railed in 
this parifh, but that practice is now much given up, it ha- 
ving been found by experience not to be profitable. The 
hufbandryis almoft all carried on by horfes, there not being 
above one oxen plough in the parifh. Ploughs, with 2 
itrong horfes in each, are univerfally ufed. The tenants 
breed a good many of their horfes themfelves. The farm- 
ers, upon the lighter foils, likewife rear a number of black 
cattle-, but the ftrong land not being well adapted for paf- 
ture, the tenants keep but few cattle through the fummer. 
In order to confume the ftraw, and make dung for the 
farm, they either purchafe cattle in the autumn and fet

them off in the fpring, or take into their ftraw yards car 
tie from the graziers, who paj fo much a-head for them, 
according to their fiz.e *. 

Advantages. — This parifh derives much advantage from 
its vicinity to the town of Montrofe, where the farmer has 
always a ready market for every thing that he can raife, 
and where in return he can purch-.ife whatever he wants 
for the ufe of his farm or his family. Another very 
great advantage is the open navigation from Montrofe to 
Old Montrofe, where coals are landed for fuel to the inha- 
bitants, and likewife great quantities of lime both from 
• Sunderland and Lord Elgin's lime-works, for manure. 
Veffels of 50 or 60 tons burden can, at ftream tides, land 
with eafe at the harbour of Old Montrofe. A canal has 
been projected, and perhaps one day will be carried from 
thence to Brechin. This would complete the navigation 
between Brechin and Montrofe, and would of courfe not 

only 

* Price of Labour. — The price of labour is very high. The wages 
of a common ploughman are from L. 8 to L.io Sterling a-year; a fer- 
vant maid from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3. A ftout man will get from L. 1, Ios. 
to L. a for the harveft ; a woman from L. 1 to L. I, 5 s. The wages of 
a common labourer are 1 s. a-day. Yet notwithftanding the high price of 
labour, the common people are not richer than formerly : Although their 
revenue be greater, they add nothing to their capital, feldom think of 
faving any thing to fupport them in their old age. All is fpent upon the 
back and the belly ; they eat and drink better, and are better cloathed. The 
ploughman now defpifes the home-made fuit »f blue or grey, and all of 
the fame piece : He comes to church on Sunday drefled in a coat of Eng- 
lifli cloath, a fancy veft, corduroy breeches, white thread ftockings, plated- 
buckles, &amp;c. All of them wear hats ; not a Scotch bonnet is to be feen. 
The drefs of the women is as much changed as that of the men. The 
country Lafs makes her appearance at church, or a wedding, drefled in the 
manufactures of VTancJiefter, Glafjrow, and Paifley. Thus the improve- 
ment of the la id is the enrichment of the kingdoms and the fail could not!

wife to all the adjacent country *. 

Maryton-Law.— Maryton-Law is a fmall eminence fi- 
tuated upon a rock upon the top of one of the hills for- 
merly mentioned. It is evidently artificial, and probably 
in former times has been either an. alarm port, as it com- 
mands a great extent of country, or a place where the 
great family of Montrofe dfflributed juftice to their, vaflals. 
From the top of it is one of the mod beautiful profpefts in 
Scotland. To the north, (clofe under the eye), is the rich 
and fertile country extending from Brechin to Montrofe, on 
both fides of the river SoutrieJk, where are interfperfed a num- 
ber of elegant gentlerriens feats ; a fine view of both towns, 
with the bafon and harbour of Montrofe, and in the back 
ground are the Grampian hills. To the eaft is the well cul- 
tivated parifli of Craig, with a great expanfe of the Ger-

* Vijheriet. — In the river Southefk, which is the northern boundary of 
this parifli, there is great plenty of filh, falmon, grilfe, fea-trout, finnocks, 
and a variety of river-trout, in the month of May, a prodigious quantity 
of beautiful clear fmall trouts, called fmouts, make their appearance. 
They are evidently the falmon-fry that were fpawned in the autumn be- 
fore, and are then going down the river to the fea, where they arrive at 
maturity, A \'aft variety of aquatic birds frequent the bafon, or, as it is 
commonly called, the back fands of Montrofe, efpecialhy in the winter 
feafon ; fuch as wild geefe, ducks of various forts, and in amazing num- 
bers ; a Variety of gulls, cormorants, fea-magpies, golden-eyes, curlieus, he- 
rons, &amp;c. &amp;c The wild geefe arrive in great flocks about the end of 
October, and generally remain till March. They frequent the fields in 
the low grounds through the day, where they feed upon the wheat-ftub- 
ble in autumn, and the green wheat in winter : They always return to 
the bafon at night. The ducks, on the contrary, remain in the bafon 
through the day ; but when the night falls, they g6 to the land, and feed 
upon the barley-ftubble fields. Both the geefe and ducks are very fine 
birds for eating. In fevere ftorms, of long continuance, there are likewife 
fome fwans in the bafon, but they do not remain long. There are great 
plenty of partridges in this parifli, and fome quails, but they are rare : ' 
Hares are fcarce, there being little cover.

Arbroath, and the proipecT: is terminated by the frith of 
Forth, and the coaft of Lothian. 

Stipend, School^ Poor, &amp;.c. — The manfe was built 4 years 
ago, and is one of the beft finifhed in the county. The 
ftipend is 76 bolls of meal, 45 bolls of barley, and L. 19 
Sterling in money. The glebe confifts of about 6 acres of 
very good land. The King is patron. — The fchoolmafter'u 
falary is about L. 5 Sterling a year ; and as the parifh is 
fmall, his perquifites are not confiderable. A new church 
was built lafl year, which is both elegant and commodious, 
and to the praife of the heritors be it fpoken, not a farthing 
demanded for feat-rents ; a practife by no means common in 
Scotland, but highly worthy of imitation. — The poor are 
maintained from the intereir. of a fund of about Li 50c Sterh 
and the weekly collections, which are very trifling, owing 
to the greatnefs of the poors funds, the people not being 
very apt to give, when they know that there is little oc- 
cafion tor their charity. Thefe great fund3 are a lofs to a- 
ny parifh. They are the caufe of a number of poor co- 
ming into it, when the know that they will be maintain- 
ed. They tend to make the lower claffes greedy and la- 
zy, and to live beyond their incomes, and very carelefs a- 
bout faving any thing to provide for a family, or to fup- 
port them in old age. They likewife put a flop to that 
charity among the common people, which is the bond of 
aif-ction between man and man, and which tends more 
than any thing elfe to humanize the mind. 

Manners.— The people of this parifh, except 5 or 6 in- 
dividuals, are all of the Oabliftted religion, and very regu- 
lar in their attendance on public woriliip. They are quiet 
and inoffenfive, and mind their own buiiaefs ; and as there 
is but one alehoufe in the parifh, they are in general fober, 
not being much led into temptation.

<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, &amp;.c. 

UNDER this title are comprehended two parifhes, 
Kirknewton and Eaft Calder, now within the bounds 
of the prefbytery of Edinburgh, though formerly the latter 
belonged to the prefbytery of Linlithgow, and was an- 
ciently called Calder Cleir * and Calder Clericus. The

* The Earl of Morton takes his title of dignity from the lands of 
Mortoune, lying in this parifli. and belonging to his Lordfhip, as appears 
from the minutes of the Scotch Parliament 14th March 1457 — 8, and 
from an inftrument there referred to, in which are thefe words : Tunc 
vero dictus Dominus Cancellarius. (Epifcopus Brechen), declaravit dic- 
tum Dominum de Dalkeith, non intitulari debere in diclo comitatu pro 
terris de Mortoune, in dominio de Niddifdalc exiftent ; fed pro terris dc

then eredled in a new and centrical fituation. Calder, ac- 
cording to one etymology, feems to lignify water and wood, 
from coille, " wood," and dor, " water." The name Kirk- 
newton appears to be derived from a village fo cahe near 
the old -church, and about a quarter of a mile from the new 
one. The pariiri is about 4 miles broad, and 6 long from 
N. to S. On the N. it is bounded by the river Amond, 
which falls into the frith of Forth at Cramond ; and on the 
S. it is warned by the water of Leith, which difcharges it- 
felf into the fea at Leith. There is plenty of lime here of 
excellent quality, in different parts .of the parifh, which 
is carried to many miles diflance all around. Several 
country gentlemen have lately formed an affociation, and 
opened a fubfeription, in order to explore the ground in 
£his and fome neighbouring parilhes, in fearch of coal. 
This fearch is now making on the lands of Leith -head here, 
"belonging to Mr Swanfon. If this laudable and patriotic 
purpofe fucceed, it will prove a great benefit to this part 
of the country. But as good coal is at a confiderable di- 
Hance, it is hoped this difadvantage may be remedied in 
another way, as a canal is now projected and intended to 
pafs through this parilh between Edinburgh and Glafgow, 
which will provide thefe cities, and all the adjacent coun- 
try with plenty of coal, limeflone, iron, &amp;c. of the befl 
quality. An excellent coal, which is molt general.y ufed 
here, is brought from Benhaar, on the Glafgow road, 15 
miles diitant. Coal of an inferior quality is to be got in 
great plenty at the mines of Blackburn, Bathgate, and 0- 
ther places, at the diftance only of 5,' 6, and 7 miles to the 
S. and VV. The pi ice paid at the mine for coal is gene-

is level and fertile towards the N. on the S. it is hilly, but 
not rocky or fteeply mountainous. 

Agriculture. — The green hills afford good fheep pafture, 
and in feveral places might yield excellent green crops of 
potatoes, turnip, &amp;c. if properly cultivated for this pur- 
pofe. Thefe crops begin now to be more generally raifed 
than formerly, and the farmers to be better reconciled to 
them, though fome of the lower claHes and more ignorant 
are Lt 111 averfe to thefe valuable improvements, being wed" 
ded to their old abfurd and unfkilful practices. But the 
frequent failures and loiTes that attend new fchemes at-' 
tempted by more fpeculative and opulent farmers, to them 
appear fufficient reafon for not too rafhly changing the 
plans and practices of their forefathers, and giving up a 
iure, though moderate profit, for the uncertain- hopes of un T 
experienced theorifls. The culture of field-turnip and 
cabbage is but lately introduced here ; and the Earl of 
Morton, who of 63 ploughgates in the parifh poffeffes 28, 
feems at prefertt very anxious to promote and encourage 
this plan of agriculture among his tenants. The rent of 
land, exclufive of the pooreft outfield, is from 10 s. to 
L. 2 an acre. The Englifh plough, with 2 horfes, is mofl 
generally ufed, though fome farmers ft ill prefer the old 
Scotch plough, with 4 horfes and a driver. Of late the 
rent of land is greatly increafed. Farms that about 20 
years ago let at 10 s. an acre, are now more than 20 ; and 
thofe which even 6 years ago paid L. 20 of rent, now let 
at L. 30. But the plan of hufbandry is much better now 
than formerly, and the land hence greatly improved in va- 
lue. The real rent of tile parifii within thefe few years, has 
confequently been raifed feveral hundred pounds. It can- 
not at prefent, for particular reafons, be exactly afcertain- 
ed. The rotation of crops is variable according to the va-

nous foils. The mod common, in the richer grounds, jr 
furamer-faliow, wheat, peafe, beans, barley, oats. Of late 
it has been found, that both wheat and barley have fuc- 
ceeded as well, this after turnip, and that after cabbage, as 
after a fummer- fallow, when the ground is properly dref- 
fed. Rye-grafs and clover are fown with wheat, oats, flax, 
but moft commonly with barley. Wheat has lately been 
introduced into the moors with promifing fuccefs, where it 
never was feen or attempted before. A great deal of milk, 
butter, cheefe, eggs, poultry, veal, is daily exported and 
fold in the Edinburgh market. The real produce of the 
parifh cannot be afcertained, as there is a great importation 
as well as exportation, chiefly to and from Edinburgh, of 
which no diftindY account has ever been kept *.

* "Labour and Wages. — The want of cottagers and day-labourers is of- 
ten fmartly felt by the farmer, especially in harveft; and if their place 
were not fupplied hv the Highlanders, upon whom they fo much depend 
for cutting down their crops, they would be reduced to the ufe of the 
fey the, or fome fuch more evpeditious method than that of the fickle. 
The firft threfhing machine in this parifh was eredled by Mr Waugh of 
Eafter Newton. The ufe of thefe has lately become general in this coun- 
try. The common wages of a day-labourer, for a man, are from I s. to 
I s. 2 d. in fummer, and tod. in winter a -day ; for a woman, 6 d. ; for 
an hired man-fervant, from L 6 to L. io a-year, with a pair of (hoes, and 
a cart of coals, in the half year. If he live in his own houfe, he has 6L 
bolls of meal, befides L. I, 6 s. for what is called kitchen-money. 
(This is an allowance of money, at the rate of 6 d. a-week, in place of 
milk, butter, beer, : JV.) He has alfo fometimes a cow's grafs, with as 
much ground as may fow a firlot of barley. The wages of a maid-fer- 
vant are generally L. 3 a-ycar. Mafons and bricklayers receive from 
is. 8 d. to 2 s. a day ; flaters, 2 s. 6 d. ; tailors, 8 d. with victuals A- 
bout 50 years ago butter fold at 4 d. a-pound , a good lamb at 3 s. ; beef

thefe articles arc now more than doubled in price. The people, however, 
in general, enjoy a competent fliare of the comforts of life and every man 
who is able to work, and who is induftriuus, may decently maintain him- 
felf and a fami y. In the year 1*82 much diitrefs would have enfueft

ufual occupation in the fields, and retained the full pofi'ef- 
fion of his mental faculties till a few days before his death. 
The difeafes chiefly prevalent are the rheumatifm and fe- 
vers, occafioned by the poorer people living in cold damp 
houfes, and refting after labour in wet clothes. People of 
better ftation are not fo much liable to thefe ditlempers. 
When thefe fevers once begin, they often fpread far and 
wide, as the people, from miftaken notions of fympathy 
and charity, crowd the houfe, and even the bed- room of 
the fick, which is kept as clofe often as pollible. Thefe 
catch and fpread the infection, thinking that they do no- 
thing amifs, and that no harm will befal them but by the 
fpecial decree and interpofition of Heaven. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfler, the population 
in 1755 was 1157.

The caufe of depopulation here is chiefly owing to the 
near attraction of Edinburgh, to a monopoly of farms, and 
the ufe of two-horfe ploughs, (by which means the farmer 
-works with about half the number of fervants he former, 
ly employed), and the laying down fo much ground in 
grafs for hay, which, when the foil anfwers, is judged one 
of the moft profitable crops. One caufe of the uncommon 
number of fectaries is, that a Burgher meeting-houfe was 
feveral years ago erected in the parilh, and another of the 
Antiburgher kind on the borders of it, which at their hrft 
erection were much crowded; but which, however, have 
not gained feven profelytes from the pariih church for the 
latt 7 years •, they rather feem to be on the decline. Thefe 
eftabli!hments mult be a heavy burden upon poor people ; 
Dut they are productive of worfe confequences, in directly 
counteracting the defign of Chriliianity, which is to make 
men live together as brethren ; and in fupporting fuper- 
ftition and fanaticifm, which are miftaken by many for 
religion, and maintained with a violence and flaming zeal 
proportioned to the ignorance of their deluded t vota- 
ries. 

Stipend, School, Poor. — The ftipend confifls of 105 bolls 
of victual, one half meal, and the other barley, with L. 48 
Sterling of money, betides a glebe of 7 acres good arable 
land, which has been iuclofed by the prefent incumbent. 
The Duke ot Buccleugh and the Earl of Morton, formerly 
the ftparate patrons of Eaft Calder and Kirknewton, are 
now vice- patrons of the parilh. — The fchool falary is L. 12 
Sterling a- year, with L. 2 belonging to the feflion-clerk- 
fliip, together with the common perquilites of baptifms 
and marriages. The number of fcholars is between 40 
and 50. The children of poor parents are educated at the 
public expeni'c. borne years ago, the fchoolmaftcr being,

through age and infirmity, unable to officiate, the heritor? 
contributed L. 9 Sterling a-year, with fome other perqui- 
fites, for his maintenance during life, and appointed another 
fchoolmalter. — The number of poor that regularly receive 
panlh charity is 12, and their proportion is from 2 s. to 
4 s. a- month, intended only as a help to thofe who cannot 
entirely fupport themfelves. The weekly collections, dues 
of mortcloths (palls), and a remainder of fume funds which 
are now nearly exhaufted, at prefent lupply this charity. 
It is often found neceffary alfo to grant occafional afliftance 
to poor families in fickncfs and want. No perlon in the 
parifh has been fullered to beg publicly, in the memory of 
man. In iummer, all who are able to work in the heids, 
generally rind employment, and can live very a-mtonably 
on their wages ; but in winter, the women, who can often 
find no employment but fpinning, are not able to earn 
more than 3d. or 4d. a-day, as there are no manufactures 
in the parifh. This is a real lots m many rtfpectb, becaufe 
both the old and young, who are unlit for the coiiimuu la- 
bour in the fields, might be employed in lumc bulmeis of 
manufacture with much advantage, both to themfelveb and 
the public, and to the preventing of indolence and licen- 
tioufnefs. 

Manners. — The people in general are fober and induftri- 
ons, and that wild and gloomy fanaticifm which formerly 
raged with fuch turbulent, unhallowed zeal, feems now, 
except among very few, over the whole country, as well 
as here, to wear a milder and brighter afpect, and the ran- 
cour of party-fpirit is daily abating, as alfo that rage of 
fchifm which once prevailed, fo hurtful to the peace of fo- 
ciety, and to the interefts of religion. More rational no- 
tions of religion are now entertained among all feels, and 
the doctrines of faith and morality are not unhappily fepa- 

rated, 



414 



Statijiical Account 



rated, efpecially among the middle ranks of the people. 
Thefe maintain much decency of character, with regard 
both to a religious deportment, and to honefty of manners. 
They are emerging from the gloom of ignorance, rudenefs 
and fuperftition, and as yet are happily ftrangers to the vi- 
t-ious refinement, fcepticifm and licentioufnefs, which, from 
the example of the metropolis, have lately much infefted 
the neighbourhood. Some loofe and libertine principles, 
the poifonous fpawn of a falfe philofophy and falfe patrio- 
tifm, have recently corrupted the minds of half-learned 
witlings and fmatterers in fcience, who implicitly receive 
their opinions at fecond hand. From thefe they have been 
catched by many among the moft ignorant, the obvious 
tendency of which is to deftroy the foundations of all civil 
and' ecclefiaftical government. When the lower people 
ihall have learned to copy the manners and principles of 
fome of their fuperiors, which they naturally do, the confe- 
quences to iocicty mulf be fatal, as may be feen from the 
progrefs of modern refinement and philofophy. " He that 
has eyes to fee let him fee." 

JVHfcdlaneous Remarks. — Agriculture has lately made a 
rapid progrefs in this part of the country, and the appear- 
ance of the ground, particularly towards the fouth fide 
oi the parifll, which was formerly bare and barren, is now 
greatly altered bo r h in foil and climate, by means of the 
improvements and thriving wood plantations that fhelter 
and adorn the higher parts. Die b^ft and mofl extenfive 
improver in this refpecf here, is Mr Maconochie of Mea- 
dow-ban k, who has greatly beautified the more unfertile 
parts of his eftate with complete inelofures for pafture, and 
with belts of plantation, variegated with every kind of 
•wood foiled to the foil. The roads and bridges are brought 
into good repair, and great improvements are daily making 

upon

upon them. The ftatute labour is commuted at the rate 
of 18s. the ploughgate. The largeit farms let at L. 150 
and L. 200, and are generally inclofed, except the hilly 
flieep- farms. There' are 12 heritors, two only of whom 
refide conftantly in the parifh, fome of the reft occafionaliy. 
The valued rent is L. 3760 Scotch. From the manle, a 
profpeft opens to the eye one of the richeft and moft beau- 
tiful to be feen in Scotland. On the eaft it is terminated 
by a full and pifturefque view of Arthur's feat, the metro- 
polis, and its venerable cattle, which is on a level with the 
manfe, and which feems as if only about 5 or 6 miles diflant. 
On the north appear theOchil hills, the frith of Forth, a great 
part of Fife, and feveral of the coaft towns ; and on the 
fouth arife the Pentland hills. From a riling ground, a few 
yards diftant from the manfe, a part of 13 counties may be 
feen, and aftretch of country of about 100 miles, almoft from 
Berwick to Greenock. The great Glafgow road from E- 
dinburgh paffes through the parifh. — \bout 50 years ago, 
it was ufual for the moft fubflantial farmers to appear at 
church and market in home-fpun cloth and plaiden hofe. 
Now their menial fervants and cottagers are equipped in 
Englifti broad cloth, filk and fatin. This turn for finery is 
a great lofs to them, as they live up to their wages, not- 
withftanding their being fo high. Thus they enter into a 
married ftate, with their whole fubftance upon their back, 
efpecially women ; and when licknefs, or any misfortune 
prevents their daily labour, they^immediately fink into the 
depth of poverty. It is generally obferved, that the inha- 
bitants of villages are more licentious and diffipated, than 
thofe who live in feparate and fequeftered hamlets, and 
are employed in agriculture. The almoft- univerfal ufe of 
tea and fpirits, of an inferior quality, tends greatly to hurt 
both the health and morals of the lower people. — Some

Eminent Ven. — The celebrated Dr Cullen was proprie- 
tor of the eftate of Ormifton-hill ; and he lies interred in 
the church-yard of Kirknewton. The Doctor's great ta- 
lents as a profeflor. as a phyfician, and as a philofopher, 
are well known and un-iverfally acknowledged in every 
part of the world. Other qualifications, however, he pof- 
fefled in an eminent degree, though in thefe his fame has- 
not been fo much extended. He was a great mafter in the 
fcientific branches of hufbandfy; a confummate botanift ; 
and poffeffed a full formed and correct tafte in the fine arts. 
Thefe attainments appeared confpicuous in his operations 
at Ormifton-hill. In the year 1758, the Do£tor, after fi- 
nilhing his courfe of chymiftry, delivered to a number of 
his particular friends, and favourite pupils, nine lectures on 
the fubject of agriculture. In thefe few lectures, he, for 
the firft time, laid open the true principle concerning the 
nature of foils, and the operation of manures. Thefe were 
difcoveries entirely his own, and which haVe fince been 
made known to the world by a variety of channels, though 
without any notification of the fource from whence they 
proceeded. The juftnefs of thefe principles he demonftrated 
by his practice on the lands of Ormifton-hill, which, though 
naturally of an ungrateful foil, rendered worfe by immemo- 
rial bad management, and fituated in an unfavourable cli- 
mate, he raifed in a few years to a furprifing degree of 
culture and fertility. Early in life he was a proficient id 
botany, and was the firft perfon in Scotland who underftood 
the Linncean fyftem, and recommended the ftudy of it to his 
pupils, at a time when it met with much oppofition from 0- 

thers. 



of Kirknewton.

thers. In his gardens and pleafure grounds at Ormifton- 
hill, he formed an extenfive collection of rave trees, ftirufcs, 
and herbaceous plants. The cultivation of thefe, and the ac- 
curate determination of their fpecie*, afford d him always an 
agreeable relaxation from the more ferious ftudiesand labours 
of his profeffion. He was likewife remarkable for his criti- 
cal knowledge and correct judgment in architecture and 
painting. The hall of the Royal College of Phyficians in 
Edinburgh is an example of the former, which was plan- 
ned when he was Prefident, and according to his directions. 
The front of this building may be considered as the mod 
chafte and beautiful morfel of Greek architecture, that has 
yet appeared in Scotland. The acutenefs of his eye, and of 
his mind, in difcerning the beauties and blemiflies in paint- 
ing, was well known to his intimate friends. This talent 
rendered him a fuperior judge in the difpofition of grounds, 
and in the arrangement of rural ornaments. When he firft 
entered to the poffeffion of Ormifton-h ill, every thing about 
the place Was in fuch a ruinous ftate, fo comfortlefs and fo un- 
promiiing, that he placed over the front-door of the houfe, 
EST ULUBRIS : But, by great attention and good tafte, 
he foon made it a commodious and pleafant refidence. 
While he refided here, he was acceffible at all times to his 
neighbours, and teftified the utmoft readinefs to give his 
valuable advice to the poof gratis on every occalion of di- 
ftrefs ; and attended to them as anxionfly as to thofe of the 
firft rank in the realm, for whom he daily prefcribed. In 
this he feemed to be of the opinion of his famous prede- 
ceffor Dr Boerhaave, who ufed to fay, that the poor were 
his beft patients, for God is their paymafter.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12056653">DRY'SDAL E</name>, 
(County and Synod of Dumfries, Presbytery of 

LoCHMABEN.) 

By the Rev. Mr Thomas Henderson.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Rivers, Soil, Climate. 

DRy'soale is obvioufiy a corruption or contraction of 
^ r yf e fdale i fo called, from its lying partly on the 
banks of the rivulet Dryfe. The panfh lies about the 
middle of Arrnandale, and is in 55 0 08" N. Lat. and 3 0 W. 
Long. It is about 7 miles loner, from N. to S. ; at the 
fouthern extremity' only a mile broad ; at the centre about 
6 miles ; and at the northern end 3 ; exhibiting a furface 
of nearly noo acres The weftern and fouthern parts are 
generally flat, and cultivated. The upper or northern 
parts are hilly, and moftly in pafture. There is nearly one 
half of the parifh cultivated. The Annan, dividing it from 
Lochmaben, wafhes it on the W. and S. for upwards of 
6 miles, abounding in rainy feafons with excellent falmon, 
from the Sol way Firth, to the fupply of the Lockerbie, 

Lochmaben 



of Drffdale.

jLochmaben and Dumfries markets, and on fome occafions 
xo the Engiifh markets, befides a variety of fea trout, her- 
ling, Ikellies, eels, pike and burn trout. The Dryte runs 
through this parifh for about 3 miles on the N. W. part, 
emptying itfelf into the Annan in a direct line, between 
the market town of Lockerbie and the Royal Burgh of 
Lochmaben. It rifes in the northern end of Hutton pa- 
rifh, and runs a courfe directly fouth about 1 1 miles. It 
is, in moderate weather, a fniall rivulet, clear and pure, 
having in its pools plenty of trout, and fome fmall falmon, 
&amp;c. ; but in rainy weather, it comes down in fwells, fud- 
denly and rapidly, driving all before it that comes in its 
way; hence the name, overfpreading its holms, and in- 
creafing the Annan The gently riling hills on each fide 
are cultivated, or exhibit a beautiful verdure, and rich pa- 
fture for cattle and fheep. The Ciirrie and Milk touching 
it on the E. and S. E. alfo abound in trout and fmall fal- 
mon. The Currie is a fmall ftream, about 5 miles long 
from N. to S. deriving its name from its fource, being a 
Corrie, a Celtic term, lignifying a confined cleugh or glen, 
of which fort is the fpring of the Annan, vulgarly called 
the " Annan Peck," or the Marquis of Annandale's 
" Beef Stand." Ics banks and contiguous farms afford the 
richer! pafture, and as rich crops of corn in favourable fea- 
fons, as any high lying part of the country. It empties 
itfelf into the Milk, at the eaftern extremity of the cen- 
trical line of this parifh. The Milk, a limpid rivulet, 
has on each fide very rich land for arrage, but peculiarly 
for paftiirage to milk cows, hence the name. It touches 
this parifh only for about a mile and a half, though its 
courfe being partly weft, and then fouth, is not lefs than 12 
miles, when it difcharges itfelf into the Annan oppofite 
the Watch Tower of Repentance in Cummertrees parifli. 
Along the banks of the Dryfe and Annan, there is a traft 



4 20 Statiflical Account 



of rich holm land, the warnings of both waters for time 
immemorial, confiding of deep loam, very productive un- 
der proper culture. The other cultivated lands are gene- 
rally light and dry, lyirig on a flatey and ragged rock, or 
gravel, which, with lime, marl and dung, produce very 
well. The hilly parts are generally dry, green, with ve- 
ry little heath, and fit for cattle or Iheep. The air is dry 
and healthy, becaui'e the country has a fine open expofure to 
the S. and W. The fpring in favourable feafons is early. 
The fummer fometimes extremely hot. Harveft foon on 
the weftern fide. Winter ftormy and cold. High winds, 
heavy rains, but feldom any continuation of fnow, though 
of froft in fome feafons for upwards of one, two, or three 
months together, which is always reckoned a preparation 
for, and a prognoftication of a kindly fpring, a nourifhing 
fummer, and plentiful harveft. Peats are fcarce, fome- 
times fold for 2 s. 3 s. .aid even 4 s. the fingle cart-load. 
Coals are brought from Sanquhar in the upper part of 
Nithfdale, Tindall, Fell, and Archerbeck in Cumber- 
land, at the diftance of 30 and 40 miles, and fold at 9 s. 
the cart load in Lockerbie ; an infuperable bar to riling 
manufactures at prefent, and principally occafioned by the 
unproductive and impolitical tax on coals over the Solway 
Frith, which is faid and expected foon to be taken off 
there, and alfo in fimilar iituations in Scotland, which 
would be a vaft benefit to the country. No epidemical 
difeafes are peculiar to this parifh. The common duration 
of human life is 60 years, though fome advance to 70, 8o, 
and 90. 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr Webfter's report, th e 
population then was 1097. The number of inhabitants now 
is about 1600 ; 700 in the thriving town of Lockerbie, and 
900 in the country part of the parilh. There are about 

1 4® 



of Drffdale. 42 j 

40 births, upwards of 30 deaths, and 12 marriages annual- 
ly. Lockerbie being a market and poft town, and the moft 
noted place of the parilh, merits a particular defcription. 
It is fo called, as many other places on the Englifh border, 
and up and down Annandale, Elkdaie and Nithfdale, of ihe 
fame termination, becaufe the term Bie, being Celtic, fig- 
nifies a " ftation or place of ftrength." Lockerbie had 
been a place or tower of fafety, fituated between and 
almoft furrounded by two lochs or lakes, now di ;.ined ; the 
one, on the eaft fide of the intervening ridge, is converted 
into a rich bog meadow, in the bottom of which is a deep 
bed of Ihell marl, but, on account of the ftagnating water, 
difficult to be wrought ; the other, on the weft fide, is 
partly meadow and partly mofs, Ijing alfo on marl, very 
deep. The town confifls of one long flreet f.om N. to S. 
in extent about half a mile, and another, at a right angle 
to the E. about a quarter of a mile. There are about 150 
inhabited houfes ; 2 fairs, and 10 markets yearly. The 
fairs are at Limmas and Michaelmas, when nn. derate 
tolls are levied by the proprietor, amounting only to about 
L. 16 Sterling a-year. At the ic markets all are free. 
D uring the courfe of the year, there are fold for England up- 
wards of 50,000 yards of linen and woollen cloth, and at 
the Lammas fair about 20,000 lambs, partly to be winter- 
ed in the neighbourhood, but principally for England, and 
all the other articles ufually fold at the ordinary markets

were very few houfes in Lockerbie ; but at that period, th« 
late laird of Lockerbie, with confent of his then furviving fa- 
ther, granted many f.;us of houfe Headings and yards, on the 
•weft fide of the ftreet, and long tacks of the fame fort on the 
eaft fide, for fourfcore times 21 years. Since that time 
the town has been yearly enlarging. There are no public 
manufactures eftablilhed as yet ; but a great deal of foreign 
and inland flax is given out to be fpun from the {hops. I 
remember one of them once told me, he has had in the 
courfe of a year more than joo fpinfters of faftory-lint on 
his books, partly from the country, and partly from the 
town, the yarn being exported to Kendal, and other manu- 
facturing towns in England. There are in Lockerbie, 12 
large lhops, 6 lefs ones, 2 furgeons and apothecaries, 2 mid- 
wives, 2 writers, 2 meflengers, 6 weavers, 10 tailors, 5 
•wrights, 3 blackfmiths, 1 nailer, one principal inn, where 
carriages and horfes may be hired, 3 leffer inns, 2 watch- 
makers, 2 bakers, 3 butchers, 2 barbers, 11 carters, 3 
■wheel- wrights, 1 gardener, 2 daggers, 2 faddlers, 2 tanners, 
and in the town and parifli jointly, there are about 80 
ploughs, 3 millers, and 200 horfes. The parilh-church ftands

(vile on the Thurfday thereafter ; the next, 3 weeks after the laft, called 
the Martinmas market; the next 14 days thereafter; and the 10th, on the 
Thurfday before Yule, or Chriftmas O. S. The hiring market for fer- 
vants for the fummer half year is in April, For the winter ditto, is the 
14 days one after Michaelmas, and the aforefaid, for the greateft part of 
Annandale. At thofe hiring markets, the wage of a man for the half 
year is about L. 3, ios. of a woman L. 1, 15s. but varying according to 
drcumfVances. Jn the markets, and at the proper feafons, there is a vaft 
variety of young cattle, cows, horfes, Uc. expofed to tale. There is an 
old fquare tower ftill Handing, called the Mains which was the file or 
manfion-place of the ancient family of the Johnftons of Lockerbie, being 
a branch of the old Laird Johnfton's of Lochwood, the anceftors of the 
late Marquis of Annandale. Lockerbie lies ia miles E. fiom Dumfries, 
4 from Lochmaben, 16 niles S. from Moffat, 16 miles W. from Langholm, 
a a. miles N. from Annan, and 6 Irom Ecclefcchan.

apon an eminence, at the head or north end of the town* 
It is a neat edifice, handfomely fitted up in the infide, and 
may contain about 750 people. It was built in the year 
1757, being at that time removed from Dryfefide, 1-5 mile 
north of Lockerbie. It is faid, that in the year 1670, Dryfe 
fwept away the original church and burying ground, which 
was in the middle of the holm, now called the Sand Bed\ 
after this, in 1671, the late church and burial ground was 
eftablilhed at a fmall diftance, and upon the Ikirt of the 
prefent glebe, or Kirkhill, thought to be perfectly fecure 
from the fwells of Dryfe ; but the water in procefs of 
time, approached the new burying ground, carrying a good 
deal of it away, and threatening the church itfelf, verifying 
the old faying or prophecy of Rymer, 

si .*••»' v ' • ^ 
" Let fpades and-fhoels do what they may, 
" Dryfe will have Dry'fdale kirk away." 

Partly from the above circumftances, but principally 
through the influence of the family of Lockerbie, the church 
was removed to the town, for the ornament and conveni- 
ence of the place and parifli. There is an Antiburgher meet- 
ing houfe at the fouth or foot of the town, eftablifhed about 
50 years fince, the only one in Annandale, and draws only a 
moderate congregation and annual income from the whole 
dale. 

Lakes, Cleughs, or Glens. — Turnmoor Loch affords a fuffi- 
cient quantity of water for fupplying the corn and barley 
mills of that name, but hath nothing peculiar, excepting it£ 
being an excellent haunt for wild ducks, geefe, and other 
fowls in the winter-feafon. The Cauldron is a very deep 
lake in the midft of a morafs, never freezing, abounding 
with pike and eels, being the remains of the old water-gate

of Dryfe, and in which there is plenty of fliell marl, but 
expenfive in the working. Half a mile fouth of this, and 
in the fame tract, there is a vaft fund of excellent and 
workable marl, belonging to the Duke of Queenfberry, and 
which is extremely beneficial to his Grace's tenants, cofling 
only 3 d. the cart load, and 30 cart load being fufficient for 
an acre. St Mary's Cleugh, at the north end of the pariih, 
feparating it from Sibbaldbie, is very deep, and its fteep 
fides are covered with the molt thriving plantations of oak 
and afh, fome of the latter being 60 feet high, plenty of 
hazle, and nuts in the feafon. The Bifhop Cleugh, fo called 
from its being old kirk -lands, has nothing remarkable. The 
Scale Cleugh, on the eaft fide of the parifh, is very deep, and 
its fteep banks are covered with hazle and brufhwood. 
There are other cleughs, but none remarkable. 

Antiquities. — On the holm of Dryfe, about ~ mile beloW 
the old church-yard, are two very aged thorn trees, with a 
tumulus at their bafe, called Maxwell's Thorns, becaufe they 
point out the place of the remarkable fight on Dryfefands, 
between the Maxwells of Nithfdale and the Johnftons of 
Annandale *. There are veftiges of ftrong towers at Old 

Walls, 

* The particulars are: On 7th December 1593, the Lord Maxwell, 
■warden of the weftern marines, having, in conjunction with the then 
Lairds of Durrilanrig and Clofeburn, collected 2000 men in arms, marched 
into Annandale to befiege the Laird Johnfton's houfe of Lochwood, and 
through deadly ftite to extirpate him and all his name. Accordingly,' 
early on the- morning, the Laird Maxwell came to Lockerbie, expecting 
to find the Johnftons, vaflals of the Lochwood family, at ho:ne ; but being 
difappointed, burnt the houfe of Nether Place, the refidence of the Laird of 
Lockerbie's brother, and afterwards returned to his party at Dryfefands. It 
fo happened, that Annandale Johnfton foon appearing with only 40 horfes, 
engaged 80 of the enemy, put them to flight purfuing a certain length, and 
then, 0 through defign.fuddenlyretreating.were followed by the whole body of 
the enemy, with Lord Maxwell at their head, till they came to the Torrwood

Walls, Kirktown-mains, Nether-place, Myrehead, and Dal- 
tonnook. There are evident remains of 8 camps or forts, 
fome fquare or Roman, others circular or Britifh, and moft- 
ly built pn eminences, becaufe about 2000 years fince (their 
age) the fides of the eminences or hills had been covered 
with grow ing wood, and the prefent flat or low lying and 
holm land, m Annandale had partly been a morafs, or under 
water ; hence we find, that the Roman roads were generally 
made on riling ground, when it could be got. The moft 
remarkable are two, the one Britifli, and the other Roman, 
facing each other, and feparated by a narrow morafs. They 
are built on two hills E. of the village Bengali, the name 
alluding to the forts on the hills, fignifying the hill of the 
Gauls. Old pieces of armour and warlike weapons have 
frequently been found in them, and not many years fince, 
the Ikeleton of a man was found in a cairn, on the inter- 
vening morafs, thought to have laid there for fome ages, 
and fome fragments of his drefs or accoutrements were car- 
ried off as a curiofity, particularly his fandals, curioufly 
wrought and bound around the mouths with leathern 
thongs, were conveyed into England for the Oxford Mufeum. 
There is another, a Roman fort, beautifully fituated upon 
large eminence, in the centre of the united and extenfive 
holm of Dryfe and Annan, called the Gallaberry, or the 
burgh and ftation of the Gauls, for the term Berry is of 
Saxon origin, fignifying " burgh, manfion, or ftrength."

on the S. E. fide of Dryfe, whence 400 Annandalians fptung, flew upon 
the furprifed enemy, after a fliort, but bloody ftruggle, put them into 
confufion, and being joined by a few Scots, from Eikdale, under the Laird 
of Buccleugh, completed the vidlory, killing upwards of 700, among 
whom was the Lord Maxwell himfelf, and purfued the routed enemy to the 
Gotterbie Ford of the Annan, where many were drowned. A great num- 
ber that efcaped, were marred or hurt on the face during the fight ; hence 
ihe common faying, •« A Lockerbie lick." It is Angular that fo few de- 
feated fo many.

Statijlical Account 



The moft entire is a Britifli one at Dry'fdale gate, occupy- 
ing about 2 acres of ground, commanding a moft exteniive 
profpect ; its counterpart is a large Roman one about £ 
mile due E. interrupted by a moor, being the place cele- 
brated for the bloody battle between the army of Julius 
Agricola, and the forces of Corbredus Galdus, the 21ft King 
of the Scots, about the end of the ill century. There are 
plain traces of the great Roman road, from the borders of 
England up to the vaft encampments on the neighbouring 
beauteous and confpicuous round green hill of Bur i'fwork, 
and thence crofting this parifti at Lockerbie to Diy'fdale 
gate, and up to the Galfaberry above mentioned, where it 
divided, one branch leading up through Annandale, by 
Moffat, to Tweeddale and Clydefdale ; the other branch 
crofting the Annan, touched an entire and beautiful double 
foi t on the northern margin of one of the Lochmaben lakes, 
called the Woody Cajile, thence pafied up the weft lide of 
the water of Ae, through Nith'fdale to the weft country. 

Hills, Quarries, l$c. — Upon the banks of the Currie, 
there is an eminence called Currie Law, the term ftgnifying 
a fummit commanding a large and deep view below. There 
is a range of beauteous green hills running from N. to S. 
for about 3 miles, dividing the Highland from the low part 
of the parifti. The Highland or outerly part, had been 
once a parifti by itfelf, called Little Hutton, in contraft to 
the large parifti of Hutton conterminous. The church and 
burying ground had been at Halldykes, for in the garden, 
human bones are frequently dug up ; but there is neither 
record nor tradition of the time of its annexation to Dry'f- 
dale. Be fides this church of Little Hutton, there were two 
other places of public worftiip in the parifti, viz. The cha- 
pel of Beekton, fuppofed to belong to the Knight's Tem- 
plars, lying I mile N, W. of Lockerbie, where the traces 



of Dryjdale. 427 



of graves are ftill manifeft, and at which there is a moffc 
copious and excellent fpring well. There is alfo the veftige 
of the chapel at Quaas £ mile W. of Lockerbie, the font- 
ftone of which ferves for the market crofs of Lockerbie to 
this day. The molt lofty and beautiful hill, (for there are 
no mountains in the parifh,) is Whitewynd or White Woolen, 
car petted with an unvaried green, being an excellent paftu- 
rage for pecs or unlaid lheep, hence the name. This hill is 
of confiderable heighth and fteepnefs ; on its fummit there is 
a fpacious plain, in the centre whereof is a mound or mote, 
where a fire ufed to be kindled to warn the country of the 
incurfions of the Englifti borderers. From this top, there 
is a molt extenfive and enchanting profpecT: of Annandale, 
Elkdale, the Englifti border, Solway Frith, Irifti Sea. I(le 
of Man, part of Nith'fdale, and Galloway. At the fouthern 
end of the parifti, there is a limeftone quarry, which pro- 
duces a coarfe, dark coloured, but ftrong lime for land. 
There is fome freeftone at Old Walls, but too foft for du- 
rable ufe. There is plenty of whin and rag ftone in the 
neighbourhood of Lockerbie, which, when Ikilfully built* 
makes excellent and beautiful walls. Free hewn Hone 
comes from the upper end of Lochmaben parifti, about 4 
miles diftant. 

Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c. — There is a great number of black 
cattle bred in the parifti, particularly in the Highland part. 
A good deal of butter and cheefe made. In the neigh- 
bourhood of Lockerbie, the grazing of a milk cow is L. 1, 
10 s. a-year. Skimmed milk is fold for 1 d. the Scotch 
pint, butter at 8 d. and 9 d. the pound, new cheefe at 3 d. the 
pound, and old cheefe from 5 s. to 8 s. the ftone, heavy weight, 
being 24 ounces to the pound. The farmers preferring 
black cattle to ftieep, there is only one or two ftieep ftocka 
in the parifti, yet there are a great number of pets and 
3 lambs 



Statijlical Account 



lambs, and hogs wintered, in all amounting to about 1200 *. 
Black cattle, horfes, fheep and wool, have been rifing in 
their price for feveral years paft. The wool fold at the 
Lockerbie markets comes from the upper part of Annan- 
dale and Eikdale, and is from 4 s. to 10 s. the ftone. Un- 
laid or pet wool, is from 15 5. to L. 1, 1 s . the ftone. The 
common people are generally clothed in home manufacture, 
from the laid ftieep wool, at the rate of 2 s. 6 d. 3 s. and 4 s. 
the yard, for the Scotch ellwand is now univerfally laid 
afide. Every family is a fmall factory for both linen and 
woollen cloth. There are a great many dyers and dreflers 
of cloth, alfo bleachers, in this part of the country. 

Roads, IV oods, &amp;c. — The great poft and turnpike road 
from London to Edinburgh and Glafgow, runs through 
Lockerbie and this pariih. The fouthern mail coach arrives 
at the poft-office here every evening, and the northern ditto 
every morning. The time of communication between 
London and Lockerbie (336 miles) is only about 50 hours. 
Along this road in the fpring, but efpecially in the end of. 
harveft, vaft droves of black cattle from the North and 
Weft Highlands pafs into England, to the number of about 
ao,ooo annually, prices from L. 3 to L. 7 each, in order to 
be fatted in the Norfolk fenns and other places, and fupply 
the London and other markets, making the molt delicious 
meat, vaftly preferable to the large and rancid Iiifh horned 
bullocks. About] 50 cart loads of merchant goods pa&amp; 
weekly to and from Glafgow, and that vicinity, moftly of 
the cotton fort. The private roads in this parifli are getting

into excellent repair, owing to the converfion of the ftatute 
labour of the farmers and houfehoulders into a pecuniary 
aflefTment, by act of Parliament 1777, producing in this 
parifh annually L. 45 ; which, by the judicious management 
of the commiffioners in general, and peculiarly by the abi- 
lity and activity of William Stewart, Efq; factor 'to Lord 
Hopetoun, as fucceeding the late Marquis of Annandale, the 
only rending juftice of the peace and acting commiffioner 
of fupply in the parifh, has been properly expended, and 
contributed to their improvement beyond expectation. In 
confequence of, this melioration, lime carriage for the im- 
provement of laud is greatly facilitated, and a fpirit of agri- 
cultural improvement prevails, though the lime is brought at 
10 miles diftance. The new mode of farming, by rotation 
of crops, and fubdividing and inclohng by ftone fence, hedge, 
and ditch, and planting trees on the hedge-rows, takes place. 
There are but few woods in the parifh. There are fome 
new and thriving plantations of common firs on Lord 
Hopetoun 's and Lord Mansfield's lands, and fome old ftrips 
along the cleugh fides and banks of the waters, and parti- 
cularly there is a large plantation round the manfion-houfe 
of Halldikes, Whitewynd, Rofebank, and Robert-hill, and 
fome infant plantations riling on the eftate of Lockerbie ; 
but it muft be acknowledged, that this part of the country 
is defective and naked in this particular, though it now 
feems to be on the mending hand. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The ftipend is L. 77, and the 
glebe, though upwards of 20 acres, is not worth above L. 8 
yearly ; becaufe it is generally bad land. The manfe is a 
new and neat building, ftanding on the fumrait of the old 
Kirkhill, on die fide of Dryfe, contiguous to the old church- 
yard, in an open part of the country, and is the moft confpi- 
cuous and beauteous Situation in Annandale, commanding a

moft extcnfive and enchanting view, terminated by the 
towering, though far diftant mountain of Skicldaw beyond 
the Solway frith, in Cumberland, on the fouth ; by the lofty

tended vale of Annandale, in fome places 4, in others 8 
miles over. The waters of Dryfe, Annan, Kinnel, and 
Ae, uniting their kindred ftreams in the centre of the vale. 
In fummer and harveft it is de lightful indeed to fee fuch a 
rich variety of lofty mountains and deep vallies, of green 
hills and growing dales, of winding rivers and rivulets, of 
rich paftures and richer crop-lands, all around. The royal 
burgh of Lochmaben is in full and diftincl view acrofs the 
Annan to the weft. The town clock is heard, and the 
Caftle loch, a fheet of 204 acres of water, with the caftle 
ruins on a peninfula on the fouth fide, is feen. The profpeel 
is beautified and variegated with a great number of gentle- 
mens feats and plantations on all hands-, fuch as the Kirk- 
wood, Denbie, Whitecroft, Rammerfcales, Holmains, New- 
mains, Fourtowns, Halleaths, Caftlemains, Lochmaben, 
Ellfhiefhields, Riggheads, Todhillmoor, Kirkmichael place, 
Hillfide, Balgray, and above all the new and elegant palace 
belonging to Lord Hopetoun at Raehills on the Annandale 
eftate. The crown is patron. The parifli, in the 13th century, 
by King Robert Bruce, was given as a menfal church to the 
Archbifhoprickof Glafgow, and alfo the neighbouring parifh 
of St Mungo. — There is an eflabliftied parifh-fchool, with 
the ufual falary of ico merks, and the intereft of L. 80 of 
mortified money, together with the common fchooUfees. 
It is to be regretted, that too fmall encouragement is afforded 
to fcboolmafters in Scotland, a clafs of men extremely nfe- 
ful, if able and faithful. There are feveral private fchools

church, with fines, and the annualrent of L. 65 of mortified 
money, amount to about L. 18 yearly. This, together with 
the alms afforded by the noteholders, is amply fufficient 
to fupply the necetfitous poor ; but there is a vaft influx of 
vagrants and beggars from diftant places, notwithstanding 
the activity of the Juftices of the Peace in fending many to 
the houfe of correction at Dumfries. Poors rates would be 
an unnecefiary and heavy burden on this part of the coun- 
try. The people are very liberal to their own poor, and 
perhaps too much fo to flrangers. 

Heritor x, Agriculture, i$c. — There are only 4 fmall re- 
fiding heritors, vvi:h the numerous body of feuars and long 
tackfmen in Lockerbie. The great and non-reliding pro- 
prietors are the Duke of Queenfberry, Earl of Hopetoun, 
Earl of Mansfield, Lady Douglafs of Killhead for Locker- 
bie, Mr Harries of Hilldikes, and Mr Johnfton of Barn- 
gallhill, befides 6 fmall non-refiding heritors. There are 
upwards of 60 farms from L. 25 to L. 100 rent, and fome 
few above that fum ; the arable land is in general about 
13 s. 4 d. the acre, and Highland pafture about 2 s. and 
2 s. 6 d. The inclofed parks around Lockerbie give from 
17 s. 6 d. to double that fum of yearly rent. The grofs 
rental of the pariih is L. 3400, and the valuation is 7194!- 
merks. The crops are oats, barley, peafe, potatoes, turnips, 
flax, fome hemp and rye, and wheat, with fown grafles in 
rotation. A conliderable quantity of barley is exported at 
port Annan from this parifli to Whitehaven and Liverpool 
for malting, alfo oats and potatoes. A great many fvvine 
are fatted and fold at the weekly market of Lockerbie du_ 
ring the feafon. About 200 are annually fed in the parifh, 
from 10 to 20 ftones each, and give from 3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. 6 d. 
the ftone, and cured and dried hams are about 6d. the pound. 
Farmers make their rents partly from their barley and ba- 
con

con exported, and from oats raw or manufactured into meal, 
and from the breeding of black cattle and fome for horfes. 
As the grain here is of the belt quality, it commands the 
Higheft price. The price of labour is greatly on the rife, 
particularly in harveft; reapers getting is.the day with their 
victuals, and is. 6 d. without them; but at the other fea- 
fons labourers are much cheaper, being in winter 6d. and 
in fpring and fummer 8 d. and 9 d. the day with vic- 
tuals. 

General CharaBer, and MifceUancous Obfervations. — The 
people are honeft, fober, induftrious in their refpedtive oc- 
cupations ; well affected to the prefent govenment, both 
ecclenaftical and civil ; peaceable and pious, regular in 
attending church ordinances on the Lord's day, are well ac- 
quainted with the principles of Chriftianity, are devoid of 
bigotry and hypocrify, are moderate and humane, and de- 
light to favour one another. Even in the town of Locker- 
bie, where dramming fometimes does prevail, efpecially 
about the market times, there has not been a fight or quarrel 
worth mentioning for thefe 11 years paft, the time of the 
incumbent's miniftry, nor for as long before that, as he has 
been informed. This is a proof of the civilization of the 
people ; and peculiarly to the praife of the fair fex, if men 
are fometimes feen drunk, women never are, neither at 
markets, nor on any other occaiion. Marriages are early 
and fruitful, there being few bachelors beyond 25 years of 
age. This parifh hath produced feveral eminent, learned, 
and mercantile men, who have travelled to the Eaft and 
Weft Indies, and fuccefsfully obtained fortunes. The prin- 
cipal diverlion or amufement is curling on the ice in the 
winter, when fometimes fcores of people aflemble on the 
waters, and in the moft keen, yet friendly manner, engage

agalnft one another, and ufually conclude the game and day 
with a good dinner, drink, and fongs. The people are 
healthy and robuft. The parifh is improving in agricul- 
ture annually, and increafing in the number of inhabitants ; 
but efpecially in the town of Lockerbie, which hath in- 
creafed upwards of 150 within thefe 10 years pail. The 
drefs, diet, language, and manners, are daily mending, and 
vaftly fuperior to fome of the neighbouring and country 
pariflies. •

By the Rev. Mr Thomas Shepherd.</head> 



<p>Extent, Soil, &amp;c. 

ITS extent is about 4 Englifh miles in length, and 2 in 
breadth, and it contains about 4000 acres, moft of 
which have been meafured, and above 600 acres inclofed. 
Some of thefe inclofures are planted with firs, and general- 
ly in a thriving way. One of the greateft extent, of 50 
acres, on the eftate of Barra, was among the earlieft plant- 
ed in this country, and is now cutting down and felling to 
good account. On the fame eftate is lately finifhed ano- 
ther inclofure, not fo extenfive as the former, but is flock- 
ed with a variety of plants of different kinds of wood be- 
fides that of firs. About the middle of the' parilh, there 
are two ranges of hills, moftly green. They feem of old 
to have been laboured within 50 yards of the top, but now

the higher parts are neglected. The ground upon the 
fkirts, and at the bottom of thefe hills, is wet and fpungy ; 
later in harveft by 10 days than the earlieft parts of the pa- 
rifh, and feems more fuited for grafs than grain. The 
lands lying to the W. and to the E. of thefe hills are gene- 
rally of a ftrong ftiff foil, with a clay bottom, pretty fertile, 
but much peftered with large ftones, both above and be- 
low the furface. About 20 years ago, our country did not 
breed cattle of fufficient bulk and ftrength to labour the 
ground. They were morlly brought from the fouth, par- 
ticularly from Fifelhire. In a few years, by hard labour, 
they were worn out, and became unfit for fervice \ and as 
the farmer had not the means of fattening them, he very 
often fold them for a third part of what they coft him. 
The cale is now much altered to the better. The farmer 
brings up oxen able for his work, fells them or fattens 
them when they begin to be upon the decline, and in this 
way is rather a confiderable gainer than a lofer upon his 
work cattle. ' 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation was then 525. The number of inhabitants, by 
an exact lift in 1771, was 560. It is now only 45c ; the de- 
creafe is principally owing to the monopoly of farms, and 
the fcarcity of mofs. Of the prefent inhabitants, 2 arc 
Seceders, 10 Epifcopalians, and 6 Quakers, the reft attend 
the Eftablifhed Church. 

Rents. — One farmer pofTefTes nearly what employed 4 ; 
each of whom yoked 10 oxen. The proprietor took thefe 
lands under his own management for a few years, inclofed 
and limed a confiderable part of the grounds, built an ex- 
cellent dwelling-houfe, fubftantial and commodious office- 

houfes, 



43 6 



Statijiical Account 



houfes, and let the whole to one gentleman, at rather more 
than double the rent the lands formerly gave. The rent is 
now about L. 185 Sterling. Another farm rents L. 105 
Sterling. The reft of the rents of the parilh are from 
L. 40 down to L. 7 Sterling. The whole rent of the pa- 
rilh is about L. ioco Sterling, the valued rent L. 2501 
Scots. 

Mode of Cultivation. — Several of the tenants yoke 10 
oxen in one plough ; however, the new hufbandry has been 
pra&amp;ifed by fome of them for feveral years, and is daily 
increafing. There are about 50 acres of turnip, and 250 
of fown grafs. The grain generally fown is bear and oats, 
few peafe or lint-feed ; and there are as many potatoes rai- 
fed as ferve the inhabitants. 

Number of Cattle. — There are about 6co black cat- 
tle ; 50 j lheep pafture during the fummer, but not 
fo many thiough the winter, and 130 horfes. We 
have now 60 carts. In 1744, when the prefent in- 
cumbent was fettled, there were only 2. At that 
period there were only two houfes in the panfli which 
had ftone chimnies, the houfe of Barra and the manfe. 
Since that time, three of the heritors have built manfion- 
houfes ; and within thefe few years, feven neat and com- 
modious houfes have been ere&amp;ed, upon different farms 
within the eftate of Barra. 

Manure and Fuel— The principle mariure is that which j 
the cattle afford. Of late the farmers have begun to bring 
lime from Aberdeen and Newburgh, Englilh and Scotch 
fhells, and fome powdered lime from Udny and the 
Buchan country. Some years ago it was to be had at Pit- 

njedden. 



of Bourtie.

medden. The principal fuel is peat, and fome turf from 
the moors and furface of the peat-mofs. 

Antiquities. — On the fummit of the hill of Barra, 
there are the diftinct remains of a camp, of a circular 
form, in extent near to 3 acres, and furrounded with 3 
ditches. It goes under the name of the Cummin's Camp. 
The Cummins were a bold and numerous race of people, 
who are faid to have been proprietors of the greateft part 
of the Buchan country, and difaffecled to King Robert 
Bruce. After the battle near Inverury, where the king's 
arms were victorious, he marched his troops, ftormed this 
camp, and put the Cummins to flight. It is probable 
this camp had been originally formed by the Danes, as it 
feems to have required confiderable time and labour to 
execute it, and that the Cummins had taken poffeffion of 
it as an advantageous poft. In the church-yard there is a 
long rough ftone, cut out into a coarfe ftatue of a man. 
The traditional report is, that it was done for the cele- 
brated Thomas de Longueville, the companion of Wallace, 
who was killed in ftorming the above mentioned camp, 
and is buried here ; but all this refts upon uncertain tradi- 
tion. There are three Druidical temples here, two of 
them pretty entire. 

Heritors and Stipend. — There are 5 heritors, none of 
whom at prefent refide. The flipend is L. 42 : 4 : 5 in 
money, 32 bolls of meal, and 16 bolls of bear. 

CharaBer of the People. — They are fober, induftrious, 
and peaceable. Since 1744 none of them have been tried 
before a criminal court. 



Advantages

Statijlical Account 



Advantages and I)if advantages.— -The advantages arc 
the fobriety of the inhabitants, (not an alehoufe being in 
the parifb), and the diligence of the women in knitting 
{lockings. They are far from lime, and it requires a con- 
fiderable fhare of their fummer labour to provide fuel. * 

* The rife of farm fervants wages is very remarkable. When the pre- 
fent incumbent was fettled in I 744, the half year's wage of men fervants 
was from 8 s. to 15 s. Sterling. The prefent rate is from L. 1, 10 s. t»

<p>St it/at ion, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

THE parilh of Crail lies upon the eaft point of the coun- 
ty of Fife. It is bounded on the S. by the frith of 
Forth, and on the E. by the German ocean ; its form is 
irregular, and breadth unequal ; its greateft length from 
Fife's Nefs to Kingfcavin Mill, is about 6 Englifh miles. 
The number of acres cannot be exactly afcertained. The 
valued rent is L. 13,682 : 13 : 4 Scots. As the valuation, 
from the early cultivated ftate of this part of the country, is 
in general high, it is probable that the real rent does not ex- 
ceed it in fo great a proportion as in many other diftri£ts of 
Scotland. — The general appearance of the country is flat and 
naked. At a very little diftance from the high water mark, 
the land rifes abruptly from 20 to 60 or 80 feet above the

and have an unhealthy appearance. The ftrong breezes 
from the fea contribute much to retard their growth. They 
thrive beft at Ardrie, which has encouraged the prefent 
proprietor to make feveral additional plantations. The 
foil is excedingly various. It is found of all kinds, from 
the richeft deep black loam, and drieft fharp channel, to the 
pooreft thin wet clay. The value is confequently as va- 
rious, from 3 s. or 4 s. to L. i, L. 2, L. 3, L. 4, and in one 
inftance to L. 5 an acre. The manures employed are lime, 
dung, and fea-ware ; which laft is caft upon the flaore in 
great quantities •, and upon many fields produces as good 
crops of barley, wheat, and turnips, as can be raifed from 
dung. 

Agriculture, ifc. — In the mode of farming, there 13 no- 
thing peculiar to this parifh. The crops, and their rotation, 
are in general the fame as along the reft of the coaft of 
Fife. The ploughs are of the new conftruftion, and uni- 
verfally drawn by two horfes. No threfhing mills are yet 
ere&amp;ed. Where the land is good, potatoes are generally 
planted as a preparation for wheat. An acre may produce 
from 40 to 60 bolls ; 1500 or 2000 bolls are annually ex- 
ported to the foreign and Englilh markets, from 45. to 6 s. 
the boll. The trades people frequently rent fmall portions 
of land from the farmers, which they plant with this ufeful 
root. At their leifure hours they hoe and drefs their little 
lots, an exercife which contributes both to their intereft and 
to their health. In this way, after fupplying the family, a 
few bolls are frequently procured for fale. The rent, when 
paid in money, may be' at the rate of L.3 or L. 4 an acre; but 
a more common way is for tfte tradefmen to give the feed 
and labour, allowing the farmer half the produce. Drilled

beans are raifed in the neighbourhood of the town in great 
quantities, and of an excellent quality. The crops of 
wheat, oats, bear and barley, are plentiful. Partly perhaps 
from prejudice, and partly from a wifh to accommodate 
their practice to the general nature of the foil, which is ra- 
ther late, as lying upon a cold bottom, many of the farmers 
in this and the neighbouring parifhes, Hill prefer for feed a 
mixture of bear or big and barley, in different proportions, 
which they call Ramble. Though they admit, that when 
equal quantities of thefe grains are mixed together, and 
the produce repeatedly fown, the barley in a few years is 
found generally to prevail yet they are of opinion that 
they can depend moft upon this mongrel crop. They think 
that the bear, as being the earlier and hardier plant, cherifti- 
es the tender barley, and pufhes it forward in its various 
ftages ; that from its fuperior ftrength of ftraw, it prevents 
the barley from lodging fo much as it is apt to do, when 
fown unmixed, a circumftance peculiarly prejudicial upon 
a damp foil, from the great quantity of undergrowth it is 
difpofed to fend up ; and that, from the fame quality, it 
affifts much in winning and preserving the whole crop in 
late and rainy feafons. Experience without doubt confirms 
in fome meafure the truth of this train of reafoning but 
how far thefe advantages are counterbalanced by the infe- 
riority of this mixed kind of grain to pure barley, yet re- 
mains to be afcertained. Great quantities of thefe grains, 
with a full proportion of beans and wheat, are fent every 
( year to Glafgow, and its neighbourhood. The open- 
ing of the Canal between the Forth and the Clyde, has 
been of immenfe advantage to the farmers and landholders 
in this part of the country, who formerly could find no 
good market for what corns they raifed, beyond what was 
required for home confumption. The principal farms, a- 
bout 20 in number, are of a moderate fize. Though feve-

ral fmall ones were united, when the laft leafes were grant- 
ed, yet the population of the country has not been fo ma- 
terially affected by this meafure as by the gradual fup- 
preflion of cot houfes, and a redudion of the number of 
hands employed in agriculture, by the changes which have 
taken place in the mode of farming. A part of two e- 
ftates is not under leafe, but let from year to year in pa- 
fture ; and the principal heritors, with their families, are ei- 
ther gone from the parifh altogether, or at moll but occa- 
fional refidenters. A great proportion of the pariih ftill 
continues uninclofed. Much has been done, but much ftill 
remains in refpeft of draining, which has always been 
found a moft beneficial improvement. With a very few 
exceptions, the farm houfes and offices are bad; an evil 
which, it is hoped, will be remedied when new leafes are 
granted There is no doubt but. in the end, the landholders 
would find their advantage in this. The tenant, who, at the 
rifle of a val uable flock, is anfwerable for a rent of L. 100, 
L. 200 or L. 300 a-year, is entitled to good accommodation. 
In the prefeqt improved ftate of fociety, a man of fpirit or 
property has no encouragement to engage with a farm, 
where he and his family muft be obliged to live in a hovel, 
deftitute of every convenience and comfort. About half 
the valued rent of the pariih belongs to Mifs Scott of Scot- 
ftarvit, a young Lady, whofe amiable difpofition affords the 
faireft profpect, that her ample fortune will be directed in a 
manner highly advantageous to the interefts of humanity in 
general, and to the particular improvement of thofe parts 
of the country, in which fhe has an immediate concern. 
Befules the farmers redding in the country, about 12 or 15 
live in the town, who cultivate from 3 to 20 or 30 acres 
each, partly rented, and partly their own property. Thefe 
are an induftrious clafs of men, whofe numbers it is to be 
wilhed may not be reduced. Several of them are in the

pra&amp;ice ot letting their carts and horfes for hire for various 
ptirpofes, particularly for bringing coals to the inhabitants 
either from the harbour or the neighbouring collieries. 

Minerals. — In former times coal has been wrought both 
in the eaft and weft fields of Crail. Veftiges of the pits 
and mines are eafy to be traced. It is probable that no 
machinery was ufed, and that the crop-coal only, where it 
was level free, has been exhaufted. In times of fcarcity, 
the poor people have from time immemorial, been in the 
practice of digging the thin feams of coal among the rocks 
along the fea-thore ; while they were thus employed a few 
weeks ago, within the high water mark, a gold coin of 
Queen Mary's was found, about 3 feet below the furface* 
under a flratum of rock, from whence the coal had former- 
ly been wrought. It is dated 1553, and is intrinfically 
worth 11 s. or 12 s. in the pofTeffion of Captain Whyte of 
Dyfart. Limeftone is alfo found by the fea-lide in fmall 
quantities. There are feveral quarries of it in the interior 
part of the pariih, upon the town's moor, and the lands of 
Newhall, belonging to the Honourable Henry Erfkine. 
But though it is of a pretty good quality, yet, owing to its 
great depth, the working of thefe quarries has been pro- 
ductive of little profit to thofe who have opened them. 
There is plenty of freeftone ; but, in general, it is by no 
means remarkable for its goodnefs. 

Borough of Crail. — Crail is a place of great antiquity., 
The name formerly written Carle, Caryle and Carraille f 
is fuppofed to fignify, in the Gaelic, its fituafion upon a 
fmall winding or bending of the more. By fome of the 
old hiftorians, it is mentioned as a town of confiderable 
note, fo early as the middle of the 9th century. It confifts 
of two parallel ftreets, extending eaft and weft along the

more, which is here prettj deep and high. The one up- 
on the N. is wide, tolerably well built, and paved. The 
fouth or Nethergate is not paved ; and though, in point of 
fituation, perhaps naturally pleafanter than the other, has 
of late fallen greatly to decay. The whole town bears e- 
vident marks of having feen better clays. As almoft eve- 
ry houfe has a yard or croft belonging to it, the town co- 
vers a confiderable fpace of ground. Owing to this cir- 
cumftance, and to its high fituation in the immediate vici- 
nity of the fea, without trees or hills to afford occafional 
fhelter, it enjoys a pure, uniform temperature of air, high- 
ly favourable to the health of the inhabitants, without pro- 
ducing, however, any remarkable inftances of longevity. 
In the paridi, there are feveral above 80, but none above 
90 years of age. Crail is a royal borough, and fends a 
member to Parliament, in conjunction with Kilrenny, the 
two Anftruthers and Pittenvveem. It received a charter 
from Robert the Bruce, which was fucceluvely confirmed, 
with feveral new grants, by Robert II. Queen Mary, 
James VI. and Charles I. By thefe charters, its privi- 
leges extend from the middle of the water of Leven, to the 
water of Puttekin, which falls into the fea at Pitmilly burn 
mouth, with a right to the filhings, tolls, anchorage, &amp;c. 
in all the harbours and trefeks within thefe bounds. Ac- 
cordingly the cuftoms are regularly collected between 
Crail and Pitmilly. Pittenweem and Anftruther Eafter 
were burdened with an annualrent or reddendo, when they 
were erected into royal burghs. The other places between 
Crail and Leven do not appear ever to have been in ufc 
of making any fuch payment for their anchorage and cu- 
ftoms j but the queftion has never yet been decided, whe- 
ther the Town of Crail has or has not loft thefe, with fe- 
veral other rights and privileges. About the beginning of 
this century, Crail was the great rendezvous for the her- 
ring .

ring filhery in the frith of Forth. Befides a great num- 
ber of boats fitted out and manned by the fiftiermen and 
others belonging to the town, feveral hundreds aiTembled 
from different parts of the country, particularly from An- 
gus, the Mearns and Aberdeenlhire. Thefe were fupplied 
by the inhabitants with nets, for the ule of which they re- 
ceived a certain proportion of what was caught. Immenfe 
quantities of herrings were cured for home confumption,. 
and for exportation. The Drave, as it is here called, was 
feldom known to fail. The filherman expected it as cer- 
tainly as the farmer did his crop. Almoft all the people 
in the place derived their fupport from it, the other fifhe- 
ries, and the trade and manufactures which were immedi- 
ately connected with them. A fad change has now taken 
place ; and we liften as to a fairy tale, to the accounts gi- 
ven by old people of what they remember themfelves, or 
have heard related by their fathers. For half a century,, 
the fifheries here have been gradually declining.. The. 
herrings, for feveral years paft, have neither vifited the 
coaft in any considerable quantity, nor remained long e- 
nough upon it to i'pawn as formerly. This is partly to be- 
afcribed to unfavourable weather ; partly to the flioals be- 
ing broken by the bufs fifliing upon the N. E. coaft o£ 
Scotland, which was not the cafe during the flourilhing pe- 
riod of the filhery here ; partly to the encroachments of 
our neighbours the Dutch, who occafionally fweep our 
coaft with zjleet of nets, extending feveral miles in length* 
at no greater diftance than 2 or 3 leagues from the more 
and parrty perhaps to the induftry of man, having thinned 
this fpecies of filh. This conjecture is not fo vague, as 
fome at firft fight may be apt to imagine. In addition to- 
the havock made by the Britilh and Dutch filhermen, im- 
menfe quantities have of late years been killed upon the 
coafts of Sweden and Norway. The herrings, crowding 

into 



446 



Statifltcal Account 



into the narrow bays and creeks, are there inclofed by 
nets, which are hauled upon the beach by the aid of cap- 
ftans, where after curing what may be required for the 
market, the reft by millions, are immediately boiled down 
into oil, in cauldrons erected for that purpofe on the more. 
To the circumftance, of the herrings not having fpawned 
for feveral years paft upon this part of the coaft, muft in a 
great meafure be afcribed the want of haddocks, which 
formerly ufed to be caught here in great quantities. About 
eight or ten years ago, the price was 2 s. id. the long hun- 
dred, /. e. 132. At prefent, if one or two happen to be 
caught, they are greedily bought for 4 d. or 6 d. a-piece« 
The fifheries of great cod and fkate are ftill good, but very 
precarious for open boats, as the beft fiftung ground lies fa*" 
off more. About 20 or 25 thoufand lobfters are fent e- 
very year to the London market. Ten years ago, there 
was double the number. The price is L. 12, 10 s. the 
thoufand.

Relief. 

The great excefs of the females above the males, in the 
article of children, above 8 years of age, is-occafioned by the 
young men going to fea, &amp;c. while a great proportion of 
the girls remain at home with their parents. Jn the town 
of Crail there are 7 incorpprated trades. The number of 
freemen, journeymen and apprentices, as they flood upon 
the roll in 1792, is as follows : 

Smiths, 5 freemen, no journeymen nor apprentices. 
Wrights, 8 freemen, 7 journeymen and apprentices. 
Weavers, 35 freemen, 21 journeymen and apprentices. 
Tailors, 12 freemen, 1 journeyman, 

Shoemakers, 18 freemen, 1 1 journeymen and apprentices. 
Coopers, 3 freemen, no journeymen nor apprentices. 
Bakers, 7 freemen, 1 apprentice. 

Several of thefe freemen are not engaged in their refpec- 
tive trades. At prefeut there is but 1 working cooper, 
though this trade was formerly very flourifhing. In the 
country there are 2 fmiths, 5 weavers, 1 fhoemaker, 1 ma- 
fon, and 1 miller. Befides thefe, there are in the town, 
2 hairdreffers and barbers, 1 butcher, 1 1 mafons, 6 brewers, 
who alfo retail ale and Britifh fpirits, 1 vintner, and 3 others 
who retail ale, porter, and fpirits, 1 furgeon, 1 writer, 1 mi- 
nifter, 1 fchoolmafter, 1 fuperannuated ufher, 6 retail fhop- 
keepers, and 1 miller. — Belonging to this port, there are 
6 floops from 25 to 60 tons, 1 brig of 150 tons, and 1 floop 
upon the ftocks. Thefe veilels are navigated by 25 men. 
The number of failors belonging to the town, but failing 
from other ports, is very fluctuating. During the late 
French and American war, 72 men from the town and pa- 
ri ft 



of Craih 449 

riih of Crail, entered on board his Majefty's fleet ; a fmall 
proportion returned home. Six boats are employed in the 
white or cod fifhing, and 6 fmaller ones in the lobfter fifti-. 
ing. The number of men required to work them, is about 
45 or 50. In 1791, 13 large boats were fitted out for th&amp; 
herring fimefy, each carrying 7 men. Upon the ifland of 
* May, which, quoad faera, has always been confidered fince 
the Reformation as part of the parifli of Crail, there were 
formerly 10 or 15 filhermens families, with a proportion- 
able number of boats. At prefent there are only 3 men 
and 2 women upon it, for the purpofe of taking care of the 
light. At Fife's Nefs there is only 1 boat, with 2 filher- 
men. The little village which is lituated there, is not now 
fo confiderable as it appears once to have been. In the prefent 
generally decayed ftate of the filheries along the eaft coaft 
of Fife, the people employed about them deferve every 
protection and encouragement from the country. Nothing

appear that Crail was once the feat of a priory*. A ruin 

evidently 

* This priory is not to be found in the lift of religions houfes in Scot- 
land at the rime of the Reformation. It was probably fuppreiTed long be- 
foie that period. While this conjecture is Hated with becoming diffi- 
dence, it is alfo proper to take notice of a tradition which fome have 
heard, that the above mentioned ruin is the remains of a chapel dedicated 
to St Rufus. The kirk of Grail, with the teinds thereof, both parfonage 
and vicarage, anciently belonged to the priory of Haddington. In the 
year 1517, upon the petition and endowment of Sir William Mjreton of 
Camho, vicar of L ath; ilk, Janet, Priorer* of Haddington erefted it into a 
collegiate church, with a pn.voft, facrift and feveral prebendaries. The 
provoft had a right to the vicarage tithes, upon entertaining a vicar 
penfioner, for ferving the cure of the parilh within the faid collegiate 
church ; and fix of the prebendaiies had annuities, payable out of certain 
lands and tenements of houfes, lying in the town and neighbourhood, 
mortified for that purpofc by Sir William Myreton. The church, quire 
and veftry, are ftill (landing, and ufed as the place of pubiic worfhip by 
the congregation. " An inventarie of the ornaments and of the fylver 
wark in the college-kyrk of Carraile," is in the pofleffion of the prei'ent 
minifter. It feems to have been hand Comely provided. Befides the high 
altar, there we e eight others, dedicated to the Virgin, St Catharine, St Mi- 
chael, St James, St John theBaptift, St Stephen, St John the Evangelift, ani? 
St Nicholas. It was in this church that the mob, inflamed by the preach- 
ing of the famous John Knox, began the work of abolifhing the monu- 
ments of idolatry in Fife, as their brethren had done at Perth a few days 
before. Having finiflied their operations here, they followed their apofto- 
lical leader to St Andrew's, where they aflifted in leveling its beautiful 
and fupeib Cathedral to the ground. About the time of the Reformation, 
Loid Lindefay feems to have obtained from the priorefs and convent of 
Haddington, a tatk of the tiends, both parfonage and vicarage, of the 
parochin a d paripj.kirk of Crail, for the.yearly rent of two hundred and 
fifty-five marks. By King James VI. the pari'h was disjoined from the 
priory, and ciecled into a feparate and it'dependant rcelory. The pa- 
tronage was vefted in Sir William Murray of Bclvaird, who prcfented'

evidently of great antiquity, the eaft gable of which is {till 
/landing, bears the name of the prior walls. A well in th e 
neighbourhood is called the briery, without doubt a cor- 
ruption of priory well; and a croft belonging to the 
burgh is defcribed in the valuation of the tiends 1630, as 
the prior croft. By the aft of Parliament * which disjoined 
the pariOi of Crail from the priory of Haddington, a third 
part of the tiend-fheaves was affigned for fupport of the 
minifter ferving the cure. The parifti being found too ex- 
tenfive it was judged expedient to divide it. Accordingly, 
in 1630, the lands of Kingibarns and others were erefted in- 
to a feparate parifti. A ftipend of 5 chalders of vi&amp;ual 
was affigned to the minifter, which was by the voluntary 

ad 

Mr William Murray to the benefice. Ho then religned the patronage in- 
to the King's hands in favour of J hn Lord Lindefa), who id (639 obtain- 
ed from Mr Murray a confirmation of the former tack of the tiends, for 
three lives and twice three nineteen years. 

The town of Crail having by fevera! charters obtained a grant of the 
collegiate church and its revenues, with the advocation, donation and 
right uf patronage of its provodry, prebcnJurc, chaplainaries, and chorif- 
try, diiputes began to arifV bet een them and Lord Lindefay concerning 
their refpeclive rights. To prevent law fuits, a coinpromife was entered 
into in J 630. by which the town's right to the collegiate church, and 
the place called the college, with the right of patronage as above, was 
confirmed; but their claim to emolument was expi efvly 1 eftrifted to the 
tithe 6% and the rent', fees and duties, which had been the efpecial pro- 
perty of the provoft and prebendaries. The parf mage and vicarage 
tithes excepting the tithe fifh, '.vere declared to remain with his Lordfhip 
and his fuccefiors. In 1774-6, the queftion concerning the right of pa- 
tronage to the parijh church was tried. By an interlocutor of i!ie Lord 
Ordinary it was given again '} the town, and the Earl of Craw ord, as fuc- 
•ceflor to Lord Lindefay, is now confidered as undoubted patron.

are patrons, and the falary, which is L. 12 a-year, is paid 
from the common good. The income of the prefent incum- 
bent, who is alfo precentor and feilion-clerk, may be about 
L. 40 a-year There is no houfe, nor garden annexed to the 
appointment. — The number of begging poor is only 6 or 
8 ; but there are upwards of 100 who receive ftated or 
pccafional charity. There are no poor rates : They are fup- 
plied from the following funds : i/i, The kirk-feffion funds, 
which arife from the rent of about 6 acres of land ; the in- 
tereft of L. 293 Scots •, the rent or feats in the church ; 
dues upon marriages when the bride is in the parifh ; the 
collections at the church-doors ; fome fmall feu-duties, and 
occasionally gifts from heritors and others. After paying 
neceflary fees and expenfes, thefe funds, upon an average of

the laffc 4 years, have afforded L. 30 a-year to 20 or 25 pen- 
fioners at 6 d. each the week, and L. 33 more to thefe and 
others in diftreffed circumftances, in occafional charities of 
money, coals, clothes, &amp;c. As benefactors to the poor, the 
families of Scotftarvit, Wormifton, and Sauchop, are men- 
tioned with peculiar pleafure. It may be proper to notice 
here, an excellent cuftom which has been eftablifhed in the 
parifh for more than a century. An annual collection is 
made at the church-door about Martinmas, for purchafing 
fhoes and other articles of clothing for the poor. The fum 
collected varies according to circumltances, from L. 3 to 
L. 7. A few guineas are always added by the feffion, fo 
that about L; 10 or L. 12 a-year are appropriated to this 
ufeful charity. 2d, The fifhing box. The funds of this 
charity arife from a fmall fee paid at entry into the fociety, 
the rent of fome land, and a half tithe of fifh granted by 
the town. From thefe are paid about L. 30 a-year in 
weekly penfions from 6 d. to 1 s. 6d. and from L. 6 to 
L. 10 in occafional charities. 3^, The failors box. The 
funds of this fociety arife from the rent of a few acres of 
land, and the intereft of a fmall fum of money. They 
pay about L. 10 a-year in ftated and occafional charities. 
4^, The intereft of L. 500 in the 3 per cent. S. Sea an- 
nuities 1 75 1, mortified by Robert Ramfay tailor in London 
for behoof of the poor of the parifh of Crail, under the 
management of the minifter and Town-council for the time 
being. The intereft of this fum is divided yearly among 
poor houfeholders. The whole funds for fupporting the 
numerous poor may be ftated to be, one year with another, 
L. 120 or L. 125 Sterling. It is to be wifhed that all the* 
non-rending heritors would annually contribute their cha- 
ritable mite, which in every point of view is a much better 
plan than the legal eftablifhment of poor rates.

Seats, Antiquities, ls?c— The only gentlemens feats in 
the parifh are Balcomie, Wormifton and Ardrie ; the houfes 
of Weft-barns and Newhall have been demoliftied. In 
the line of antiquities there is nothing very remarkable ; 
the prior walls, which ftand clofe to the fea below the eaft 
end of the town, have been already mentioned. Upon the 
point of land a little to the fouth-weft of the harbour, there 
are fome traces of a building, which has given the name of 
Cqfile Hyne to a fmall creek or inlet among the rocks. In 
the vicinity, fome ftone coffins have lately been found. The 
remains of an old caftle overlook the harbour upon the eaft. 
In it King David I. frequently refided ; hence Crail be- 
came a conftabulary, extending weftward to Kincraig 
Nooke. Sibbald, in his hiftory of Fife, fays, that this mo- 
narch died here •, in general, he is fuppofed to have died at 
Carlifle in Cumberland. The fimilarity of the names 
Carryle and Carlifle, has probably occafioned the miftake. 
Upon the lite of this caftle, a gentlemen has lately erefted 
a neat fummer-houfe, which commands a fine profpecl, and 
having a battery of fmall cannon mounted upon its top, it 
makes an excellent appearance from the fea *. 

Manufa&amp;ures, 

* In the lift of antiquities, the D nes dike mud: not be forgotten. It 
is the remains o : a bulwark :•' Jy Jlones, railed, it is fnid, in one night by 
the Danes, who having been defeated by the Scots at tLe water of Leven 
in v 74, retreated eaft ward till they came to the extreme point of Fife, 
■which they fortified in thi manner, to defend themfelves againft the at- 
tacks of their victorious enemies, till they had an opportunity of embark- 
ing on board their (hips, which we.c hovering in the mouth of the frith. 
The mound is quite overgrewn with grafs, but it is difti.ictly to be traced 
foi a coufiderahle way acrofs the poiat. The large fpnee which it in- 
clofes, with feme other circumftances which ftrike an attentive obferver 
upon the ground, might perhaps juftify fome degree of fceptieifm upon 
the; fubjecl. Near this dike is the '.mall cave in which the Danes put to 
dca h Conftantine the Scottifh Khg, whom they had taken prifoner in a 
fkirmifn as they retreated. The only other antiquity in the parilh which

Manufaclures, IsV. — The reader muft not expect to hear 
of the flour i thing ftate of trade and manufactures in this 
parilh. They are indeed in a very languishing fituation. 
The natural migration of commerce from fmall towns, 
where the Hock of the trader is inconfiderable, and the de- 
mand for confumption limited, to great towns, where the 
capitals of merchants are large, and the demands extenfive 
and conftant, has deprived Crail of any little portion of 
foreign trade which it formerly enjoyed. The various 
mercantile articles which are required, are brought weekly 
by the carriers from Edinburgh or Dundee, and occalional- 
ly from Leith by fea. Properly fpeaking, there is no ma- 
nufacture eftabliflied here. The women, however, are ge- 
nerally employed in fpinning lint yarn for the manufactu- 
rers in other places, to the extent of many thoufand fpin- 
dles every year. At prefent the price is from is.' 3 d. to 
8 d. the fpindle, according to the quality. A few fhoes 
are made for the market ; and nearly 40,000 yards of 
meetings, Ofnaburghs, coarfe brown linen, &amp;c. are wrought 
by the weavers for fale, over and above what is manufac- 
tured for private ufe. It is to be hoped, that by proper 
exertions, thefe, and other branches of bufinefs, will be 
gradually extended and improved. 

Advantages and L if advantages. — The parifh enjoys no 
peculiar advantages over thofe in the neighbourhood along 
the coaft of Fife. Its difadvantages are, the want of ftiel- 
ter, which expofes it to the blaft from every quarter. Its an- 
gular fituation, which circumfcribes its intercourfe to a fmall 
diftrift of country, and a fcarcky of running water, which 
difcourages the introdudion of any manufadure which re- 
quires

quires the aid of powerful machinery. The greateft dis- 
advantage of all is the badnefs of the prefent harbour, 
which only admits fmall veflels, is dangerous to take in bad 
■weather, and in fouth eafterly winds affords but indifferent 
lhelter. It has frequently proved fatal to the fiihermen, 
who often for many days together cannot go out or in with 
fafety, while boats from the harbours to the weft ward ex- 
perience no inconveniency. A little to the eaft of the 
town, there is a fmall bay or opening among the rocks, 
called Rome, for what reafon is not known, which at a mo- 
derate expenfe might be made an excellent harbour. It 
would have a good depth of water, could be ealily taken 
in all weathers, would be advantageous for a more perfect 
profecution of the fiihery, and of very confiderable ufe to 
the coafting veflels, when turning either up or down the 
frith in blowing weather. This is probably the place call- 
ed the old harbour in fome of the charters belonging to 
the town. 

Character of the People. — Of the character of his peo- 
ple, a minifter ought to fpeak with caution in a publication 
of this kind. To record their vices would argue impru- 
dence, as tending rather to irritate than-to reform. To 
trumpet forth their praife would favour of adulation. In no 
material feature of their character cio the people here dif- 
fer from their neighbours. The credulity of former times 
with refpeel to witches is almoft extinguished, and the little 
fuperftitious fancies, which fo frequently prevail among the 
commonalty, are gradually loling ground. The practice of 
inoculating for the fmall-pox has been much retarded, part- 
ly by religious fcruples, and partly by the expenfe of me- 
dical aid. To the cleannefs and commodioufnefs of their 
habitations, they are beginning to pay greater attention 
than formerly. When dreffed they are decently neat, ra- 
ther

tlier than fine. If they are not remarkable for fobriety 
and induftry, neither do they deferve to be ftigrnatized as 
diffipated and idle. Their ideas and fentiments are gradu- 
ally acquiring a greater degree of liberality. The ordi- 
nances of religion are refpc&amp;ed, a tolerable decorum of 
manners is obferved, though here there are exceptions as 
well as in every numerous fociety ; as fubjecls they are 
peaceable and loyal, and by no means fond of " meddling 
with thofe who are given to change." 

Mifeellaneous Obfervations. — Formerly there were four 
corn-mills in the parifh. At prefent there are only two 5 
one of them is turned by fait water, admitted during flood- 
tide into a refervoir, and diicharged ' upon the wheel after 
the tide has ebbed. The parifti is rated at about 50 plough - 
gates. For them the flatute-labour is generally paid in 
kind. It is commuted to private houfeholclers. The fum 
may amount to L. 12 or L. 14 a year. The road leading 
from Anftruther to St Andrew's, and paffing through Crail* 
is in tolerable repair. The ftatute-labonr is p6rfe£tly fuf- 
ficient to uphold it •, and if applied with vigour, might an- 
nually do fomething to the other roads within the parifh. 
If the middle road to St Andrew's were made, it would 
tend greatly to the improvement of the interior part of the 
country. The price of labour and provifions is nearly the 
fame as in other parts of Fife. James Shairp was fettled 
minifter of Crail in 1648. He continued to hold the living 
till he was confecrated archbifhop of St Andrew's, after 
the Reftoration. From the feffion records, it appears, he 
was a drift difciplinarian. The rigid prefbyterian parfon 
differed in circumjlances, rather than in cbarattcr, from the 
rigorous metropolitan. Of the many refpeftable gentle-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011189">FYVIE</name>, 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery 

of turreff.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Moir.</head> 

<p>Extent, River , &amp;c. 

THE parifh of Fyvie, though of confiderable extent, 
affords not much matter for Statiftical Information ; 
concerning the etymology of the name, I never heard even 
a conjecture hazarded. It is about 13 miles in length, and 
8 in breadth ; fuppofed to contain about 20 or 22,000 acres, 
8000 of which may be under culture, 120c in plantations 
and natural woods ; the remainder, moffes, heath, and 
rough pafture grafs. The fmall river Ithan, which takes 
its rife about 5 or 6 miles above this, after paffing through 
the parifh of Auchterlefs, and a part of Turriff", divides 
this parifh nearly into two equal parts, and falls into the 
fea at the Newburgh, a fmall village in the parifh of Fove- 
ran. On this river, there are two falmon fiihings, one at 
the mouth of it, and the other at Ellon, where there are 
cruives, which prevent the falmon from getting this length, 
except in great floods, and at fpawning time. But what 
this fmall river is remarkable for, is, the pearls that are 
fometimes found in it. In the years 1762 and 1763, there 
was a confiderable number found in it, many of which fold 
from is. to 6s. 8s. and 10 s. the pearl, and there were two 
of them fo large as to fell, the one at L. 2, and the other 
at L. 3 Sterling. 

3 Surface,

Statijlical Account 



Surface, foil, £sV. — The furface is very uneven, a great 
part being barren hills covered with heath ; a great part of 
them, however, appears to have been once in a cultivated 
ftate, as is evident from the ridges that are ft ill perceptible 
on them. Some of them have of late been planted. The 
Honourable General Gordon of Fyvie, the, patron and prin- 
cipal heritor, has of late inclofed and planted above 1000 
acres with oak, afh, plane, beech, larqh, pine, and common 
firs, all which are in a thriving condition. The foil is vari- 
ous, but in general kindly, and yields pretty good early 
crops of bear and oats, efpecially in the neighbourhood of the 
church and Fyvie Caftle. The more remote parts, parti- 
cularly near the moffes and moors, are of a colder nature 
and later. They are, however, capable of improvement, 
and a great part has of late been confiderably improved ; 
there being few or none of the farmers who have not a part 
of their fields in turnip and potatoes, and afterwards laid 
down in clover and rye grafs. The writer of this was a- 
roong the firft, who fet them the example by fowing grafs- 
feeds in the open fields, which, fucceeding very well, 0- 
thers were induced to follow the example. The time of 
fowing varies according to the feafon, and nature of the foil. 
It is commonly from the beginuing or middle of March to 
the middle of April, for oats. Bear is fown in the end of 
April y and throughout the month of May.- They begin 
to reap in the month of September, and in early feafons 
fooner. Oxen are generally employed in ploughing.  Some 
ufe 8 oxen, others 10, and fome 12, others 4 horfes, and 
fome 2 horfes and 2 oxen. The plough ufed for all thefe 
is on the model of the Englilh one, except in very ftony 
ground, where the Scotch one is employed. The rents are 
pretty reafonable, excepting fmall crofts, which generally 
give 30s. and upwards the acre, befides fervices and mill- 
multures, fo often taken notice of in this work, as unfa-

vourable to the indubious hulbandman. It is impoflible 
to afcertain what quantity of grain may be annually pro- 
duced in the parith ; but it is certin, that a large quantity is 
fold yearly out of it, over and above what is paid to the 
heritors as a part of their rent*. 

Air and Difeajes. — The air in general is reckoned pure 
and healthy. There have been no prevalent diftempers 
for fome time, except the putrid fore throat, which raged 
about two years ago, and proved fatal to feveral people. 
It has appeared alfo this winter, but is not fo violent and 
as formerly. The fmall pox alfo carries off fome, as inocu- 
lation is not very common. 

Character, 13 c. of the People. — They are in general de- 
cent and well behaved ; feldom frequenting the inn or ta- 
vern, but upon very particular occafions; generally fympathi- 
zing with thofe in diftrefs, and ready to give them fuch aluft- 
ance as they can afford. Their houfes are in general more 
neat and comfortable than they were 30 years ago. Their 
drefs and manner of living are alfo improved. 

Heritors, Rent, i$c. — There are 8 heritors in the pariih, 
The Honourable General Gordon of Fyvie, Earl of Aber- 
deen, Mifs Innes of the Moors of Fyvie, Gordon's Hofpi- 
tal, Aberdeen, James Leflie of Rothy, John Forbes of 
Blackford, James Gordon of Littlefolla, and James Hay of 
Monkmill. Only 3 of them refide. General Gordon be-

rent of the parilh may be from L. 2500 to L. 3000 Ster-

in order to fix the value of the teinds, which I fubjoin, to

Church y Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c— The church is an old 
building 90 feet in length within the walls, and 22 feet 
wide. It was repaired in 1776, at which time the feffion 
gave L. 20 for liberty to ereft a loft or gallery in the weft 
end, the feats of which they let at a moderate rent, for the 
benefit of the poor, for which they draw about zc per cent. 
for their money. There is an old delk in the church, 
ereded by one Watfon in 1502, which is ftill quite frefh 
and found. It is now one of the belt and moft commodi- 
ous old churches in the county. — The manfe was built in 
1762, but the offices ftand greatly in need of repairs. The 
ftipend was augmented in 1783, and is 1000 merks, in- 
cluding communion-element-money, and 6 chaldevs of 
vi&amp;ual, one of which is bear. The glebe is fmall, and in 
4 different parcels. Patron, General Gordon. Near the 
church, on the banks of the Ithan, are the ruins of a priory, 
faid to be founded by Fergus Earl of Buchan, in the year 
1 1 79, and his donation of it to the Abbacy of Arbroath 
was afterwards confirmed by Margaret, Countefs of Bu- 
chan, his daughter, who married Sir William Camming, 
Knt. who, by that marriage, became Earl of Buchan. 
From the appearance of the foundations, which were ex- 
tant fome years ago, it mould feem to have been 3 fides of 
a court, the middle of which was the church, and the 
2 lides the cells and offices of the monks. It does not feem 
to have been richly endowed, for the lands that belonged 
to it in this neighbourhood, amount only to L. 200 SterL 
of rent at this day. — To the weft of the church is the parifh- 
fchool, which in fummer is generally attended by about 30 
children, and 40 in winter. The falary is paid to the ma- 
fter in meal, by the farmers and crofters, which he is obliged 
to collect, and amounts (if exacf ly paid) to 1 2 bolls of meal 
annually. The fees of the fcholars are low. He has L. 2

the education of youth is at prefent carried 011 at this 
fchool on the moft approved plan ; and befides what is ge- 
nerally taught at v grammar fchools, the French and Englifh 
languages are taught here with as much purity and exacfc- 
nefs as in moft of the Englifh academies, (the prefent ma- 
tter having been feveral years in one of the bell academies 
in the neighbourhood of London), a circumftance which 
deferves to be remarked, as few country parifhes enjoy the 
like advantages. — The number on the poor's roll at prefent 
amounts to 24 . The only funds for their fupport are the 
weekly collections, fines, mortcloth-money, and the rent of 
the above mentioned gallery. There are few in the parifh 
who go about begging, except in very hard times. 

Roads. — The public road from Aberdeen to Banff, goes 
through the parifh. It is kept in pretty good repair by the 
ftatute-labour. There is a poft-ofnce on it at LefTes of 
Fyvie, not far from the church. 

ManafaBures. — The manufacture in which the women 
are chiefly employed, is that of fpinning wool, and knitting 
it into hofe. The hofe manufacturers in Aberdeen come out 
to different ftations every 4 weeks, and give out their wool, 
which they receive knit into (lockings. Thus, the work- 
ers are not put to the trouble and expenfe of providing 
materials for their work, but receive their wages punctual- 
ly when their work is done. Several of the men fervants 
alfo employ themfelves in the winter evenings, in knitting 
their own ftockings. A much better way of employing 
their time than frequenting the ale-houfe, of which there 
are only 3 in the parifh. 

MifccUaneous Articles. — There are in the parifh 13 corn- 
mills, in each of which there is a fanner and winnower, 
turned by the machinery of the mill, which not only faci- 
litates 



*

litates the peoples labour, but enables them to work in 
good and bad weather ; 2 fulling-mills, a barley mill, and 
a lint-mill, which was erefted in 1782, before which time 
there was fcarce any lint-feed fown in the parilh ; but now 
there are few farmers who do not fow fome quantity,, 
There is one threlhing machine, and another going to be 
erected, which is to be wrought by water. There are few 
farmers who have not a winnower in their barns. 

Population. — According to Dr Webber's report, the po- 
pulation then was 2528. The number of iouls at prefent 
in the parilh is 2194, of which 1059 are males, 1135 fe- 
males, 22 widowers, 74 widows ; 300 Diflenters, of whom 
3 are Roman Catholics, 12 Seceders, and the reft Nonju- 
rors, who have 2 places of worihip in the parilh. The 
births and burials are not exactly regiftered, the fmall tax 
impofed operating as a kind of prohibition ; but, from the 
belt information that could be procured, the following is an 
average of the births, burials and marriages for 4 years 
preceding 1793, viz.. Births, males 29, females 26, in all 
55 ; burials, males 25, females 22, in all 47 ; marriages n„ 

Trade/men. — Shoemakers 9, weavers 10, fmiths 7, tai-

PARISH of <name ref="NA">DRON</name>, 

(Count* of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stirling, 
Presbytery of Perth.-) 

By the Rev. Mr David Dow.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, &amp;c. 

r P , HE prefent and ancient name of this parifli, as far 
back, as can be traced, is Dron. Dronn, in the Gaelic 
language, is laid to fignify a 4 Ridge or Projection, a Hunch 
or Bunch and this probably is the true etymology of the 
name ; for it is obvioufly delcriptive of its lituation, of that 
part at leaft where the church and manfe are placed. They 
Hand on the ealtern extremity of a rifing ground, detached 

from 

* In order to give fome idea of the populoufnefs of this part of the 
country, it may not be improper to oblerve, that there are 20 pariflies in 
this prefbvtery exclufpve of the town of Perth, all of which lie round it at 
their common centre, and are all. except 4, within 6 miles of it. Thefe 
4 arc about 9 or 10 miles dirUnt from • erth. Six panlhes lie fouth of 
Earn ; 8, north of Tay j and the reft, including Perth itfelf, between the* 
Earn and die Tay.

from the hills, and formed like a ridge, floping on every 
fide to the N. and S. extending weilward with a gradual 
afcent, and terminating a little beyond a farm, which 
lies on the molt elevated part of it, and is named 
Weft Dron. There are feveral other places in different 
parts of the country, which have the fame name of Dron ; 
and they have all a ntuation fomevvnat fimilar. The pa- 
rim is fituated about a mile S. of the river Earn, and 5 
miles S. E. of the town of Perth. Tt extends in length 
from E. to W. between 3 and 4 miles, including a narrow 
ftrip of the lands of Pitkeathly, in Dumbarnie parilh, which 
interfefts it, and in breadth from N. to S. about 3 miles. 
The principal and lower part, ftretches, in a Hoping pofi- 
tion, along the bottom of the Ochil hills, which form the 
fouthern boundary of the rich and beautiful vale of Strath- 
earn, and prefents to the view of the traveller, paffing along 
the great road which leads from Perth to Kinghorn and 
the Queensferry, a very agreeeable profpecl: of well culti- 
vated and inclofed fields. The face of the hills here is va- 
rious. In fome places they exhibit an irregular and bro- 
ken furface, roughened by projecting rocks, and over- 
grown with furze ; but even there, considerable patches of 
torn land, producing barley and oats, are to be feen inter- 
fperfed. In others the defcent is more fmooth and regu- 
lar, uniformly green, and adorned with ftrips and clumps 
of plantation. Some are covered with an extenfive wood 
of firs, birch, alh, &amp;c. which at once ornaments the pro- 
fpeft and enriches the country. When fully grown, it will 
afford a copious fupply of timber for all necefTary ufes, an 
article grown fcarce, and much wanted here. A few farms, 
more extenfive than rich, occupy the higher part of the pa- 
f jfh, being fituated on the fummit of the Ochil hills. 



Climate

Statijlical Account 



Climate and Difeafes.— The higher ground poffefles, from 
its elevated fituation, a pure and wholefome air, though ra- 
ther keen and piercing ; but the lower part of the parifh 
cannot boaft of fo pure an atmofphere, for it is often loaded 
■with moid vapours, the common exhalations of deep and nar- 
row vallies, where flow rivers wind their courfe, and where 
much of the furface is covered during winter with ftagnated 
Water. The exiftence of agues, fluxes, rheumatifm, and o- 
ther kindred diforders of the human frame, is the natural 
confequonce of fuch a ftate of atmofphere. It cannot, how- 
ever, be faid, that the inhabitants, tho' occafionally attacked 
by thefe diforders, are in general unhealthy. Nature and ha- 
bit have a wonderful power to form the conftitution to its 
local refidence and deftination in life. Agues, formerly of a 
fgvere and tedious kind, were very prevailing ; the returns 
of fpring and autumn never failed to bring along with 
them this fatal difeafe, and frequently laid afide many of 
the labouring hands, at a time when their work was of the 
greateft confequence and necemty. For leveral years, how- 
ever, this difeafe, fo enfeebling to the human fyftem, has 
in a great meafure ceafed. This happy change may be 
owing in part to a different mode of living, and in part, 
probably, to the better and more general cultivation of the 
foil, conlidered as a fource of more pure and wholefome 
air. In this neighbourhood, large tracts of moorifh ground, 
•which lay totally negleded, and covered with water in 
■wiut.r and fpring, have lately been broken up, drained, 
and brought under tillage, or planted with timber, which 
abiorbs and exhaufts the fuperfluous moifture. Confump- 
tions are rather more frequent than formerly among the 
young, and often feemingly healthy and vigorous. They 
are no doubt fometimes owing to a radical weaknefs of 
conftitution, but more frequently to fedentary occupations, 
damp houfes, crowding the fick and the healthy together

in one bed, and to the pernicious cuftom of expofing them- 
felves, in a ftate of violent perfpiration, to the fudden im- 
preflions of cold. A large draught of cold water, in this 
ftate, has often proved the beginning of confumptions and 
dropfies *. 

Rivers, Springs, Minerals. — Though there are no rivers 
which run through this parifh, yet it is plentifully fupplied 
with water, by fprings and little currents which defcend 
from the hills. The only river which borders on the pa- 
rifh, and divides it from Abernethy, is Farg. It rifes in 

the 

* Scorbutic habits are not uncommon ; being every where, in a lefs or 
greater degree, to be met with But nature has provided a remedy for 
this difoider in the mineral waters of Pitkeathly in this neighbourhood, 
which have proved very effectual in fome of the worft and molt inveterate 
appearances of this malady, as alfo a fuccefsful palliative in fcrofulous 
diforders. The fmall-pox, through improper management, by keeping 
the patients too hot, and too long in their foul linen and clothes, and 
through the ft ill prevailing averfion of the lower claffes of the people to 
the falutary practice of inoculation, continue to carry off gre^t numbers of 
children. It is difficult to convince that part of mankind whofe minds 
have not been opened by education and reflection, that any innovation on 
the^cuftoms of their fathers can with propriety or fafety be introduced. 
A fuperftitious dread of acting contrary to the will of heaven, by intro- 
ducing difeafe into the human frame, not inflicted by the immediate hand 
of Providence, is the fentiment which deter- the weak but well-meaning * 
peafant, from adopting the practice of inoculation. But daily inftances of 
its happy effects begin to wear off this prejudice, and experience and ob- 
fervation have enabled many perfons to get the better of thofe ill-ground- 
ed fcruples, which they once thought it a part of religion to entertain. ' 
Another very fatal difeafe among children, and very prevailing, is that; of 
worms; which cuts off many, debilitates the conftitution of more, and is 
frequently attended with very violent and mocking fyrnptoms. No effec- 
tual remedy feems to be known for extirpating the'e pernicious ve:min 
from the human conftitution, when once, by neglecting to apply an e.irly 
check, they have been fuffered to obtain a feat in the bowels. Bad water, 
jn its raw ftate, and unripe fruit, contribute greatly to introduce and 
ftrengthen this habit, fo common and troublcfome to children.

the Ocbil hills, about 5 or 6 miles above, and runs through 
a deep and narrow glen for a considerable way, before it 
ifhVs into the plain ; and after a lhort courfe directly north 
it bends to the eaft, and lofes itfelf in the river Earn, at a 
place, which derives its name from it, called Culfargie. 
Though this river is often almoft dry in fummer, yet after 
long continued rains, or heavy fummer fhowers, it (wells in- 
to a dreadful torrent, and burfts from its narrow channel in- 
to the level of the Strath, with fuch irrefiftible impetuofiry 
as to fweep all before it. It abounds with fine trout, and 
is the fcene of an agreeable amufement to the angler in the 
proper feafon. Mineral fprings are frequent here, and 
by their fcum and fediment, indicate the existence ol me- 
tals in the neighbouring mountains. They are moftly of 
the chalybeate kind, but are not ufed for any medicinal 
purpofe, though, if tried, they might probably be found of 
fervice for bracing the ftomach and nerves. There are 
fome veins of limeltone in the pariuS ; but what has yet 
been difcovered, is of an inferior kind. It is not however 
improbable, that if fuel could be procured for burning it at 
a moderate expenfe, veins of good lime might be found on 
a more accurate fearch ; an article of great importance to 
the farmer, who at prefent is obliged to import it fiwm 
Lord Elgin's lime-works at Charlelfown, or to bring it in 
carts from the hills of Fife, the Lomonds, or Forthar, at 
the dill ance of 8 or 10 miles. There is fome free-ftone ; 
but feldom wrought, except on a particular, demand. The 
appearances of coal are fo great, that many attempts have 
been made to difcover it, by digging, boring, &amp;c. but hi- 
therto without fuccefs. Three different trials have been 
made within this parim fmce the year 1758, and fanguine 
hopes have been entertained, but as often difappointed. 
Our neareft coal-mines are at Keltie, at the diflance of 18 

mile.-

Allies fouth, from whence they are ufually brought in carts 
during fummer, for the fupply of all this country fouth of 
Perth. There is no mofs nearer than 8 or 9 miles. This 
fcarcity of fuel is feverely felt by the lower claffes of the peo- 
ple, who having neither cattle. nor carriages of their own, 
xnuft purchafe it from others who have, at a dear rate. 

Agriculture, &amp;c— The foil in the lower divifion of the 
parifh, though various, according as it approaches to the bot- 
tom of the hills, or the level of the Strath, is in general 
ftrong and fertile, confiding partly of clay, till, and loam, 
producing plentiful crops of wheat, beans, peafe, barley, 
grafs, oats, which is the ufual rotation obferved here. Tur- 
nip and potato are not yet raifed in any great quantities, 
{till lefs cabbage and yams. The nature of the foil does 
not feem adapted for the culture of flax, being too ftiff and 
moift 1 little therefore is raifed, except for domeftic ufe. 
The foil of thofe farms which lie on the hills is of a lighter 
kind, (hallow and interfperfed with rock, lying at the bot- 
tom of the furrow, and frequently jutting out above the 
furface. But in the flats and hollows the foil is good, and 
produces very tolerable crops, chiefly of barley and oats, j 
peafe only in fmall quantities. Of late wheat has been 
cultivated with fuccefs, as alfo grafs. Large trails, how- 
ever, in thefe farms are unfit for cultivation, and only af- 
ford an extenfive range of indifferent paflure for cattle. 
No fheep are now kept there, though the pafture is better 
adapted for that ufeful fpecies of animals than any other, 
becaufe they are fo apt to ftray into the neighbouring inclo- 
fures, and fo injurious to fences. From the elevated filia- 
tion of thefe farms, they are much expofed to fufFer from 
high winds and late harvelts. — Improvements in agricul- 
ture 



47 2 Statiflical Account 

ture have, within thefe laft 20 or 30 years, made a rapid 
progrek. Much uncultivated ground has been broken up, 
and is now become, through the united efforts of labour, 
IKitl, and expenfe, capable of producing good crops of eve- 
ry fpecies of grain. Fields which formerly lay open and 
expofed, and were ploughed in a carelefs and irregular 
manner, are now inclofed, ftraighted, and fubdivided. 
The fences, for moft part, confift of ditch and thorn hedge, 
often too flight, and too much neglefled, to prove either 
eiTe&amp;ual or durable. Some are conftrucled on a better 
plan ; a ftrong high earth fence, with a row of thorns on 
each fide, intermixed with trees of all forts. Formerly 
wheat crops were rare and fcanty, becaufe raifed on foil ill 
prepared to produce it ; but now great quantities of this 
grain are fown on every large farm, on ground thorough- 
ly fallowed, and manured with dung and lime. One great 
improvement in rural oeconomy is the introdudlion of 
threlhing mills, which the principal farmers are now every 
where ere&amp;ing, at a great expenfe, from L. 30 to L. 100, 
and above. As there is no convenient accefs to water here, 
thefe machines are all worked by 3 or 4 horfes, and require 
7 or 8 hands to carry on the operation. By this mode, 
70 bolls of grain have been cleaned and prepared for the 
field or the market in a few hours. The number of ploughs 
is reckoned to be about 25 ; but this is occafionally increa- 
fed, efpecially in the fpring, in order to carry on the ope- 
rations of that important feafon, with vigour and expedi- 
tion. Every plough is drawn by 2 horfes, without any 
driver, as the man who guides the plough has the entire 
command of them, by means of a long rein, which pafles 
from their heads to his hand, and refts on a hook inferred 
in the ftilts. The plough in common ufe is the Scotch 

plough,

'plough, conftrufted on the fame principles, but of neater 
workmanfhip, and with fome improvements, fuch as an iron 
head, and a bended plate of yetlin or Carron manufafture, 
for a mould-board. The practice of uling oxen m the 
plough, which till of late was fo general, is now entirely 
difufed ; but confidering the high puce of horles, the great- 
er expenfe of their food and furniture, and in cafe of acci- 
dents, their being totally unproductive of any reversion to 
the owner, it maybe a queftion, whether labour might 
not be carried on with much lefs expenfe by oxen, elpe- 
cially in thofe farms where the fields lie in a Hoping or 
hanging pofition, as they are known to pull more fteadily 
than horfes. This practice would likewife have a tendency, 
by leflening the demand, to reduce the prefent exorbitant 
price of horles. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the popu- 
lation at that, time amounted to 598. About the end of laft, 
and beginning of this century, the inhabitants of this parifh 
have been much more numerous than they are at prefent. 
This facl: is evinced by comparing the number of baptifms, 
(for we have no precife regifter of births), in one year, as 
marked in the feflion-records during tliefe different periods. 
Another proof of it ariies from the evident veftiges of feve- 
ral hamlets or little villages, which formerly were the refi- 
dence of petty farmers, cottagers, and tradefmen, but are 
now either totally fuppreffedj or exift only in a ftate of vifi- 
ble decay.

* There is no exact regifter of deaths. The only calculation, there- 
fore, which can be made of them, arifes from the ufe of the mortcloths, 
which are ufually two at leaft in every parifh, and being paid for, when given 
out, the money is Hated to account of cafli received for the poor. But 
this is fo inaccurate a ftatemeat in refpett of real deaths in the parifh, that

By the laft account which was taken of the number of 
fouls in this parifh about 18 years ago, when there was a 
propofal for embodying the Scotch militia, they amounted 
to 500, at prefent they do not exceed 450, which is a de- 
creafe of one-tenth part in fo fhort a period. This no 
doubt is principally owing to the modern pra&amp;ice of uni- 
ting feveral farms into one, and the fuppreffing of cottagers. 
Whatever advantages may arife either to the land older or 
tenant from this practice, it is evidently attended with fe- 
veral inconveniences to themielves, and to the country in 
general. Small farms and little villages, confuting of cot- 
tagers and tradefmen, were the nurferies of young perfons 
of both fexes, and afforded a conftant fupply of fervants, 
and plenty of hands for labour on every occahon. Fr m 
the fame fource, the market was plentifully iurnifhed with 
poultry, butter, cheefe, &amp;.c at a reafonable rate. Perhaps 
the prefent difficulty of procuring fervants, the great ad- 
vance of their wages, the fcarcity of hands for reaping the 
corns in harveft, and the exorbitant demands now made 
for their work in that feafon, with feveral other hardihips, 
all fenfibly felt by the farmers themfelves, and the fubject 
,of general complaint, may, in time, induce them to recur 

t 

•no certain conclufion can be drawn from it. For many of the inhabitants 
are buried in other pariflies, and confequently our mortcloths are not ufed. 
And for feveral poor people it is not demanded, or it is given gratis. In 
thefe cafes, the death of fuch perfons is not inferted in the parifh-regifcer. 
The record of marriages is likewife very inaccurate. Indeed there is 
rcafon to fufpect, that until thefe public regifters are put on a better foot- 
ing, the conclufions deduced from them will not b? very exact. An ac- 
curate regifter of births and deaths, fpecifying the age of each perfon at 
their death, and the diftempers of which they die, &amp;c. would afford very 
fatisfadtory evidence with refpect to the objects in view by fuch enquiries 
as the prefent. But to anfwer this purpofe, fome fmall falary might be 
ncceflary to the felfion-clerk or fchoolmafter, and would be a very accep. 
table, indeed ueccflary addition to their poor livings.

to the old practice of encouraging thefe little plantations of 
ufeful and indultrious labourers. By the fuppreffion of 
thefe, it may likewife be obferved, a number of people, 
who, from their manner of life and employment in the 
country, were a healthy vigorous race, have been, for the 
pre lent, forced to feek a fubfiftence in the neighbouring 
cities ; where the nature of their occupations, confined a- 
partments and unwholefome air, are by no means favour- 
able circumltancL-s for the increafe of population, or the 
health of the individual. 

Divijion of the Inhabitants, Morals, &amp;c. — The principal 
heritors of the parilh are 6, none of whom refide. There 
are, % or 3 feuars who hold of the proprietor of the lands 
of Potty ; they poffefs a few acres and refide. There are 
about 14 farmers, who rent land from L. 20, L. 30, or L. 50 
to L. 100, L. 2co, -nd L. 300. The reft of the inhabitants 
are tradefmen or artificers, a few cottagers and day-labour- 
ers. Thefe lalf, and a tew young men who hire themfelves 
for domeihe fervice in the winter, are employed in ditch- 
ing, draining, filhing, and working on the roads during the 
fummer featon. This increafes the difficulty of procuring 
men fervants, and enhances their wages. It may likewife 
be obferved, that the increafe of the linen manufacture, and 
the late introduction of machinery into that department, 
occafion a fcarcity of female-fervants. Many young wo- 
men, who ufed to go into fervice, find it more advantageous 
to ftay at home and fpin for the manufacturer, or to pur- 
chafe lint and difpofe of the yarn. By this mode of life, 
they feel themfelves independent, and more at their own 
difpofrl, which is no doubt an additional motive for prefer- 
ring it. But they overlook the ill confequence of their choice 
to health and vigour of conftitution, which is more than a 
balance for all their advantages. Their fedentary life, and 

want 



of Dron. 



477 



want of proper exercife ; their eager application and fcanty 
provifion, are all circumftances which conipire to enfeeble 
the conftitution, produce nervous diiorders, and bring on 
fexual infirmities, which render life uncomfortable, and 
hurry them into premature old age *. As to the general 
character of the people here, it is but jufKce to fay, that 
with a few exceptions, and fuch there always will be in 
every colleftion of human beings, they are a lober, peace- 
able, induftrious fet of perfons ; apparently contented in 
their various fituations. Crimes of an atrocious or capital 
nature are fcarcely known among them, or indeed any 
which require the interference of the civil judge. Even 
that fpecies of licentioufnefs, fo prevalent in many other 
places, I mean the illicit commerce of the fexes, is far from 
being frequent here. Many years elapfe without a {ingle in- 
ftance of this immorality ; a circumftance which deferves 
to be mentioned to their praife. They are in general de- 
cent and regular in their attendance on the public inftitu- 
tions of religion ; and as far as external appearances can as- 
certain the character, they are to be reckoned well difpofed, 
religious in their fentiments, and in general cautious and 

prudent 

* Price of Labour an! Provif'ons. — This article is greatly enhanced 

of late. In confequence of the increafe of riches, the great quantity of 

fictitious fpecie by the fubftitution of paper or notes, by means of which 

almoft every tranfa£tir,n is carried on; and on account of the fcarcity of 

hands, by the increafe of labour, workmen of all defcriptions have raifed 

their wages to nearly double ofwhat they ufrd to be 20 years ago The 

day-labourer has from ,o d. to 1 s. a-day ; carpenters, the fame ; mafons,

prudent in their conclud. There are a few families of Se- 
nders j no Epifeopals or Papifts. A great change has of 
late taken place with refpeft to drefs. The coarfe garb of 
the lower claffes of the people, which fatisfied their plain 
and homely predeceffors, is exchanged for fhowy and ex- 
pense garments. On every public occafion they exhibit 
an appearance of neatnefs and elegance, which a few years 
ago would have been confidered as highly extravagant. 
As this is an agreeable object in itfelf, when kept within 
proper bounds ; fo it affords a proof of the increafing riches 
of the country, and the growing tafte of the people. The 
better fort of farmers pofTefs good houfes and comfortable 
accommodation for their families ; live in a ftyle of weaith

Stipend, 

* Langvnge.— The language fpoken here is Scotch, with a provincial 
accent or tone ; the pronunciation rather flow and drawling, and apt to 
ftri!:e the ear of a ftranger as difagieeable. The language of all ranks, 
however, is improving by a more liberal education, and a more extenfive 
intercourfe with fociety. No Gaelic is fpoken here at prefent, or under- 
ftood by the inhabitants ; but it is faid to have been the common lan- 
guage, not only here in the neighbourhood of the Grampians, but even 
through the whole county of Fife, not above two or three generations 
back. An anecdote, communicated by a gentleman to the writer of this 
paper, gives countenance to this report : " By a letter," fays he, " which 
I had from Sir James Foulis of Colington, Baronet, a number of years 
ago, he informed me, that when young he had it from an old man, who 
fpoke Gaelic, that even in his time it was almoft the univerfal language 
of Fife." Be this as it may, it appears from the names of feveral places 
here, that they are of Gaelic extraction : for inftance, Baltnanno, ' The. 
Town of the Monk}' Kilknockic, ' A Cell or holy Ground, or Burial- 
place on the Hill;' Mutidie, ' The Hill or Mofs of God Tildic, ' The 
Refidence of the Bard of God, &amp;c. Thcfe names feem to have a refer- 
ence

Stipend, School, Poor, i£c. — The church and manfe are 
both old buildings, and have received frequent partial re- 
pairs. The latter of thefe continues, notwithstanding, a 
very damp and uncomfortable habitation. The Crown is 
patron. The ftipend confifts of a little more than 4 chal- 
ders of victual, wheat bailey and meal, and L. 36 : 7 : 9 
money, and a few bolls of coals. The glebe is 4 acres 
and about 16 falls or roods. There is no grafs ; in lieu of 
which, the heritors pay the minifter L. 20 Scots ; a very un- 
equal compensation, at prefent, for the maintenance of a 
horfe and two cows. — There is no fchool or fchool-houfe in 
the parifh. The fchool, at prefent, is taught in a fmall 
confined apartment, in a private houfe, and the fchoolma- 
fter has a fingle room for himfelf, in the fame houfe ; for 
each of thefe, the heritors pay 15 s. yearly. The falary is 
only ico merks. The fchool-fees are fmall, and the other 
emoluments few. Thefe unfavourable circumftances have 
occafioned a. rapid fucceffion of teachers, within thefe laft 
20 years. Every vacant fchool is an objecl: to a perfon 
who finds himfelf fo inconveniently fituated, and every 
change of a mafter interrupts and retards the education of 
youth. — There are no funds for the poor, except what arife 
from the weekly colle&amp;ions, which, as no heritor relides, 
are but fmall, and from the ufe of the mortcloths. Thefe 
together afford but a fcanty provifion for the poor. No af- 
feffrnent is laid upon the heritors, who, on account of their 
non-refidence, contribute nothing to the funds. They have 
however, been indebted to the generofity of one of the he- 
ritors, the proprietor of Potty, who has at different times 

voluntarily 

ence to fome religious eftablilhment with which they were connected ; 
and it is not improbable they might be detached but dependent parts of 
the abbey of Lindores ; the ruins of which Mil remain in the vicinity of 
the town of Newburgh, about 6 miles from this.

voluntarily contributed to the fupport and increafe of the 
funds. The poor are happily not numerous, and none are 
permitted to beg. There is a fmall piece of ground, about 
7 acres, adjoining to the minifter's glebe, which was morti- 
fied by a Mr William Bell, minifter here, 1641, and after- 
ward tranflated to the parilh of Errol, for the purpofe of 
maintaining a ftudent of divinity ; the management and dif- 
pofal of this mortification is in the hands of the prefbytery 
of Perth, who let the lands, and appoint the rent to be paid 
annually as a burfary to the ftudent whom they have cho- 
fen, and who continues in the poffeffion of it for 4 years. 
They are obliged to attend the univerfity of St Andrew's. 
The prefent rent of thefe lands is 12 guineas, exclufive of 
all public burdens, which are likewife to be paid by the 
tenant. Minifters fons in the prefbytery are preferred to 
all others. 

Ale-houfes. — There are only 3 ale-houfes, and thefe at 
fmiths fhops, places of general refort, where both the idle 
and the aclive mf-et. Every where they are the coffee- 
houfes of the parifli, where all the news and reports in cir- 
culation, be they of what complexion they will, true or 
falfe, probable or improbable, are brought together from 
every quarter, and diffeminated with a credulous affent 
over all the neighbourhood. Even the politics of the na- 
tion, are, at times, difcufled here with freedom, and 
decided on with confidence. Thefe are, however, but 
harmlefs and innocent matters, compared with that perni- 
cious cuftom of drinking and foaking, of which they are 
too frequently the occafion. It were much to .be wi.'hed, 
that honfes for felling fpiritous liquors were lets frequent. 
The pernicious prance of dram-drinking, now fo common, 
in confequence of the low price of fpirits, and the eafy 
terms on which the law allows them to be retailed, has a

moft unhappy influence, as well on the health as the morals 
of the people. Even the honelt and induftrious labourer 
isfometimes inadvertently drawn into this deflrudlive prac- 
tice. Exhaufted by his daily labour, and at times by more 
violent exertion, he feels the neceffity of fome cordial to 
recruit the wafted powers of nature, and Amply fwallows 
a poifon for a cordial •, he feels from it a temporary flow of 
animal fpirits, but is not aware that it waftes the conftitu- 
tion it feems to invigorate ; and when it grows into a ha- 
bit, deftroys in the end his health, his fubftance, and his 
virtue. Were ale or beer of a good quality, and moderate 
flrength, to be had at an eafy rate, it would prove, when 
temperately ufed, a very wholefome and recruiting beve- 
rage. In thefe interefling views, it may be fuppoltd an 
object worthy the attention of the Legiflature. 

Antiquities. — There have been in former times 2 fmUl 
chapels in this parifh. One of thefe, which flood in the 
eaft corner of the parilh, is now totally in ruins, no veftige 
of it remaining, except iome part of the foundation below 
ground, and human ikulls and bones, which are fometimes 
dug up, or difcovered in the face of a bank, where the foil 
is waihed away by the impetuous torrents of the Faxg, on 
the verge of which it has flood, juft at the place where it 
iffues from the mountains into the plain. The other is in 
the weft end of the parifh, and ftill remains in a ruinous 
ftate ; the walls are tolerably entire, with an inclofed buri- 
al-ground around it, which is ftill the place of interment 
for many families in the parifh and neighbourhood. This 
part of the parifh, which is entirely feparated from the 
reft, by an interjacent part of the parifh of Dtunbarnie, 
bears the name of Ecclefi^magirdle, the origin of which is 
uncertain; but probably hns been given in honour of iome 
faint; fome explain it to fignify " i he church of 6t Mag-

" dalen." Thefe chapels may probably have been place* 
of worfhip, erected for the conveniency of the religious in 
this corner, who were dependents on the Abbey of Lin- 
dores. 

Singular Phenomenon. — In that part of the Ochils which 
fronts the houfe of Ecclefiamagirdle, a very Angular phe- 
nomenon took place about 7 years ago. After a long feries 
of rainy weather, the hill, about 100 paces from the fum- 
mit, burft open with a loud explofion like thunder, which 
was heard at the diflance of two miles acrofs the valley. 
A violent and rapid torrent, mixed with earth and ftone, 
and broken rock, hTued from the opening, and ruflicd 
down with an impetuofity which fwept all before it ; the 
inhabitants of fome houfes which flood immediately be- 
low, alarmed at once with the noife and torrent, which di- 
rected its courfe full towards them, were preparing to flee 
for their fafety, when happily the torrent deviated into a 
different trad!:, and after continuing to flow for 10 or 12 
hours, it ceafed, without having done any material in- 
jury, and has remained quiet ever fince. 

Water-Fall. — In one of thofe chafms or gullies, by which 
the face of the Ochil hills is frequently interfered, nature 
has formed a fmall romantic fcene, beautifully diverfified. 
Nearly oppofite to the church and manfe, in a deep hollow, 
and in the concealed bofom of the gully, is a little cafcade, 
which, though on a humble fcale, is a curiofity of its kind. 
The accefs to it is difficult, which is by afcending up the 
rivulet, which flows down a deep and narrow gulph, af- 
fording little more than a paflage for the ftream, where 
the way is obftruaed by huge ftones, fhelving rocks, furze, 
and fpots of marfh. The difficulty of the afcent, however, 
is abundantly compenfated by the romantic variety of the 
„ feen* 



of Dron.

fcene. You fee the current Aiding from rock to rock, or 
guftiing into little cavities formed by its perpetual lapfe, 
pleafing at once the eye and the ear by its murmurs and 
meanders. When you reach the fall itfelf, you enter a 
kind of open grotto, furrounded with rocks, and fhaded 
with trees, whofe tops nearly clofe over the head, and caft 
a gloom, which adds to the romantic appearance of the 
fcene. The precipice itfelf, which is directly in front, is a 
rugged perpendicular rock, which bends itfelf on each fide 
into a femicircular form, inclofing a neat pebbly bafon, in- 
to which the defcending torrent throws itfelf. In its ufual 
ftate it is but a fcanty rill ; but when fwelled by winter 
rains or burfls of thunder clouds, it aflumes a formidable 
afpecl, rolls along a deep and turbid ftream, and gufhes o- 
ver the rock from its narrow channel with violence and 
precipitation, dtfhing into the pool below with a hideous 
noife, which ltuns the ear, and reverberates from rock to 
rock on every fide. 

RocMng Stone. — On the fouth defcent of the hill, oppo- 
fite to the church and manfe, Hands what is called the 
Rocking ftone of Dron, prefenting at once a monument of 
ancient ingenuity and fuperftition. It is a large mafs of 
whinftone, of an irregular figure, about 10 feet in length, 
and 7 in breadth, and Hands in a floping direction. On 
gently preffing the higher end with the finger, it has a per- 
ceptible motion, vibrating in an arch of between one and 
two inches, and the vibration continues for fome time after 
the preflure is removed. It is placed on a flat ftone in the 
earth, which, doubtlefs, has a fmall, though invifible exca- 
vation, to receive its centrical prominence, and to prevent 
it being thrown off its balance. Neither Buchanan, who 
has mentioned the rocking ftone of Balvaird, in his elegant 
Hiftory of Scotland, nor any other author, recollected at 

prefent

prefent by the writer of this, has taken any notice of the 
rocking ftone of Dron. That of Balvaird ftands at the di- 
ftance of between i, 3 miles eaft, on the banks of the 
Farg, in the parifh of Abernethy ; but its motion is not 
now perceptible, being choked up with earth and gravel clofe 
to its centre. For what particular purpofes thefe {tones, fo 
artfully formed, were eredted, is at this diftance of time a 
matter rather of conje&amp;ure than certainty ; but little doubt 
can be entertained, that they were defigned to be the filent 
inftruments of impofition on the credulity and ignorance of 
the vulgar ; the ingenious but difhoneft contrivance of the 
priell, or the politician, to ferve their own intereflcd views. 
It may be obferved here, as a fort of curiofity, that from 
the great height of the Ochil hills, a number of houfes in 
this parifh, which lie at the foot of thefe hills, are deprived 
of the fun for 3 months of the winter, from the beginning 
of November to the beginning of February, during which 
period, the rigours of that feafon muft be more feverely 
felt by the inhabitants ; and fcanty fires, (where fuel is 
fcarce and diftant), afford but a forry fubftitute for the 
chearful rays and genial influences of that all animating lu- 
minary.

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5037152">CAPUT H</name>, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stirling, 
Presbytery of Dunkeld.) 

By the Rev. Mr William Innerarity.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation and Extent. 

THE ancient name of the parilh was Capoch; its mo- 
dern name is Caputh, and is probably derived from 
the Gaelic word Keapoch, ' a decayed wood but from 
what circumftance this name took its rife does not appear. 
It is lituated in that diftrict of Perthfliire which is called 
the Stormont, and comprehends the greater part of the 
plain of the Stormont, (a portion of the extenfive vale of 
Strathmore). In the Lives of the Bifliops of Dunkeld, by 
Alexander Mylne *, Canon of Dunkeld, it is related, that 

Biftxop 

* He lived in the times of George Brown, Bifhop of Dunkeld, from 
I484 to 1514, and of his fucceflbr, the celebrated Gavin Douglas, to 
whom his work is dedicated. The original M. S. is in the pofleffion of 
the Duke of Atholc.

Bifhop Brown, in the year ijoc, divided the parifh of Little 
Dunkeld into the old parifh ot Little Dunkeld and the parifh 
of Caputh; and, " at Caputh lie built, on his own charges, a 
quire, with painted cieling and glazed windows. He gave 
for the fupport of the vicar, a vicarage, which had been for- 
merly united to his own fee. four acres of glebe-land, 
and the riling ground called the Mute Hill *, to build a 
church upon." The parifh is lingular in its extent ; for 
befides what lies contiguous, there are feveral diftincf uncon- 
conn£r.ed portions belonging to it, fome in the county of 
Perth, and fome in the county of Forfar, 8 or ic, and even 
20 or 25 miles from the church f. It is , difficult to give 
a fatisfacfory reafon for fuch peculiarities. May it not be 
fuppofed, that thofe diftant places belonged anciently to 
fome confiderable proprietors in this parifh, whofe defire of 
having all their eflates in one parifh %, occafioned thefe 

extraordinary 

* Hence it appears, that the mount on which the church is built, (now 
called the Kirkhill), was the place where, in ancient times, public juftice 
was administered. It ftands 260 yards from the bank of the Tay, on a 
gentle declivity, in a beautiful and romantic Situation. 

\ Thefe it feems not improper to enumerate : Balholmie. locallv Situ- 
ated in the parifh of Cavgill ; Weft and Middle Gormack, in Kinloch ; 
Eaft and' Weft Logic, Cairns, Chappelton, Meadows and Crofty, in Clu- 
nie ; and Craigtown of Dalrulzian, in Kirkmichael ; all in Perthshire : 
And fouth • Bandirran, in Collace ; Balbeuchly, in Aughterhoufe ; 
Broughtay caftle and fiflungs, and a fmall piece of ground at Mylrjfield, 
near Dundee-, and Fofarty in Kinncttles ; all in Eoffarflure. In Fofai- 
ty there is a field of about 4 acres called, from time immemorial, " The 
Minister of Caputh's Glebe," and is. believed to belong to him, though 
not hitherto occupied. 

% The following words of Dr Johnfton may feem to, favour this con- 
jectures " When Christianity was established in this ifland, a regular 
mode of public worfhip was prefcribed. Public worfl.ip requires a pu- 
blic place ; and the proprietors of lands, as they were converted, built 
churches for their families and vaflals. For the maintenance of mimfters,

extraordinary annexations ? Befides thefe remote portions, 
(which are confidered as belonging, quoad facra, to the pa- 
rimes in which they are refpedively fituated), the parifb. is 
of confiderable extent, ftretching from N- W. to S. E. 
nearly 13 miles, and varying in its breadth from 1 to 
64 miles. 

Soil and Land, Floods. — The foil is various. On the 
high grounds it is moftly a cold wet clay. On the banks 
of the Tay and Ifla, it is in general a light loam. The 
ground is fo flat, that when thefe rivers are flooded, they 
overflow many hundred acres. Four remarkable floods 
have happened in the Tay, in the courfe of 30 years, in 
1 76 1, 178c, 1789 and 1 79 1. In the fpring of the year 
1790, in confequence of gradual breaches made by the river 
on the green Inch, below Inchtuthel, two oak trees were 
uncovered. The trunk of the largeft, from the root to the 
loweft branch, was 40 feet 6 inches long, and contained 
132 feet 9 inches of folid meafure. As fimilar oaks have 
been often difcovered near the place, by means of fimilar 
encroachments on the bank, in the fpring and autumnal 
floods, it appears in the higheft degree probable, that they 
had grown on the fpot. Hence we are led to believe, a- 
greeably to traditionary accounts, that the country was well 
wooded in former times. The Tay has undoubtedly taken 
various directions, at different periods, through the plain. 
Delvin, though now and for many ages fituated on the 
north, is faid to have been on the fouth fide of the river *. 
It feems, however, more likely that it was always occa- 

fionally 

fich minifter was required to extend his care, was, by that eircumfcrip- 
tion, conftituted a parifli. This is a pofition fo generally received ia 
England, that the extent of a manor, and of a parifli, are regularly re- 
ceived for each other." BofweU's Life of Johnfon, vol. I. p. 410.

fionally infulated by the Tay ; and this fuppofitioa is fa- 
voured by its fituation, and by its ancient name, Inch-tuthd f 
that is, an " ifland in a flooded ftream." 

Hills and Woods. — The north and weft parts of the pa- 
rim are hilly, and contain quarries of excellent blue flates, 
which are fold on the fpot at L. i the thoufand, and are 
carried to a confiderable diftance. The higher hills are 
covered with heath, mixed with dwarf juniper, the lower 
with furze and broom. They are generally of a rocky ap- 
pearance. Some of the latter are clothed with natural 
woods of oak, alh, birch and hazel ; others have been 
planted with firs, larches, and other foreft-trees, of which 
large plantations have likewife been formed in the low 
part of the parifti, within the laft 20 or 30 years ; but 
there is (till need of more woods, not only for fhelter and 
for ornament, but alfo to fupply the inhabitants with fuel 
and timber. 

Climate, Diflempers, i£c. — The air is dry and healthy, 
but fenfibly different in the N. and S. parts of the parilh, 
being temperate on the banks of the Tay and the Ifla, and 
cold and keen on the hills*. About 50 years ago, the ague 
was very prevalent in the plain ; but fince the marfliy 
grounds were drained, it has difappeared. The diforders 
moftly to be met with, are hyfterical and nervous affections, 
confumptions, and worms. The violent nervous fymptoms

* Having been favoured with a ftate of Fahrenheit's thermometer for 
the laft 10 years, taken at Delvin, at ri o'clock at night, I fubjoin an ab- 
ftraft of the greateft and leaft heights. To this I am enabled to add a 
fimilar abftradl of the greateft and leaft heights taken at the fame hour 
in Queen-Street, Edinburgh, for the fame years. From thefe abftracts an 
idea may be formed of the general temperature cf this climate compared 
with that of the capital. Delvin is in 56* 33' North Latitude.

with which the country people are fome times feized, are 
fuppofed to be owing to their extreme inattention to their 
drink and clothing, when they are over heated by their 
fummer work. Spinning, which is the employment of the 
young women during the winter months, is juftly reckoned 
the occafion of confumptions among them, by the wafte of 
faliva requifite in that laborious exercife. Some medical 
pra&amp;itioners think, that worms in children are the effecls 
of their living fo much on potatoes, which they prefer to 
oat-meal. The people in general have weak eyes, from the 
fmoke of their houfes, and fine teeth even to old age.

mont, runs a chain of fmall lakes, The lochs of Craiglufh, 
of Lows, of Butterftown, of Cluny, and of Drumelie. 
They are connected by the rivulet or burn of Lunan ; which 
taking its rife in the firfl-, paries through all the reft, and at 
its mouth, where it falls into the Ifla, forms the eaftern- 
boundary of this parifh. The three firft mentioned lochs 
are wholly in the parifh, and it touches the other two on 
their fouth fides. Excellent pikes, perches, trouts, and eels, 
are found in them. The falmon-fiihing in the Tay is now 
inconfiderable ; and the price is fo much enhanced by the 
great demand for the London market, that little is left for 
the ufe of the country. The falmon caught in the Ifla is in- 
ferior both in fize and quality to that in the Tay. 

Migratory Birds. — Of thefe, the cuckoo, f wallow, lap- 
wing, fandy-lark, plover, rail or corncraik, feagull, fea-raag- 
pie, piclarny or kittywake, curlew or whaap, and clocha- 
ret, are fummer birds. The fieldfare, woodcock, and wild- 
geefe, are winter birds. The fwallow appears about the 
14th of April ; the earlieft time of the cuckoo's being 
heard, is the 25th of April, but ufually not before the 2d 

or

Population. — It is a fubjedt of regret, that the feflion re- 
cords of country parifties have been generally kept in a 
manner fo flovenly and negligent, that it is now almoft im- 
poflible to form a juft eftimate of their population a century 
ago, or even lefs. There is alfo a peculiar difficulty in ma- 
king fuch an eftimate with regard to this parifti. Previous 
to the year 1728, its population was greater than it could 
be expedled to be at any fubfequent period ; becaufe thofe 
diftant parts (already noticed) which are locally fituated in 
Cluny and Kinloch, and thofe which are immediately ad- 
jacent to the town of Dunkeld on the N. and W. were then 
Joined refpe&amp;ively to thefe parifties quoad facra, in confe- 
quence of a formal recommendation of the Prelbytery ; 
and from that time ceafed to be under the infpeflion of the 
minifter of Caputh. With refpeft to the following lifts ta- 
ken from the parifti-regifter, it is to be remarked, i, That 
many children in diftant parts of the parifti, not being bap- 
tized by the minifter, are negle&amp;ed to be regiftered by the 
parents. 2. That many of the inhabitants bury in other 
parifties, and never pay the tax impofed by aft* of Parlia- 
ment in 1783, which, being unpopular, is not collected in 
fome places. No accurate conclufion, therefore, can be 
drawn from thefe lifts of

Cattle, Grain, «In the parifli are horfes, black cattle, 
fwine, flieep, foxes, hares, rabbits, badgers, &amp;c. The hor- 
fes and black, cattle of the braes, or hilly part, are fmall 
fized. In the low country, both cattle and horfes (efpecial- 
ly the latter,) have of late years been much impro- 
ved in fize and goodnefs. Sheep, which formerly abounded 
throughout the parifli, were baniflied from the low grounds 
when the planting of foreft-trees became an objecl: of im- 
portance to the proprietors. They are of the fmall Scots 
breed, (except a few in the neighbourhood of gentlemens 
feats,) and confined to the hilly part of the parifli. There 
are 570 horfes, 2061 black cattle, 1800 Iheep, 178 ploughs* 
402 carts. The Scots plough is much ufed ; but the Eng- 
lifti plough is daily gaining ground. There is a map of 
the parifli in Stobie's map of the counties of Perth and 
Clackmannan, publiflied in 1783, but it is not accurate. 
The number of acres has not been afcertained. But from 
a calculation made with great exaclnefs, it appears, that be- 
fides fupplying itfelf with grain, the parifli fells annually, at 
an average, 4000 bolls of barley, which are moftly carried 

out 

* Few remarkable inftances of longevity have lately occurred in the 
parilh. One man died, during the incumbency of the prefent minifter, 
who was above 90 ; • gentlewoman 88 years of age ; and a confiderable 
number between 80 and 90. An inftance worthy of notice, is a man now 
in his 85th year ; who in his youth being croffed in love, became crazed 
and has continued through life, indolent, harmlefs, contented, temperate' 
and even indifferent about food. For many years, he refided either in an 
open fhed or a hayloft, lying among ftraw, having only an old blanket 
around him ; apparently without fleep, yet in perfetf health. He has a 
fine face and figure. His incoherences are chiefly on the fubjedt of war 
and the French. He ftill poffefles a retentive memory, and is famed in 
the country for his penetration and acutenefs, his repartees and moral 
fayings.

out of it ; there being no brewery, and only two fmall 
diftilleries : Whereas about 30 years ago, hardly 1500 bolls 
were fold out of the parifti *. 

* Ancient State of the Pariflj.—To give a general notion of the former, 
compared with the pre fen t ftate of the parifh, the following fadts relative 
to the mode of cultivation, &amp;c. 50 or 6o years ago, are fubjoined ; which 
are derived from the information of fome intelligent farmers, who fpeak 
•from their own knowledge. There were for the mod part 8 tenants in 
one farm or townfliip, and the whole farm was run rig ; that is, one ridge 
belonged to one, the next to another, the third to a third perfon, &amp;c. 
The ground was divided into infield and outfield. The infield was con- 
■ftantly cropped, either with oats or bear; one ridge being oats, the other 
bear, alternately. There was no other crop, except a ridge of flax, where 
,the ground was thought proper for it. The outfield was ploughed three 
years for oats, and then paftured 5 or 6 years with horfes, black cattle, 
and (heep. In order to dung it, they made folds of fod for the cattle.; 
and what were called flakes or rails of wood, removable at pleafure, for 
folding the iheep. On the field thus teathed, they had their bed crops for 
'two years. A farmer who rented 60, 80, or 100 acres, was fometimes 
under the neceflity of buying meal for his family in the fummeV feafon : 
Nor will this appear wonderful, when it is confidered, that 15 bolls of 
bear have of late years been produced upon the fame field, where 50 
thrave (1100 (heaves) formerly grew, which the owner faid " he would 
give for 50 bear bannocks," (barley cakes.) This little anecdote is cha- 
radleriftic of the times, though allowance be made for the exaggeration 
of difappointment. The rent of land was about a fifth of the prelent rent. 
The ploughs and carts were ufually made by the farmer himfelf ; with 
little iron about the plough, except the coulter and (hare ; none upon 
the cart or harrows ; no (hoes upon the horfes ; no hempen ropes. In 
fhort, every inltrument of farming was procured at fmall expenfe, wood 
being at a very low price. Salt was a milling the bufliel : Little foap 
was ufed : they had no candles, inftead of which they fplit the roots of 
fir trees, which, though brought 50 or 60 miles from the Highlands, were 
purchafed for a trifle. Their clothes were of their own manufacturing. 
The average price of weaving ten yards of fuch cloth was a (hilling, 
which was paid partly in meal and partly in money. The tailor worked 
for a quantity of meal, fuppofe 3 pecks or a firlot a-year, according to the 
nnmber of the farmer's family. They ploughed with horfes and oxen 
together ; 2 horfes before four or fix oxen ; and fbmctimes only with ox- 
en. The tirae^of (owing and reaping was much the fame as it is now. 
After harveft, they paftured in common. No marl or lime had at that 

tire?

ShSk of Farms, Crops, Rent, ifc— Farms are in general 
fmall 5 many under 40 acres, and from 40 to 60 or 8c ; 
feldom above icq. There are two tenants, who, renting 
two or three farms, have in their poffeffion 150 or 160 
acres. A threfhing mill was erefted in 1792 by a fpirited 
farmer, on a farm of 120 acres. The principal crops in 
the parim are, oats, barley or bear, peafe and flax. Wheat 
has been fometimes tried by way of experiment ; but a 
crop of barley is more profitable. The culture of potatoes 
ii univerfal. Turnips are cultivated only in the fouth-and 
eaft parts of the parim, where the foil is light and warm. 
Early oats are fown in the N. W. part of the pariflv 
where the foil is cold. A great quantity of clover and rye- 
grafs is fown ufually among barley. Oats are fown from- 

the 



time been found in the parifh. The country was uninclofcd, except 
■what was in the immediate neighbourhood of the houfes of great proprie- 
tors. In the year 1735, the belt ploughman was to be had for L. 8 Scots 
(13 s. 4d.) a-year, and what was termed a bounty, which conlifted of 
iome articles of clothing, and might be eftimated at 1 r s. 6d. ; in all L. 1, 
4 s. iod. Sterling. Four years after, his wages rofe to L. 24 Scots, (L 2) 1 
and the bounty. Female lervants received L. 2. Scots, (3s. 4d.) and a 
bounty of a fimilar kind; the whole not exceeding 6s. or 7s. Some- 
years after their wages rofe to 15 s. Men received for harveft-work 
L. 6 Scots (ios.) ; Women, L. 5 Scots, (S s. 4-d.). Poultry was fold at 
40 pennies Scots, (3-L d.) Oat-mea!, bear and oats, at L. 4 or L. 5 Scots 
the boll. A horfe that then coft 100 merks Scots, (L. 5 : 11: ix) would 
now coft L 25. An ox that coft L. 20 Scots (L. 1:13:4) would now 
be worth L. 8 or L. 9. Beef and mutton were fold, not by weight, but 
by the piece; about 3s. 4d. for a leg of beef of 3-t (tones; and fo in pro- 
portion. No tea nor fugar was ufed : Little whiiky was drunk, and lefsof 
other I'pirits : but they had plenty of good ale ; there being ufually one 
malt-barn (perhaps two) on each farm. They caught abundance of fal- 
mon in the Tay ; 150 have been taken in one night, with very imperfect 
nets, in a fpace not exceeding 200 yards in length. For many 3 cars paft, 
they have not caught as many in one feafon, and in the whole parifhj

the middle of April to the end of Ma\ ; potatoes and 
peafe from the middle to the end of April ; flax from the 
23d of April to the 10th of May ; turnips from the ift of 
June to the t middle of July, all in drills, except what are 
late fown, and intended to moot out in the following fpring. 
Yams for horfes have been lately introduced, and planted 
fomewhat fooner than potatoes. Some Englifh rye is fown 
in October. Hay harveft commences the fecond week of 
July ; barley and rye harveft, the firft week of Septem- 
ber ; peafe and oats the fecond week of that month ; and 
in fome feafons, they are all more early. But thefe dates 
both of fowing and reaping, refer chiefly to the low coun- 
try ; in the hilly parts of the parilh, they are in general 
10 days later*. The parifli owes much of its improvement 
to the late John Mackenzie, Efq; of Delvin. By direct- 
ing the attention of the truftees for manufactures, &amp;c. to 
this part of the country, by bellowing well-judged rewards 
and giving encouragement in various ways, he excited a 
fpirit of induftry and improvement, which has operated 
with energy and fuccefs. The valued rent of the parilh 
is L. 9369 13:4 Scots. The real rent, (including the rent

in the Stormont. The prefent number of fcholars is about 
3°- — The number of poor is much diminiftied, in conse- 
quence of the pfogrefs of improvement and of induftry. 
In the year 1775, the Juftices of Peace for this county en- 
a&amp;ed certain regulations for fupprefling vagrants and beg- 
ging ; and appointed lifts of the poor in every parifh to 
be made up half yearly, and their maintenance to be pro- 
vided for by affeffment, if it mould be found requifite. 
The heritors and kirk feflion of this parifh met according- 
ly, and agreed to adopt the plan pointed out by the Jufti- 
ces of Peace : but it was not carried into effecT:. The lift 
of the poor at that time contained 3c ; of whom 19 recei- 
ved afliftance from the parifh-funds, and 1 1 were allowed 
badges. The average amount of thefe funds was L. 13, 
7 s. 8 d. At prefent, there are 12 on the poors lift; and 
the averape amount of the parilh-funds, for the laft 5 years, 
is L. 27 : 13 : 6. They receive from 2s. to 4s. the month; 
in all L.i, 12 s.; which makes L. 19, 4 s. a-year. They 
alfo receive about L. 3, 3 s. extra at Martinmas for clothes 
and fhoes : total, L. 22, 7 s. But it muft be remarked, 
that many of them contribute towards their own fupport ; 
and they have in general a laudable pride, in not requi- 
ring aid from the parifh funds, as long as they can fubfift 
without it. The kirk-feffion gives occasional fupply to 
fuch as are lefs neceflitous. Their clerk and beadle are 
likewife paid out of thefe funds *. 

Price* 

* About Chriftmas 1719 began the fevereft froft that had been knowii 
fince the year 1715. For fix weeks, from the III of Tanuary 1740, the 
river Tay was frozen over ; and loaded carts pafled and repafled on th« 
ice. The crop of that year, not being fuily ripened, was very deficient; 
and oat-meal rofe, in 174I, to the enormous price of J.. 12 jcots (L. 1 
Sterling) the boll. . At that time, the raoft indigent poor of the parifh 
received h s. icots. (6 d. Sterling) a- week; and thole who were able to 
ker, 2 s. Scots, (2 d. Sterling.) The next ieafon was as mild as the for- 
mer 



of Caputh.

Prices and "Sages. — The price of all kinds of provifions 
lias rifen confiderably within thefe few years ; that of 
poultry, in particular, is almoft double what it was in : • 83. 
The average price of beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, 
through the year, is 34 d. the Dutch pound. Poultry, od. 
or is.; a chicken, 3d.; a dozen of eggs, 3 d. ; butter, 6 d. 
the Englilh pound ; cheefe from 4 s. to 6 s. the ftone, of 
16 pounds, the pound containing 22 ounces ; potatoes, 6 d. 
the peck, of 2 Hones Dutch or meal weight. The prices 
of grain are for the molt part lower than in the Hadding- 
ton market. As the farmers ufually fell on credit, and de- 
liver in December, January, &amp;c. what is not to be paid 
till midfummer following, they get a higher price than 
they would otherwife receive. Barley, of crop 1791, was 
from 15 s. to 18 s. the boll ; oats from 12 s. to 15 s. ; feed 
oats from 16 s. to 17 s.; peafe from 13 s. to 15 s.; oat- 
meal from 15 s. 4 d. to 16 s. The prices are in general 
higher for crop 1792. — Servants, both male and female, 
are commonly hired for the whole year. The bell mart 
fervant for hufbandry receives L 10 or L. 12 ; an ordina- 
ry one from L. 6 to L. 8. They either have their victuals 
in the farmer's houfe, or in lieu of victuals, 6 bolls and a 
half of oat-meal, and milk from his dairy. Female ler- 
vants receive from L. 3 to L. 4. A man, for harveft work, 
gets from L. 1 to L. 1, 18 s. ; a woman from 16 s. to L. 1 ; 

a 

mer had been fevere. The crop was uncommonly fertile, and generally 
got in about the middle of September N. S. Before Martinmas i74f, 
the price of meal fell to L. 6 Scots the boll. In confequence of the very 
late and unproductive crop of 1782, the price of oat-meal again rofe, in 
the fuinmer of 1783, to L. 1 the boll. In Auguft that year the heritors 
and kirk feffion direded L 1 2 to be taken from the parifh-funds. and di- 
ftributed in the courfe of four weeks ; and foon after, 10 bolls 1 tirlot 
and 1 peck of the meal, which was fent to Scot and by order of Govern- 
ment, were received and diftributed in like manner By thefe means, a 
temporary relief was afforded to many of th,e induftrious poor.

one third of what was (tamped was manufaftured in the 
parifti ; but during the two kit years, the parifti manufac- 
tured about one half of the quantity ftamped. Befides the 
above quantities, and without reckoning i2,coo yards and 
upwards, annually made for houfehold ufe, there are about 
20,oob yards manufactured in the parifti, which are ftamp- 
ed at Blairgowrie or Dunkeid. 

Antiquities. — About a mile and a half north-weft from 
the church, in a verj-- elevated fituation, there is a fmall 
Dvuidical circle. Befide it are two large ftones, deeply funk 
in the ground ; the top of the loweft is artificially formed 
into an inclined plane, facing the fouth, and contains a 
number of fmall cavities ; which may have been ufed by 
the Druids in the performance of religious rites. Near the 
church, there are the remains of a cairn, where probably a 
crofs had been en:£ted during the prevalence of Popifh fu- 
perftition ; the place ftill retaining the name of Crofs-cairn. 
Cairnmure is the largeft cairn in this country, being 456 
feet in circumference, and 18 feet high. It has been lately 
furrounded with a row of trees and a ftone wall. Above 
half a mile fouth-weft from this, Hands another, 357 feet 
in circumference, and 14 feet high. In a line with thefe 
two, and at the fame diftance, there is a third, of a fmaller 
fize. The top of the craig at Stenton, a mile weft from 
the church, bears evident marks of having been a fortified 
fpot. It is called Kemp's Ho/J, or the Ho/diers Fajlnefs. 
Some fragments of weapons were dug up about 16 years 
ago, when it was planted with trees. It has a very piftu- 
refque appearance. The antiquities of Inchtutbel have 
been defcribed by the ingenious Mr Pennant *. It is a flat

Picts had a town, which muft have been a place of great 
ftrength, and of which the veftiges may be difcerned at the 
fouth-weft corner of this lingular elevation. Boetius calls it 
"Inline or 'Tuhfia, and fays, that it was populous and well 
fortified ; but deferted and burnt by the Picls. on the ap- 
proach of the Romans under Agricola : he adds, (as tranf- 
lated by Holinlhed,) " the Scottifhmen in our time call the 
place Inchtuthill *." The Romans alio availed themfelves 
of this fituation. Their camp flood on the north-eall bor- 
der, and commanded an extenfive view of the plain. It is 
50c yards fquare ; the walls, to a conliderable height, were 
ftrongly built, nine feet and a half thick, with Hones 
brought from a quarry 2 miles diftant ; the ftones have 
been gradually removed, and the wulls are now aim oft le- 
velled by the plough. In the courfe -of ploughing, frag- 
ments of weapons, and fome entire utenfils, were formerly 
found. Here, Mr Pennant fixes the A'rreci of the Romans; , 
with much greater probability than Dr Stukeley t, who 
fuppofes it to have been Perth ; though in is map, he 
places it north-eaft of the Tay, and on the very fpot where 
the prtfent Delvin ftands. There are two tumuli ox bar- 
rows, and a redoubt, on the fouth-eaft fide of the camp. 
A few years ago, the largeft of thefe barrows was opened, 
and confided of a rich black mold, poffibly compofed of

It is now diftinguifhed by a clump of trees. Inchtuthel is like- 
wife believed to have been part of the land granted by Ken- 
neth III. (who began his reign in 977,) to Hay for his bra- 
very in the battle of Luncarry •, and his dependents fe poffefied 
it till the beginning of the 17th century. There appears 
to have been a Roman ftation 3 miles to the eaft of this, 
in the moor of Meiidour, towards the extremity of the 
parifh. The line of the Roman military road leading thi- 
ther, can be ftill traced through the parifhes of Scone, St 
Martin's, and Cargill : and this road feems unqueftionably 
to be the continuation of that which paffed through Strath- 
ern, and crofted the Tay at Rome, a little to the weftward 
of Scone, where probably there was a bridge of wood over 
the river f. Where the Roman road touches on the Ifla, a 
bridge is alfo fuppofed to have flood, of which the neceflity 
is evident, for the purpofe of opening a communication 
from the fouth with the ftation near Meiklour, and by con- 
fequence with the champaign country, both eaft and weft, 
as far as the Grampian Mountains. Here the Romans 
raifed a wall of earth, about 24 feet thick, (for it is difficult 
to afcertairi the exaft meafurement,) defended by a ditch on 
each fide, 6 5 feet diftant from the wall. This wall, which is 
now named the Cleaving Dike, ftretched above two miles 
and a half, from the ancient courfe of the Tay to the Ifla ; 
which, by their commodious jun&amp;ion two miles below, 
completely fecured the ftation. The fpace inclofed is in 
the form of a delta. In this area, there are feveral explo- 
ratory mounts •, one, apparently artificial, (now called the

tains, in Roman charaders, DL DAL. WVNDI * five 
times repeated \ the inner circle confifts of unknown cha- 
racters, four times repeated, which cannot be reprefented 
without an engraving. An exact tranfcript of the whole 
was made by me feveral years ago, and prefented to the 
Antiquarian Society of Scotland. 

General CharaBer and Condition of the People. — The 
people here have an indifference, and even diflike, both to a 
feafaring and a military life. They prefer the occupations 
in hufbandry or manufacture, to which they are inured 
from their infancy. They are rather fond of large :wed- 
dings and funerals, and often incur unnecefTary expenfe on 
fnch occafions. Of late, they have become much more 
ftudious of drefs than they were, and have chan ed for 
the better their mode of li vin  in many articles of do- 
meftic economy. They are now more attentive to clean- 
linefs than formerly ; their cottages are more fubftan dally 
and commodioufly built ; and their condition is daily im- 
proving. On the whole, they are fober, peaceable and in- 
duftrious. They are in general humane to one another, and 
fhow great kindnefs and fympathy to their diftrefled neigh- 
bours. During the laft 30 years, one inftance of filicide 
has happened ; and one perfon has been banifhed. I have 
not heard of any perfon belonging to the .parifh having 
fuffered capital puniQiment.

Advances and Mfadvantages.-K judicious obferver 
has rem arked, that the light grounds in the Stormont poffefs 
his advantage over richer and ftronger foils, that though 
the crops are never uncommonly weighty, yet they are 
inoderatly good, in a greater variety of leaions, than in any 
place where his obWtfbn Iras eached. A new ro«d 
now making to Perth by Stanley, will be of confidcrablc 
utility to the panlh. And confequences ftill more bene-

keld and Cupar in Angus palTes through the middle of the 
panlh ; but, though it is a great thoroughfare, it has never 
been made in a fufficient manner. The ftatute-labour, being 
formerly exafted in kind, was ill adapted either to the con- 
ftruclion or prefervation of good roads. As it is now com- 
muted, it may be reafonably expedted to produce an advan- 
tageous change in the ftate of the roads in the county. A 
marl-pit has been htely drained. There is alfo fome lime 
in the parilh, but the want of coal renders it ufelefs. In-

labour, is their diftance from ccal, and from lime, for the 
purpofes of agriculture. It is to be regretted, that fome 
well di reded attempts have not been made, to difcover 
whether there is coal in this diftricl. A matter of fuch im-

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6667615">LOGI E-C OLDSTONE</name>. 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery 
of Kincardine O'Niel.) 

By the Rev. Mr Robert Farqjjharson.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Soil, &amp;c. 

T I 1 HE parifli of Logie was annexed to the parifh of Cold- 
ftone in 1618. The name of the parilh of Logie is 
exprelfive of its local fituation. It is a corruption of the 
i word Lag, which in the Gaelic language, fignifies a " hol- 
" low or low fituation." There is no circumftance or tra- 
dition for the origin of Coldltone. Logie- Coldftone parifli 
is 38 miles diftant from Aberdeen. It lies in the upper 
part of the country called Cromar, a corruption of the 
word Cruievar, which in the Gaelic fignifies " the bught 
of Mar." It is at equal diftances berween the rivers Dee 
and Don. The country is furrounded by a large ridge of 
hills, and is in the form of a bught or fold for holding 
cattle. The diltrift. is about 3! miles from E.-to W. and 
about 6 from S. to N. The foil is various. The interior 
1 part 



of Logie-Coldflone. 51 1 

part of the country is incerfperfed with a number of fmall 
hills, and large barren moors ; a great many of which retain 
the marks of cultivation, by the remains of furrows and fences; 
but the ground is now fo reduced by that barbarous prac- 
tice of calling muck-feal and turf, (that is, the furface), that 
it produces nothing in general, but a (hort worthlels kind of 
heath. Near the manfe there is a fmall plantation of fir 
wood ; to the S. and E. of the church, there are 5 of the 
fame kind. Some farms on the E. and W. fide of the 
manfe, called the Eafter and Weftern Batonies, and lands 
of Waterairn, are a fine rich deep loam ; and though very 
capable of improvement, are all in a itate of nature, except 
the farms of Kinaldie, Coldftone, and part of th it of Loan- 
head. The firft is all inclofed, and ibme of the fields 
ftraighted and drefled ; the fecond was inclofed by the 
heritor about 14 years ago, and lies in natural grafs, on 
which he paftures his own cattle in fummer and harveft ; 
a part of the third, which lies near the manfe, is inclofed 
and improved. On the E. and W. fide of the church, the 
ground is light and fandy, a great part of it of a very 
poor quality ; in advancing farther from the church, to- 
wards the S. E. extremity, the foil is of a fine rich loam. 
That part of the parifh called Delkrie Side, which lies on 
the north fide of the hills, is of a cold wet mofly nature, 
and very fubjecl: to froft and mildews. 

Climate, Rivulets, Springs, 1$c— The air is accounted fa- 
lubrious. The froft in winter is often very intenfe, though 
the country is not near fo ftormy as the neighbouring pa- 
rimes to the N. and W. of it, fuch as Towie, Glenbucket, 
and Strathdon. There are 3 rivulets in the diftridt, which, 
fall into the Dec in the parifh of Aboyne. They are fo 
fmall in fummer, that they require gathered dams to drive 
the meal-mills, of winch there are 5 in the interior part of 
this diftncl, and 1 on Defkrie Side, driven by a burn, the 
one fide of which, for 2 miles, belongs to this parifh. It 

falls

Statijiical Account 



falls into the Don about a mile below the church of Strath- 
don. They all abound with fine trout. There is a loch 
on the fouth fide of this diirrid, called Lochdaven. It is 
about miles in circumference-, it abounds with pike, 
fome of them of a large lize. A good many of them are 
taken with bait in furamer. There is a mineral fpring in 
the parifh, a little to the S. of the church, called Poldow, 
which in the Gaelic fignifies " a black pool the water of 
which, fome years ago, was much and fuccefsfully uled for 
fcorbutic and gravelilh diforders. It is now much defert- 
ed, fince the Wells of Pananich (which are 4 miles di- 
ftant) were difcovered. Great crowds of the country 
people ftill refort to Poldow, and drink of the water for all 
diforders. 

Antiquities, Game, &amp;c. — The principal remains of anti- 
quity in this pariih are 3 large cairns, 1 of which, a little to 
the N. of the manfe, is of an uncommon fize. They are fup- 
pofed to mark out the places where the bodies of fome emi- 
nent men were interred. There are likewife Druidical 
fanes in difiV-rent parts of the pariOi. — Few parifhes in Scot- 
land abound more with a greater variety of game, fuch as 
hares, fnipe, moor-fowl, partridges, woodcock, a few black- 
cock, tarmagans, and white hares; the two latter are always 
to be found on the hill of Morven, which, in the Gaelic, 
fignifies " a large hill." It is one of the higheft hills in 
Scotland ; it bounds a part of the parifh on the W. There 
are likewife great numbers of wild ducks and geefe which, 
in late feafons, deftroy a great part of the crop which grows 
on the low grounds. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls then was 1243. The Mate of the parifli, 
with refpecT: to population, cannot be traced far back. The 

writer 



of Logie-Coldjione*

writer of this was fettled here in 1779 ; the number of in- 
habitants fmce that time is confiderably decreafed. At 
that period, all the farms were occupied by tenants and 
fubtenants ; but af prefent there are about 20 families quite 
extirpated, and their poffeffions in natural grafs. In 1780* 
there were 1300 fouls in the pariflv at prefent (1793) 
there are 11 82. The annual average of births fince 1780 
is 23 ; of marriages, 10. The people follow, in general, 
the occupation of hufbandry. There are 2 frniths, 1 car- 
penter, 2 fhoemakers, and 4 Ihopkeepers, who fell fmall 
articles for the good of the country. The chief manufac- 
ture, till about 1789, was that of knitting {lockings by the 
women, the wool brought by manufacturers from Aber- 
deen. For 3 years part, fpinning on the two-handed wheel 
is much introduced, and found more profitable. The lint 
is given out to fpin, juft in the fame way as the wool, by 
manufacturers from Aberdeen, Brechin, and as far fouth as 
Dundee. The whole inhabitants are members of the E= 
flablifhed Church, and fpeak all that dialect: of Englifh, 
common in the north of Scotland. 

Agriculture. — -Oats and common bear are the principal 
productions of the parifh ; fome peafe and rye are alfo raifed ; 
but the quantity of thefe kinds of grain is but fmall, when 
compared with oats and bear. Potatoes are of late culti- 
vated by every family, whether of farmers or labourers, 
for their own fubfiftence : a few turnips are fown, fome in 
drills and fome in broadcaft ; but for want of inclofures, as 
winter herding is not introduced, they muft be pulled before 
they come to much perfection. The old Scots plough is al- 
moft univerfally ufed. Some of the moft fubftantial tenants 
put 12 oxen in the plough, others 10, others 8, the poorer 
fort 2 horfes and 2 cows, fome of them 1 horfe, 2 cows, and 
2 fmall oxen. Clover and rye-grafs have been cultivated on

the farms of Kinaldy, Blelachy, and Lonhead, with great 
fuccefs } but no where elfe, except in gardens, for want of 
inclofures. Many of the farmers begin to raife flax j and as 
there are now 2 lint-mills erected in 2 of the neighbouring 
pariflies, Towie and Coul, it is thought it will turn out a 
very profitable crop. There are a good many fheep rear- 
ed in the parifh, the greater part of them of the black fa- 
ced kind ; they fell from L. 7 to L. 13 the fcore. Black 
cattle are very much degenerated for want of grafs, the far- 
mers fend them all, except a few milk-cows, to pafture in 
glens every year about Whitfunday for 3 months ; and fince 
the fheep became numerous, they generally return as poor as 
when they went away. In 1780 there were 5 or 6 carts 
in this parifhl; now, in 1793, there are about 30. There are 
at prefent 4 heritors in the parifh, Lord Aberdeen, Lord 
Strathaven, James Farquharfon of Invercauld, and Charles 
Gordon of Blelack ; the latter is the only refiding heritor. 
The valued rent of the parifh is L. 2783 Scots. Real 
rent L. 782, 10 s. 344 bolls 2 firlots meal, 181 bolls 1 firlot 
bear. The rents of the principal eflates are demanded 
when due ; with certification, that if the laft farthing is not 
paid, the tenants (very few of them having tacks) mufl 
remove at the firfl term of Whitfunday. To avoid this evil, 
numbers of them fell meal and bear for ready money, 
which they have not to deliver, and at that inflant buy the 
fame back from the one they fold it to at 5 s. and 3 s. 6 d. 
the boll of additional price, payable 9 months after. Such as 
have the victual to deliver, are obliged to threfh out their 
crop before they have ufe for the flraw ; by which means, 
they lofe a great deal of it, carrying it out of their barns 
and building it up in their yards, and it becomes dry and 
infipid for their cattle. By this uncommon kind of traffic, 
numbers are reduced to very low circumftances. All the 
confolation they have, is, the one part of them is taught by

civil, the other by moral law, that " whom the Lord loves 
he chaftifes." Lord Strathaven, who got his father Lord 
Aboyn's property in this county made over to him 2 or 3 
years ago, has altered the terms of payment of rents from 
Martinmas till the 8 th or middle of February and from 
Whitfunday till the middle of Auguft ; by which his te- 
nants have an opportunity of making the beft of their vic- 
tual and cattle, and now pay their rents with much greater 
eafe and advantage than they did formerly. If this plan 
were adopted by heritors in general in this country, it 
would be of the greateft confequence to their tenants in ge- 
neral, who depend chiefly on the produce of their crops for 
the greater part of their rents. Improvements in agricul- 
ture will never take place in this parilh, until -leafes are 
granted and encouragement given for houfes and inclofing ; 
till that happen, the poor farmer will be obliged to adopt 
the old mode of cultivation, whether right or wrong, 
though the climate and foil in general are fuch as would 
produce good crops of any kind of grain ufed in the north 
of Scotland. At prefent the farm-houfes are worth very 
little, and the mode of living very mean ; dwelling-houfes, 
when valued on the removal of a tenant, are appreciated 
from 16 s. to L. 1, 5 s. Subtenants from 5 s. to 10 s. *

were before that time. The average rate at which men fervants are hired

the family ; women fervants ufually get from L. 2 to L. 2, 10 s. and their 
maintenance. There are no alehoufes in the parifli ; the inhabitants in 
general are very fober: but numbers of them are obliged by neceffity to 
attend a weekly market at Tarland, fome time before every term, to fell 
victual in the way already mentioned to pay their rents ; by which means, 
they throw away a great part of their time and their fubject. At this 
market no fewer than 4 meffengers, 3 of whom are notary-publics, attend 
regularly, and have made themfelves rich on the ruins of the poor ; one 
of them has bought 2 eftates. 3

NOTE. 

Letter from Mr Farquharfon to Sir John Sinclair. 

" There is a very uncommon and particular circumftance in my cafe; 
which I mall mention to you, (knowing you to be a friend to mankind). 
I have for a long time been diftreffed with a diforder in my ftomach ; a- 
bout 5 years ago, I was advifed to take (when much pained) 25 drops 
of laudanum once a-day, and to increafe the quantity gradually. My 
diftrefs was fuch, that it made me attend regularly to the prefcription, as 
it gave me a mom entary relief, fo that at the end of 4 years I came on 
to 12 and often 14 tea-fpoonfuls the day ; the effects of which, along with 
my complaint, reduced me .to mere (kin and bone, and made me as yellow 
as an orange. I confulted Dr Cullen when I began to take the lauda- 
num, who did not difapprove of it ; but on finding it breaking in fait 
on my conftitution, (which was originally good), I applied to Dr Monro 

wh« 



of Logie-Coldflone. $ij 



who gave me for anfwer, " that laudanum was a certain, though flow 
poifon." This determined me, though in a very reduced ftate, to diminilh 
the quantity 10 ica-fpoonfuls a-day. The fudden tranfition bore very hard 
upon me. tofuch a degree, that it was the belief of every one who faw me, 
th.it 1 could not live many days. Dr Thomas Morifon in London, (who 
was my early acquaintance), came to this country in Auguft laft, and. 
advifed me (it poflible) to abandon the laudanum, but to do it gradually; 
he fent me fome dofes of the fliavings of fteel to take three times a-day, 
which I continued to do with fuch fuccefs, that I can now with pleafure 
fay that I have not tailed laudanum for 4 months paft, and am become 
ftout and fat."

PARISH of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2282115">GRAITNEY</name>, 



(County and Synod of Dumfries, Presbytery of 

Annan.) 



By the Rev. Mr John Morgan.</head> 



<p>A 1 ante, Extent, Surface. 

\TO authentic information can be obtained refpe£ting 
-** ^ the etymology of the name of this parifti. The fpell- 
ing varies much, which increafes the difficulty. The moft 
probable conjecture is, that it was originally called Great- 
know, from a fmall hill lying at the diftance of about a 
quarter of a mile from the church. The form of it is that 
of an oblong fquare, extending along the coaft of the Sol- 
way Frith, nearly 6 miles in length, and about 3 in breadth 
at an average. It is a level diftri£t, diverlified with a few 
rifing grounds of fmall extent. The higheft eminence is 
Graitney-hill, from which the parifli is fuppofed to derive 
its name, lying at the diftance of about a quarter of a 
mile from the church. It rifes about 350 feet above wa- 
ter 



of Graitney. 519 

ter mark, and commands a pleafant and extenfive profpecl 
of the coaft of Cumberland, Solway Frith, Annandale, 
Liddiefdale, and of part of Northumberland. 

Springs, Rivers, Solway Frith, l#c. — There are fome mi- 
neral fprings ; but as very little attention hath hitherto been 
paid to them, their virtues are fcarcely known, and they 
are rendered lefs valuable by being often warned over by 
the tides. The Eden, Eik, and Sark, uniting form the head 
of Solway Frith, and the fouthern boundary of this pa- 
rilh. The Frith here may be 4 or 5 miles broad, and is 
navigable to Sarkfoot for veflels of 1 20 tons burden. There 
are feveral harbours or landing places in the parifli, fuch 
as Sarkfoot, Hiedkirkpoint, Brewhoufes, &amp;c. but on any 
part of the coaft, which is a flat and fandy more, veflels 
may lie in fafety at all times. The Sark, and the Kirtle 
another fmall river, are the only ftreams in the parifli. The 
tides flow regularly from W. to E. with great rapidity, for 
the fpace of 3 hours, and are nearly full at the moon's 
fouthing. The fpring-tides rife about 20 feet above low 
water mark, and there are evident appearances of their ha- 
ving rifen much higher at fome former period. In the 
little rivers Sark and Kirtle are trout, eels, herlings, pike, 
&amp;c. but not in fuch quantities as to be obje&amp;s of much at- 
tention to the inhabitants. The fifliing, however, in the 
Solway Frith is of more importance. It produces falmon 
in pretty large quantities, fome fturgeon, cod, flounders, 
and rarely porpoifes. But as the different methods employ- 
ed in taking the feveral kinds of fifh, the markets to which 
they are fent, and the prices at which they are fold, are 
fully and accurately detailed in the return from the adjoin- 
ing parifh of Dornoch, it is unneceflary to repeat them 
here. 



Climate, 



Statijiical Account 

Climate, Soil, Wr.-The climate is temperate and the air 
healthful. No local diftempers are prevalent. There are 
feveral inftances indeed of rheumatic and nervous diforders 
particularly among the loweft clafs of the inhabitants, owing 
to their living in cold and damp houfes, to their enjoying 
but a fcanty fhare of the comforts of life, and in fome cafes 
perhaps to . the indifcreet ufe of tea and fpiritous liquors. 
There have been fome inftances of longevity. It appears 
from a grave-Hone in the church-yard here, that of 2 bro- 
thers, who died a century ago, the one was hi, and the 
other no. In the year 1 791, a woman died at the age of 
103, but her name could not be found in the parifh -record. 
There is now living one woman upwards of an 100, two 
between 90 and 100, and feveral perfons between 80 and 
9c, which are ftriking proofs of the falubrity of this part of 
the country. — The foil is various. Except fome tracls of 
mofs and boggy grounds, which are incapable of improve, 
ment, it is in general dry and fandy, mixed with ftones. In 
fome parts, and particularly on the fea-fide, it is a fine rich 
loam; in others, of a wet and clayifh nature. In almoft eve- 
ry part, however, the foil is fertile, and, when properly cul- 
tivated, yields abundant returns*. 

Population. — According to the returns made to Dr 
Webfter, the number of fouls was then 1051. It is be- 
lieved that the population of this parifh has been gradual- 
ly increafing for many years. There are now 1810 per- 
fons, of whom are, 

Under 10 years of age, 490 Between 10 and 20, 399

All the reft of the inhabitants are cottagers employed by the 
farmers. They are all of the Eftablifhed Church, except 
1 Cameronian, 2 or 3 Burgher Seceders, and a few Epifco- 
palians. The number of births within the parifh, taken at 
a*n average of 10 years, amounts to 54. The average num- 
ber of marriages for the laft five years does not exceed 7 ; 
but it is to be obferved, that there are many irregular mar- 
riages in the parifh. As no regifter of burials has hither-

The annual produce of this parifh has been greatly in- 
creafed of late years, by the improvements which have 
been made, as the feveral proprietors have exerted them- 
felves with a laudable emulation in the melioration of their 
refpecrive eftates. The arable lands are all inclofed at the 
expenfe of the landlord, and the ftone-fences and hedges, 
which are in a thriving condition, are upheld by the tenants. 
Several of the farms are in a very high ftate of cultiva- 
tion, and the reft are daily improving. It is believed, 
that the rental of the parilh has been tripled in the courfe 
of the laft 25 years. The manure ufed here is dung and 
lime, brought from the Donkin's lime-works, in the pa- 
rilh of Middlebie, or from Haymuir, in the parifli of Kirk- 
patrick, and fometimes from the hollows, in the parifli of 
Cannobie. The price the buftiel at Donkin's is 11 d. and 
at the other places 7 d. or 8 d. This difference in the 
price, is owing to the difference of the prices of {he coals 
ufed in burning the limeftone. The farmers here ufe the

Englifh or Rotheram plough only, with the curved mold- 
board. It is drawn by two horfes, without a driver, and 
commonly ploughs about an acre a-day. The rotation of 
cropping, in general, is, firft year, wheat or oats ; fecond 
year, oats ; third year, turnip or potatoes ; fourth year, bar- 
ley, fown out with clover and rye-grafs. The land, fown 
out in this manner, is ufually mown for one year, then 
paftured two years, and afterwards ploughed, and under- 
goes the fame rotation of crops. The parifli is the pro- 
perty of 4 heritors, the Earl of Hopetoun, Earl of Mansfield, 
Sir William Maxwell of Springkell, Bart, and Mr Graham 
of Mofsknow ; none of whom refide. No part of the pa- 
rifli is commonty. Every proprietor knows the precife 
limits of his eftate. The farms in this diftridl: are in ge- 
neral of fmall extent. There is, however, one farm let at 
L. 300, and another at L. 186. All the reft are confider- 
ably fmaller. The land here lets from 5 s. to 20 s. the 
acre *. 

Stipend, 

* Prices, Wages, Expenfes, Earnings, ifc— The average price of 
wheat is 5 s. 6 d. of barley, 2 s. 8 d. and of oats 2 s. the Winchefter bufhel. 
Meal is from i s. 6 d. to a s. the flone of 17.* lb. The prefent average 
price of beef and veal, is 3^ d. the lb ; of mutton and lamb, 3^. d. and of 
pork 4 d. the lb. of 16 ounces. A turkey is fold at 3 a goofe at 2 s. 6 d. 
a hen at 8d. a duck at 8d. cheefe at 3d. and butter at 6 d. the lb. of 16 
ounces. The prices of provifions of all kinds are greatly increaled of 
late years. The farmers here live lefs on butter and cheefe, than they 
feem to have done formerly. They think that they find an advantage in 
felling thefe articles, and in buying butcher-meat. There is an exceed- 
ingly good flefh-market in the village of Graitney Green, where upwards 
of L. 700 worth of butcher-meat of all kinds, and of the beft qualities, 
is killed and fold annually, the greatefl part of which is confumed in this 
parifli and neighbourhood. In coniequence of our vicinity to England, 
as in other bordering parifhes, wages and the price of labour are generally 
high, as many cf the young people of both fexes go into Cumberland, 
where a male fervant can have from L, 8 to L. 12 and upwards, and a fe- 
male

Stipend, School, Poor—The ftipend is L. 760 Scots, in- 
cluding L. 60 Scots for communion-elements, and 5 chal- 
ders of viftual, two thirds of which are payable in meal, 
and the other third in bear, amounting, communibus annis, 
to about L. 120 Sterling. The glebe is but fmall, and 
lies at the diftance of more than two miles from the church, 
which renders it lefs valuable to the minifter. In the 1789 
and 1 790, the church and offices were all new built, and 
the manfe repaired at a confiderable expenfe. Lord Mans- 
field is patron. — There is in the parifti one fchoolmafter 
only, who has a falary of 100 merks Scots. This, and the 
fchool-wages, including an houfe and garden, may amount 
to about L. 10 Sterling annually. The fchool-houfe, and 
the houfe in which the fchoolmafter refides, were both 
built not many years ago, and are at prefent in excellent

harveft quarters, a ftout young man will get from L. 3, 10 s. to L. 4, 10 s.

vants are nearly the fame in this diflridl, From Candlemas to Martin- 
mas the wages of a day-labourer are 1 s. 2 d. without victuals, and 8d.

Antiquities. — The remains of a Druidical temple are ftill 
to be feen on the farm of Graitney Mains. It is of an o- 
val form, and inclofes about half an acre of ground. It is 
formed of large rough whin or moorftones, which mult 
have been brought from a confiderable diftance, there be- 
ing no flones of this kind within 10 or 12 miles of this 
place. One of the largeft of thefe flones, which is com- 
monly called Lochmaben ftone, meafures 118 cubical feet, 
the total weight of which, fuppofing each cubical foot to 
weigh 12 ftone, mull be 20 tons and upwards. The reft 
are confidcrably fmaller. The file of this temple is laid 
to be famous for having been the place where alliances 
were anciently formed between the two nations. The re- 
mains of two or three fquare towers are ftill to be feen in 
different parts of the parifh. They feem to have been 
places of defence againft the incurfions of the Englifh bor- 
derers. There are in the pofleflion of James Graham, for- 
merly of this parifh, but now in the parifh of Dornoch, 
29 fmall filver coins, which were found inclofed in a fmall 
wooden box, in a mofs near the Hirft ; 25 of them are 
about the fize of fixpences, and the remaining four fome-

Natural Curiofity. — In autumn 1792, the tackfmen of 
a free ftone quarry, belonging to the then Vifcount of Stor- 
mont, and lying near the foot of the water of Kutle, in 
working the fame, difcovered a mats of tar, incrufted on 
all fides with the rock. The hollow in which it was 
found, would have held about \ \ gallons Scotch meafure, 
and the quantity of tar found was about i4 Englifh pints. 
When the tar was tried, it burned in the fire like common 
tar, extra&amp;ed from fir, but had a fulphureous fmell. It 
was foft when found, and became fluid in the fire. The 
rock in which it was found is a white freeftone, of a good 
quality. The workmen are of opinion, that it has pro- 
ceeded from a fpring on the north -weft fide of the quarry. 
This fpring leaves a black flimy fubftance like tar ; and 
this fubftance, as they think, oozing through the foot of 
the rock, has produced the mafs defcribed above. 

Village of Spring field,— \n the year 1791, a new village 
was begun on the farm of Springfield, belonging to Sir 
William Maxwell, where upwards of 4© houfes have been 
already built, or are now build  g. This village is fituated 
oh a dry healthy foil, upon an eminence above the Sark, 
the river which is here the boundary of the united king- 
doms. The plan of the village is perfectly regular. The 
ftreets are 50 feet wide, and the houfes are all built of 
freeftone or bricks, and covered wich blue flate. A great 
part of the land adjacent to the village, and belonging to 
the proprietor, has been inclofed, and the fences planted 
with quicks and hedge-rows of trees. Each fettler is ac- 
commodated with an inclofure of 6 or 4 acres at a mode- 
rate rent, and upon a leafe for 19 years. The building 
leafes are for 99 years. Several weavers are now fettling 
in tins village, and as the proprietor is exerting bimfelf for 
the eftablifhment of manufactures of different kinds, there

feems to be little doubt of this village becoming a very con- 
fiderable place in a fhort time, from the many advantages 
which it poffefles with refpecl to its fituation. Both coal and 
peat are to be had here at no great diftance, and at a mode- 
rate expenfe. There is a fmall river contiguous to the 
village, and the fea-port at Sarkfoot is not above a mile 
diflant from it. The great road from England by Moffat 
to Edinburgh and Glafgow, and the great road by Dum- 
fries to Port Patrick, and by Dumfries, Sanquhar, Muir- 
kirk, &amp;c. to Glafgow, all pafs through this village. 

Roads. — There are two turnpike roads which pafs through 
this parifh. The road from England by Moffat to Edin- 
burgh and to Glafgow, by Hamilton, and the road from 
England by Drumfries to Port-Patrick, and to Glafgow by 
Sanquhar, Muirkirk, &amp;.c. and which roads feparate at Head- 
lefs-Crofs, about 200 yards to the weft ward of the new vil- 
lage of Springfield*. 

Graitney-Hall. — This houfe, in'which an heritor former- 
ly refided, is now fitted up in a very elegant and commo- 
dious manner as an inn by the Earl of Hopeton, the pro- 
prietor, where poft-chaifes are kept, and every accommo- 
dation 

* There, were no turnpike roads, in this part of the country till the year 
j*1*] t when an act of Parliament was obtained for repairing certain roads 
in the county of Dumfries, by the aid of tolls, and for commuting the fta- 
tute-labour; the truftees under that act being empowered to aflefs the 
proprietors and occupiers of land, in a fum not exceeding 12 s. on each' 
loo merks of valuation, for the purpofes of repairing, and keeping in re- 
pair, the different ronds within the county The benefit which has been 
derived from this aft of Parliament has been 'iniverfally felt and acknow- 
ledged ; and ir is from that period, and from t.;is circumftance, that every'

dation may be had that is to be found in the beft inns in 
England. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — There are 2 bridges, the 
one of one arch over the Sark, and the other of two arches 
on the Port-Patrick road over the Kirtle, lately rebuilt in 
a very fubftantial manner. There is an exceedingly good 
wheat, barley and oat mill, well mpplied with water, 
where the greateft part of the grain in the parifli is grind- 
ed. We have very little natural wood. There is a plan- 
tation of full grown trees at Graitney-Hall, and there are 
feveral belts and clumps of young plantations in different 
parts of the parifli, which in time will be a very great or- 
nament to this part of the country. The common fuel u- 
fed here is peats. The expenfes of cutting, drying and 
leading them may be eftimated at about 1 s. the cart-load. 
Coals are brought from Archerbeck in the parifli of Gan- 
nobie. They cofl is. 6d. the cart-load at the pit. They 
are likewife brought by water-carriage from Cumberland. 
By landing them on the Englifh fide, the payment of the 
duty is evaded, and they colt 6s. the ton, or 3s. the cart- 
load. Thefe are perhaps cheaper than the Archerbeck 
coal, which are about 10 miles diftant from this place. 

NOTE. 

ClanJcJIine Marriages. This parifli has been long famous in 

the annals of matrimonial adventure, for the marriages of fugitive 
lovers from Kngland, which have been celebrated here. People living at 
a diftance erroneoufly fuppofe, that the regular and eftablillied clergyman 
of this parifli is the celebrator of thofe marriages : Whereas the perfons 
who follow this illicit practice, are mere impoftors, priefts of their own 
ereclion, who have no right whatever either to roarry, or to exercife 
any part of the clerical function. There are, at prefent, more than one of 
this defcription in this place But the greateft part of the trade is mono- 
polifed by a man who was originally a tobacconift, and not a blackfmith, 
as is generally believed. He is a fellow without literature, without prin- 
ciples, without morals, and without manners. His life is a continued

fcene of drunkennefs. His irregular conduia has rendered him an objeft 
of deteftation to all the fober and virtuous part of the neighbourhood. 
Such is the man (and the defcription is not exaggerated) who has had 
the honour to join, in the facred bonds of wedlock, many people of great 
rank and fortune from all parts of England. It is 40 years and upwards 
fince marriages of this kind began to be celebrated here. At the loweft 
computation about 60 are fuppofed to be folemnized annually in this 
place. Taken at an average through the year, they may be eftimated at 
1 5 guineas each ; consequently this traffic brings in about L. 945 a-year. 
The form of ceremony, when any ceremony is ufed, is that of the Church 
of England On fome occafions, particularly when the parfon is intoxi- 
cated, which is often the cafe, a certificate only is given. The certificate 
is figned by the parfon himfelf, and two witnefies under fictitious figna- 
tures. The following is a 

Copy of one of thefe Certificates, in the original Spelling : 

** This is to fartfay all perfons that my be confernid, that A. B from 
the parifh of C. and in county of D. and E F. from the parifh of G. and

both to be Angle perfons, and now mayried by the forme of the Kirk of 
Scotland, and agreible to the Church of England, and givine ondre my 
hand, this iSth day of March, 1793" 

Is it not a difgrace to the police of a civilized country, to permit fuch 
irregularities to be praclifed with impunity ? And is it not a reflection 
on the good fenfe and difcernment of the Nobility and Gentry of Eng- 
land, (for fome of the Englifh Nobility have been married here), to fuffer 
themfelves to be impofed upon, and their pockets to be picked, by fuch 
mifcreants ? ,

<p>Name, Extent, Rivulets, l$c. 

NOTHING is feemingly more arbitrary and capricious 
than the names of places, and nothing is for that rea- 
fon perhaps lefs attended to and understood ; owing, as we 
fuppofe, their origin to mere fancy or arbitrary will, we 
think them unworthy of a ferious investigation ; and that 
every attempt to account for them, is but a confirmation 
of what we fuppofe. On the other extreme, is the opi- 
nion of thofe who allow, indeed, that they may be traced, 
and their meaning afcertained, but that in order to this, an- 
cient times muft be confulted, and ancient tales be belie- 
ved. Whatever, therefore, comes ftamped with this au- 
thority, and has any relation, though but in found to the 
name, is admitted as a matter of importance, and fufficient 
to fettle every inquiry of this kind. To fuch perfons the

marvellous and improbable are fo far from being objection 
that they rather appear to be natural for the times that 
gave them birth,- and neceffary to give dignity and perma- 
nancy to what they were intended to exprefs. It is for 
this reafon, that the names of places have been explained in 
the mod fanciful manner, and circumftances adduced in the 
explication of them, that exceed every degree of probabi- 
lity, and are evidently falfe. The name before us, as ac- 
counted for by fome, is one of thefe. According to them, 
there was among the Danes who infefted this country, a 
man of extraordinary ihength and flature, and that upon a 
time, to mow I fuppofe his extraordinary folly, he made a 
remarkable leap from a bill in the neighbourhood of the 
plr.ee where the church now ftands, and that to this inci- 
dent the hill itfelf and the parifli are indebted for their 
name. But without examining into the merits of this ftory, 
or regretting that it had not been more circumftantially 
told, we need only obferve, that the name is with much , 
more probability derived from an old and refpeftable fami- 
ly in the parifli, or from its hilly appearance Dun-hp or 
Dun /uib, fignifying, in Gaelic, " a winding or circuitous * 
hill and were we to credit the tradition, that the houfe of 
Dunlop flood originally on the top of Dunlop-hill, we 
mictfit be led from this circumftance, and the appearance of 
the ground about it, to fuppofe, that it might be called, in 
the language of the *imes, the houfe on, or the houfe of the 
winding hill, and that the family itfelf might afterward 
affume that name, and give it to the parifli. The parifli is 
of an oblong figure, being about 7 Englifli miles long, and 
a- broad. It is bounded by the parilhes of Neilfton, 
Stewartoun, and Beith. From the firft of thefe it is fepa- 
rated in front by a fmall burn or brook on the E. from the 
fecond in the fame manner on the S. and from the laft by 
Lugton on the N. This has its fourcc in the parifli of 
t • Neilfton,- 



of Dunlop.

Neihlon, is well ftored with fifh, efpecially trout, and is at 
prefent only worthy of notice for the extent of country- 
through which it paffes, and the winding courfe which it 
takes in its progrefs to Garnoch, which it turns in the 
neighbourhood of Kilwinning. There are no rivers, and 
but 2 burns in the pariQi, one of which is confiderable e- 
nough to afford a fufficient fupply of water during the win- 
ter, and in wet feafons, to the mills which are ere&amp;ed on 
it, and is faid to contain the charhe or chare, a fpecies of 
trout of the fineft quality. 

Roads. — By means of the roads which interfecl: it in dif- 
ferent places, there is an eafy accefs to every part of the 
parilh, and likewife to the country and town around it. Jn 
confequence of this, the people have frequent and friendly 
intercourfe with one another, know the value of every- 
thing they have to fell, and can bring it to the belt mar- 
ket. To the fame caufe, perhaps, may be afcribed that po- 
lifh and urbanity which they have in common with their 
neighbours, and that fondnefs for drefs which is fo obferva- 
ble on public occalions. 

Surface, Sot', and Produce. — The parilh of Dunlop may 
be faid to ftand upon high ground, and to confift of a great 
variety of hills. None of thefe, however, are remarkable 
for their height, but many of them for the beautiful and 
extenfive profpecb which they give, and all of them for the 
rich grafs which they produce, arifing from an elevated 
bafe, which occupies great part of the parilh. The ground, 
though hilly, is of eafy accefs, and well adapted to the pur- 
pofes of pafture and agriculture For the fame reafon, it 
abounds in fprings of excellent water ; and being moreover 
within a few miles of the fea, it is bleffed with a pure and 
iiealthful air. In confequence of this, the people are fub- 



Statiftical Account 



ject to few difeafes, and generally live to a good old age.' 
In the weftern parts of the parilh, the foil is either light 
or of a thin clay, and towards the E. the prevailing foil is 
deep and heavy, with a cold wet bottom. And this, it is 
probable, has given rife to a practice unknown in other 
parts of the country, and which ftrangers are apt to con- 
lider as foolifli and unaccountable. The cuftom is, to 
plough with 4 horfes and 3 men ; 2 of the men are em- 
ployed in the ufual way ; but the third, with a long pole 
fixed to the beam of the plough, direfts the beam, and af- 
fifts the ploughman By this mode, of an ancient date 
among them, they imagine they do more and better work 
in the fame time, than could be done by any other method. 
But whether the advantages 6f this, fuppofing them to be 
real, will overbalance the expenfe of an additional horfe 
and fervant, is certainly a queftion of fome importance, 
efpecially to thofe who have nothing but cuftom to juftify 
their continuance of it. In a place like this, where the 
farms are fmall, and where the ploughing is carried on by 
two neighbours jointly, this expenfe is indeed not to rea- 
dily perceived ; yet ftill it mull be for their interefl to per- 
ceive it, and for their credit, as proper farmers, to retrench 
it. From what has been faid concerning the difference of 
foil, it is eafy to fee that there will be a difference alfo in 
what it produces. The crops accordingly, which are ufual- 
ly oats, are better and more productive in the firft and fe- 
cond, than they are in the third divilion of foil ; thofe of 
the former yielding from 17 to 19, and thofe of the latter 
but from 12 to 15 pecks of meal the boll. The average 
rate, however, of meal the boll, for the whole parilh, will 
not exceed 14 pecks, though the boll here contains a bulhel 
! more than it does in moil oilier counties in Scotland. And 
what may appear a little itiange for a parilh. not of great

•extent, the harveft is concluded fome feafons five * fooner in 
ithe weftern than it is in the eaftern extremity of it. But the 
principal produce, or manufacture, as it maybe called, of the 
parifti, is cheefe. For this it has been long known and diftin- 
guiftied, infomuch that all the cheefe made in the coun- 
try about it, when carried to Paifley, Glafgow, or farther, 
goes by the name of Dunlop cheefe, and finds a better 
market on that account. Nor is this preference to be af- 
cribed altogether to prejudice ; for it is certainly as good as 
ever it was, and equal, if not fuperior, to what is made any- 
where elfe. The practice of making fweet-inilk cheefe, 
as it is called, was firft introduced into this parifti by one 
Barbara Gilmour, whole grandfon is ftill living, and is pro- 
prietor of the fame farm. Having gone to Ireland, to a- 
void the hardlhips which people were then expofed to on 
account of religion, (he is faid to have brought it with her 
when {he returned about the time of the Revolution. Since 
that period, cheefe has been the great and almoft the only 
bufinefs of Dunlop. Senfible that their lituation was more 
favourable for this than for any other purpofe, the people 
bellowed upon it the greateft care, and turned it to the belt 
advantage. — They have inclofed their ground, have but a 
third or fourth of it in tillage, and the reft in grafs, which 
is always a plentiful crop, and of the fineft quality. They 
are very attentive both to the colour and ftiape of their 
cows, which are rather fmall than otherwife, and common- 
ly of their own raifiag. And as thefe feed in inclofures, 
free from the restraints of herding, and are not brought in- 
to houfes during the night, from the beginning of May to 
the end of harveft, the quantity of milk which they give 
is very great. I am forry that under this article I cannot 
give the reader all the information I could wilh, either as

to the number of cows that is kept, or the quantity of 
cheefe that is made in the parifh. The people were a- 
larmed when queftioned about thefe things, and alleging 
that this was valuing their farms, they refuted to give me 
any fatisfatfion on this head ; only from what I could col- 
IecT:, fo far as I went with this view, I mould fuppofe that 
there may be about 758 cows kept, and about 10,612 ftones 
of cheefe made in it annually, which is equal to L. 3714, 
4 s. at 7 s. a-ftone, the market-price at prefent. And to 
this they are well entitled, both on account of the quantity 
and quality of their cheefe. For as this is the produce of 
the richeft pafture, and the bed cows, fo nothing can exceed 
their integrity and cleanlinefs in manufacturing it. Like 
that made in fome of the counties of England, it appears to 
great difadvantage when new, but improves by age and proper 
keeping. The valued rent of the pariih is L. 41 15, 17 s, 
6 d. Scots. The real rent upwards of L. 3000 Sterling*. 

Population. 

* It might be expected, in a country like this, which is all inclofed, 
that there would be a good deal of plantation, or at leaft that hedge-rows 
would be frequent and in a thriving condition. The truth is, though 
trees be neceffury both in point of utility and ornament, and though na- 
ture points with an high hand as it were to many places where thefc 
mould be ; yet they are only to be found in fmall numbers, where an 
houfe ftands, or where one has flood. This general obfervation, how- 
ever, admits of two exceptions. Mr Dunlop of Dunlop has planted 
fome thoufands of trees of different kinds within thefe few years ; and 
from his good tafte and great attention, there is every reafon to expect 
that he will proceed. on a larger fcale. The late Mr Muif of Caldwail 
was a man of the fincft talte, and in nothing perhaps did his fuperiority 
in that more appear, than in the manner in which he has laid off his 
ground, and placed his different plantations. Thefe, (kitting and inter- 
fering his feveral farms, add both to their beauty and value ; and afford 
a pleafant proof, how much the face of a country, naturally bleak and 
unpropitious, may be changed and improved. But an example of this 
kind was not likely to be followed by thole whole properties are but 
fmall, and whofe ftudy is economy, refiding the greater part of them on 
their own farms, and depending in a great mcafure pn h hat they produce, -

and of future advantage, but which mult be attended with prefent ex- 
penfe, are feldom thought of, and never adopted. Under thefe circum- 
ftances, it is not to be wondered at, if the parifb. i?, with refpect to trees, 
what it was in the days of their fathers, very naked and bare ; in- 
deed, after what has been faid, the reader will be furprifed when he is 
told, that in no parifh of the fame limits, and inhabited by fo plain and 
frugal a people, will he find a greater number of good fubftantial houfes. 
Many of thefe are dated, and finiihed in a ftyle that mows what might be 
done in other things, was there the fame inducement. Tjiofe above us in

* With regard to the population of the parilh JO years ago, it is a lit- 
tle uncertain, whether the number therein /rated comprehended every in- 
dividual, or thefe only who were of age to be examined. If the latter on- 
ly, the number of the people would be much the fame then with what it is 
at prcfent; but it is more probable that the firft was the cafe, as the di- 
vision of property has been frequent, and the number of proprietors con- 
fiderably increafed fince that time. With refpccl to the lift of perfons 
between 70 and 100, it may be obferved, that 17 of thefe were from 70 
to 80, and 8 of them from that to 100 ; 2 of thefe are fince dead, 1 of

cmilh them, it may be obferved, that they retain nothing 
* of 

longevity of late years, were James Anderfon, who died at the advan- 
ced age of ioo, and John Andrew, fo old as ro2 according to the report 
of his family. As to proprietors and tenants, it may be noticed, thac 
there are but few of the former whofe properties are cxtenfive, and of the 
latter whofe farms are large ; and as the greater part of each of thefe 
is in grafs, the labour of the female becomes more neceffary than that of 
the male fervant to manage them. And this accounts for the difpropor- 
tion that is between them. The number of both however is diminilhed 
during the winter, both becaufe they are lefs neceflary, and becaufc 
their wages are very high. The men get from L. 4 to L 6, and the wo- 
men from L. 2 to L. 2, 10 s. for the half-year. From which it rs obvious 
to remark, that labour is very expenlive here. The wages of an ordi- 
nary labourer are from 1 s. 4d. to t s. 6 d. a-day, from the beginning of 
February to the end of November, and in time of harveft they are ftill 
higher, as then he gets the fame wages and his provifions alfo. How to 
account for this it mult be confidered, that there^ are but few of this 
clafs, and that thefe few live within two hours walk of the great works 
in a neighbouring parifh, where they can find employment at all times 
and on their own terms. Having a fittfation fo inviting always before 
them, and circumftances of advantage, which it is not their intereft to 
neglect, fo ealily in their power, it is natural for them to avail themfelves 
of them, which they accordingly never fail to do ; fo that it is impoflible 
to fay what the price of labour, and where labourers may be found in a 
few years in this part of the country. From what I have faid, it will be 
ealily inferred, that there are none of thefe works within the bounds of 
this charge ; and confidering its diftance from coal and fuel of every kind, 
and its deficiency in water to anfwer thefe purpofes, it is more than pro- 
bable that none of them ever will be in it. Nor is this a matter of any 
regret to me, how much foever I may fuffcr with others, from the caufes 
which prevent them. For although I rejoice in the profperity of my 
country, and in every thing that tends to the improvement and hap- 
pinefs of mankind, yet in the cafe alluded to, there is reafon, I appre- 
hend, to rejoice with trembling. Works that depend fo much on the 
labour of the young, and that mult neceflarily crowd fo many of them 
together, muft be hurtful to their health, and holding out an early and

eventually at lead hurtful to their manners ; not to mention, that by col- 
lecting fo many people of all defciiptions into one place, they may mate- 
rially affect, if not cxhauft the funds of the poor. But it is not my inten- 
tion to reflect upon works, in which human ingenuity feems to be carried 
almoft as far as it cai' go, and in which pcrfons of the firlt character and 
greateft refpectability are concerned. And therefore I remaik, that as to 
what relates to the poor, thofe ftated in the table are not the only per- 
fons who receive from the funds. There are befides thefe, federal others 
whom it is found necefTary to affift from time to time, but who are not 
entered on the poors lift, becaufc they aie able to do fomething for them- 
felves, and that they may be the more induftiiou*. The capital of their 
fund commenced abiut 60 years ago in the time of Mr Rouat. He was 
what is called a popular preacher, and popular with this peculiarity, that 
he was equally efteemed by the great and the common people; and be- 
ing well attended every Sabbath by both, the collections were fuch as to 
enable the feffion or veftry, to raife a little, as a ftock, which has been 
increafing ever fince, and is now pretty confiderable. The intereft arifing 
from this and the contributions at the church door on Sundays form the 
annual income, which is appropriated to the exigencies of the poor, and 
is ufually more than fufficient to anfwer their demands and to put them 
above the ncceflity of begging. Begging, however, is daily practifed by 
thofe who come from other places. Retrained from following this at 
home, and knowing how ready the people here are to liften to them, and 
relieve them, they pour in upon them from every quarter, and importune 
them every hour. But that cannot be charity which brings abr. ad the 
idle and the difeafed, and that cannot be charity which diftributes with 
an indifcriminating hand. Charity thinketh no evil, but charity raaft 
think the truth ; and while it does, it muft as infallibly lead us to dif- 
countenance begging, as it will lead us to be merciful, and full of sonJ- 
paffioa to the poor.

with the greatnefs of the height, and the grandeur of the 
valley below. In this fituation, we feel every thing which 
the magnificent can infpire, not without a wifti to retire 
from it with all convenient fpeed. — The language which 
they fpeak is a mixture of Scotch and Englilh, and has 
no other Angularity, but the flow drawling manner in 
which it is fpoken, and that they uniformly pronounce 
fow, fed and mow, mai-w. The only cuftom which 
they may be faid to retain is that of having great and ex- 
pensive burials. It is no unuiual thing when a wealthy 
perfon dies, to invite two or three parifhes to attend his fu- 
neral ; and as they are limited to no particular hour, great 
part of the day is taken up in coming to it, and waiting 
on it. But the lofs of labour, and the lofs of time, are not 
the only evils that follow it ; it becomes opprellive to thofe 
who cannot atFord the expenfe, but who, from vanity or 
pride, mull continue the cuftom. Many things have been 
objects of taxation, and were this as univerfal as it is unne- 
cefTary, it would be wife and merciful in the Legiflature 
not to exempt it. In defcribing their character, it may 
be juftly faid, that they are of the principles of the Church 
of Scotland, and that thefe have the happieft influence on 
their civil and religious conduct. Warmly attached to 
the conftitution in Church and State, they are zealoufly 
affected for the interefts of both, and are almofl as rarely 
feen to feparate from the church as they are heard to be 
difloyal to their King. Nor are they lefs exemplary in 
the other duties of their flation ; fo that it but feldom hap- 
pens, that any of them are addidled to the common vices 
of the age ; and there are but few of them who cannot 
mow, that the hand of the diligent maketh rich. Among 
a people of this complexion, taverns cannot be numerous, 
nor be attended with bad effects ; for few will be inclined 
to keep them, where little bufinefs and little profits are to

the prefent number in the parifh, were it not for the pu- 
blic roads, which are frequented by ftrangers, and from 
whom chiefly they derive their encouragement, fmall as it is. 

Eccle/iajlical State, Stipend, School, ISc. — The next article 
in order is the church, under which it may be proper to 
give fome account of it in ancient and modern times. 
Dunlop was one of the many parifhes that had been ap- 
propriated to the monaftery of Kilwinning, and of which 
that monaftery became the beneficiary or titular. This is 
evident from a tranfaftion between the Commendator of 
"Kilwinning and Cuninghame of Arket, in the year 1581, 
whereby the former gives in tack, to the latter the whole 
teinds, parfonage and vicarage, of the parifh of Dunlop, for 
a certain number of years, and with the exception of cer- 
tain lands therein fpecified. At an early period, therefore, 
and as foon perhaps as it was defigned a parifh, -it may be 
fuppofed, that it would have a parifh-church, and that the 
church may have flood at firft at a place which is called the 
Temple-hcufe to this day. But when it was built, and 
how long it continued there, cannot be known, as there is 
no vefHge -of it remaining, and as the tradition concerning it 
is almoft gone. The next place where we find it, although 
equally uncertain of the time of its ere&amp;ion, is in a fitua- 
tion which was happily chofen for the purpofes of dura- 
tion in thofe days, ftanding at the bottom of a rock, ex- 
tending itfelf in the form of a breaft-work, and under 
the gloom of the trees and brufhwood with which it would 
be covered. It poffefled every thing that was requifite to 
infpire the worfhippers with reverence, and to promote the 
feverity of their afts of mortification, which the nature 
of their fin, or the pleafure of their priefl, might enjoin ; 
but whether it was cuftomary in thefe cafes, to repair to a

juti now hinted, fay the people, bur more probably for its 
being found by itfelf, Thugirtltane being a corruption or 
an abbreviation of The girt or great tlone. Hard by the 
church was a fpring, which ftill continues, and from which 
iffues a ftream of the fineil water, and in fuch abundance 
as to fill a bore of i inches diameter. It is fly led in all 
the old writings, which mention it, the Chaplainry of the 
bleffed Virgin Mary, which mows, that it was dedicated to 
her ; and that the ltepping ftones in the burn, over which, 
the people palled in their way thither, were called the 
Lady's Steps, for the fame reafon ; which name the place 
flill retains, although there be now a bridge at it. From 
what remains of it, it appears to have been a fmall houfe, 
but large enough, it may be prefumed, to accommodate the 
•inhabitants, which, probably it did till the Reformation, 
when it was either deferted or deftroyed. In a different and 
more elevated' fituation, Hands the prefent church ; but 
having been rebuilt about 27 years ago, the date of its 
firft foundation, if there was one, has not been preferved. 
It is pretty certain, however, from an infeription on the 
graveftone of Mr Hamilton, who died in the year 1608, 
and who is faid to have ferved the' cure here 45 years, that 
it was built at the Reformation, or foon after it *. Ihe

the

James Lord Vifcount Clandeboyes ; for fo Mr Hamilton's eldeft fon is 
defigned in an infcription on the fchool-houfe, as we lliall (how in its pro- 
per place. It is upon the whole a piece of fine workmanfhip, and a tri- 
bute to the memory of worthy parents, which mull -have been very ex- 
penfive to their pious fon. But through length of time, and great ne- 
glect, it has been much injured ; and as there are none who think them- 
felves immediately concerned to keep it in repair, it will foon become 
ruinous. For none will impute to the prcfent age, what was faidof the Pha- 
rifees, that they " build the tombs of the prophets and garnifh the fepul- 
chres of the righteous." Jam not inpoffeffion of further information about 
Mr Hamilton's family, and therefore fliall only add. that it is not a little 
for the credit of Dunlop, that befides thofe who may be faid to belong to 
it, it has given birtli to perfons of fuch eminence and dilHnct.ion as they 
certainly were. Mr Hanis Hamilton was great-grandfather to Mr Wil- 
liam Carftairs, Principal of the Univerlity of Edinburgh, and to Mr 
William Dunlop, Principal of the Univerfity of Glafgow, and Hiftorio- 
grapher for Scotland. Iu Crawford's Hiftory of Renfrewfhire, publifhed 
in 1710, Mr Hamilton's eldeft fon James, is ftyled Earl of Clanbryfal in 
the kingdom of Ireland ; but whether Hamilton, the prefent Earl of Clan- 
bryfal, be a defcendent of his, T know not. From that period little is 
known of the minifters of this parfih, till the Revolution, when Mr Ga- 
brial Cuninghame was appointed to the charge. He had been one of the 
indulged minifters, was a man of confiderable abilities, and greatly re- 
fpected by the people. To him fucceeded Mr Jamiefon, in whom fimpli- 
city and godly fincerity were very confpicuons, and who therefore had, 
what he was well entitled to, the love and affection of his flock. When 
dying, he left his two fons, who were then only boys, to the care of one 
Anderfon of Craighead, a plain countryman, who undertook the charge, 
and.executed it with great fidelity. The one he bred a merchant, and the 
other a clergyman, without impairing in the leaft the little patrimony 
which was left them. Mr William Jamiefon, the clergyman, was minifter 
of Rarick, and author of an Eflay on Virtue and Happinefs, which may 
be confidered as an ingenious attempt to reconcile what is irreconcilable, 
the different accounts of moral obligation. After Mr Jamiefon was Mr 

Rouat.

the higheft honour on the gentlemen concerned, and promi- 
fes to be of extenfive utility, by exciting others to follow 
their example. * 

Rouat, of whom mention has been made already, and concerning whom 
there are thefe two ancedotes. The church-officer complaining one day 
to the fervant, that Mr Rouat was too much with the Gentles, was replied 
to, that her mafter had fcripture for that; for, fays the apoftle, " Lo wc 
turn to the Gentles." He was convinced and relieved, and perfeclly 
pleafed with the gentles. When the faci a ment was to be given for 
the firflr time by the gentleman who was then minifter, Mifs Dunlop, 
afterwards Lady Wallace, came to church rather early, and exprefied to 
an old fervant her fatisfadtion at feeing the houfe fo decently filled. 
" Madam faid the old man, this is 'nothing to what I have feen in Mr 
Rouat's time, I have heard the boogers cracking at 6 o'clock o' the 
morning ! The boogers cracking, WTiat do you mean James, faid Mifs 
Dunlop ? Yes Madam, continued James, I have feen the folk in his time, 
htting on the balks of the kirk like bykes o* bees." Thefe ftories, trifling 
and ridiculous enough in thomfelves, mow the fpirit of the times, and 
that it was pofllble in thofe days, at leaft for the fame perfon to be a 
gentleman, a fcholar. and a popular preacher. Mr Rouat was afterwards 
tranflated to Jedburgh, where he lived but a fliort time. His fon was 
fometime Profeflbr of Church Hiftory in the College of Glafgow, and 
died within thefe few years in the pofleflion of all that efteem which was 
due to the worthy fon of a worthy father. Mr Baird fucceeded Mr 
Rouat as minifter of Dunlop. and was, if inferior to his predeceflor hi 
popularity, his equal in prefence of mind, prompt expreflion, and pleafant 
manners. He was moreover, like him too, a warm and perfuafive preacher, 
a fincere Chriftian, and an honeft man. — Thofe that follow are ftill living. 

* The fchool-houfe is of the fame age with the tomb, and' was built by 
the fame perfon, as will appear from the following infeription, above re- 
ferred to : 

1641. 

" This fchool is erected and endowed by James Vifcount Claneboyes 
in love to his parifli, in which his Father, Hans Hamilton, was pa- 
ftor 45 years, in King James the fixt his raigne."

tainly be generous in thofe who may have the means of being acquainted 
with it, to difclofe it, that the intentions of the Noble Donor might be 
anfwered, and the circumftances of the teacher bettered. For at prefent 
he derives no other advantage from that endowment than the houfe he 
lives in ; and his place, including every thing belonging to it, does not 
amount to L. 19 a-year. Why then ihould we complain of the want of 
learning in our teachers, or be furprifed if their fuccefibrs are not half fo 
learned. In moft country pariihes the number of fcholars is very preca- 
rious, and the fchool-wages exceedingly fmall, as fmall in many of them 
as they were 20 years ago ; in which cafe, what is to be expected, but 
that either the teacher is himfelf untaught, or that he is difpirited in 
teaching, and in a perpetual ftruggle for a better place. By which 
means he neglects his prefent truft, and offends his prefent employers. 
It would be wrong indeed to make them independent of their office, but 
it would be as far wrong to Itarve them in it. Let them have what is 
proper to call forth their exertions, and to reward their abilities, and then 
we ihall fee the profeffion as refpectable as it is ufeful.

r | V HIS parilh takes its name from Grangia, a middle age 
•* term for a farm, or country refidence. This name 
was given to the lands called the Davoch of Grange by 
the Abbots of Kinlofs, who had here a caftle, in which they 
frequently refided, attracted by the beauty of the fituation, 
the cattle being built upon the top of a fmall mount, partly 
natural, partly artificial, furrounded with a dry ditch, upon 
the fouth fide of a riling ground, overlooking extenfive 
haughs, then covered with wood, and the fmall river Ifla 
meandring through them for feveral miles. The church 
lies 16 meafured miles S. W. from Banff, 12 S. of Port-

N. to S. by 5 miles from E. to W *. The parifh ex- 
tends N. from the banks of Ifla, in 3 long but low ridges, 
terminating in the mountains called the Knockhill, Lurg- 
hill, and hill of Altmore, which divide it from the fertile 
countries of Boyn and Enzie f. The Knockhill is a very- 
high conical hill, upon the N. E. corner of the parifh. It 
is detached all round from the reft of the ridge, and is feen 
at a great diftance every way, both by fea and land, as it

* This parifli is part of the diftricl called Stryla, or Strath-ifla ; fo call- 
ed from the fmall river Ifla, which runs along the fouth fide of it from 
W. to E. ; dividing a farm or two, on the north fide of the ridge of hills 
called Ballach, from the reft of this parilh ; and empties itfelf into the 
Deveron, about two miles eaft of the parifh, after a fhort courfe of I % 
miles, in which it receives a number of rapid mountain-ftreams, which 
caufe it frequently to overflow its banks, and damage the crops upon the 
haughs ; which, for 5 miles of its courfe, in this and the neighbouring 
parifli of Keith, are about half a mile broad. In the the years 1768, 
1782, 1787, and 1789, the river did incredible damage to the crops upon 
the haughs. In 1768, the greater part of the crop being cut, but not got 
in, a flood fwept the whole away. In 1782, 1787. and 1789 the floods 
came earlier in the fcafon, and blafted the crop in (hooting ; in 1789, ii 
particular, the haughs were II times overflowed, from the time they 
were fown, before the crop was got in. 

f Altmore fignifies '-The great Burn,' and is the name of a large and 

rapid ftream, which takes its rife in thefe mountains, and running from N. 

to S. falls into Ifla, dividing the parifli of Keith from Grange, the whole 

length of its courfe. Other 3 burns iri this parifh take their rife in thefe 

mountains, and running from N. to S. parallel to the burn of Altmore, 

fall alfo into Ifla ; two of them, the burn of Pathnie and the Lime-burn, 

run between the 3 ridges or divifions of the parifh above mentioned ; the 

third, the burn of Millagyn, is the boundary of the parifh upon the E. 

feparating it from Marnoch and Rothefnay. Thefe burns, together with 

Ifla, abound with very fine trout of different kinds: which are the only fifh 

found in them, except in autumn, when the falmon, with which the De- 

veron abounds, come up Ifla to depofit their fpawn ; but no clean falmon 

are ever caught in Ifla. Otters arc fometimes found in Ifla, and in thefe

ot 6 or 8 feet at leaft. The average height of the Knock- 
hill above the adjacent vallies may be about 400 yards. 
It is faid, that in a clear day, part of 12 counties can be di- 
ftinctty difcerned from the top of it. There are only other 
two hills in the parifli. The hill of Silliearn makes part 
of the eaftmoft of the three ridges, into which the parifli is 
divided. It rifes about 100 yards above the reft of the 
ridge, extending from N. to S. about two miles, and from 
E. to W. above a quarter of a mile. The Gallowhill is 
a fmall hill of about 200 acres area, making part of the Da- 
voch of Grange, lying N. of the church, upon the fouth end 
of the middle ridge or divifion of the parifli, and is fo call- 
ed, becaufe it was the place of execution for criminals, 
tried and condemned in the abbot's regality-court ; for the 
Abbots ofKinlofs,as well as the;great feudal barons, had an 
heritable right of judging in all civil and criminal matters 
in their own domeftic court, by their bailie of regality, 
within a certain diitri£r, generally their own eftates, and 
from this court there lay no appeal ; nay, they could even 
reclaim a caufe out of the King's courts, if it belonged to 
their jurifdi&amp;ion, and judge it in their own. This right, fo 
derogatory to the honour and power of the Crown, and to 
theadminiftration of juftice in the national courts, as well as 
to the liberty of the fubjecr, was aboliflied after the rebellion 
in 1745, ap d a compensation in money given by Parlia- 
ment to the heritable proprietors. The low part of the 
pavilh is in general pretty generally cultivated, except fome 
low moffes, and the cultivation has crept more than half 
up the fun- unding hills. The land for a mile N. of the 
water of Ifla, lying upon the lide of a riling ground, doping 
to the fouth, is a good foil, tolerably dry and early, and 

very

very fertile in good feafons, and when well cultivated ; but 
two-thirds of the cultivated ground in the parifli to theN. 
are cold, wet, and late, the foil confifting chiefly of a poor 
clay, upon a till bottom, or a fpungy mofiy foil. The air of 
the parifli is moift, owing not only to the wetnefs of the 
foil, but alfo to the ridge of hills between it and the fea, 
which attracts the clouds as they pafs from the Moray Frith, 
and make them difcharge their contents in torrents upon 
Stryla, when there hardly falls a drop on the coaft fide. 
Stryla feldom fuffers by a dry feafon, but always hy a wet 
one. 

Antiquities, Heritors. — This parifli appears to have been 
anciently covered with wood, and to have been part of a 
vaft foreft, extending from the river Deveron to the 
Spey, through the pariflies of Rothemay, Grange, Keith, 
and Boharm, as appears from the roots and trunks of oaks, 
alder, birch, and fir, found in great quantities, in the many 
and extenfive moffes, fo frequent in that tracl: ; but at 
prefent this parifli is quite deftitute of wood, except fome 
folitary trees, fcattered in a few farmers yards, a copfe of 
200 or 300 trees at the houfe of Edingight, and two fmall 
patches of firs, which are not thriving. This gives the 
whole country a bare and naked appearance. It does not 
appear that the parifli was early inhabited •, there are no 
traces of Druidical temples in it ; although thefe are fre- 
quent in the neighbouring parifhes. The places that have 
names derived from the Gaelic, (which are not many,) 
mull have been firft inhabited ; becaufe that language was 
univerfal in Scotland till after the Norman Conquelt of 
England, when the tyranny of the Conqueror, occafioned 
the flight of great numbers of Anglo-Saxons into Scotland, 
who, obtaining fettlements in the low country, along the 
eaft coaft of Scotland, introduced their language, which

gradually diffufed itfelf through all the more civilized and 
beft cultivated part of the country ; perhaps the clergy al- 
io contributed to difrufe the Englifh language where they 
had property or eftablifhments. There is reafon to think, 
that the Scotch dialed* of the Englifh languages has been 
the language of the natives of this parifh for at leaft 400 
years *. The lands of Strath Ifla, (Strath-heylifF, as it is 
fpelled in the charter), containing the whole parifh of 
Grange, and a great part of the parifh of Keith, were be- 
llowed by William the Lyon upon the abbacy of Kinlofs, 
in the 1 2th century. The Popifh clergy very much pro- 
moted the cultivation and improvement of the country, 
where they had eftablilhments, and large tracts of land 
granted to them, formerly not very valuable, nor well cul- 
tivated, which foon became, under their pofTeffion, well cul- 
tivated and well peopled. While the barbarous wars and 
depredations carried on between neighbouring chieftains,

* The names of pfaces in this parifli, derived from the Gaelic, are faid 
to be defcriptive of the local fituation, or peculiar properties, of the 
places to which they belong ; and it is probable, that they have been 
firft occupied for the purpofe of pafturage, rather than for raifing corn. 
The principal of them, together with what is faid to be their meaning, 
are as follows: Edingight, ' The Place oppofite to the Wind.' Tot trie, 
' The cold South-eaft Hillock.' Crannach, ' The Gufhet, or Triangle,' 
alluding to the fliape of the ground. Ealarnoon, ' The Mofs.town.' 
Patbnic, ' The Cow-Hillock.' Cantley, ' The frofty Height.' Auchin- 
boove, ' The Field of Groves,' &amp;c. This laft feems to take its name 
from one of the fields of battle, with which this parifh abounds, and' 
which are faid to have been fought between the Scots and Danes, when 
the latter landed at Cullen, in the reign of Donald III. in the end of the 
ninth century ; who, as appears fjom the ancient Scotch hiftorians, de- 
feated the Danes near Cullen, and afterwards at Forres in Moray ; 
■when, as Guthrie conjectures, the famous obelifk at Forres was erect- 
ed. The Danes, in advancing into the heart of the country, muft necsf- 
fcrily pafs through the parifh of Grange, which is only 4 computed miles

often defolated and depopulated their eftates, the poifef- 
iions of the clergy flouriGied •, the oppreffed often fled to 
the church for protection, and took refuge under the wings 
of the clergy, whofe Ipiritual and temporal power was 
long very great. Strath Ma was foon well cultivated, and 
well peopled, under the Abbots of Kinlofs, who had great 
eftates, and were very rich and powerful. They frequent- 
ly lived at their caftle of Grange, in great fplendour and 
hofpitality, and kept a certain number of monks there, 
to manage their eftates, and cultivate their domeftic farm ; 
they erected mills upon Ifla for grinding corn, and bound 
their tenants to bring their whole crop to thefe mills ; be- 
caufe they here levied the tithe of corn, which, lince the 
Reformation, has been exacted under the denomination of 
that opprellive fervitude called multures, afterward to be 
taken notice of. Upon the firft appearance of the Refor- 
mation in this kingdom, the then Abbot, whofe name was 
Robert Robifon, forefeeing the approaching troubles, be- 
gan, 

diftant from Cullen ; and ■there are fevera.1 trenches or encampments, 
fuppofed to be made by the Scots, upon the haughs of Ifla, with the de- 
fenfive fide thrown up towards the coaft. Two of the fields of battle 
are clearly to be feen, being covered with cairns of (tones, under which 
they ufed to bury the flain. One of thefe fields is on the N. fide of the 
Callow-hill, not far from the encampments above mentioned ; and the 
other is on the S. fide of Knockhill, to which there leads a road, from 
the encampments, over the hill of Silliearn, called to this day, « The 
Bowmens Road.' Auchinhove, which lies near the banks of Ifla, has 
been another field of battle ; and in a line with it, towards Cullen, upon 
the head of the bum of Altmore, fome pieces of armour were faid to 
have been dug up feveral years ago, but were not preferved ; and in the 
fame line, towards the coaft, upon the top of the hill of Altmore, there 
is a cairn, called The King's Cairn, where probably the Danifh King or 
General was flain in the purfuit. There are no other antiquities in this 
pariih but The Abbot's Caftle, already mentioned ; of which there now 
remains nothing but a heap of rubbilh ; being entirely deftroyed for the 
fake of theftones, which are very fcarce in this corner, for building houfes.

gan, about the year 1535, to feu out his lands in Stryla, to 
the tenants that then pofleffed them, for fuch fums of mo- 
ney 3S he could obtain, and the payment of a fmall yearly 
feu-duty, referving to himfelf, however, the tithe of corn 
paid at the mills. His fucceffor, who was the laft eccle- 
fiaftical abbot, completed what his predeceffor had be- 
gun, referving only the feu-duty ; which, upon the diffo- 
lution of the abbacy, came into the poffemon of Edward 
Bruce, created commendator, or lay abbot of Kinlofs, and 
paffed from him to the family of Lethen in Moray, who 
at prefent draw about L. 42 of feu-duty from this pariih. 
Grange, being thus feucd out among a great number of 
fmall proprietors at the Reformation, continued in that 
fituation, except fome few changes, till towards the end of 
the laft century, when Alexander Duff of Braco got pof- 
fcffion of the greateft part of thefe fmall feus. The Da- 
voch of Grange, with the heritable jurifdiftion belonging 
to it, was the laft property which the abbots had in 
Stryla -, which, after being poffeffed fucceffively by Aber 
nethy Lord Salton, Lord Ochiltree, and Macpherfon of 
Cluny, belonged to the family of Gordon for more than a 
century, till the prefent Duke excambed it with the Earl 
of Fife, for fome lands in Moray, in the year 1779. At 
prefent, the Earl of Fife, the reprefentative of Alexander 
Duff of Braco, poffeffes four fifths of the p2iifh •, Captain 
Innes of Edingight, whofe anceftors were original feuars 
from the abbots, poffeffes one-fixth ; and the Earl of 
Findlater the remainder. Edingight is the only refiding 
heritor.

No regifter of deaths or burials was ever kept here till, in 
1783, an aft of Parliament was paffed, impofmg a duty up- 
on the registration of baptifms, marriages, and burials ; af- 
ter which, a regilter of burials was attempted to be kept, 
but the tax was fo odious and unpopular, (being confidered 
by the majority of the people as a tax upon their misfor- 
tunes), that it could not be collected, but with great diffi- 
culty ; at the fame time, that it afforded little information

part of the burials comes from other pariflies, and man j 
perfons dying in this parifli are buried elfewhere ; fo that 
from the moll attentive obfervation, for 4 years that the re- 
gifter was kept, it appeared that the burials did not corre- 
fpond at all with the deaths * for thefe reafons the regifter 
was given up. The regifter of marriages is rather a regifter 
of the contract and publication of banns of every individual 
in the parifli that is contracted, whether they marry or fet- 
tle in the parifh or not ; but thofe females that are contract- 
ed to men in other parifties, though their contract be re- 
corded here, do not add to the number of married couples 
in the parifli, for they generally remove from it altogether. 
This will account T in forne meafure, for the great difpropor- 
tion that fometimes appears between the marriages and 
baptifms in the table ; and it is like wife to be obferved, 
that the diflenters regifter all their contracts, but few 01 
none their baptifms. The baptifm-regifter appears to 
have been accurately kept, except during the period from 
1 771 to 1780, during which the church was vacant 2% years, 
and the people were frequently obliged to go to neighbour- 
ing clergymen to get their children baptized ; and not ha- 
ving an immediate opportunity of recording their childrens 
names, many of them did entirely neglect it. If, therefore, 
the regifter had been regularly kept during that period, 
the average number of baptifms, would probably have been 
about 36, inftead of 28 T ^ •, certainly it would have been 
greater than it is. At any rate, the writer of this is fure, 
that the names of all the children of the members of the 
Eftabliftiment are regularly recorded from the year 1780 ; 
and though the Seceders, and other diffenters, do not regi- 
fter the names of their children, there is every reafon to be- 
lieve, that their numbers are not fo great now, as that of 
the Papifts and Epifcopals were at the beginning of this 
century, when the firft Preftyterian minifter was fettled 

here ;

here ; fo that the regular decreafe of the average number of 
baptifms in every 10 years, from the beginning of this cen- 
tury, (the firft io years only excepted, which, it is to be 
obferved, immediately fucceeded the 7 years cf famine, 
during K. William III.'s reign), affords a ftrong prefump- 
tion, if not a pofitive proof, of a decreafing population. That 
the population has decreafed very confiderably fince the 
year 1780, is perfectly confiftent with the incumbent's know- 
ledge ; for that year, the number of fouls was 1980 ; in the 
year 1782, it was 1875 ; in 1784, only 1760; in 1789, di- 
minifhed to 1598 -, and in this year 1791, when an accu- 
rate lift of them was taken up, for the purpofe of this ftate- 
ment, the number of fouls is 1572, of which 697 are males,

Statiflical Account 



Agriculture, &amp;c. — Agriculture is in a worfe ftate at pre- 
fent in this parilh than it was 10 years ago. Before the 
year 1782, the improvements in farming, introduced by 

the 

no fubtenants. The lime-trade, which, for centuries Hack, has been the 
principal employment of all the inhabitants, was incompatible with large 
farms. The largeft farm formerly did not exceed 15 or 20 bolls fowing ; 
and every farm was fkirted with a number of fubtenants, who were 
bound to aflift their mailers, in fpring and harveft, with their fervices, 
which was generally the greater part of the rent they paid for their pof- 
feflions; and they were allowed to Jceep as many cattle and flieep upon 
the common pafture as they pleafed; and each diftrict of the parifli had 
a large tract of pafture in common Whenever the feed time was over, 
all hands were employed till harveft, and even after harveft was over, in 
providing fuel, and in burning and driving lime ; and before lime was 
brought by fea from England, and the frith of Forth, Stryla fupplied ai- 
moft all Aberdeenfliire, BanfHhire, and Moray, with lime ; for which 
they received, as long ago as can be remembered by the oldeft people, nearly 
the fame price as they do now. They had alfo a kind of fliort flax, which 
is now entirely baniflied out of the country, but of which they formerly 
raifed great quantities ; the drying, breaking, fcutching, beating, heckling, 
fpinning, weaving, and bleaching of which, not only afforded employ- 
ment to men and women, at certain times of the year, when they could 
not work at the lime-trade ; but brought in a groat deal of money in- 
thofe days, and Keith market was formerly reforted to from all parts of 
Scotland for purchaling linen-cloth. This, together with the low rents 
which they paid; the cheapnefs of victual, for which there was no market 
but among themfelves, and the numbers of black cattle and flieep whic h 
the then extenfive paftures enabled them to keep, (many of which they 
fattened and killed for their own ufe, becaufe there was no demand for 
them at that time from the fouth country or from England), enabled 
them to live comfortably,, and bring up numerous families ; and young 
people were not deterred from entering early in life into the manied 
ftate from fears of want. A very fmall ftock was fufficiei.t to begin the 
world, and that ftock was eafily acquired. But when fliipping and trade' 
became more common upon the coaft, and the exportation of corn com- 
menced at Portfoy, then the farmers thought they could make more pro- 
fit by the fale of corn, than by the lime-trade, or by fubtenants ; they 
therefore enlarged their farms, by removing their fubtenants. The he- 
ritors alfo extended the corn-land, by dividing the commons, and fating 



of Grange.

the late patriotic Lord Findlater into his adjoining eftates 
tipon the coaft fide, had crept gradually into this parifli. 

Carts 

off portions of them to the poor peeople to cultivate. Thefe were baa 
fubjecls for bearing com, being naturally of a poor, wet, four, ftony, or 
mofiy foil ; and when once the fwarcl of them was broke, they foon ceafed 
to be good either for grafs or corn, and improvers were unable to cure 
the natural barennefs of the foil with plenty of rich manure. The lofs 
of the pafture was an irreparable lofs to the farmers, the immenfe num- 
bers of fheep and black cattle, which were formerly kept upon the hills 
to which there was eafy accefs, on the paftures, and on the green moffes, 
now almoft wholly caft up for turff, or ploughed and burnt for corn, 
-produced a great deal of manure, which raifed plenty both of grafs and 
corn ; but the pafture being curbed and deftroyed by the new improve- 
ments, the cattle and flieep dwindled away, and the fields of confequence 
did not produce as formerly. The farms were neceflarily enlarged ; this 
-increafed the number of candidates for farms, and confequently raifed the 
rents, by fuggefting the plan to heritors, which they have too fteadily ad- 
hered to, of fetting up farms to roup. The high prices given for cattle 
within thefe 30 years, alfo tended greatly to advance the rents, and to di- 
minifh the number of fubtenants, whofe poffeflions were now become ne- 
■cefiary for pafture. The new improvements foon became unfit, for the 
reafons already afligned, to maintain the improvers and their families, 
even with all' the advantages of mofs and lime ; this occafioned the un- 
iting feveral improvements into one pofieflion. All thefe changes, tendel' 
to leffen the population. 2d, The decay of the lime-trade. Many pla- 
ces that were formerly fupplied with lime from Stryla, can now be fup- 
plied with Englifh fhells, cheaper than it can be manufactured here with 
peat, (always a precarious fuel, and obtained at much expenfe of time 
and labour), and carried to a great diftance, not lefs than S or 10 com- 
puted miles : whereas formerly people came from a great diftance, and 
uought it at the kilns and carried it themfelves. 3^, Emigrations, prin- 
cipally to the fouth country, occafioned partly by the rife of wages, and 
the demand for hands, for the purpofes both of agriculture and manufac- 
tures there ; but chiefly by the impolitic ,feverity of the landholders, af- 
terward to be taken notice of. qth, and laftly, A great mortality has pre- 
vailed in this parifh for feveral years paft. The parifli was always e- 
Iteemed healthy, till within the laft Io years, notwithstanding the moifture 
of the climate ; but the moifture cannot ftagnate, as it is expofed to very 
high winds from almoft every quarter. As a proof of its healthinek,

Csrts for carrying dung, lime, and grain, were univerfally 
adopted in place of creels, currocks and facks on horfes 
backs. The levelling and ftraighting of ridges, and culti- 
vating of green crops, fuch as turnip, potato, and fown 
grafs in fmall quantities, were becoming pretty common a- 
mong the mod confiderable farmers, and were rapidly gain* 
ing ground, when the fcarcity in 1783 put a ftop to all im- 
provement by green crops, and made the farmers think of 
nothing but railing grain ; and the more fo, as in thefe wet 
and late feafons, the beft cultivated lands often produced 
the worft crops, becaufe they continued to grow till the 

frofts 



there were about aoo of the inhabitants alive, upwards of 70 years 
of age, in the year 1780. Before that time confumptions were not near 
fo frequent as they have been fince. This may be juftly attributed, in a 
great meafure, to the effects of the fcarcity, and bad victual, in the year 
1783 ; to the long and inclement harvefts in n8i and 1 787 ; in both which 
feafons, the labourers were expofed to much cold and wet, during thrre 
months that each of thefe harvefts continued ; but principally to the 
change that has of late years taken place, in the manner of living among 
the lower ranks. Formerly every houfeholder could command a draught 
of fmall-beer, and killed a fheep now and then out of his own little 
flock ; but now the cafe is very different ; few of the poorer fort of houfe- 
houlders can keep any fheep. for the reafons already affigned, or even 
afford a little beer, or a bit of meat, upon the Chriftmas holidays. A- 
mong the poor, the want of nourifhing diet, nay, the frequent want even 
of the very neceflaries of life, which their induftry is often not fufficient 
to procure for them, to which may be added, their wretched damp un- 
comfortable houfes, to which tkey enter through the dunghill, the putrid 
effluvia of which they breath continually; and among the middling 
ranks, dejection of mind, confequent upon a change of circumftances 
from affluence and independence to ftrugling with debt and want, ap. 
pear to he the principal caufes of the prevailing diftempers, and mortality 
in this parifh. Young people are in general cut off by confumptions, 
R nd thofe more advanced in life by low nervous fevers and dropfies. 
There are 110 diforders that feem to belong peculiarly to the climate, un- 
lefs that old people are generally diftreffed with rheumatifms, Of late, 
neitherthe fmall-pox nor any inflammatory diforder has been very preva- 
lent or mortal. The complaints are principally nervous.

frofts came upon them before they were properly filled. 
The tenants in this parifh were in general at that period 
in very good circumftances, the greater part of them ha- 
ving from L. 50 to L. 150 or upwards out at intereft, be- 
fides the flocking of their farms ; but the whole rent of the 
parifh was more than doubled a few years before ; and in 
1783, not only between L. 3000 and L. 4000 Sterling, fup- 
pofed to be brought into the parifh, one year with another, 
for grain and lime, was wanting, but nearly as much was 
given out for viftual and feed. This, together with a fuc- 
ceffion of bad feafons and crops, and the advance of fer- 
vants wages, greatly reduced the tenants, and brought ma- 
ny of them in arrears, upon which they were fummoned 
out of their pofleffions. This broke their fpirit for indu- 
ftry and exertion, as they then laboured only for, and held 
their all at the discretion of the landholders, who from 
tim6 to time feized and confifcated their whole effefts for 
payment of their arrears, and left the poor families no re- 
fource, but to go to fervice, to begging, or to emigrate to 
the fouth country, or elfewhere, in queft of employment; 
and even fome of thofe tenants that were able to weather 
the ftorm, are only now receiving new leafes for 8 or 9 
years, including two or three of their former leafes not ex- 
pired. But in general new leafes are never granted till 
the former be entirely expired, which always expofes the 
farm to be overcropped, as nothing but its being quite 
worn out will give the pofTeffing tenant a chance to renew 
upon reafonable terms, and that only for 19 years at 
fartheft, without any encouragement to inclofe, or build 
good houfes ; and no refpedt is paid to the beft cultivator, 
nor even to the tenants in beft circumftances ; he that 
will promife moft rent is always preferred. Confidering 
thefe circumftances, and the heavy oppreffive multures and 
mill-fervices to which they are fubjetted, amounting to

between an eighth and ninth part of the whole crop, it is 
a wonder that the ftate of agriculture is even fo good as 
it is.— The furface of the pariih may be eltimated to con- 
tain about i6,oco acres ; little more than 4000 of which 
are under tillage; and onlj 2567 are in crop this year ; 
1873 in oats ; 538 in barley ; 76 in peafe ; 6c in turnip 
and potato about 20 in flax ; and between 80 and 90 in 
fown grafs. There are 167 ploughs yoked ; of which 42 
confift of 8 or 10 oxen each. There are only 3 or 4 two-horfe 
ploughs, that go without a driver, and 1 two-oxen ploughs. 
This is a great faving ; and it is aftonilhing, that 2 horfes, or 
2 oxen in a plough, are not more generally adopted, confider- 
ing the great fcarcity and high wages of fervants. The reft of 
the ploughs confift of 4 or more horfes each, or cattle and 
horfes yoked together, as thofe who have fmall poffeflions 
can afford. Almoft all the farmers, who yoke oxen 
ploughs, yoke one or more horfe ploughs. The plough 
almoft univerfally ufed is the plough with curved mould- 
board. *There are upwards of 400 carts of one kind or 
other \ of thefe only 1 2 are two-horfe draughts, and 6 are 
oxen wains. 

There are in this parifh 388 oxen, 521 cows, 944 young 
cattle, 452 horfes, and 2582 ftieep, moftly of the black 
faced kind, which, by a raoft unaccountable predilection for 
fize, (the only property of this breed,) has very generally 
banifhed from the North of Scotland, the fmall white faced 
native breed, which produced a very fine wool, and fine 
flavoured mutton. Some farmers are improving their 
breed, by crofting with Englifh rams. The black cattle 
are all of the Scotch breed, and generally of a fmall fize, 
being worked too young, which ftints their growth, and 
they are frequently fold off to the dealers before they arrive 
at their full fize. The average price of oxen may be ftated 
3 at 



of Grange. 567 

at L. 5, 5 s. Sterling ; of cows, about L. 4 Sterling ; of 
young cattle, about L. 2 Sterling each. The prices of hor- 
fes are from L. 3 to L. 30, but the average price of the 
ordinary fize of work, horfes may be about L. 8 Sterling r 
and the average prices of fheep about 6s. Sterling each. 
There are 40 farmers in the parifh, that pay from L. 1 5 to 
L. 50 rent* and one farmer pays L. 250 a-year. The pa- 
rifh produces much more grain than is neceffary to main- 
tain the inhabitants, unlefs in very bad feafons. The land 
yields very differently in different places, but, at an ave- 
rage, it may be estimated to yield about five returns, inclu- 
ding feed. The rent is as various as the foil ; being from 
2s. 6d. to L. i, 1 s. Sterling the acre; at an average, it 
lets at about 10 s. Sterling the acre grofs rent. The whole 
rent of the parifh, including mill- multures, may be about 
L. 2000 Sterling a-year *. There are none of the farms- 
in the parifh inclofed, except the farm of Knock, pofieffed 
by Lord Fife's faftor, which is inclofed with flones, with 
which that corner of the parifh is well fupplied ; and 
the Mains of Edingight, which is inclofed with flonc 
fence and ditch. Hedges and ditches are, indeed, the only 
practicable mode of inclofing the greater part of the parifh, 
as there are few or no (tones to be had, except limeftone 
quarried at a confiderable expenfe, and which can hardly 
be obtained of any fize fit for building. But hedges and 
ditches are much more proper for inclofing the greater part 
of this parifh than ftone fences ; as the ditches would tend 
to drain the wet foil, and hedges to fhelter a bleak and 

open 

* Peafe and oats are generally Town in March and April, and barky 
fometimes in tl.e end of April, and till the end of May, and beginning 
of June. Turnips aie fown from the middle of June to the middle of 
July. Hay i3 cut in the month of July. Harveft generally begins about 
tl e middle of September, though in early feafons it ufed ibmetimes to be

in 1782 and £787, it was not all got in till the end of December.

Mannfa&amp;urcs. — The only manufactures in the parifh are 
iime, and linen yarn. There are inexhauftible quarries of 
the very fineft limeftone in almoft every part of the parilh, 
and nature had amply provided the means of manuta Mi- 
ring it, in the extenfive moffes, with which a great part of 
the parifh was formerly covered, and which are not by 
any means exhaufted by the confumption of many centu- 
ries ; though they are become more diftant and inaccetfible 
than they were, and will now wear out much fafter, as the 
furface of them is generally dug up for turf, which puts an 
end to their growing. The quantity of lime burnt in this 
parifh, about 40 years ago, was eftimated at 60,000 bolls, 
of 64 Scotch pints to the boll, which was fold, at an ave- 
rage, at 6 d. the boll. The quantity at prefent manufactu- 
red, may be eftimated, at between 20,000 and 30,000 bolls, 
which fells, after being carried from 6 to 10 computed 
miles, at an average, at 8 d. the boll. The heritors lay re- 
ftraints upon the making of lime, both becaufe it exhaufts 
the moffes, and draws on 0 the attention of the people from 
their farms. Indeed they feldom lay any of it on their 
own poffeffiorts, from an ill founded prejudice, that it would 
not be ufeful, but hurtful, to ground that ftands on lime- 
ftone, though frequent experiments, made by different 
farmers in the parifh, prove that it is capable, when judi- 
cioufly managed, of producing remarkable crops. The 
fpinning of linen yarn, and making of coarfe linen from 
Scotch flax, was long practifed, (as already obferved,) be- 
fore the manufacturers began to import Dutch flax, and gave 
it out to fpin, which they have done for many years. Since 
that time, there is but a fmall proportion of the Scotch 
flax fpun for the market ; as the quality of the flax is not 
fo foft and fine as the Dutch flax, owing perhaps both to 
the nature of the foil, and to the management of the flax. 
There is, however, a good deal of it made into coarfe li- 
VoL - Ix - 4 C nens, 



57o 



Statiflical Account 



nens, both for home confumption, and likewife for fale, and 
fome of it is fold in yarn ; but the manufafturers complain, 
that the fpinners draw it beyond the grift, that they may 
have the more out of their flax, which hurts the fale of' 
the yam at the market. But the fpinning of yarn from 
Dutch flax is the principal employment of the women, 
and is computed to bring in about L. 1500 Sterling annual-

On the road from Aberdeen, Huntly and Rothemay r 
through Grange, there are 4 good bridges over the 4 
fh earns that interfecl: the parifh ; two of thefe bridges were 
built lail year, out of the vacant ltipends of the neighbour- 
ing parifh of Rothemay, and are of great importance to 
the whole country, as they are upon, a well frequented 
road, and acrofs two very rapid and dangerous ftreams. 
There is alfo a bridge over Ifla, near the church, which 
" was built in 1699, by Alexander Chriftie, tenant in 
" Cantley, for the glory of God, and the good of the 
" people of Grange," as the infcription bore, being built 
to render the church acceflible to the people of CantLy, 
which is the farm upon the fouth fide 01 Ilia. 100 merks 

Scots 



of Grange, 



571 



Scots were lodged in the hands of Edingight, by the faid 
Alexander Chriftie, to be laid out by the direftion of the 
kirk-feflion, for repairing and upholding faid bridge ; which 
appears from the records to have been all expended before 
the year 1740. As the bridge was too narrow to allow 
carts to pafs, being intended originally for foot-pa.ffengers 
only, and as it was then the only bridge upon Ma below 
Keith, Sir William Forbes, the patron of the pariih, gave 
a year and half's vacant ftipend for repairing and enlarging 
it, which was done in the year 1783, in a very fuperficial 
manner, fo that the new part of it threatens foon to go to 
ruin : And indeed the bridge is not even fo publicly ufeful 
as could be wilhed, as it is not on any of the public roads. 
The old bridge, which was fit for anfwering every necef- 
fary purpofe in the place where it was, could have been 
.repaired at a very fmall expenfe, fo as to have ftood for 
many years, by a parilli contribution : it is to be regretted, 
therefore, that the vacant ftipend was not made part of a 
fund for the purpofe of building a new bridge over Ma, in 
that part of the pariih where the roads from Banff, Cullen, 
Portfoy, Keith, &amp;.c. all meet, and crofs Ma at the fame 
place. The roads are in wretched repair, the ftatute-labour 
being employed upon them principally in autumn, when 
the day is Ihort, and the earth foaked with the autumnal 
rains. The difficult parTes are rendered ftill worfe, by ha- 
ving the loofe wet clay thrown into them \ for proper ma- 
terials are never fought for, nor brought from a diftance 
when they are not at hand, but the mire from the ditches 
is thrown into the middle of the road, fo that a piece of 
new made or mended road is generally impaflable. Add to 
this, that the ftatute-labour (which is a moft unequal and 
oppreflive tax upon the poor, in the way in which it is at 
prefent levied) is performed with the greateft reluftance. 
A poor labourer, who has neither horfe nor cart, and per*-

haps little or no crop, and whofe labour cannot maintain a

roads fix days in the year, while a farmer who pays L. 40 
or L. 50 rent, works 4 carts, and needs only one fervant 
and himfelf, except boys for herding, is liable only for 
twice as much as the poor labourer ; and fervants are en- 
tirely exempted from this heavy tax, though they are much 
better able to bear it than many houfeholders *. 

Church, Stipend, School, Poor.— This parifli, in times of 
Popery, belonged to the parifh of Keith, and was ere&amp;ed 
into a feparate pariQi in the year • 1618, (Prefbytery re- 
cords). The prefent church was originally a chapel of 
eafe, built by the abbot, and dedicated to the Virgin Ma- 
ry ; it is now in a ruinous condition, and never was fit 
to contain the congregation. The manfe, which was built 
about 40 years ago, was repaired in 1778 and in 1787, 
and is ftill a bad houfe. The offices are tolerably good, 

but 

* The ftatnte labour ought therefore to be convetted into money 
by aft of Parliament, and exacted in different proportions, according 
to the circumltances of the perfons ; for initance, a poor houfeholder, 
that has little or no crop, ought not to he affeffed above 1 s. a year ; a fer- 
vant that has no family ought to be aflefled is. 6 d. ; tenants ought to 
pay acc 1 ding to their rent, or the number and kind of carts they em- 
ploy ; and heritors (who are at prefent entirely exempted, and whofe rent 
riles in prop .rtion to the eafy communication by good roads) ought to 
be tax«d in proportion to neii rent: It fuch a fcheme was adopted, and 
the roads contracted for, they would loon be made, fo as to fave 50 per 
[ cent, of the expenfe of tranfportinp commodities, and alfo of the teai and 
wear of carriages and han.els : And after the roads were once effefluallji 
made or -epairen, the tax Ci uld be reduced cottfiderably, and yet the 
roads be ept in excellent repair. The a£l ought alfo to contain a claufe, 
ippoi tins « committee, f equal number-, of the mo ft rcfpeclabie tenants 
gs well as landh-'der, in e;.eh dift.iift, to carry the aft into execution, 
that there might be no improper exemption.

ftipend is iooo merles Scots in money, and 254. bolls of 
meal, at 8 {tone, including L. 4, 4 s. for communion ele- 
ments ; and a glebe of 5 acres, of tolerably good foil. 
Sir William Forbes of Cragievar, Bart, is patron. The 
fchoolmafter's falary is 12 bolls of meal, collected in lip- 
pies and pecks, from every houfeholder in the parifh that 
poffefTes any land, in proportion to what they poffefs ; 10 
merks Scots of a mortification ; L. 2 Sterling as precentor 
and feffion clerk ; 2 s. for every proclamation of banns ; 
and 4 d. for the regiltration of every baptifm ; about 30 
fcholars, at an average, attend the fchool ; from whom he 
receives 1 s. 3 d. the quarter for reading Englilh ; 1 s. 6 d. 
for reading and writing; and 2 s. for arithmetic and La- 
tin; which altogether may amount to about L. 18 Ster- 
ling yearly. The number of fcholars might be many 
more ; but the fchool-houfe is fmall, and at a corner of the 
parifh ; the fcboolmafters are frequently changed, owing 
to the poor encouragement ; and the people are, from ha- 
bit, backward in fending their children to fchool ; they 
allege, that by the time their children begin to make any 
progrefs with a fchoolmafter, he is about to remo-e to a 
better place or bufinefs. The fchool is not acceffible in 
winter to above one third of the parifh ; the mmifteY, 
therefore, with concurrence of the heritors, made applica! 
tion to the Society for propagating Ghriftian Knowledge 
in the year 1782, and got a fchoolmafter appointed to the 
moftdiltant parts of the parim, upon Condition th t the 
heritors would pay L. 4 yearly of his falary and ,,V e 
h.m a houfe, garden, fuel, and a cow', grals gratis ; which 
they would not agree to do, and the fchoolmafter was re 
moved ; the conference of which mull be, that the Knntf

worth the while of a man of liberal education, that moft 
ufeful inftitution will foon be abandoned altogether, (as 
it would have been already, in many places, were it not 
a kind of interim employment to poor young lads, while 
at college, and during the time they are ftudving divini- 
ty,) and then the country people will return to ignorance 
and barbarifm : but the prefent fafhionable paradox is, that 
. ignorance is the mother of induflry ; which is equally welj 
founded with the ancient aphorifm, that ignorance is the 
mother of devotion. As ignorance is the nurfe of fupeilli- 
tion, fo is it peculiarly favourable to a fiate of flavery ; 
and the favage ftate, which is a itate of ignorance, is a Kate 
of indolence, not of indujlry. — The poor are fupported by 
the weekly colleclions, fines from delinquents, hire of two 
mortcloths, and hand-bell at funerals, rent of the church 
yard, rent of the feats of a gallery in the church, with the 
intereft of L. 240, previous to the year 1783. In the year 
1782, the crop in this parifh was fo wretched, that if it 
had been all made into meal, it would not have maintain- 
ed the inhabitants for two months ; and the victual was fo 
bad, that its effects, together with the fcarcity, proyed fa- 
tal to the conftitutions and lives of many, (as already ob- 
ferved) ; however, the inhabitants were fupported, one 
way or other, with what they had remaining of the formei 
crop, and what they could purchafe at L. 1, 4 s. Sterling 
the boll, of 9 ftone, (lJ7i lb. Averdupoife,) from the 
neighbouring countries of Enzie and Moray, (where the 
crop was much lefs affeaed by the bad feafon,) till they 
were relieved, by the importation of white peafe, and o- 
ther grain, in April and May. The feffion imported 200 
quarters of white peafe, with their funds, together with 
L. 100 Sterling, lent to the feffion, free of intereft for nine 
months, to purchafe grain for the benefit of the poor, by a 
manufaaurer in the parifh, who, by uncommon induftry,

attention and integrity, had, without any original flock, in 
a few years, acquired fome hundred pounds, and who, be- 
fides the above generous and benevolent exertion in be- 
half of the poor, imported great quantities of all kinds of 
grain, flour, bifcuit, &amp;c which he fold out at little or no 
profit. Lord Fife alfo bought excellent barley at the Lon- 
don market, and oats for feed ; but as they were fold out 
for ready money, many of the poor tenants, who were un- 
, der the necefiity of employing all their ready money for 
purchafing victual for their families, were obliged to fow 
their own feed, which did not grow ; and even the oats, 
they bought from the coaft fide for feed, at L. i, is. and 
upwards the boll, though it looked beautiful, and was well 
filled, did not grow, but rotted in the ground ; and indeed, 
in this country, the worft filled corn, and the corn that 
was laft cut in harveft 1782, was the only corn that did 
vegetate tolerably next year. This ruined the next crop, 
which, had the feed been good, would have been a plenti- 
ful one, as the fummer and harveft 1783 were the beft 
that have been fince ; this made the fcarcity and dearth 
continue in this country, till crop 1784 relieved it. 
The feffion made the peafe they bought into meal, and 
fold it out at or below prime coft to poor families, and 
great numbers were fupplied gratis, befides thofe upon the 
roll, whofe numbers were alfo greatly increafecl ; fo that 
when the heritors and feffion met upon the ift of July 
1783, to report to the Barons of Exchequer the ftate of 
the parifh, in order to enable them to judge what propor- 
tion of the visual bought by them, with the L. io,ooq 
granted by Parliament for the relief of the poor, in the 
■northern counties of Scotland, they reported, " That the 
number upon the poors roll amounted to 200, and that 
L.jo Sterling is already expended in a partial relief to 
thofe in greatelt diftrefs ; that upwards of 1200 have been 

fupported.

fupported by imported grain from the end of February j 
and that more than 800 fouls will (land in need of affift- 
ance from the poors funds, (fuppofing they were fufficient 
for that purpofe), before they can be fupplied fro'm the 
crop upon the ground, which cannot be expe&amp;ed fooner 
than three months hence." Upon this report, the Barons 
of Exchequer, fent in all, 79 bolls of meal, at different 
times, to be diftributed gratis, and 102-^ bolls, to be fold 
at 8 s. 8 d. the boll. This was a great relief. Lord Fife al- 
fo fold out the meal in his girnel, and what multure farm 
came in, at 16 s. Sterling the boll and he deducted a fifth 
part of the tenants money- rent for 1783, upon condition, 
that thev paid up the remainder, together with the arrears 
of the former rent, and the price of their deficient farm or 
vi&amp;ual rent, by the ift of February 1784 ; but many of 
them were rendered unable to take the benefit of his Lord- 
flup's liberality *.

Befides the above mentioned fources of relief to the poor, there is a 
great deal given in private charity, not to travelling beggars only, but 
the people in general are uncommonly humane and benevolent; and 
when any poor perfon or family is afflicted with ficknefs, or any other 
unexpected calamity, the neighbours d" n,.r wait to be folici'e I but 
carry meal, or whatever elle the fituation requires, or their circumftanees 
can afford, and they watch with the Tick. &amp;c. Many of the poor alfo 
have bags in the mills, into which every one puts as he can fpare, or as 
charity difpofes him. And on the Chiiftmas holidays, the: young men go 
out in parties through the parifh a-begging for th gieateit obj els; -Mid 
feveral bolls of meal, and Come pounds Sterling of money, are coUected 
every year, and committed to the care of tne members of feflion for behoof 
ef thofe for whom it is collected. This practice has an excellent eft £t 
upon the morals, both of young and old ; it difpofes the old to acts of 
liberality, and draws forth thei fvmpathy towards 'he difheffed, and it 
train* up. the young to a-ts of benevcleice and charity This practice is 
alfo a great fupport to the funds, which a e beginning again to iec ver, 
from their dilapidation in 1783 and 1784 The heritors alfo, being 
convinced by experience of the importance of having a fund in referve 
againft a time of fcarcity, ref lved to take the poors money and pa\ 5 
per cent, yearly for it; (» hereas before 1783 it was lent out at 4 per cent. 
a-year, payable only once in tw.i year«.) By this means, together with ome

where there is generally a market for grain, vidlual, &amp;c. 
when it is pknty ; and in the neighbourhood of the fertile 
countries of Boyn, Enzie and Moray, from whence, and 
by importation, a fupply can be obtained in wet and late 
feafons, when the crop fails in Stryla ; and that it pofleffes 
the means of improvement by lime, fo near, and in fuch 
plenty. But the difadvantages are many ; a cold, wet, 
and late foil and climate, and confequently uncertain crops; 
fhort leafes ; no encouragement to tenants to improve 
their land, to inclofe or build good houfes ; heavy and op- 
preffive mill multures, which take between an eighth and 
a ninth of all that the tenant carries to the mill, and even 
of what he buys, in times of fcarcity, if it be manufactured 
within the fucken. The tenant alfo is obiiged to pay iod. 
for every boll of oats carrit d to the more, and fold fome- 
times as low as 7 s. and never above 12 s. the boll, and e- 
yery farm pays a certain number of bolls of barley, for 
what barley is fold, and for keeping in the mill water ; 
notwithstanding which, the tenants are compelled to per- 
fonal fervice, for keeping in the mill-water, and to per- 
form other mill fervices, fuch as bringing home millftones, 
and upholding the mill, if required fo to do ; and to carry 
the mill farm-meal to Macduff, 17 miles diftant, which 
they are generally called to do in the fpring feafon. This 
fervitude amounts almoft to a prohibition to improve, as 
it is at leaft a tax of 12 per cent, upon the produce of im- 
provements ; beiides, the tenants are liable to be called to 
give an account upon oath, before the baron-bailie, what 
they have bought or fold for three years back ; and if a 
man's memory, who cannot keep accounts, has failed him, 
and he confcientioufly refufes to take an oath, he is char- 
ged arbitrarily. Such a mode of proceeding is furely con- 
trary to the effential principles of juftice, and very hurtful 
to morals, as frequent oaths, (efpecially where the intereft

of the perfon taking the oath may be materially affedted 
thereby), muft often be *. Bad roads is another difad- 
vantage, and the unequal and oppreffive tax of ftatute-la- 
bour, totally inadequate to the making or upholding fuch 
an extent of road ; beftdes ' that it is often mifem ployed, at 
the will of the commiffioners or directors of the diftrict, on 
private roads, while public ones are neglected. — The tax 
upon coals alfo is a great grievance. A great and precious 
part of the year, both to the farmer and limer, muft be 
employed in providing and driving fuel •, whereas, were it 
not for the heavy tax upon coal, the farmer would gain 
two months of the fummer, which could be employed in 
cultivating turnip, managing hay, working fallow, or pre- 
paring manure ; and, at the fame time, be better ferved 
with fuel, by bringing coal from the more, when he car- 
ried his grain thither ; and the limers would find it their 
intereft alfo, to burn their lime partly with coal, rather 
than with peat alone; becaufe, inftead of driving it fome 
miles farther to get a penny more for the boll, that they 
may make as much as poffible of their fuel, they could 
burn more, and fell cheaper; and when they went to the 
fhore for coal, they could always carry a draught of lime 
with them. Some years ago, a very wet feafon compel- 
led fome of them to try coal, and they found a mixture of 
peat and coal anfwer fo well, that they continue to ule a 
little coal now and then. — The people alfo complain much 
of the unequal and oppreffive nature of the excife and di- 
ftillery laws. The laft partakes fo much of the nature of 
a monopoly, that the diftillers, unlefs in a time of fcarcity, 
when the grain is wanted for meal, combine and keep the 

price

price of barley low ; and consequently the fpirits, which- 
are generally of a bad quality, are fold at a low price, 
which has a tendency to deftroy both the conflitutions and 
the morals of the people, for punch and dram-drinking are 
now too generally fubftituted in the public houfes in place 
of beer, which was a much more wholefome beverage ; 
and the heavy excife on malt, which is alfo rigoroufly en- 
forced by the diftillers for obvious reafons, tends to pro- 
duce the fame effect, and alfo to prevent poor people from 
having malt or beer in their own houfes, the want of 
which proves very hurtful to the health and conflitutions 
of the labouring poor ; and when a poor man has a boll of 
barley to difpofe of, he can hardly fell it at all, or only at 
a very low price, generally what the diftiller pleafes to 
give ; whereas, before the eftablifhment of diftilleries, and 
the additional excife on malt, a poor man made his boll of 
bear into malt, and paid the duty for it, and then diftilled 
from it an excellent fpirit, which he fold at a high price 
to the rich, and thus obtained a good price for his grain, 
and the grains and offals helped to maintain, and often to 
preferve the lives of his cattle when provender was fcarce; 
now the -whole advantages that were before enjoyed by 
the poor, are, by the diftillery law, thrown into the hands 
of the rich diftillers, (for none can be diftillers upon the 
prefent plan but the comparatively rich), while malt and 
beer are in a manner entirely prohibited *. 

* The impolicy as well as opprefilon of the diftillery law will appeac 
from this circumftance, that a diftiller takes out a licence for a 40 gallon 
Hill, for which he pays a duty to Government of L. 40 a-year, and an 
officer employed to attend that ftill receives a falary of L. 50 a-year. 
The heavy excife on malt alfo, which in effedl^mounts to a total prohi- 
bition, neceflarily promotes fmuggiin?, which is always injurious to mo- 
rals, as well as hurtful to the revenue ; and it is univerfally thought, that 
Government does by no means draw fo much from the northern counties.

it Scotland of excife-duties, as even to pajj the falaries of the officers 
employed to levy it, notwithftanding the oppreflions that the people 
fuffer on account of it. It feems to be the general opinion, that if the 
excife and diftillery laws were repealed in the north of Scotland, and the 
revenue raifed by them yearly, including officers falaries, were tranfmitted 
to the commiffioners of fupply of the counties, to proportion it among 
themfelves and tenants, they could pay in the fame with the land-tax, 
and by this means, the revenue would be improved by the whole amount 
of the officers falaries at leaft, and the country would think themlelves 
infinitely better, as they would then be permitted to do with their grain 
what they pleafed without moleftation. 

NOTE. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.— There are no objects of natural hiftory 
peculiar to this parifli. Limeftone is the only mineral worth mentioning. 
The only wild beafts are the fox, the weafel or polecat, and the hare. The 
birds are few and common ; moorfowl, partridge, plover, wild duck, 
bittern, rook, jackdaw, magpie, lark, fparrow, yellow-hammer, robin, 
wren, watercock, linnet, and a few others. The panlh is occalionally 
vifited in winter by fnow-birds, and in fpring by flocks of fea-gulls. and 
now and then by hawks, kites, ravens, and herons. The migratory birds, 
are the lapwing, cuckoo, corn, rail, and fwallow. There are no noted 
mineral fprings in this parifh, though fome of them are conliderably im- 
pregnated with iron ; but there are two confecrated wells, one at the 
foot of a fmall natural mount adjoining to the caftle of Grange, which, 
with the mount, had been dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and are now 
called the Ladyhill and the Ladywell. The other fpring is on the fouth 
bank of Ma, directly oppolite to the church-door, and is called the Croik- 
well, probably from Croix, crofs. The greater part of the people are ra- 
ther above the ordinary fize, and it feems have always been fo. There are 
at lead as many men in the parilh above 5 feet 8 inches as there are bel- 
low it ; and feveral are 6 feet high : Accordingly fuch of them as go into 
the army, generally enlift either into the Guards or Train of Artillery. 
The anceftors of the greater part of the prefent inhabitants have lived 
in this parifh for fome centuries back, and many of them- are dependents 
of the ancient feuars in the parifli. The moil ancient names are. lnnes, 
Adamfon, Richardfon, Riddoch, Longmoor, Carr, Kelman, Scot, Sim, 
Ballach, Beg, Craib, Gray, Howie, Allan, Wilfon, Taylor, Reaper, 
Dyker f Neil, &amp;c. 8cc. There are no perfons of remarkable eminence, 
that have been born, lived, or died in this parifli. It has indeed been

long famous for producing a great number of clergymen, and there are 
five miniften of the Kftablilhment, and one of the Church of England, 
now alive, that were born in this parilh. Befides, there are many natives 
of it in the Eaft and Weft Indies, in America, in London, and through 
many parts of Great Britain, that are all doing well in different lines of 
life. The people are in general regular in their attendance upon the 
ordinances of religion, and they are. upon the whole, fenfible, fagacious, 
focial, humane, obliging, fober. induftrious, and well behaved ; no in- 
ftance iiaving occurred of any native being executed or baniflied within 
the lait 50 years ; two inftances of fuicide, indeed, have happend within 
that period, the one of a man about 2J years ago, the other of a womas, 
jabout 50 years ago.

<p>Name, Situation, Extent, i$c. 

'T^HE name of Crieff may be derived from the Gaelic 
word Craobh, a " tree the letters bh having the 
found of y* or v ; or more probably from Crubha Cnoc, the 
" haunch of the hill the town being built on a rifing 
ground, which may be confidered as the haunch of the hill 
immediately beyond it, that Hands detached from the 
Grampians, and is called the Cnoc or hill, by way of emi- 
nence. Crieff is 18 miles W. from Perth, and 20 N. from 
Stirling, near the foot of the Grampian mountains on the 
S. E. fide ; has a fine fouthern expofure, a moll delightful 
var elated profpedl of hills, woods, vallies and rivers, to

the fercne air, and the dry healthy fituation, have induced 
people of tafte and fcience, who frequently refide there 
during the fummer months, to account it the Montpelier 
of Scotland. Crieff is in bulk the fecond town in Perth- 
shire. The parifti in its utmoft extent may be divided in- 
to the highland and lowland parts, which are detached 
from each other by the intervention of the parifh of Mon- 
zie. The moft confiderable diflricr. of the former is the 
long Strath of Glenalmond, the property of the Duke of 
Athole, through which the Almond runs a courfe of 8 
miles. That and the other parts of the highland divifion 
afford advantages for game, trouting, and other fummer 
amufements. equal to any in the Highlands ; may yield 
L. oo yearly rent to the three proprietors, and contain a- 
bout ;oo inhabitants : But being annexed quoad facra to 
]V)onzie, will be more properly defcribed along with that 
pari h, una lhall therefore be no farther noticed in any of 
the following obfervations The lowland part of Crieff 
panih, which falls immediately under the infpection of the 
miiwfter, is 4 miles long from N. W. to S. E. and 3 
broad from S. W. to \\ E. ; being bounded on the N. E. 
by the parifli of Foulis ; on the N. W. by the Shaggy, 
which i'eparates. it from the highland part annexed to Mon- 
zie ; on the W. by the Torot, which divides it from Moni- 
vaird ; on the E. by the Pow, which I'eparates it from 
M-derty ; and on the S. it is warned for 3 miles by the 
Earn, which is the border between it and Muthil, except- 
ing one farm of near 100 acres, which it cut off to the S. 
fide, by leaving its ufual bed about the end of laft cen- 
tury. Thefe rivers abound in trout, the Earn alfo in fal- 
m0 n, which the principal heritor has the privilege of catch- 
ing with cruives. This, however, does not hitherto ex- 
clude others from the pleafure and profit of angling. The 
rivers are all furnilhed with ftone bridges, generally built 



of Crieff.

by die voluntary contributions of the country. That of 
Crieff was the fecond ftone bridge ever thrown over the 
Earn, confifts of 4 large arches, and was built out of the 
vacant ftipend of the parilb, in the interval between the 
iuppreflion of Epifcopacy in 1690, and the re admiffion of 
a Prelbyterian minuter in 1699. 

Soil ami Productions. — Near one half of the parifh, that 
is, along the W. and S. fides, is of a light, fandy, fometimes 
gravelly foil ; around the town, from the nature and quan- 
tity of the manure, it becomes a pretty rich loam. The 
other half, to the eaftward, is tilly, or a kind of ftiff red 
clay, frequently wet, and lying upon rock of the fame co- 
lour, which yields a hard durable ftone for building, but 
incapable of hewing ; whereas under the fandy foil, to the 
weltward, is an excellent freeftone of a light brown colour, 
that eafily cuts in the quarry, and admits of a good polilh. 
Each fort apparently partakes of the nature of the foil un- 
der which it is found. — The fpecies of grain raifed, are' the 
beft white oats of the late kind, bear, commonly called 
Chefter, with fometimes a mixture of barley, plenty of 
potatoes, a few peaie, but no wheat. Some late experi- 
ments have not encouraged the general ufe of that grain. 
One boll of bear gives i{- bolls of meal, and il bolls of oats 
1 boll of meal, befides paying kiln and mill dues. There 
are 2 very fmall orchards of an old date, and 2 others of 
fome acres extent, planted within thefe few years •, one of 
them, near the town, in a good foil and warm S. expofure, 
muit foon be very productive. 

Agriculture. — Until the year 1774, the old mode of 
farming by croft and outfield univerfally prevailed. As the 
outbids got no manure except watering, wherever that 
was wanting,, they produced only a fpeciea of grey oats,

of which zi bolls made only , boll of meal. Then, how^ 
ever, iome extenfive ftrata of marl were difcovered in the 
neighbourhood, the ufe of which quicUy introduced a 
more profitable mode of agriculture ; and fields of 4, 8, or 
12 acres, began to be fown out in good condition, with clo- 
ver and rye-grafc ; 210 ftones of that hay may be raifed on 
an acre, if the ground be in good order, and fold before 
flacking at 4 d. the ftone. The change in 20 years, ap-

About two thirds of the pariih are inclofed, and trees ge- 
nerany planted in hedge-rows along the irtclofures. There 
are only two fmall hills in it. All the heathy and una- 
rable part of the Cnoc or largeft, amounting to 222 aeres, 
is planted with firs interfperfed with larix, &amp;c. The 
fmalleft, 500 yards diftant, is all arable ; the top of it, how- 
ever, is alfo planted. Thefe, and the other plantations in 
the parilh, executed fince 1770, may extend to 270 acres. 
There is little old timber, except about a few gentlemens 
feats ; and only two coppices of oak and birch, which do 
not together exceed 10 acres. Before 1770, there were 
a few fmall plantations of old firs, which have fince been 
almoit wholly cut down.

Corporations. — The number in each trade is not precifely 
afcertained by the preceding table, as it marks only the 
number of thofe that, in each clafs, are heads of families. 
The moft material difference, however, is in the clafs of the 
weavers, who generally train their children to their own 
employment. They are therefore by far the greatefl: body 
of tradefmen. In 1770, they formed themfelves into a cor- 
poration, and began to eftablifh a fund for the fupport of 
their widows, and for the maintenance and education of 
their orphan children, each operative member paying \i s. 

1 at 



59° Statiftical Account 



at entry, and is. annually to the fund. In 1786, the} 
expended L. 2co in building a hall, which yields L. 1 1 
yearly rent, befides accommodating them at all their pu- 
blic meetings. The members now amount to 171 •, of 
whom 121 are of this parifh. They make an annual pro- 
ceflion through the principal ftreets of the town, on the 
King's birth-day, with a band of mufic and magnificent 
enfigns difplayed, in token of their attachment to his Ma- 
jelty's perfon and Government. The tailors too have got 
a hall and a common good, on the fame principles as the 
weavers. And the mafons have long had a lodge and a 
wealthy fund, though the operative brethren are moftly of 
other parifhes, and their funds chiefly enlarged by honora- 
ry members ; among whom are inrolled many perfons of 
the firft rank in the county. 

Caufes of increajing Population. — The rapid increafe of 
population here is owing to feveral concurring circumstan- 
ces. The people having had hitherto very little trade, 
ignorant of the means by which any money they acquired 
could be improved to advantage, think themfelves happy 
to fecure it in a houfe and garden of their own property. 
The fuperiors of the town have wifely encouraged this 
fpirit, and could not difpofe of their land more profitably 
than in fmall feus to thofe willing to build upon ihem. 
Accordingly, in 1768, a ftreet 16 yards broad and 4 0C Jc, ng, 
was formed by felting off feus 12 yards in front, and 40 
in depth, paying no price, but a yearly feu-duty of 4 s. 
each*. At that rate, the whole ground, ftreet included, 
ftill brings the original proprietor L. 2 the acre. Since 
1785, when the forfeited eltates were reftored, two other 
ftreets are forming, by granting feus of L. 40c fquare ells 
each, paying L. 4 price and 2 s. 6 d. yearly feu-duty, which, 

being 

* N. B. The old feus were an much lower terms. 



of Crief. 



591 



being along the fide of public roads, and nothing loft by 
ftreets, is equal to L. 4, 12 s. the acre annually to the iupe- 
rior. The houfes are almoft nniverfally two ftories high, 
roofed with blue flate, and confift of four rooms, &amp;c. 
which generally accommodate two, fometimes three, or 
even four families \ and, with the garden adjoining, bring 
the feuar L. 5 of rent, if fully inhabited *. Moft of thefe 
houfes, indeed, would lie wafte, were it not that the town 
Handing very near to, and ou one of the principal roads 
leading from the Highlands, it is the firft at which the High- 
landers naturally arrive, when, by the formation of ex- 
tenfive fheep-farms, without introducing manufactures at 
the fame time, they are compelled to leave their native 
land, in queft of food, habitation, and employment. Here 
they find Ihelter and fuftenance at a cheaper rate than in 
moft parts of Scotland; while the improving ftate of the 
country, road making, which is here done by c ommutation 
of the ftatute-labour, quarrying, marl-digging, ditching, 
planting, &amp;c. afford moft of them employment and grow- 
ing wages. Some of the males indeed go farther fouth for 
labour, or engage as domeftic fervants in neighbouring 
parifties, leaving the females behind ; which is one reafon 
of the excefs of females obfervable in the preceding ftate- 
ment. But what encourages them more than any thing 
elfe to fettle here with their families, is the wife plan adopt- 
ed by the proprietors of land near the town, equally pro- 
fitable to themfelves and ufeful to the lower claffes, of di- 
viding it into fmall portions of 2c ells fquare, at 4 s. each 
of yearly rent, being equal to L. 2, 17 s. the acre, befides 
the profit of a nurfery ; for the lots are diftinguifhed by 
young trees planted in the corners of them, which the pro- 
prietors 

* The yearly rent of the whole feuais in the parifli, arifing to them 
from their feus, amounted, in 1785, to T.. 734 : 14 : 9. 



59 2 Stdlijlical Account 

prietors tranfplant at pleafure. Thus, every trad ef mar... 
and labourer, and even females, have each their own lots 
which they cultivate at leifure hours, for raifing lint, po- 
tatoes, and other neceffaries. By this means, thofe of fe- 
dentary occupations preferve their health, and the poor, 
their lives in time of fcarcity : as in 1783, when many 
of the pooreft fort lived from the end of July, almott en- 
tirely on potatoes of their own * rearing, while oat-meal 
fold at 1 s. 3 d. the peck. So far as the population is increafed 
by the growth of the original inhabitants, it may be at- 
tributed to this circumilance. The tradefmen here, very 
few individuals excepted, are all on a level; no one chooles 
to ferve another, after he underftands bufinefs bimfelf. 
When the young weaver has finimed his apprentice/hip, 
and acquired as much free Hock, as will purchafe a loom, 
furnifh a room, and defray the expenfe of a wedding, he 
fcorns to be a journeyman ; but fets up for himfelf, mar- 
ries a wife, and becomes the father of a family. 

Manufattures. — Thefe have hitherto had little eifeft on 
the population, in comparifon of what they will probably 
foon have. Befides 3 corn-mills, 3 fulling mills, 1 for 
malt, l for barley, a lint-mill, and lately a threfliing mill, 
there was built in 178a a paper-mill, that manufactures 
yearly near 1700 ftones of rags, at 18 d. the ftone, into 
the coarfer kinds of paper. And at the fame date, an oil- 
mill, that preffes yearly between 300 and 400 bolls of 
lintfeed of this country's growth, purchafed at J 8 s. the 

bolL 

* The potatoes of crop 1-782, fuftx-redas much as the grain did by the 
feafon ; and farmers who could afford to live on other victuals, general- 
ly referved theirs for fale in feed time, in hope of a high price. Tku» 
the market was overftocked, and in April and May, potatoes fold at 4 i. 
the peck; and the poor, who had exhauft.d their own fcanty ltore, got 
»oth feed and a new ftock of provihons at a very moderate price.

boll. In 1763, a merchant of Crieff erected a paper-mill, 
being the firft of the kind, except one, on the north fide of 
the Forth ; an oil-mill in 1775 ; and in 1785, formed an 
extenfive bleachfield with fuitable machinery. And fo 
late as 1792, fome other manufacturers of this town erect- 
ed 2 mills for carding and fpinning cotton, and a third oil- 
mill. Thefe, indeed, for the convenience of ground and 
water, were built on the oppofite fides of the rivers Earn 
and Torot, in the parifhes of Muthil and Monivaird ; yet 
are here mentioned, as they belong to inhabitants of this 
parifh, a confiderable number of whofe children as well as 
adults they daily employ. A tambouring manufacture 
commenced here in 1792, which prefently employs 30 
girls from 8 to 12 years of age. Thofe above 10 are en- 
gaged four years, and thofe under to five : and receive of 
wages, L. 3, 10 s. for the firft ; L. 4, to s. the fecond ; L, 5, 
10 s. the third ; L. 6, 10 s. the fourth ; and L. 8 for the fifth 
year. There are here two diftilleries ; one confumes 500, 
the other 250 bolls of bear annually. And one brewery, 
begun in 1791, which in 1792 made 9600 gallons of beer 
at 14 d. and 22 d. the gallon from 400 bolls of bear at 15 s. 
the boll. There was a tannery built in 1782, and a 
fecond in 1789. They are both now in the hands of one 
company, and are fuppofed in 1792 to have tanned 3100 
hides of different fizes, which, when fully manufactured, 
may bring above L. 3000. Of thefe hides 981 were bought 
raw in Crieff for L. 375, the cow-hides at 6 s. 9 d. the calf 
at 7 s. and 2 d. the ftone. Till within thefe few years, the 
weavers chiefly worked in linen, worried fluffs, druggets, 
and coarfe woollen cloths for the country ufe. Befides 
thefe, they are now much employed in working a thin 
kind of coarfe linen called Silefias, vulgarly Scrims, 
whereof each piece is 27 or 30 inches broad, and 92

influence of an enfeebling potion, the very poorer! clafles begin to regard 
it as one of the neceflaries of life, and for its fake refign the cheaper and 
more invigorating nourifliment which the productions of their country 
afford. The change in the mode of living, in this and fome other re- 
fpects, has perhaps produced a change in the nature of difeafes. The 
acute fever, that 30 years ago often attacked the carelefs and robult, 
and came to a crifis in ro days, is now rarely feen ; but to it have 
fucceeded hyfterics, difeafes flowing from debility and relaxation, and 
the flow nervous fever, under which the patient languifhes for three or 
fix months, and probably never again recovers his wonted vigour. Here, 
however, the people in general are perhaps as healthy as in any part of 
Britain.

for all kinds of butchers meat, poultry, butter, cheefe, &amp;c. 
Of the firft article, there is ten times more fold now than 
20 years ago ; each kind too was then to be got only in 
its moft plentiful feafon, pork in winter, veal in fpring, 
lamb early in fummer, mutton from the middle of fummer 
to Chriftmas, beef from Lammas to Candlemas, when it 
almofl totally difappeared for fix months. Now that ar-

near the middle of this century, Crieff had continue! for 
ages to be the great mart to which the dealers in England 
annually reforted, to purchafe, for the EngKfli markets, the 
droves of black cattle reared in the Highlands of Scotland. 
And old people here fometimes fpeak with deep regret of 
the glorious fcene difplayed to view, when 30,000 black 
cattle, in different droves, overfpread the whole adjacent 
country for feverai miles around the town. A man of 84 
now lives in Crieff, whofe grandfather, for a long feries of 
years, uplifted cuftom on that number of cattle, and there- 
by made a handfome profit to himfelf, while he paid L. 50 
yearly to the landlord. But the principal fale and meet- 
ing has fmce that time been removed to Falkirk, and not

part of what met at Falkirk in the fecond week of that

Highlands, always pafs at lead before 12 at noon of the day 
preceding our market, to avoid the cuftomary duties, 
which they would otherwife be obliged to pay that is, 1 s.

changing of the market-place for highland cattle arofe from 
the following caufes. For a confiderable time after the 
beginning of this century, the drovers from Argyle, In- 
vernefs, Rofs ih ires, &amp;c. paid nothing for the pafturing 
of their cattle all the way to the market ; but in the im- 
proving ftate of the country, grafs became more valuable, 
the roads more confined, and the drovers were forced to in-

quire after the raoft convenient and cheap roads from their 
feveral homes, to the principal market-place, now at Fal- 
kirk, where the roads leading by the fhorteft courfe from 
every quarter of the Highlands towards England, naturally 
unite ; and where the whole of the Argyle and near half 
of the Invernefs-fhire cattle can arrive fome days journey 
earlier than if they came by CrieiF. The additional travel 
was no lofs, while the pafture coft them nothing; but 
would now confiderably affecl: their profits. By the remo- 
val, alfo, of the noble family that had a particular intareft 
in this market, extortions iii the cuftoms, and reftraints on 
the cattle in parting occurred, which juftice and patriotifm 
would have induced them to prevent, had they been ren- 
ding in the country. But efpecially the inclofing of certain 
lands adjacent to the town, about the year 1750, by remo- 
ving fome of the drovers from their ufual ftatious, excited 
fuch difguft and murmurs as foon terminated in the ruin of 
the market." Belides the 30,000 cattle above mentioned, it 
is calculated, ( that 20,000 met at Falkirk on what is called 
the Auguft Tryft in 1792, and above 10,000 more were fold 
at Down in Monteith the firrt. week of November that year ; 
an at leaft a thir i part of both quantities paffed through 
this town to thefe markets. So that the numbers that go 
fouth are certainly not diminilhing, notwithftanding the 
increafing confumption every where. Some years, indeed,

Antiquities. — There is fcarcely any monument of antiqui- 
ty in the paiilh. Even the large detached ft ones arranged 
circularly on various eminences, and accounted temples of 
the Drnids, are generally removed for the fake of agricul- 
ture. The old parochial church was an antique Gothic 
building, 95 feet long within ; but being only 18 feet 
wide, and 14 in the quire, was not near half ^he fize of the 
prefent church. At the demolition of it in 1787, were 
found among the rubbifli, about 40 pieces of bright gold 
coin of Robert I. of Scotland, having that King's head 
encircled with the words Robertas rex Scotorwn, and St 
Andrew with his crofs on the reverfe. Each piece was 
equal in breadth to a guinea of the prefent reign, and pre- 
cifely one fourth of it in weight. They were all much 
worn, and had been depofited in a niche of the wall fix 
feet above the ground-floor, probably in fome time of pu- 
blic danger. On a plain, half a mile fouth from the town, 
is a circle of 12 yards diameter, (lately furrounded with a 
low wall of earth and ftone, and now left open in the 
planation,) on which the Steward of the King's eftate of 
Strathern formerly held his court, after that earldom fell to 
the Crown by the forfeiture of the Countefs Joanna, who, 
having married the Englifti Earl of Warren, was found 
guilty of treafonable practices againfl Robert I. and the 
office of Steward in time became hereditary in the family 
of Drummond, till the abolition of heritable jurifdiclions 
in 1748. For the accommodation of that court, and other 
public bufinefs, was built in 1665 the prefent tolbooth,

liquors, clothes, groceries, and all forts of merchandife, than on any other 
throughout the year. 3

which has a decent fpire, containing the town clock, and Jt 
good bell, gifted in 1725, as its Latin inscription bears, by 
Lord John Drummond, uncle of James the third Duke of 
Perth. To that family the fuperiority of the greateft part 
of the town belongs, and the property of fome of the bed 
buildings, particularly a large and elegant affembly room, 
built in 1790, and frequently honoured with the prefence 
of the chief nobility and gentry of Perthfhire. Adjoining 
to that is the principal inn, where ftrangers of any rank 
may lodge comfortably, and where two chaifes kept for 
hire are well employed ; although in 1770, and again in 
1780, an attempt to keep one had mifcarried. 

Religion, Poor, ifc. — John Drummond was minifter of 
Crieff, from 1699 to 1755. In his time none feparated 
from the church, who had been previoufly of the eftablifli- 
ment ; but a number (till adhered to the Epifcopal mode of 
worlhip, whofe forefathers in the preceding century, had, 
in Conformity to the wifhes of the court, embraced JEpif- 
copacy. During the incumbency of Thomas Stewart, his 
immediate fucceffor, about the year 1763, the Seceders of 
the clafs of Antiburghers formed there a congregation. 
Next in fucceffion was the prefent minifter, admitted in 
1770. In his time arofe the feci: called Bereans, whofe 
founder had been a private tutor in the parifh, and formed 
fome of his relations and connexions there into a party *. 
Thefe, with the Epifcopals and Papifts, have no clergyman

Bible to be the only, certain rule of faith and manners. At the fame 
time, they hold, that none can be faved, except fuch as have a- full af- 
furance of their own falvation, and that every one pofiefling this affu- 
rance is perfectly fafe. That aflurance, however, they do not pretend to 
build on the conformity of their actions to- the rules of Chriftianity.

in the parifh. The feet of Relief alfo was introduced 
there about the year 1785, through a ferment excited by 
the fettlement of a minifter on a reluctant congregation in 
the neighbourhood. They and the Seceders have each a 
clergyman of their own in the parifh. What idea mould 
be formed of the fectaries, conlidered either in a religious 
or political light, would perhaps be a fruitlefs inquiry -, 
but as they do not maintain their own poor, they tend 
evidently to the diminution of the ordinary funds for 
maintaining the poor of the parifh, for whom no afleflment 
is made, and who are fupplied merely from the collections 
at the church-door. Thefe are more than doubled within 
the laft 20 years, owing chiefly to the enlargement of the 
church, and confequently greater number of contributors ; 
and partly to the increafing wages, or even luxury and 
vanity of the lower claries. — Collections for the poor were 
in 1772, L. 25:1: 3; in 1792, L. 54 : 6 : 1. About the 
year 1780, female fervants and others of that rank began 
firft to wear ribbons. Confcious of attracting fuperior 
notice, fuperior charity was alfo difplayed ; and the refult 
muft have proved very confiderable, had it continued to 
keep pace with the vaft improvement in the drefs of both 
fexes, during the fhort intervening period. For inftead of 
the grave and folid productions of the country, the gay 
cloths, filks, muftins, and printed cottons of England, adorn 
on Sundays almoft every individual. The collections, 
which would be much greater if all the heritors refided 
and attended the church, might tolerably fupport the poor 
that are natives of the parifh, but are far from being fuffici- 
ent to prevent begging, and to maintain the great number 
of poor that arife through the influx of indigent families 
from the Highlands, whofe fmall flock joined to their la- 
bour fupports them for three years without begging, after

which they often fall upon the parifli funds. Including 
fuch as are fupplied weekly, 69 perfons, all of different 
families, appear on the lift as occafionally fupplied in 1792 j 
and to thele might be added 26 more, who, as well as they, 
havr- been relieved from other fources of charity. For 
befides the collections, fome of the heritors have at times 
been very liberal in their donations of meal and money, 
or wood for fuel ; efpecially in the winter of that year, 
when peats had been loft by the wet fummer, and coals 
greatly advanced in price, above 400 carts of wood were 
given gratis by two heritors, and money advanced by 
others to purchafe coals. There is nothing, indeed, that 
the people in general feel more than the difficulty of pro- 
curing fuel *. 

Language. — The people fpeak the Englifli language in 
the beft Scotch dialect : although the Gaelic be commonly 
fpoken at the defiance of three miles north, or four weft 
from Crieff, yet no adult natives of the lowland part of 
the parifli can either fpeak or underftand' it. They have 
not even contracted the peculiar tone of that languape, by 
their intercourfe with the numerous Highland families now

their general poverty, their frequent ignorance in the 
grand fubjefts of revelation, their incapacity of deriving 
benefit from the public religious fervice performed in the 
Enfflifh language, the happy effects to themfelves and to 
fociety that might refult from a proper regard paid to their

humane attention and friendly aid of the Society for pro- 
pagating Chriftian knowledge. A fmall annuity allotted

Name, Situation, Extent, Surface, and Climate. 

INVERNESS was anciently written Innernefs. The town 
of Invernefs, from which the parifh has its name, is fi- 
tuated at the mouth of the river Nefs. Inner is Gaelic, 
and expreffive of that fituation. The river derives its 
name from Lochnefs, which is its fource. Some promon- 
tories and headlands in our own and in other northern coun- 
tries, are called Nefs, as Buchannefs, the Naes of Norway, 
Nefs quaji nofe, from its prominency. But no promontory 
is in Lochnefs *. The parifli of Invernefs is 10 computed 

miles

IS various j it is partly flat, partly hilly, rocky and moun-

with lome exceptions, a black loam, rather light, and on a 
gravelly bottom. The air is dry and healthy, confequently 
we are not afflicled with any peculiar difeafe. F.vers 
fometimes make their appearance, particularly in the fpring 
and autumn ; but upon inquiry, we feldom fail of difcover 
ing the caufe in the inattention and foolhardinefs of the 
patient. Epidemical fevers rarely vifit us. Fevers, it is 
believed, are not fo fatal with us as formerly ; this is attri- 
buted to the cool regimen and antifeptics, which are the 
general practice. The fmall-pox which, before the intro- 
duction of inoculation, proved fo fad a bar to the increafe 
of the people, will foon in this parifli, it is hoped, be no

an Irifh hero, had fettled a colony of . his countrymen in Strath-harick. 
The aera of this event is pafled over in filence. Veftiges, however, of 
his caftle and fortrefs are ftill to be feen, on the fummit of Dun Dear- 
dill, a rock of high elevation, at a fliort diftance from the lake. The 
rock had its name from Dornadilla, the Lady of Nyfus. This hero built 
a barge, and was the firft who failed the lake. Hence Lochnefe. We 
relifli not the derivation from Nyfus, and will hazard a conjecture of 
our own. The two rivers which have their courfe through the country 
of Strath-harick, and difcharge themfelves in Lochnefis, are Carrigack and 
Fechloln. Thefe rivers are remarkable for high cataracts, particularly 
Fechloin. In this river and ne ir the mouth of it. is the Fall of Foyres, 
a tremendous cataract. This cataract attracts the notice of all travellers,, 
and when a flood is in the river, ftrikes. the beholder with aftonifliment. 
Efs, in the Gaelic language lignifies a " waterfall or cataract." The 
lake which is fupplied with the water of this fall, might not unaptly be- 
called Locnnefs, that is the lake of the cataract. The names of places, 
lakes and rivers, are not unfrequently taken from the molt important and 
(hiking objects in their vicinity; here the object is awfully ftriking.

Who fefides at the diftance of two miles from the town, 
and who fuffered in his family by the natural fmall-pox, is 
become, with the lower clafs of people, an inoculator. The 
firft he inoculated was a child of his own, and an only child. 
He forcibly inculcates a fedulous attention to light bed- 
clothes, frefh air, cleanlinefs, and fimple diet. He is a fuc- 
cefsful inoculator, and has the generofity to pradife gratis. 
We have not heard of any remarkable inftance of longe- 
vity in this parifh. Perfons of 80, and fome years beyond 
that period, are not uncommon ; a few we have known who 
furvived 92 and 93 years, but not one who lived up to a 
full IOC. 

Lake and River. — Lochnefs is partly in this parilh. It is 
24 miles long, and at a medium 2 broad. Soon after the 
Revolution, it was founded by one George Scot, with 500 
fathoms, and afterward by a Captain Orton, with a whole 
barrel of plumb-line, but without fuccefs ; ne bottom could 
be found *. Sir John Piingle, however, who in the year 
1746 was with the army at Fort Auguftus, fays +, that the 
common foundings are from 116 to 120 fathoms, and that 
in one place they ran to 135. On the fuppolition that the 
foundings of either period were general over the whole 
lake, and not particular, confined to different parts of it, we 
cannot help confidering the foundings of the latter period to 
be the more probable account. But when the great extent 
of the lake is attended to, it feems not unlikely that the 
former and latter foundings were in different parts of the 
lake. It is very probable that the latter foundings were in 
the fouth end of it, near which the army then lay in en- 
campment. The foundings by George Scot and Captain

Orton, were communicated to the Royal Society, by the 
Rev. Mr James Frafer, then minifter of Kirkhill, 'near In- 
vernefs, who was a diftind and accurate perfon, as well as 
learned and ingenious : This gentleman relates to the So- 
ciety, at the fame time with the above, fome curious obfer- 
vations he made on a fmall lake near Lochnefs, in thefe 
words: " To the weftward of the caftle of Urquhart, 
above 4 miles, Hands the great mountain, Meal fourvounj, 
of a round, neat, high fhape, and may be 2 miles perpen- 
dicular height from the lake. Upon the very top of this 
hill, there is a lake of cold frelb. water, about 3 c fathom3 
in length and 6 broad, no courfe or ftream running to it nr 
from it. I plumbed with 100 fathoms of fmall line, but 
could find no bottom. It is always equally full, and never 
freezes." Lochnefs and the river lie between the 57th and 
58th degrees N. L. They were never known to freeze 
by the extremeft cold experienced in fo northern a climate. 
They not only do not freeze, but diffolve froft in bodies 
that are put into them. We have frequently obferved 
wafherwomen dip linens, when ftiffened by froft, in the ri- 
ver to thaw them. The river in frofty weather fmokes^ 
and a thick fog hangs over it, which fometimes fpreads to 
a confiderable diftance, and greatly mitigates the coldnefs 
of the air on either fide. This is common to the lake *. 

The 

* Sir Geo'ge Mackenzie, who was King's Advocate in the reign of 
Charles H. in a communication to the Royal Society, relates as follows. 
" Dr George Mackenzie who lives at Invernefs told me, that he obferves 
rofeniary though uncovered to continue in the gardens about Lochnefs 
fide, notwithstanding the laft winter's long and violent frofts ; whereas, 
a far lefs violent winter ordinarily kills all the rofemary which is'in 
gardens, that lie in warmer places, and at the fea fide. And though I 
live near it, and in a better foil and warmer fituatioo, yet any winter 
more than ordinarily cold kills my rofemary, though covered over with 
ftraw and litter This he attributes, (and I think upon good ground), 
to the warmth occafioned by thofe ftieams that frequently arife from that 
lakef."

The water, notwithstanding, when taken out of the lake 
or river, freezes as foon as any other ; and when the de- 
gree of cold is extreme, even the agitation of the water in 
carrying it to diftant parts of the town, does not hin- 
der its freezing by the way. The water is foft, has no mi- 
neral tafte, and eafily bears foap, and yet is believed to be 
impregnated with fome mineral fubftance, for it proves lax- 
ative to perfons who are not in the ufe of drinking it This 
effect it has on horfes. Travellers or their fervants are there- 
fore invariably directed by innkeepers to another ftream to 
water, their horfes. The water, however, has no more ef- 
fecl: on animals in the ufe of drinking it than any other 
water. We have not heard that it was attempted to in- 
veftigate and afcertain, by chymical analyfis, the compo- 
nent parts of the Nefs water *. The lake is navigated by

* The not freezing of Lochnefs has been afcribed by fome to many 
fountains fuppofed to be in the lake, and by othtrs to hot fprings ; but 
by Sir John Pringle (on the Dileales of the Army) to the ;jreat depth 
of the lake, Count Maifilli cbferving that the fea, from 6 to 120 fathoms, 
is of the fame degree of heat from December to the beginning of April. 
Now, fays Sir John, it is reafonable to believe, that the great depths in. 
frefti water, will be little more affected than thole of the fea with the 
heat and coldnefs of the air, and therefore that the furface of Lochnefs 
may be kept from freezing, by the vaft body of water underneath, of a 
degree of heat confiderably greater than the freezing point; Another cir- 
cumfrance he fays concurs; tl.ere is never any perfect calm upon the lake, 
and the wind blowing always from one end to the other, makes fuch an 
undulation as mult much cbftruct the freezing of the water. He fays 
further, this account feems to be co- firmed by an oblervation commonly 
made in the neighbourhood, which is, that when the water is taken out 
of the lake and kept from motion, it then freezes as loon as any ther 
water. We know not whether the Count 'as a'ceitained the degree of 
heat in great depths of the lea with precifion It is uot probable, how-

Auguftus with ftores. The ftores are conveyed by land- 
carriage to the lake ; for the river is not navigable beyond 
the harbour. The river is 6 miles long, dividing the parifh 
and town unequally : it runs flowly, with placid majefty, 
never overflowing its banks, in a channel whofe fall is 
fcarcely 10 feet. In the river, at a ihort diftance fouth 
from the town, is a delightful idand. Several years ago,

fymptoms of decay. The magiftrates ordered them to be

aft the coldnefs of the air and cbfrruct the freezing of the furface, when 
the thermometer is lb low ^ 23 degrees under the freezing point, which 
it fometimes is in the parifh or 1 Invernels, if not lower. Sir John feemed 
to have been apprehe^five of this, in adveiting to the conftant undulation 
of the lake That Luchnefs, from i'.slituation, is never perfectly calm, we 
believe to be nearly true. But we may be certain that the l'mall iake, on 
the very top of Meal fourvouny, from its fituatiou likcwife, and having 
no ftream running to it or from it, is at limes perfectly calm, and yet it 
is as liitle liable to have ice as Lochnefs. The Nefs water, indeed, when 
taken out of rhe lake or liver freezes as foon as any other ; but this is not 
owing to its being kept in a ftate of reft ; for its conftant fluctuation in 
water veflels, from the river to diftant parts of the town, does not in hard 
froft, obfiruct its congealing by the way. The water, when taken out 
of the lake or river, whether kept at reft or in motion, freeze* as foon as 
any other. It fecms not then Ukely, that the not freezing of Lochnefs is 
comprehended rn the principle of the Count Marfilli. Whatever it is 
which hinders the freezing of the lake, will readily be allowed ro he that 
which hinders the freezing of the river, and which diflblves froft in bodies 
that are put into it, even at the diftance of 6 miles from the lake, and to 
be that, which likewife occafions the fmoking of the lake and river in 
frofty weather, and fo remarkably mitigates the coldnefs of the air on 
their banks. If fo, the heat owing merely to the depth of the great body 
of water underneath, and laid to be confiderahly greater than the freezing 
point, will not go far, if indeed any way, in accounting for the not free* 
zing of Lochnefs.

Fifr. — In the river Nefs are falmon, bull trouts, and 
flounders. The falmon-fifhing begins on the 30th of No- 
vember, and ends the 18th of September. The Berwick 
Fifliing Company have fifhed this river near 40 years. 
They pay L. 230 a-year to the proprietors of the lower 
divifion of the river, and about L. 100 to the proprietors of 
the upper divifion, beyond the cruives and bulwarks, as a 
compenfation for the Saturday flop, or breach in the bul- 
warks, from the fetting of the fun on Saturday, till its ri- 
fing on Monday ; to which the heritors of this divifion, to 
let the fifli pafs upward, are entitled by ftatute. The quan- 
tity of falmon caught in the river is believed to amount, 
one year with another, to 300 or 350 barrels. In the be- 
ginning of the feafon, the falmon is packed in kits for the 
London market, and fetches a high price. The leale of 
the Berwick Filhing Company is nearly expired ; it is faid 
a renewal of it will not be obtained for lefs than double 
the prefent rent. There is but little of the falmon fold 
here, and that little, by favour to particular perfons, at 3 d. 
the lb. The bull trouts are not packed, but fold here, 
and at 3 d. the lb. ; fome of them are very large, weigh- 
ing from ic to 12 lb. They generally, however, weigh 
only from 3 to 4 lb. The flounders are not good ; their 
flelh, like that of all frelh water flounders, is foft, and of 
indifferent flavour. The fea coaft is 3 miles long, and flat 
and fandy. The fifli caught on this coaft, are herrings, and 
garvocks, or fprats. The herrings are fmall, but very de- 
licious, if drefled the day they are caught. They are only 
occafional vifitants on this coaft. In fome years, there is 
not the leaft appearance of them ; in others, lefs or more 
fcanty •, but a great and plentiful mow may be faid to be 
rather uncommon. Two or three adventurers on the boun-

that it cannot be fuppofed a preparation to any degree, be- 
yond a trifling amount, will be made for it. The fprats 
are not feen lb often as even the herrings. It is upwards 
of 20 years fince we had them in great abundance, or it 
may be faid at all, on this coaft. The herrings and fprats 
are beft in the months of September, O&amp;ober and No- 
vember. 

Hills and Mountains. — The moft remarkable hill in this 
parifti is Tom-na-heurich, near the town, on the weft fide 
of the river. It is a beautiful infulated mount, nearly re- 
fembling a fhip, with her keel uppermoft. This hill, in the 
year 1753, was inclofed and planted, chiefly with Scotch 
firs. The hill is compofed of fand and gravel, and before 
it was planted, yielded only a Qiort thin heath, and was of 
no advantage to the proprietor. This hill ftands on a bafe, 
whofe length is 1984 feet, and breadth 176. The eleva- 
tion of the hill, from the channel of the river, is 250. The 
moft ftriking mountains in this parifh, form that range on 
the weft fide of the river, which is a continuation of the 
great chain, running from Lochlomond to the frith of Tain, 
known to antiquaries by the name of Drumalbin, and 
which divided the Scottifh from the Pidtifh kingdom. In 
this range, on the fummit of a rock, called Craig-Phatrick, 
are the remains of a vitrified fort, generally believed to be 
Pictilh, and if Pidlifti, probably the remains of the Royal 
Seat at Invernefs, of which Adamnan, Abbot of Jona, 
makes- mention in his Life of the celebrated Saint Colum- 
ba ; hither, as Adamnan relates, the Saint repaired from 
Jona, and converted Brudius, the Pi&amp;ifti monarch, to the 
Chriftian faith. The elevation of Craig-Phatrick from 
the river is 1150 feet.

Woods. — There are no natural woods in this parilh, if we 
except an inconfiderable oak-wood, which is periodically 
cut for the bark. But this defe£l is amply compenfated 
by the extenfive plantations with which the parifh abounds. 
In the extremity of the parifh eaftward, on the eftate of 
Culloden, there is a plantation of Scotch firs and foreft- 
trees of confiderable extent. This plantation was com- 
pleted above 70 years ago. It is of great advantage to the 
proprietor, and will undoubtedly be of ftill greater. The 
plantations on the eftate of Kinmylies, in the weftern ex- 
tremity of the parifh, were begun about 35 years ago, and 
completed in a few years. On this eftate every acre that 
was not capable of being improved to arable land was plant- 
ed. Others followed this example. One gentleman in 
particular, who kept an exacl: account of his operations, 
planted 15,000 foreft trees of the following kinds : elm, afh, 
beach, oak, and fycamore, and 4 millions of Scotch firs, 
which occupy a fpace of 8co acres of Duncan, one of the 
Drumalbin range of mountains. In fhort, on the face of 
this range to the -eafl, and as far as the property of the 
gentlemen in this pariih extends to the weft, with the ex- 
ception of what was fit for arable land, and the oak wood 
formerly mentioned, from Lochnefs northward to the 
Beauly frith, an extent of fix miles in length, is covered 
with thriving plantations. Eefide thefe, there are fevcral 
other plantations, and all in a thriving ftate. This bufinefs 
is ftill going on with little remifiion, fo that in a few years 
it is likely there will not be a fingle ufelefs acre in this 
parifh. 

Agriculture, l$c. — Wheat, barley, oats, and peafe, are 
fown in this parifh. The wheat from the middle of Oc- 
tober till the end of November, the barley from the middle 

of 



6i2 Statijlical Account 



of April till the latter end of May, and the oats and peafe 
from the beginning of March till the middle of April. 
Some rye is fown mixed with oats, but beans may be faid 
to be no crop at all in this parifh. Generally the corn is 
not gathered in before the middle of October, rarely in 
September, and in fome years not before the latter end of 
November. Potatoes are raifed in great abundance, and 
are of very great importance. They conftitute the prin- 
cipal p rt of the food of the lower clafs of the inhabitants 
for more than three quarters of the year. They are plant- 
ed from the middle of April till the middle of May, and in 
drills with the plough. About the middle of Auguft we 
begin to raife them for immediate fupply \ but the corn 
harveft bufinefs is completely ended before we raife them 
for iroring. It may be obferved here, that we know 
nothing in this parifh of the difeafe called curled tops, 
which proves fo prejudicial to this ufeful plant in fome 
other places. Field turnips, white and yellow, are fown 
from the middle of June till the fecond week of July, and 
in drills. There is no hemp fown, and but little flax, and 
that for private ufe only. It would be tedious to mention 
the variety that ftill obtains in the rotation of crops. The 
moft approved courfe, however, is gaining ground among 
us, and will, it is expefled, become prevalent. Much is 
done in the way of inclofing, but much remains to be 
done. The value land derives from being inclofed is uni- 
versally acknowledged. Afield at the diltance of about 
half a mile from the town was lately inclofed ; when open 
it jielded only L. 8. rent. It was inclofed at the expenfe 
of between L. 25 and 30, and was fold at the price of 
L. 550, and reckoned- by the purchafer a good bargain. 
Sea-ware, ftreet and ftable dung, and lime, are allufed for 
manure. The fea-ware is much ufed by thofe who live 

near 



of Invernefs.

near the more. The Englim plough drawn by two horfes, 
and withouc a driver, is now generally ufed. The lower 
clafs of farmers at fome diftance from the town, and in 
hilly and ftony ground, ufe with a driver the Scotch plough, 
drawn by four fmall horfes, or four or fix oxen, or horfes 
and oxen together. Lord Karnes's harro vs were tried here 
by fome, but are difcontinued. Drill ploughs and rollers 
of various kinds are ufed here. The draught horfes of 
the better fort of farmers are from 14 to 16 hands high, 
and were a few years ago bought for from 10 to 12 guineas 
each. The price is now much raifed, even to L. 16 and to 
L. 20. This has induced feveral in the parifh to keep 
breeding mares, in which they will undoubtedly find their 
advantage *. The land-rent of the whole parifh was in 

the 

* Price of Labour and Proviftons.—--k ploughman has from L. 5 to 
L. 7 a year, with 6 bolls, half oat and half bear meal, a houfe, kail-yard, 
land for potatoes ; his peats are carried home likewife, and fome have 
grafs for a cow ; but the laft is not common. Thefe fervants live com- 
fortably, their wives are employed in little manufactures for clothing therr 
own families and for fale, and fometimes in fpinning for the manufac- 
tures at Invernefs, and earn about 3 s, a-week. A woman farm fervant's 
fee is L. 1, i2 s. and maintenance in the houfe, and a herd's wages are 
much the fame. A mafon's wages a-day, from is. 6d. to 1 s. 8 d ; a 
wright's from I s. to I s. 4d. ; a tailor's 6d. with maintenance. Weavers 
and Ihoemakers work by the piece. Day-labourers at ditching, digging,

Women in weeding and hoeing potatoes, are paid at the rate of 5 d. the 
day. — There are two weekly markets at Invernefs : beef, mutton and 
pork, coft from 2.id to 4d. the pound. Veal and lamb at the beginning 
of the feafon may perhaps be reckoned dear, but afterward very reafon- 
able. The old cuftom of laying up in fait a family's whole (lock of 
beef for the year at Martinmas is long happily difcontinued, and a far 
better obtains. Stall-feeding in this parifh and the neighbourhood has

7 s. 11^ d. Sterling. The boll at that period was valued to 
the tenant at 9 merks Scots or 10 s. Sterling, with cuftoms 
and fervices, which were of little value to the proprietor, 
but often of diftreffing confequences to the tenant. The 
cuftoms and fervices are aboliflied. The land-rent is rifen 
far beyond double the above, and is ftill increafing, nor are 
the tenants by any means overburdened ; they are much 
better able to pay the prefent rents than they were to pay 
the former, when oppreiTed by ignorance and indolence, 
cuftom* and fervices. Many acres of wafte land too have 
been improved fince the year 1754, bearing luxuriant 
crops of corn, which add confiderably to the rental of the 
parifli. It cannot be faid with precifion what the number 
of acres in the parifli is, as all the eftates have not been 
meafured. The number however cannot be under 5000 
arable acres. At prefent lands let at from 13 s. to L. 2 an 
acre Garden ground near the town lets at from L. 4 to L. 5. 
Few eftates have been fold in this parifti for many years. 
Lands were lately bought for no lefs than 35 years pur- 
chafe, and lands too cultivated to the utmoft, almoft all 
garden-ground. There are about 50 heritors, 14 or 16 

may 

and the markets are well fupplied with beef of the beft quality the whole, 
year round. Kens and ducks are fold at 6 d. 8 d. or 9 d. each ; ch.ckens 
and ducklings, at 3d. ; a goofe 1 s. 4 &amp; or x s. 6 d. ; a turkey ,j. 6 d. or

at moderate nrices, rarely high, and feme years herrings are in fuch abun-

may be reckoned confiderable. There arc 4 of them non- 
refiding ; but on the eftates of the non-refiding heritors im- 
provements are going forward in various kinds, as well as 
on the eltates of thofe who conltantly refide. The land- 
rent of the panih is not nearly equal to the expenditure of 
the proprietors ; their other properties and refources are very 
confiderable. The hnall tenantry are gradually wearing 
away ; in a little time there will be none of them ; the rents 
of the more confiderable tenants are frono L. 40 to L.300. 
The farmer who pays the greateft rent in the parifxi has 
feveral fubtenants. Monopolizing of farms began here 
about 25 years ago. This evidently affe&amp;s the population, 
cf the country part of the paiifh ; but fortunately the de- 
ficiency is more than compenfated by the manufactures 
euablilhedin the town, which have increafed confiderably 
its population, and not a fingle individual is under the 
neceility of leaving his native home, to feek for employ- 
ment and bread at a diftance, in another country. — The 
horles in the parifh amount to about 600 ; the black cattle 
iooo; and there may be about 1000 Iheep, generally of the 
old lmall breed of the Highlands. One gentleman has a 
flock of about 100 of the black-faced Linton breed. They 
thrive well. There are in the parifli 13 meal mills, 3 
flour and* 2 barley mills. 

The Town. — Invernefs is a royal burgh of great anti- 
quity. Its firfl: charter was granted by K. Malcolm Can- 
more. It always Hood firm in its allegiance to the Crown, 
and maintained in ancient times with the neighbouring 
rebellious chieftains and their clans many defperate con- 
flicts *. The laft charter in favour of the burgh was grant- 
ed

cd by King James VI. From the date of this charter to the 
Revolution 1698, the inhabitants were an induftrious, en- 
terprifing and thriving people ; feveral opulent families 
now flourifliing in the country, derive their diftindion 
from the induftry of anceflors w ho were merchants and 
guild brethren of Invernefs. The principal fource of their 
wealth was a commerce in corn and Jkins. The corn 
and malting trade was brought to a confiderable height. 
The greater part of the town confifted of kilns and gra- 
naries. The export trade was carried on chiefly with 
France, the northern countries, and Holland. All the 
home confumption likewife in malt was fupplied by them, 
that is of Invernefs-fhire, Rofs-ftiire, Sutherland, Caithnefs, 
the Weftern Ifles, and the Orkneys ; for the art of malt ma- 
king in thefe days was underftood in this country chiefly by 
the corn-merchants of Invernefs. The fkin-trade, during thf; 

7 o 

period under con fideration, was fingly of itfelf a fource of 
great wealth. The people of all the extenfive countries 
and Ifles now mentioned reforted to Invernefs, as the only 
or the moft convenient market they then knew any thing 
of. In exchange for fkins, they were Supplied, fome with 
meal, others malt, and all of them with dye-fluffs, fait, 
coarfe linen and iron. From the Revolution to the year 
1746, the burgh of Invernefs fuffered a gradual decline ; 
So that at that time and feveral years after the town ap- 
peared little better than the ruins of what it formerly was. 
In the centre of the town there were many ruinous houfes, 
and in all the other parts of it, every fecond fpace, and that 
by far the larger, exhibited the ruin of a kiln, a granary or 
other building. The caufes of the failure of the corn trade,

after a duty was granted by Government upon exported 
corn in the year 1688, are fo complicated, that an attempt 
to unfold them on men an occafion as the prefent might be 
deemed unneceffarily tedious. Suffice it to fay refpecling 
the ikin-trade, that the remote Highlanders and iflanders 
by their agents found the way to Glafgow, which they 
have long considered as the more eligible market.- In the 
year 1746, the town began to revive, and from that period 
to the prefent, particularly in the laft thirty years, has been 
in a rapid progrefs of improvement. At this time it may 
be faid to be wholly new built ; its old limits are confider- 
ably extended, and yearly extending. The money circula- 
ted by the army after the fuppreflion of the rebellion in the 
year 1746, the great influx of money from the Ealt and 
Weft Indies, the eftabliftiment of manufactures, the conse- 
quent improvements in agriculture, the rife in the value of 
land, and the confumption of luxuries, are evidently the 
caufes of the increafmg profperity of this burgh *. The 
harbour is fafe and commodious, and kept in excellent 

repair. 

* The town-council of Invernefs corifift of 2i members. They have 
a clerk and a clerk-depute. The old council every year at the term of 
Michaelmas elect a new council. The new council eledl out of their 
number, a Prcvoft, 4 Bailies, a Dean of Guild and a Treafurer. The 
Provolt however is commonly continued in office for the fpace of 3 years. 
The Bailies, the Dean of Guild, and the Treafurer, for 2 years. There are 
6 corporations of craftfme.i, via. Hammermen, including fuiiths, tinfmiths, 
copperfmiths, filverfmiths, watchmakers, braziers, cutlers, faddlexs. 2d, 
Wrights, including houfe-earpenters, cabinet-makers, vvheel-wrights and 
coopers. 3d, Weavers. 4th, Tailors. 5th, Shoemakers; and 6th, Skinners. 
Thefe corporations eleft annually at Michaelmas, 6 deacons and 6 box- 
mafters or treafuiers, each corporation its own peculiar deacon and bo*- 
mafter. The 6 deacons elecl a deacon-convener, to piefiJe over and to 
attend to the intcrefts of all the corporations. They elecl at' the fame 
time a general boxmafter. The 6 corporations are rcprefented in the 
town cfluncil by their deacon convener, who by virtue of his office is a 
member, and by two deacons annually elected by the town-council. 
There are befides the above feveral other crafts which are not corporate, 
inc. mafons, cart-wrights, bakers, butchers, and barbers.

repair. Seven veffels belong to it, meafuring from 400 to 
500 tons, and manned by about 30 feamen, including ap- 
prentices. They are chiefly employed in carrying to Lon- 
don the produce of our manufa&amp;ures, the fifh of our river, 
and fldns of goat, deer, roe, fox, hares, rabbits, and otter,' 
with other articles. They bring in return materials both for 
ufe and for luxury. There are 9 boats manned by 6 men each. 

ManufaBures . — There are 2 tanneries and 1 tawing 
work in the town. The tanned leather is confumed at 
home •, but the tawed is fent to London. Thefe manufac- 
tures do not indeed employ many hands, but they are very 
beneficial to this country. There are 2 tallow-chandlers 
and 1 foap-boiler. Thefe two do much work with few 
hands. There is a brick work in the neighbourhood of the 
town. This work is only in its infancy. The duty on 
the thoufand is a dead weight on this work ; 1 s. on the 1000 
would raife a much greater revenue. A hemp manufac- 
ture was eftabliflied here above 30 years ago. This bufi- 
nefs at prefent employs, in fpinning, drefiing and weaving, 
above 1000 men, women and children. They earn from 
1 s. to 10 s. a- week. The hemp is imported from the Bal- 
tic, and is manufactured into all kinds of cloth for bags, 
facking and tarpallin, confumed in Britain, and in the E. 
andW. Indies. A white and coloured thread manufacture 
is now eftablilhed here about 10 years. This bufinefs em- 
ploys, in heckling, fpinning, twifting, bleaching and dyeing, 
near 10,000 pcrfons, including men, women and children. 
They earn from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. . a-week. The company 
have in this and the neighbouring counties nineteen agents to 
manage the fpinning departments. The flax is imported 
from the Baltic, and when manufactured fent to London, 
from whence it is difperfed over the world. There is on 
the Nefs an infant bleachfield. It has many advantages, and 
promifes to do well. 

A Academy

Academy and Schools.— The magiftrates and gentlemen 
of the town and county of Invernefs, and many of the gentle- 
men of the neighbouring counties, have long confidered aa 
eftabltfhment of a feminary of learning at Invernefs, on a 
liberal and extenflve plan, of very great importance to this 
part of the kingdom. At length, in the year 1787, a com- 
mittee was appointed to confider of the mod proper mea- 
fures for bringing their purpofe into effect. An extenfive 
correfpondence was immediately commenced, and fubfcrip- 
tions were opened in Scotland, England, France, America, 
in the E. and W. Indies. An inclofure of about 3 acres 
was purchafed, and an eleganc houfe is built in the front of 
it, confifting of a large hall, and ux fpacious apartments for 
claffes, library, and philofophical apparatus. The mbfcrip- 
tions at prefent amount to above L. 6277 : 5 : 3 Sterling, 
and the magiftrates, befides their private fubfcriptions, in- 
cluded in the above, give out of the public revenue oi the 
town yearly to the inftitution about L. 70 Sterling. The 
houfe is provided with a rector and 4 matters. • In the 
lit clafs is taught Englilh grammatically ; in the 2d, Latin 
and Greek ; in the 3d, writing, arithmetic and book- 
keeping.; in the 4th, Euclid's Elements, with their appli- 
cation, plane and fpherical trigonometry, meniuration of 
folids and furfaces in all its parts, geography with the 
ufe of the globes, navigation with lunar observations, 
architecture, naval, civil and military, practical gunnery/, 
fortification, perfpecYive and drawing ; in the 5th, being 
the rector's, are taught civil and natural hiltory, natural 
philofophy, chymiftry and alhonomy. The falaries of the 
matters are as follow : The redtor, L. 50 and a houfe ; the 
teacher of mathematics, L. 40 ; the teacher of writing, a- 
rithmetrc and book-keeping, L. 30 ; the teacher of Latin 
and Greek, L. 40 ; and the teacher of Englifh, L. 30. The 
fees for each feffion, are, to the matter of the ift clafs, or

fame fees to the mailer of the 3d ; the fees to the matter pf 
the 4th, 1 guinea ; and to the mailer of the jth, 1 J. guinea. 
Over and above thefe fees, there is a fmall fum paid by 
each ftudent to the reftor. The number of fludents a- 
mounts already to above 200; for this is only the id fef- 
iion. This inftitution promifes to be a very flourifhing fe- 
minary. It has every advantage to recommend it. The 
town is healthful and pleafantly fituated, and here are no im- 
proper avocations. Board too is very reafonable, and the 
matters are very well qualified for their feveral depart- 
ments, as well as diligent in their attendance. The 
year is divided into two feffions. The ift to begin 
from the 16th day of July, and to end on the 20th of 
December ; the 2d to begin on the 5th of January, and 
to end on the 10th of June^ The directors of the academy 
are, the provoft, the 4 bailies, the dean of guild, the fhe- 
riffof the county, and the moderator of the prefbytery of 
Invernefs, for the time being ; fubferibers to the amount 
' of L. 50 each, during their lives, and fubferibers to the a- 
mount of L. 10c for their own lives and their heirs ; with 
5 gentlemen of the county, annually ele&amp;ed at the Michael- 
mas head-court. At the dehre of the Highland Society of 
London, there is a clafs opened for teaching the Gaelic lan- 
guage, with a falary from them pf L. 15 a-year, to which 
the directors have added L. 16. There is befides a pro- 
fpecl: of an addition to the Gaelic teacher's falary from the 
Highland Society of Edinburgh. There is likewife a dan- 
cing fchool, and a mufic fchool well attended. They are 
under the patronage of the magiftrates. They are detach- 
ed from the academy. — There are befides, in the town and 
parifh of Invernefs, other 10 fchocls ; 4 of which are efta- 
bliftied by the Society of Scotland for propagating Chi i- 
ftian knowledge. In thefe 4, there are no lefs than 230 
fcholars. in the other 6, there are about 200.

Poor. — The number of poor at prefent on the roll a- 
rnounts to 222, of which there are 68 ftated penfioners, 
who are fupplied, fome of them weekly, and others quar- 
terly. The pennons are from 25 s. each to L. 4 Sterling 
a-year ; but the fupplies occafionally given to a diftrefled 
family, frequently exceed the higheft yearly allowance to 
a dated penfioner. The principal flock in the manage- 
ment of the kirk-feffion for the relief of the poor, in lands 
and bonds, is L. 2520 : 18 : 10. This flock is made up of 
legacies, chiefly in the laft century. Another fund is the 
weekly collections ; they amount, one year with another, 
to L. 70 Sterling. Befides thefe, there are two other funds 
in the truft of the kirk-feffion : The one a legacy of 
L. 166 : 13 : 4 Sterling, by the laird of Macintoih, the in- 
tereft of which is applied to the education of two boys at 
the fchools of Invernefs ; and the other by Mr George 
Duncan, late merchant here, in land, yielding L. 2co Scots

5 men from Campbelltown for breach of the peace ; 1 for 
deferting his Majefly's fervice'; 17 for civil debts. In all 
52. Several, however, of the above were committed in 
the years 1787, 1788 and 1789 *.— Houfes built in the EaJft 
14 years : In the town and parifli, upwards of 60 of from 
a to 3 ftories high, and about 70 thatched houfes in the 
country and fuburbs ; fome of the thatched houfes are 2 
(lories high. — The public buildings are, the academy, the 
court-houfe, jail and fpire, and the houfe built for the 
northern meeting. The court houfe is roomy and well 
lighted, and the accel's to it eafy. The jail is fuch as 
would give pleafure to the benevolent Howard. The fpire 
was built by the architect of St Andrew's fpire in Edin- 
burgh, and is laid to furpafs it in beauty ; the flender ap- 
pearance of St Andrew's fpire, arifing from a defect in 
the proportion, renders it lefs agreeable. The houfe for 
the northern meeting is a large fabric, in which there is

every accommodation to fit it for the purpofe for which 
it was ere&amp;ed. The two public rooms are each of them 
60 feet long, and 30 broad. One of the rooms is 20 feet 
high, and the other 18. There was expended on build- 
ings, for public and private ufe, in the town and parifh of 
Invernefs, during the laft 14 years, no lefs a fum, at a mo- 
derate eftimation, than L. 50,000. 

Kcclejiajiical State. — There are three minifters of the E- 
ftablifhed Church in Invernefs. The patrons of the li- 
vings are, the King and the Honourable Mr Frafer of Lo- 
vat. The King is patron of the firft and of the third li- 
ving, and Mr Frafer of the fecond. The ltipend of the 
firft and fecond minifters, by a decreet paffed in the year 
1754, is to each 84 bolls 1 firlot 2 pecks 2 lippies victual, 
half bear half oat-meal, and L. 541 : 8 :6 Scots money. 
Each of them has a glebe ; but neither of the glebes is 4 
acres. They have no manfes, though they are entitled to 
them by law *. The third minifter is paid out of the 
Bifhop's rents of Moray and Rofs. The ftipend is precife- 
ly L. 108, 10 s. Sterling. The church for the Englifh 
congregation was built in the year 1772, by the magi- 
ftrates, in confequence of a compromise with the heritors, 
who were to have a preference of feats at an equitable

* In the year 17S4, the prefbytery's decreet againft the magiftrates 
and heritors for repairing the two old manfes was fufpended at the in- 
ftance of the heritors. A long litigation followed. The fecond minuter 
being an old man, withdrew from the profecution. The firft continued 
to infill, and was found entitled to a reparation of his manfe. But it was 
alleged on the part of the heritors, that the firft minifter was actually in 
pofTeffion of the fecond minifter' s manfe, a manfe with which they had no 
concern, whatever the magiftrates might. The minifter was required to 
give in a proof of his poil'eflion of the firft minifter's manfe, in which it 
was judged by the Court he failed. At this ftage of the bufinefs, tired 
with a tedious and expenfive litigation, he abandoned the procefs.

yearly rent. The church is an elegant ftru&amp;ure. It is 
92 feet long, and 45 broad, with a convenient feffion- 
houfe adjoined. A new church is now building for the 
Gaelic congregation, and will be completed in the courfe 
of next fummer, at the joint and equal expenfe of the he- 
ritors on the one hand, and the Magiftrates and fix incor- 
porations on the other. There was likewife added a fum 
of L. 110 Sterling, being the intereft arifing from Mr 
George Duncan's mortification formerly mentioned. This 
church is 76 feet in length, and 38 in breadth. There is 
a fmall Antiburgher congregation here ; but they can af- 
ford very little for the fupport of their minifter, whether 
the Affociated Congregation add any thing to the living, 
we know not. There is a Scots Epifcopal congregation, 
but fmall. There is likewife a Methodift meeting houfe, 
which is attended chiefly by the manufacturers lately 
come hither from other places. 

Roads and Bridges. — There are 2 military roatls which 
pafs through this parifh ; and which are kept in good re- 
pair by Government. The other roads are equally well 
attended to. The ftatute-labour is partly commuted. There 
are 3 bridges, the principal of them is the bridge over the 
Nefs, a beautiful ftru£ture of feven arches. It was built 
in the year 1688. It is a toll-bridge, by act of Parlia- 
ment, and makes a good addition to the revenue of the 
town. 

Stills, Brewers, Retailers of Ale and Spiritous Liquors. — 
There are 4 ftills in the town and parifh ; 12 brewers of 
ale, 2 of whom are confiderable,' carrying on the bufinefs 
to a good amount. The retailers of ale and fpiritous li- 
quors are about 70. Of the lower clafs of people, there 
are fome who love whilky rather much ; but not fo much,

it is believed, as formerly, their inclination begins to 
change towards ale and beer, a good and wholefome be- 
verage. 

• Clubs. — There are two clubs in the town for fupporting 
the members which belong to them in ficknefs and old 
age, and defraying the funeral expenfes of themfelves and 
their wives. The firft is reftrifted to 161 members. E- 
very member pays 30 s. into the box at entrance, 1 s. on 
the firft Tuefday of every month throughout the year, 1 s, 
on the death of every member, and 6 d- on the death of 
every member's wife. They have in return, when fick 
and unable to work, 6 s. a-week during the firft 6 months 
of their illnefs, and 4 s. a-week afterward, during their 
life, while they are unable to work, &amp;x. The other club 
is formed on much the fame plan ; but pays only half the 
above fum at entrance, and the returns in proportion. 

Battles.— -There were in ancient times feveral unimpor- 
tant rencounters and Jkirmifhes in this parifh. The on- 
ly memorable battle was that of the 16th of April 1746. 
By a curious coincidence, the important and decifive bat- 
tle of Culloden was fought on the moor of the paternal 
eftate of that truly great and good man, whofe influence 
in the Highlands, and unwearied perfeverance during the 
two preceding years, made the fuppreffion of a very a- 
larming infurrec~lion comparatively eafy to Government. 
The fervices which, on this critical occafion, the Lord 
prefident Forbes rendered to his county, will be recorded 
by the faithful hiftorian of the tranfa&amp;ions of thofe times, 
with pleafure and the warmed gratitude. 

Mifcellaneous ObferDations. — The diftrefles of the lower 
clafs of the people, arifing from the failure of the crop 

178a, 



of Invernefs. 



627 



1782, were very great. No perfon, however, in this pa- 
rifh, was known to have died of want, though probably it 
might have been otherwife, had it not been for the liberal and 
feafonable fupplies given by Government, and by a very 
refpectable native of this pari£h, James Baillie, Efq; mer- 
chant, of London. Mr Baillie's munificence at this feafon 
of fore calamity, does i»im the higheft honour, and mull 
neceffarily be to him a perpetual fource of heart felt plea- 
fure. A public granary in Invernefs would be an im- 
provement of very great importance. The Geneva gra- 
nary, mentioned by the patriotic Lord Gardenfton, in his 
travelling memorandums, is an excellent model. The 
great difad vantage this town and parifh labours under, is 
from a fcarcity of fuel. The moffes in the neighbourhood 
are either exhaufted, or inclofed and planted. Peats are 
bought at a high price, and at the diftance of 5 miles from 
the moft populous part of the parifh. Much of the fum- 
mer is fpent in bringing them home. This is a manifeft 
detriment to their agriculture. If the coafting duty on 
coals were taken off, and a coal-yard kept in the town, to 
fupply thofe who are not able to lay up a ftore for the 
winter, agriculture would be greatly benefited, feveral 
manufactures eftablifhed, to which the prefent high price 
of coal is an infuperable obftacle, and the labouring poor 
of this town and parifh have much lefs caufe to complain 
of their condition. A navigable canal, from the weft fea 
at Fort William, to the eaft fea at Invernefs, would no 
doubt be greatly beneficial to the country at large, but 
more immediately to a very extenfive tract of the High- 
lands, which is now covered with fheep, and almoft de- 
populated. Woollen manufactures would foon be efta- 
blifhed, other manufactures follow of courfe, villages and 
the chearful haunts of men infenfibly arife, and population 
in a few years increafe amazingly, in a diftrict, which,

628 



Statijlical Account 



alas ! at prefent, is dreary to the traveller, filling him 
with melancholy and dejection of heart— But however 
beneficial this canal would ultimately prove to Britain, 
yet the trade on it can hardly be fuppofed to arrive for 
years to come at that degree of importance, which ought 
to induce private perfons to fubferibe for executing the 
work. Happily Government looks not in their projefts 
of improvement for immediate returns. The increafe of 
the number, and of the induftry and of the fkill of the 
people are their obje&amp;s. To favour thefe important ob- 
jects, every exertion mould be made. The confideration 
of a temporary expenfe, though much more confiderable 
than what can be required in the prefent cafe, where in- 
deed nature has left little to be done, will not, we truft, 
by fuch a government as we have the happinefs of living 
under, be put in the balance with great and permanent- 
national advantages. — Many in this town and parifh com- 
plain, and not without caufe, of multures and pigeon-hou- 
fes. The laws refpe&amp;ing multures and pigeon-houfes are 
not founded in equity. They are palpably oppreffive, and 
unworthy of even the ftern ariftocracy of thefe ignorant 
and barbarous times in which they were enacTed. — The 
Royal, Britifh Linen Company,. and Aberdeen Banks, have 
each of them an office at Invernefs. There are two o- 
pinions refpe&amp;ing the confequences of thefe offices in this 
country. But whether credit fhall prove an advantage or 
a difadvantage to a people, can be determined only by 
an appeal to their character. If they are compofed of 
fpendthrifts and profligates, nothing can be more evident 
than that credit will precipitate their ruin ; but if, on the 
contrary, of Ikilful, induftrious and prudent individuals, it 
is equally indifputable, that credit will greatly contribute 
to accelerate the profperity of fuch a people, and to dif- 
fufe happinefs- over the whole face of their country. — The 

inhabitants 



of Invernefs.. 629 

inhabitants of the town and parifli are decent, and regu- 
lar in their attendance on the public ordinances of religion. 
They are well afFecled to the government of their coun- 
try, good neighbours, and induftrious in their federal oc- 
cupations. Inftances of diffipation and profligacy are rare. 
Their modes and habits of living have undergone, during 
the laft 30 years, an alteration greatly to the better. E- 
ven the lower fanners and cottagers are by far more indu- 
ftrious than they were formerly, more cleanly in their per- 
fdns and houfes, and improved confiderably in their appa- 
rel. They make a pleafing appearance on Sundays. Such 
as are employed in manufactures, are not only well cloth- 
ed, and cleanly in their perfons and houfes, but live more 
plentifully, and are better and more comfortably lodged 
than the lower farmers and cottagers. The craftfmen in 
the town, are, on holidays, it may be faid, finely appa- 
relled, and their wives, as far as drefs is concerned, appear 
like gentlewomen. Their houfes are clean and neat, and 
their boards abundantly provided with animal as well as 
vegetable focd. Tea equipages, in their opinion, are now 
become neceiTary. Many of them for their ftation are 
wealthy. Several build houfes, which yield yearly rents 
of from L. 20 to L. 30, and others of them purchafe land 
to the extent of feveral acres, near the town, at high prices r 
but which, by inclofing and hedging, they turn to good 
account. The more opulent inhabitants, perhaps hardly 
furpafs their predeceffors of the laft century, in richnefs of 
drefs or lumptuoufnefs of entertainments. But in the e- 
legance of the table, in the difplay of the lide-board, in 
the coftlinefs of furniture, in the decorations of their hou- 
fes, and in the number of apartments thought neceflary 
for the accommodation of a family, they are not the fame 
people they were 30 years ago. The prefent times are

town and country parifh. About 30 years ago, there wa» 
only one chaife, a four-wheeled one ; but at this time, 
there are 2 coaches, 12 four-wheeled chaifes, and 1 two- 
wheeled ; 6 of the four-wheeled chaifes are let for hire by 
innkeepers. The principal inns in town were indifferent 
till of late *, they are now commodious and comfortable, 
and, in attendance, entertainment and beds, emulate the 
beft inns in the fouthern parts of the kingdom. There 
are in the town fubicription afTemblies, and occafional 
balls and concerts of mufic. Companies of comedians 
find their way to Invernefs, and it is believed they have 
no caufe to difcontinue their vifits, nor is it improbable, 
that in a few years a theatre will be erected. In the town 
and country parifh, we have feveral convivial clubs. 
Their meetings are frequent and ftated ; but they are 
ftrangers to the coarfe excefs of former times, and its un- 
happy oonfequences. 

Antiquities. — There was founded at Invernefs, in the 
year 1233, by King Alexander II. a convent, not of Fran- 
cifcans or Gray Friars, as erroneoufly handed down by oral 
tradition, (Spottifwood) but of Dominicans or Black Friars, 
called alfo, Fratres prcedicatores, becaufe of their frequent 
preaching. They were a mendicant order, inftituted by St 
Dominic the projector of the Inquifition *. There were

upper plain of the parifh, feveral Druidical temples. At 
prefent there is only one temple entire. They were blaft- 
ed for the purpofe of building farm houfes and offices. 
Stones are fcarce, and at a great diftance, and the temples 
flood on cultivated and fertile fields. In this, (under the 
Druidical ceconomy,) facred portion of the parifh, there 
are feveral places in the parifh, called in Englifh, Drakies, 
as Eafter Drakies, Wefter Drakies, Mid Drakies, and in 
Gaelic, Dregge, both evidently corruptions of Druidhe, 
the plural of Drui, a Druid. Many places in Britain, 
France and Ireland, flill bear the name of the Druids, as 
Dreux in France, the place of their annual general aflem- 
bly. — There is, at fome diftance from the mouth of the 
river Nefs, a confiderable way within flood mark, a large 
cairn of ftones, the origin of which is of very remote an- 
tiquity. It is called Cairnairc, that is, the cairn of the fea. 
There is a beacon erected on Cairnairc, to apprize vefTels 
coming into the river, of danger from it. In the Beauly 
frith, due weft from this cairn, there are three cairns at 
confiderable diftances, one from the other-. The largeft is 
in the middle of the frith, a huge heap of ftones. This 
cairn is acceflible at low water. It appears to have been 
a burying place, by the urns which were difcovered in it. 

If

all the buildings, is the Abaft of one of the columns which fupported the 
roof of the chuich. The pedeftal, and it js believed, a great part of the 
fliaftare concealed with earth and rubbiih. The monaftery yard is become 
the glebe of one of the minifters, and the fite of the chnrch, a fmall bury- 
ing place. The chapel yard is the principal burying ground, an inclofure 
of about 6 acres. This fpaci#us yard, the old walls having failed in 
many places, was inclofed a few years ago with high walls coped with 
freeftones. The gate of the inclofure is liandfome. The old gate was 
arched, and the arch crowned with ornaments of the various kinds of ver- 
tical dials bore this infeription, ' Concordia parvas res crefcunt.'

If thefe calms are fepulchral monuments, as by the difco- 
very of urns they unqueftionably are, it feems difficult not 
to be convinced, that the fpace between the mouths of the 
Nefs and the Beauly, now covered by the Beauly frith, 
was dry land, and that the fea gained upon it, after thefe 
monuments were ereded * The Beauly frith is fix miles 
in length, and two in breadth. There was, a few years ago 
at Kilvean, a great number of fmall cairns overgrown with 
heath. They occupied about the fpace of an acre, on a 
pretty extenlive plain, and were inclofed by a ditch of an

rior work of the ramparts, which form a regular pentagon, 
furrounded on four fides by a ditch, and by the river on 
the fifth, and inclofing a fuperficies of precifely 4 acres. 
When the fea flows, the ditch is filled with water. The

feem to have been the burying places of the chiefs and heads of families, 
and the fmall cairns inclofed as above, the burying places of the common 
people. It appears, that the raifing of cairns for fepulchral mdnuments 
in honour of difhinguiflied perfonages did not ceafe with the practice 
of burning the dead in this country. There is a very large cairn near 
the river at the foot of a hill, called Torvean. It fome years ago was

1745, together with the contiguous barracks. Nothing 
now remains of either but rubhifh. This was an irregu- 
lar fortification, and confequently of little ftrength after the 
invention of gunpowder and ordnance. The caftle is fup- 
pofed to have been built by King Malcolm Canmore. The 
barracks, with flender ramparts, were erefted in the laft 
reisn. The Thane of Calder's caftle was built on the eaft- 
ern extremity of the hill. It Was razed to the ground by- 
Malcolm, in deteftation of the murderer of his father, and 
nnjuft pofieffor of his kingdom for feventeen years. There 
is not a veftige of this caftle to be feen, Seges y ubi T. oia

plough. The remembrance of the theatre of Macbeth's 
ambitious villany, however, is preferved in the old charter 
names of the lands which belonged to it. A family like- 
wife of considerable antiquity, the Cuthberts of Caftlehill, 
derive their defignation from the fite of Macbeth's caftle. 
Though this family is here only incidentally mentioned, 
there may perhaps be no great impropriety in remarking, 
that Colbert, the prime minifter of Lewis XIV. was a ca- 
det of it, that his illuftrious defcendents recognifed, and ftill 
recognife, their origin in the family, that fons of it ranked 
high in the church and armies of France, and that the bi-

fort, on the fummit of Craig-Phatric, near Invernefs, b a 
very remarkable ftrudure. It has attracted the notice of 
the antiquary. There are different opinions refpefting its 
origin. Some maintain, that the vitrification is the effeft 
of a volcano, others the work of art ; but Mr Frafer Tytler, 
who treated this-fubjecT: in the fecond volume of the Tran- 
fa&amp;ions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, endeavours to 
prove, that the vitrification is the remit merely of accident, 
the ruin of an ancient fort deftroyed by fire. Of old, ftruc- 
tures for habitation and defence, according to Mr Frafer Tyt- 
ler, were compofed of two parrallel rows of ftrong pallifa- 
does, at the diftance of fome feet from each other, clofely in- 
terwoven with boughs, and of earth, {tones of various fizes, 
boughs and trunks of trees filling the intermediate fpace. 
The R'iempiuta- hypothefis is ingenious. Some, however, 
by this hypothefis, may find it difficult to account for the 
prodigious mounds of vitrified matter on the eaft fide of 
the rock. An attentive examination of the vitrified work, 
is not favourable to the abettors of the volcanic hypothefis, 
who maintain, that the ramparts were built with lava, a

It is called in Englifli, Caftle Bathers, a corruption of the Gaelic name, 
Caiftal nan leoirach', that is the caftle of " the reclufe or retired," a 
monaftery in Gaelic is indifferently termed Manachinn, the refidence of 
the Monks, or Leoirnamanach, the retreat or retirement of the Monks. 
In Lochnefs at the north end of it, there is on a fmall ifland the ruin of 
an old building called Caftle Spiritin, evidently a corruption of Spairtin, 
that is "the water dafhed caftle," Spairt, fignifies a " dafti or fplafti of 
water," Spairtin, " dalhes of water." The proprietor fays, that about 
aoo years ago this caftle was the manfion-houfe of his family, and yet no 
account can be given of its origin, but from conjecture. According to- 
fome it was a royal Piclilh caftle, and the fcene of King Brudius's con- 
verfion to the Chriftian faith, Adamnan in his Hiftory of St Columba re- 
lating that this important event was accomplifhed by the faint in a royal 
feat near Invernefs. But according to others, this little caftle is of a far 
lefs ancient date. It was, they fay, an appendage of the fuperb feven

How ftrong and refpe&amp;able foever, the authority of this 
judgment may appear, it can have no force with thofe who 
have been upon the rock, and examined with attention the 
ramparts, which are compofed, not of individual blocks, 
but of continued, extenfive and unbroken maffes. The 
ramparts exhibit evident proofs of their having undergone 
the procefs of vitrification, on the very foundations which 
they at prefent occupy, and confequently are not volcanic 
productions *. 

* In many of the Pligland hills, there are great quantities of vitrified 
matter. It is feen collected into lmall heaps. There is in fome places 
only one heap, in others there are two, but not above three in any place 
together. This matter is in great abundance on the hills of Eyfick and 
Borlum belonging to the parilhes of Invernefs and Dores. Round each 
of the heaps there is a circle of grit, evidently fragments of the virtiried 
matter worn down by time and the weather. On this circle no plant is 
obferved to vegetate. A fmall tenant on the hill of Borlum upon his 
coming into his little uncultivated pofleffion, chofe a ipot for a garden on 
which there were two heaps of the vitrified matter, he removed them, 
but deemed his labour loft, for during a refidence of fe.veral jears, no 
plant would grow where they flood. Thefe vitrifications are curious. 
We unqueftionably are much in the dark refpecling the hiftory of the an- 
cient inhabitants of this country and their arts.— There is at the diftance 
of 2 miles fouth from Invernefs, not far from the military road, and on 
the weft fide of it, the ruin of a large ftruclure It was raifed on an 
eminence of about 30 feet above the furrounding plain. There are no 
traces of the form of this ftruclure. It was one of the many ancient 
buildings which according to fome were erected before the date or the 
knowledge of mortar and iron in this country, as no veftige of the ham- 
mer or of any kind of cement appears.' Hundreds of leads of the ftoncs 
of this ruin were lately carried to Invernefs.

~XT ENMORE Castle, the feat of the Honourable John 
Gordon of Kenmore, is beautifully and romantically 
fituated at the head of Loch Ken, half a mile fouth of the 
burgh of New Galloway. It ftands on a circular mount, 
partly natural, and partly artificial. It has been furround- 
ed by a foffe fupplied with water from the Ken, with 
which it has had a communication, but now dry and filled 
up with earth. When, or by whom this caftle was built, 
is uncertain. It is faid to have been the feat of the Gelaji 
Reguli, or rulers of Galloway y and afterward of John 
Baliol, lord of Galloway, and king of Scotland. It fuf- 
fered from the ravages of war, and was twice burnt down s 
firfl in the reign of the unfortunate Queen Mary, and again 
in the days of Cromwell. A great part of it has been

dince repaired, and is now fitted up in an elegant ftyle by 
the prefent proprietor ; and though the outworks are moft-. 
ly thrown down, and part of the walls ftand naked and un- 
roofed, it ftill retains much of its ancient grandeur, and 
will always be admired for the extent and ftrength of its 
building, and beauty of its fituation, which is allowed to be 
one of the fineft in the fouth of Scotland. Here is an ex- 
cellent library, confuting of feveral thoufand volumes, and 
which has been greatly augmented and enriched by Mr 
Gordon the prefent proprietor. 

The following tradition, omitted in my ftatiflical account 
of Kells, comes with fo many circumftances of probability, 
that I am convinced it muft have had fome foundation in 
fact. The fcene indeed is in the Kells, but the reft of the 
hiftory belongs to the parifh of MinnigafF, and will perhaps 
be mentioned in the ftatiftical account of that parifh. It is 
as follows : There is a large flat of mofs lying along the 
Dee, on the weft fide of this parifh, called Mofs Raplock., 
there a battle is faid to have been gained by Rohert Bruce, 
over the Englifh, who pofTeffed a ftrong fort at Craigoncal- 
zie, 2 miles weft of this mofs. This is confirmed by the 
following circumftances : Several pieces of fpears, and other 
warlike inftruments have been dug out of this mofs, and a 
large ftone ftands in the midft of it, called the King's Seal. 
And it is faid he had an eafy victory, owing to the follow- 
ing ftratagem : Three young men, the fons of a widow 
woman, by 3 different hufbands, who had been very active 
in the fervice of the king, collected a great number of 
goats and deer, and on the day of the battle drove them 
to the top of a high hill over-againft the Englifh army, 
who eiftaking them (with their branchy horns Handing 
up like fpears,) for another army coming to attack them, 
were intimidated, and fled with precipitation, and foon af- 
ter abandoned the ftrong fort of Craigoncalzie, where

grace took up. his residence, and where there is flill an old 
building called Brace's Walls. Soon after the battle, he 
vifited the mother of thefe young men who had done him 
fuch fignal fervice, and me requefted as a reward, all the 
lands lying between the bums of Penkill and Pilneur, an 
extent of country 10 miles long and 5 miles broad, lying 
mtheparim of Minnigaff, and which he readily granted 
them, and which' continued the property of men of the 
name of Murdoch, Mackie, and Maclurg, till within the 
memory of fome men ftill living. Their defendants are 
flill farmers in that neighbourhood, where they fay their 
anceftors have dwelt near 300 years. 

Some think this to be the battle mentioned by Buchan- 
an, as fought by king Robert Bruce near the river Cree, 
which he might eafily have miftaken for the Dee ; but 
this is the lefs probable, as there is the veftige of a battle 
fought near Machre mofs, on the fide of the river Cree, 
which is faid to have been gained by Robert Bruce over 
the Englifli, of which mention will probably be made in 
the ftatiftical account of Minnigaff. 

I alfo omitted in my account, to mention the veftiges of 
a wall or ftone dike running from S. to N. 10 miles through 
this parilh ; yet it is faid to begin at the fea, and to run N. 
through Girthon, Kells, and Carfphairn, into the mire of 
Ayr, upwards of 30 miles. This wall has no doubt been 
a limit between two chiefs, but who thefe chiefs were, or 
when this wall was built, which is now in ruins, tradition 
does not fay. 

Another fa£t come to my knowledge, is, that Mr Gor- 
don, tranflator of Tacitus, and author of the Independent 
Whig, &amp;c. was a cadet of the family of Kenmore, and 
born in this parilh of Kells, and not at Shermers in the pa- 
rilh of Balmaclellan, as mentioned by Mr Thomfon in his 
ftatiftical account of that parilh.

THE STORM, 

A Poem, by Dr Wilkie, Author of the Epigoniad, &amp;c. 
and compofed before he was io years old, while at the 
School of Dalmeny. 

What penetrating mind can rightly form 
A faint idea of a raging ftorm ? 
"Who can exprefs of elements the war ; 
And noify thunder roaring from afar ? 
This fubjecl: is iuperior to my fkill ; 
Yet I'll begin to lhow I want not will. 

A pitchy cloud difpkys itfelf on high ; 
And with its fable mantle veils the fky : 
Fraught with the magazine of heavert does throw 
Bolts barb'd with fire upon the world below. 
All nature ihak.es and the whole heavens fmoke ; 
Nor can the grofs black cloud fuitain the mock : 
But op'ning from its magazines doth roll, 
Thick fmoke and flames of fire from pole to pole. 
Thence hail, fnow, vapour, mixed with flames of fife'f 
With conjunct force againft the earth confpire. 
Monlters of lea and land, do loudly roar, 
And make the deep refound from fhore to fhofe. 
The fpumy waves come rolling from afar 
And with loud jars declare the wat'ry war. 
They upward mount and raife their crefts on high, 
And beat the middle regions of the Iky. 
Downwards they fall upon the fwelling deep, 
And tofs the rigging of fome low funk fhip : 
Upwards they tow'r and falling down again, 
They bury men and cargo in the main. 
The boiling deep doth from her low funk cell 
Throw out black wavts refembling thole of Hell. 
Th.-y forward roll and hideoufly do roar, 
And vent their rage againit the rocky fhore.
